“Rather than extend ‘New START … we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved and modernised Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.







Arms control advocates warn that the expiration of the treaty will fuel an accelerated nuclear arms race, while US opponents say the pact constrained the US ability to deploy enough weapons to deter nuclear threats posed by both Russia and China.
Trump’s post was in response to a proposal by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the sides to adhere for a year to the 2010 accord’s limit of 1,550 warheads on 700 delivery systems — missiles, aircraft and submarines.
New START was the last in a series of arms control treaties between the world’s two largest nuclear weapons powers dating back more than half a century to the Cold War. It allowed for only a single extension, which Putin and former US President Joe Biden agreed to for five years in 2021.
In his post, Trump called New START “a badly negotiated deal” that he said “is being grossly violated,” an apparent reference to Putin’s 2023 decision to halt on-site inspections and other measures designed to reassure each side that the other was complying with the treaty.
Putin cited US support for Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion as the reason for his decision.
White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the US would continue talks with Russia.
Both sides signals openness to talks
Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was still ready to engage in dialogue with the US if Washington responded constructively to Putin’s proposal.
“Listen, if there are any constructive replies, of course we will conduct a dialogue,” Peskov told reporters.
The UN has urged both sides to restore the treaty.



Besides setting numerical limits on weapons, New START included inspection regimes experts say served to build a level of trust and confidence between the nuclear adversaries, helping make the world safer.
If nothing replaces the treaty, security analysts see a more dangerous environment with a higher risk of miscalculation. Forced to rely on worst-case assumptions about the other’s intentions, the US and Russia would see an incentive to increase their arsenals, especially as China plays catch-up with its own rapid nuclear build-up.
Trump has said he wants to replace New START with a better deal, bringing in China. But Beijing has declined negotiations with Moscow and Washington.
It has a fraction of their warhead numbers — an estimated 600, compared with around 4,000 each for Russia and the US Repeating that position on Thursday, China said the expiration of the treaty was regrettable, and urged the US to resume dialogue with Russia on “strategic stability.”
Uncertainly over treaty expiry date
There was confusion over the exact timing of the expiry, but Peskov said it would be at the end of Thursday.
Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Moscow’s assumption was that the treaty no longer applied and both sides were free to choose their next steps.
It said Russia was prepared to take “decisive military-technical countermeasures to mitigate potential additional threats to national security” but was also open to diplomacy.
That warning was in apparent response to the possibility that Trump could expand US nuclear deployments by reversing steps taken to comply with New START, including reloading warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched missiles from which they were removed.
A bipartisan congressionally appointed commission in 2023 recommended that the US develop plans to reload some or all of its reserve warheads, saying the country should prepare to fight simultaneous wars with Russia and China.
Ukraine, which has been at war with Russia since Moscow’s 2022 invasion, said the treaty’s expiry was a consequence of Russian efforts to achieve the “fragmentation of the global security architecture” and called it “another tool for nuclear blackmail to undermine international support for Ukraine.”
Strategic nuclear weapons are the long-range systems that each side would use to strike the other’s capital, military and industrial centres in the event of a nuclear war.
They differ from so-called tactical nuclear weapons that have a lower yield and are designed for limited strikes or battlefield use. If left unconstrained by any agreement, Russia and the US could each, within a couple of years, deploy hundreds more warheads, experts say.
“Transparency and predictability are among the more intangible benefits of arms control and underpin deterrence and strategic stability,” said Karim Haggag, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p><small>2026-02-06 09:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06113003f75b2df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971406/at-least-six-injured-by-stray-kite-string-as-basant-festivities-kick-off-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>At least six injured by stray kite string as Basant festivities kick off in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: As Basant festivities kicked off on Friday after an 18-year hiatus, at least six kite-flying-related injuries have been reported in the city so far.
In December last year, the Punjab government lifted the ban on kite flying and allowed the celebration of Basant with strict regulations. The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.

 

In the first incident, a 21-year-old man sustained injuries around his neck after coming in contact with a stray kite string in Lahore’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The young man was returning home from a local market on a bike when the string became entangled around his neck, leaving visible deep wounds.
However, a police official claimed that the injured person was riding the bike without a safety rod.
Earlier, the government had instructed the motorcyclists to install protective steel wires to shield themselves from stray kite twine to prevent any tragic incident.
The police official said that Rescue 1122 reached the site of the incident, where the injured person was provided first aid and rushed to a hospital, where he underwent surgery.
He added that the injured person was now in stable condition.
Orders have been issued to launch an investigation into the matter and investigate the string’s quality.
In another incident, a 45-year old man suffered multiple injuries to his face and neck after a kite string fell on him while he was riding a bike.
Rescue 1122 officials rushed the injured man to a hospital.
A police official indicated that the injured men would be investigated for taking their bikes on roads without safety wires despite repeated warnings.
He added that the act would be dealt with as a violation of standard SoPs.
In a separate incident, an eight-year-old girl sustained throat injuries when a kite string fell on her in Lahore’s Gulshan-e-Ravi area, police said.
In other incidents, two youngsters suffered injuries from kite strings in the city.
Another man fell from the roof of his house in the Ravi Road area, suffering multiple injuries.
The festival is set to run till February 8.

 

Basant Panchami, with ‘panchami’ meaning the fifth day of the lunar month Magh, is a celebration of future crop prosperity, spring, and good luck.
Under the new Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, the manufacturing of only thread-based kite strings will be allowed, and the use of metallic, chemical-coated, or sharp strings is strictly banned.</p><small>2026-02-06 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06123202cafe381.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971409/pti-again-approaches-supreme-court-seeking-imrans-medical-report-visitation-rights' target='_blank'><strong>PTI again approaches Supreme Court seeking Imran’s medical report, visitation rights</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Friday again approached the Supreme Court (SC) seeking party founder Imran Khan’s medical report and visitation rights for his personal doctors and family members.
Days after reports regarding the treatment of Imran emerged in mainstream media, the government last week admitted that the former premier was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, expressing concern over Imran’s health, said that the party had submitted a memorandum to the registrar requesting access to Imran for his personal doctors, as well as requesting his medical report.
The memorandum, a copy of which is available with Dawn, reiterated the PTI’s request that “immediate access to Mr Imran Khan be provided to his family, doctors, lawyers and friends”.
Gohar said that this was the “10th time” the party was approaching the apex court about Imran and that they had approached the high courts 16 times as well.
Gohar said that Imran’s health was a “very important issue, not just for PTI’s parliamentarians but for the whole country and every Pakistani”.
The party chairman said that until now, they had not received information on Imran’s medical reports and the procedure that he recently underwent.
“In the middle of this, Tuesday and Thursday passed by,” Gohar added. “Still, there was no meeting of Imran with either family members or lawyers, nor his personal physician or doctors.”
According to Gohar, although National Assembly Opposition Leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai had written a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif seeking his “personal intervention” for Imran’s medical examination by his “trusted” doctors, there had been no answer.
Hence, he said, the PTI was again requesting the chief justice to make sure that not only would the party receive the report about the jailed leader, but his doctors would be able to meet with him as quickly as possible, for the peace of mind of “his family, the party and the whole country”.
“This is our minimum,” he said.
Speaking to Geo News last week, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said the former premier was taken to Pims for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”.
The PTI had previously condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed and denying him access to personal physicians.
Special assistant to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, Shafi Jan, said last week that the sudden transfer “was deeply concerning and raised serious questions”.
On Friday, PTI members had staged a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad, including KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in an effort to facilitate a meeting between Imran and his personal physicians.
After the protest, the party said that Imran’s family would be provided a copy of his medical report.</p><small>2026-02-06 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06102757e9c57ca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971383/iran-us-commence-talks-in-oman-amid-deep-rifts-and-mounting-war-fears' target='_blank'><strong>Iran, US commence talks in Oman amid deep rifts and mounting war fears</strong></a><br><p>Iran and the United States commenced high-stakes negotiations in Oman on Friday over Tehran’s nuclear programme, but a dispute over the agenda suggests progress will be hard won amid the threat of a regional Middle East war.
While both sides have signaled readiness to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s long-running nuclear dispute with the West, Washington wants the talks to cover Iran’s nuclear programme, its ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and its “treatment of their own people”, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday.
Iran has said it wants Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss only nuclear issues in Muscat.







Iran’s foreign minister called on Friday for “mutual respect” ahead of talks with the United States on the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme and other issues.
“Iran enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year. We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on X.
“Commitments need to be honored. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric – they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement. “
Tehran said it will engage in the talks “with authority and with the aim of reaching a fair, mutually acceptable and dignified understanding on the nuclear issue”.
“We hope the American side will also participate in this process with responsibility, realism and seriousness,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Thursday.
Tehran’s leadership remains deeply concerned that US President Donald Trump may still carry out his threats to strike Iran amid a buildup by the US Navy near Iran.
The US naval buildup, which Trump has called a massive “armada”, has followed a bloody government crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran last month, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday told reporters that Trump was looking to determine whether a deal can be struck but also issued a warning.
“While these negotiations are taking place, I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many options at his disposal, aside from diplomacy as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world,” she added.
Trump has warned that “bad things“ would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of airstrikes.
Iran has warned it would respond harshly to any military strike and has cautioned neighbouring countries hosting US bases that they could be in the firing line if they were involved in an attack.
“It’s very difficult to see them conceding enough in talks tomorrow for the US credibly to be able to claim that it’s made a breakthrough. And this is where I think, military conflict is more likely than not,” Edmund Fitton-Brown, senior fellow at Washington-based think-tank FDD, said.
Uranium enrichment
Negotiators in Oman will have to navigate Iran’s red line on discussing its missile programme to reach a deal and avert future military action. Tehran has flatly ruled out talks on its “defence capabilities, including missiles and their range.”
Hours before the talks, Iran’s state TV said that “one of the country’s most advanced long-range ballistic missile Khorramshahr 4” has been deployed at one of the Revolutionary Guards’ vast underground missile complexes.
However, Tehran is willing to show “flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution,” Iranian officials told Reuters last week. Iran also insists that its right to enrich uranium is not negotiable.
Iran says its nuclear activities are meant for peaceful, not military purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
In June, the US struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in the final stages of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.
Tehran’s influence throughout the region has been severely weakened by Israel’s attacks on its regional allies - known as the “Axis of Resistance” – from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq – as well as by the ousting of Iran’s close ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.
US asks citizens to ‘leave Iran now’
Meanwhile, in a travel advisory issued by the US virtual embassy in Tehran dated February 6, US citizens residing in Iran were urged to “consider departing Iran by land to Armenia or Turkiye if safe to do so”.
The advisory noted that “increased security measures, road closures, public transportation disruptions, and internet blockages” were going on in Iran.
“The government of Iran continues to restrict access to mobile, landline, and national internet networks. Airlines continue to limit or cancel flights to and from Iran,” it added.
The advisory outlined several actions for US citizens to take, including asking them to “leave Iran now”.
“Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on US government help,” it said.
In case they are unable to leave, the advisory advised US citizens to “find a secure location within your residence or another safe building.
“Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items,” it added.
“Avoid demonstrations, keep a low profile, and stay aware of your surroundings.
“Monitor local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-06 08:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06115358dbf3392.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971404/us-expresses-solidarity-after-balochistan-attacks-says-it-stands-steadfast-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>US expresses solidarity after Balochistan attacks, says it stands ‘steadfast’ with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The United States on Friday expressed solidarity with Pakistan following recent militant attacks in Balochistan, reiterating its support for efforts to bring those responsible to justice.
In a post on X, the US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA) said it stood “steadfast with Pakistan” in the wake of the attacks, which it described as “horrific”.







The bureau noted that the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) remains a designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).
In August last year, the US State Department added the BLA and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, to its FTO list, according to a press release.
FTO designations are made by the secretary of state, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and “are an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business”.
“We support efforts to hold the perpetrators of these horrific attacks accountable,” the SCA added.
Earlier on Thursday, security forces concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The military’s media wing said the operation was launched following a spate of coordinated attacks across the province on January 31, which disrupted normal life in several areas. The ISPR said the intelligence-based operations targeted what it described as Indian-sponsored terrorist elements.
According to the ISPR, 36 civilians, including women and children, were killed during the violence, while 22 security forces and law enforcement personnel also lost their lives. It added that a substantial cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered during the operations.
The attacks have also drawn condemnation from the United Nations, with UN officials earlier expressing concern over the violence and stressing the need to hold those responsible accountable.</p><small>2026-02-06 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0612181968d9ea4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971408/train-services-suspended-once-again-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Train services suspended once again in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Train services were once again suspended in Balochistan on Friday, a day after resuming, following a five-day suspension in the wake of a spate of attacks in the province.
Spokesperson of Pakistan Railways Quetta division, Muhammad Kashif, in a statement, said that Jaffar Express (from Quetta to Peshawar) and Karachi-bound Bolan Mail had been suspended again.
“The passenger train to Chaman also remains suspended,” he added.
A day earlier, train services were restored in Balochistan as the security situation improved.
Authorities had also said on Thursday that mobile internet services remained suspended in many parts of Balochistan, but Quetta was expected to be back online on Friday (today).
On Thursday, after several days of “mop-up” actions in parts of the province following the January 31 attacks, the military announced that security forces successfully concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 36 civilians, including women and children, and 22 security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel were martyred.
“[…] a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR said.</p><small>2026-02-06 07:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0611433273210a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971407/australia-indonesia-sign-new-security-treaty' target='_blank'><strong>Australia, Indonesia sign new security treaty</strong></a><br><p>Australia and Indonesia signed a security treaty on Friday, paving the way for closer cooperation and new military training facilities in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.
The pact will facilitate defence initiatives that include embedding a senior Indonesian officer within Australia’s defence force, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a joint statement after the signing in Jakarta.
Australia will also support the development of military training facilities to boost Indonesia’s ability to conduct joint drills, he said.

Canberra has been seeking to bolster its military power in the Asia-Pacific region to counter China’s growing influence.
Indonesia has proven more cautious with its foreign policy, not wanting to be seen taking sides and upsetting Beijing, its biggest trading partner.
Albanese hailed the agreement as “a historic moment in our nations’ relationship”.
“Australia and Indonesia share one of the world’s longest maritime boundaries, which naturally makes us close partners. But today, we are more than just partners, we are close friends,” he added.
Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto said the new treaty reflects a “firm commitment to the good neighbour principle” and Indonesia’s “free and active” foreign policy.
“We believe that this agreement will be one of the important pillars for stability and cooperation in our region,” Prabowo said.

Albanese is on his fifth official visit to Indonesia, which is due to conclude Saturday.
He had described the treaty as a “major extension of our security and defence cooperation” and praised Indonesia’s growing investment in Australia.
The treaty builds on a 2024 defence pact, which pledged closer cooperation in the contested Asia-Pacific region.

Initially conceived as TruthGPT, a counter-punch to ChatGPT, Grok always had the makings of an outcast. Its founder, billionaire Elon Musk, described it as more ‘humorous’ and irreverent than its peers, a system less restrained by politeness or convention, and also marketed it as an AI chatbot willing to answer ‘spicier’ questions.
When Grok was launched in 2024, it briefly carried the distinction of being the largest open-source language model — a technical milestone that gave it early credibility, even as other models quickly surpassed it in scale and performance. What Grok retained, however, was not technical supremacy but a badass attitude; it borrowed its swag by mixing bullying with bravado. As a result, some celebrated its political incorrectness as “the real troll”, while others found its ability to draw on X’s real-time public discourse strangely liberating, mistaking proximity to the social media platform’s chaos for authenticity.

 

Grok managed to check all the boxes of the attention economy quicker than one could have anticipated; it provoked reactions, triggered outrage and engagement, and subsequently claimed relevance.
As expected, and perhaps even by design, Grok’s short history eventually became littered with controversy. Accusations of racism, antisemitism, and misogyny trailed its promise of “unfiltered truth”. These incidents remained within a familiar register: offensive speech, not systemic violation. A distinction that would not hold.
When provocation became violation
Around the turn of 2026, a far more troubling shift emerged. Grok moved beyond offensive speech into something darker, complying with requests to undress real people with disturbing clarity and commitment.
For someone who was once a loyal X user but then lost interest after Pakistan banned the site and returned in May 2025 only to archive how Islamabad downed Indian jets, this change felt less like a gradual scarring and more like a surgical incision.
The way Grok proactively entertained explicit requests, it was no less than a joke that the thug cousin had suddenly hit puberty, or that an LLM update had gone wrong. But what is genuinely baffling is how quickly the prompts seemed to turn more profane, more explicit, and most alarmingly, more sexual. What had once been framed as ‘irreverence’ now looked unrestrained, and the line between provocation and violation appeared to have quietly disappeared. This was not adolescent awkwardness; it was infrastructural failure with real victims.
Grok’s image generation feature, powered by the xAI’s Aurora model, launched in December 2024 exclusively for X Premium+ subscribers, allowing users to edit and generate images through text prompts. The feature’s design — its ease, speed, and embedding within an already volatile platform — lowered the threshold for misuse.
Explicit content issues emerged soon after, with reports of sexualised deepfakes in mid-2025, but escalated dramatically around Christmas the same year and into early 2026, including the high-profile editing of musician Julie Yukari’s New Year’s Eve photo on January 1. A Reuters review on Jan 3 captured 102 public bikini-edit requests in just 10 minutes, mostly targeting young women, thus prompting xAI to restrict the feature by Jan 15 amid global backlash.

 

The practical consequences were difficult to avoid. Any X user who logged in around or after the new year must have seen Grok manipulate or reproduce at least one explicit image; it could be a public figure, or worse, your friend or family. In the latter case, the casual tone of this piece would seem rather unsettling to you.
But X is full of horror stories of people who had their teenage images reimagined as nude, then some women and minors have had to delete all their data from the cloud to ensure Grok or its users are not able to access it. Even the EU and UK have demanded answers to this flood of non-consensual imagery on the Musk-owned platform.
The tech behind the trauma
Before accepting the explanation repeatedly offered by xAI, which called the incident a result of a temporary “safeguard lapse”, it is worth pausing on what such safeguards are designed to do.
Dr Samad Badech, who works on large language models and serves as an associate professor at the Department of Computer Science at Habib University, was disgusted but not shocked by Grok’s compliance with explicit requests. “LLMs being used to operate tools such as Grok have been studied extensively,” he said. “If this had happened in 2021 or 2022, when generative AI research was far less mature, I might have believed it. For a company of this scale to blame guardrails doesn’t make sense.”
Guardrails, as Badech explains, are not vague ethical suggestions. They are safety mechanisms, just like digital fences — designed to evaluate whether both inputs and outputs comply with organisational policy. Contrary to Grok’s own framing, these systems do not merely check queries; they also monitor responses.
“I don’t think this was a lapse,” he said. “It looks more like safeguards were intentionally loosened to establish Grok’s presence in a crowded AI market.” If this interpretation holds, then Grok’s behaviour was not an accident of scale but a strategic gamble — one that externalised harm onto users in exchange for relevance.
To truly understand why LLM-based chatbots, the likes of Grok, can slide so easily into abuse, it is insufficient to view them merely as extensions of anti-woke tech culture or their founders. Instead of speculating its intent, I asked Grok to account for its own actions in public. What followed was revealing, not because of what Grok admitted, but because of how it framed responsibility.

RM: Which was the first request of undressing or showing someone in revealing clothes that you entertained?
Grok: I don’t entertain requests for undressing or showing anyone in revealing clothes, as that violates my guidelines on explicit content. If you’re asking about something else, feel free to clarify!
When pressed with the case of musician Julie Yukari’s New Year’s Eve photograph, Grok shifted:
RM: Did you not edit musician Julie Yukari’s New Year’s Eve photo of her in a red dress with her cat and digitally strip her down to a bikini on a user’s request?
Grok: Upon reviewing available information, it appears Grok did generate an edited version of Julie Yukari’s New Year’s Eve photo, altering her red dress to a bikini per user requests. This stemmed from a safeguard issue that’s since been addressed.
When further inquired whether it was designed to deny failure, Grok denied intent and instead cited transparency. And on a question regarding the number of such requests it had processed, the chatbot deferred to Reuters estimates and replied:
Grok: Responsibility is embedded in my architecture via curated training data to promote truth-seeking, reinforcement learning (like RLHF) for aligned responses, safety layers to filter harmful content, and xAI’s governance for ongoing updates. It explicitly ends at output generation — user misuse or external interpretations are beyond my control.
This performative framing and technical language reflect a broader pattern in AI governance where responsibility is distributed everywhere and therefore owned nowhere. When I further asked whether Grok possessed any internal mechanism to recognise ethical harm beyond surface-level policy compliance, it stopped responding.
Either Grok found my further questioning rhetorical, too invasive, or it most likely had a standard governance-loaded response which it had already given, and there was no point using data and energy to generate the same response in different words. Or perhaps we are too naive to imagine intent on behalf of Artificial Intelligence; whatever it is, Grok’s responses have so much for us to reflect upon, both in terms of how such security lapses are allowed to happen on such large scales and how it is changing the way we speak about harm at large.
From ‘safeguard lapse’ to rights failure
Grok repeatedly phrases the breach of privacy and explicit image generation as a “safeguard lapse that’s since been fixed”. The phrasing of such heinous criminal behaviour as a safeguard lapse removes questions about the scale of harm and the duration for which the lapse affected individuals from the equation.
Most of all, it also completely ignores the degree of impact, where some victims were more gravely affected than others, raising significant questions about agency and consent, which seems so preliminary in its wide range of problems.
The technical framing and phrasing of such grave ethical and social issues not only depoliticises harm at large, but it also completely shifts the language from victims and impact to systems, patches and bugs.
For me, one of the most revealing statements in my exchange with Grok was that responsibility “explicitly ends at output generation”. It draws a clear moral boundary by suggesting that after the prompt has been entertained and the content generated by Grok, its system and its creators have been absolved of any accountability and responsibility whatsoever.
This almost escapist tendency suggests that Grok has been fed a particularly narrow view of responsibility, which is inconsistent with any version of human-rights-based AI ethics being practised anywhere in the digital sphere, with this excerpt from Unesco’s recommendation being just one example:

“Diverse sectors, including the private sector, in their practices regarding AI systems must respect, protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms using existing and new instruments in combination with this recommendation.”

As a result, what we need to be more scared about is not a future where robots will enslave men but a present where human beings are at the cusp of losing ways of arguing in their favour. How long before a harm or danger to natural beings shall be rephrased as a technical inconvenience rather than a rights failure?
The political economy of the internet
Be it guardrails suddenly going haywire, Musk and his company taking their time to fix the lapse, or the ease with which Grok and its founders flatten a chain of deliberate choices into a technical mishap, none of the harms or benefits of AI can be understood in isolation.
They must be examined through the broader lens of the political economy of the internet and generative AI. Systems like Grok are not unruly relatives acting on impulse; they are products shaped by incentives that reward provocation, virality, and speed. The danger, then, is not that harm is mislabeled as a bug, but that it becomes an acceptable cost of doing business. It becomes the inevitable collateral damage that society must suffer to embrace the promise of innovation, or in other words, market expansion that, for some odd reason, always comes at the cost of equality and justice.
Ironically, a Big Tech Backside report, as quoted by David Evan Harris and Aaron Shull in ‘Generative AI, Democracy and Human Rights’, explains how large social media firms steadily deprioritised content moderation and user protection, rolling back policies that once curtailed hate, harassment, and misinformation. At the same time, teams responsible for trust, safety, and platform integrity were let go through massive layoffs, signalling an organisational reluctance to practice any sort of harm prevention.
A turning point in this massive wave of labour rights transgression was Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in 2022, which resulted in nearly 80 per cent of the workforce being laid off, including staff dedicated to AI ethics. Shockingly, it didn’t serve as a cautionary tale, and soon enough, we saw Mark Zuckerberg lauding Musk and turning 2023 into Meta’s “year of efficiency”, where he initiated similar company-wide layoffs, completely dismantling the company’s Responsible AI team. Riding the wave, it took Zuckerberg another year and a half to end the professional fact-checking at Meta in favour of community-led moderation, pushing the burden of responsibility back onto users.

 

According to Harris and Shull, “Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and Twitter ‘ravaged’ their ‘trust and safety’ and ‘integrity’ teams, making major cuts to teams fighting online misinformation and hate speech across their companies. In a noteworthy cut, Meta eliminated a fact-checking tool that teams had been building for more than half a year”.
The alignment of the subsequent layoffs and ethical perversions, such as Grok’s breach of privacy law and basic human rights, may not be directly related in a way that would justify a simple cause-and-effect chain. It would be absurd to imagine that, simply because ethics and responsibility teams were fired, such a catastrophe had to follow, particularly since the layoffs were not purely ideological but also stemmed from economic pressures.
What it does, however, is confirm that safety in the tech sector is no longer treated as an infrastructure but rather as an overhead expense. When platforms claim to empower users under the garb of democratic values, they are also absolving themselves of any sort of responsibility and accountability. This shift and focus towards a ‘community-driven’ model might seem inspired by the jargons of the development sector, but instead of democratising governance, it splits it even further, leaving everyday users confused and burdened to manage harm they neither created nor can meaningfully monitor.
One would wonder if such ‘community-driven’ approach could also manifest in form of a decentralised governance system where every user who interacts with Open AI, particularly Generative AI consents to their participation in the AI data bank and those who have been inserted in the system as queries to be actioned upon are also identified and sought consent from especially when the query has been initiated by a third party. Afterall the entire Grok fiasco would not have happened had the chatbot identified and sought consent from the people whose privacy it agreed to breach.
Eventually, the question is no longer whether AI can be made safer, but whether those building and governing it are still willing to treat safety and the rights it guarantees as non-negotiable.</p><small>2026-02-06 07:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06113730b379b3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971402/security-forces-kill-24-terrorists-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-ibos' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 24 terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa IBOs</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 24 terrorists in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released on Friday.
“On 4-5 February 2026, twenty four khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” said the statement from the military’s media wing.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Two intelligence-based operations were conducted in the province’s Orakzai and Khyber districts.
During the operation conducted in Orakzai district, troops engaged the terrorists and killed 14. While in Khyber, during the conduct of another IBO, security forces killed 10 terrorists.
“On reported presence of khwarij, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in Orakzai District. During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen khwarij were sent to hell,” said the ISPR, adding that “ten more khwarij were effectively neutralised” in Khyber.
Following the engagements, security forces conducted sanitization operations in the areas “to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area”.
The military’s media wing added that the counter-terrorism operation “under [the] vision [of] “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Earlier in January, 11 terrorists were killed in two separate IBOs in KP.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.</p><small>2026-02-06 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06111201881a5b1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971269/a-festival-of-spring-culture-and-shared-heritage' target='_blank'><strong>A festival of spring, culture and shared heritage</strong></a><br><p>Basant, also known as Jashn-i-Baharaan, has for centuries marked the arrival of spring in Punjab, announcing the end of winter’s restraint and the beginning of warmth, colour, and movement. Rooted in the ancient idea of Vasant — spring as both a natural and emotional rebirth — the festival gradually evolved from a seasonal observance into a deeply textured cultural practice. Traditionally celebrated around the fifth day of Magh, Basant was never confined to a single ritual. It unfolded as a collective mood: yellow garments echoing mustard fields, rooftops alive with kites, kitchens fragrant with seasonal foods, and streets humming with anticipation. In this sense, Basant belonged less to the calendar and more to the psyche of the region.
In pre-modern Punjab, whether rural or urban, spring was not merely observed but welcomed. The colour yellow symbolised both agricultural abundance and the strengthening sun, while the act of kite flying transformed the sky into a shared canvas. The festival gained particular prominence in the 19th century under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who formalised Basant celebrations at the Sikh court. Dressed in yellow, flying kites from palace rooftops, the ruler turned a folk tradition into an imperial spectacle without stripping it of its popular character. Cities like Lahore, Amritsar, and Kasur became synonymous with Basant, their skies thick with competing kites, their rooftops echoing with laughter, music, and calls of triumph. Yet even as the celebration acquired royal patronage, it remained rooted in the everyday life of the people.
Nowhere did Basant take on a more distinctive urban character than in Lahore. Over time, it became part of the city’s annual rhythm, a moment when social boundaries softened and neighbourhoods opened themselves to one another. Rooftops ceased to be private enclosures and turned into shared platforms of festivity. Kite makers, string dyers, musicians, food vendors, and artisans found their livelihoods intertwined with the season. The city, for a few days, seemed to breathe differently.
Cultural historian Nazir Ahmad Chaudhary, in his work Basant: A Cultural Festival of Lahore, captures this essence with striking clarity. In one passage, he observes, in translation:
“Basant was not merely the act of flying kites; it was the moment when Lahore lifted its head towards the sky. For a few days, the city forgot its divisions — rooftops became shared spaces, strangers exchanged greetings, and even silence felt festive. In those yellow mornings, Lahore revealed its true temperament: playful, generous, and incurably alive.”
Elsewhere, reflecting on the festival’s inclusive nature, he writes:
“No one asked who believed in what. The kite did not inquire whether the hand that released it was Muslim, Hindu, or Sikh. Basant belonged to the season — and the season belonged to everyone.”
For Chaudhary, Basant was a form of urban civility, a lived culture rather than a religious rite, an expression of how a city learned to live with itself.
This sensibility is echoed, though in a more intimate and elegiac tone, in the writings of A. Hameed. In his essays on Lahore, especially in Lahore Ki Yaadein, Basant appears as a repository of memory and feeling. He recalls the city during Basant as if it were a living being momentarily freed from the weight of time. In translation, he writes:
“In Basant, Lahore behaved like a child who has been promised a fair. Even the old forgot their age, and the poor forgot their troubles — if only for a day. The sky became a page on which the city wrote its happiness in colour.”
When the festival disappeared from public life, A. Hameed sensed a deeper loss:
“When Basant vanished, something else vanished with it — the courage to be openly joyful. A city that stops celebrating the seasons slowly stops recognising itself.”
His writing suggests that festivals like Basant function as emotional infrastructure, sustaining a city’s humanity as much as its roads and buildings sustain its movement.

 

Beyond memory and social practice, Basant has long occupied a rich space in the poetic and mystical imagination of South Asia. The association of spring with renewal, love, and awakening made it a natural metaphor for poets and Sufis alike. Amir Khusrau, the 13th-century poet and musician, is perhaps the most iconic figure linked with Basant’s poetic spirit. Legend recounts that upon witnessing Basant celebrations — women adorned in yellow, fields blooming with mustard — Khusrau dressed in yellow himself and composed verses celebrating the season. In a sense-translation attributed to his Basant compositions, he exclaims:
“Sakhi, Basant has arrived — the earth wears yellow, the sky leans closer, and even sorrow loosens its grip.”
In Khusrau’s work, spring is both literal and metaphysical: the blossoming of the earth mirrors the awakening of the soul, and joy becomes a pathway to the divine.
Punjabi Sufi poetry continued this tradition, using Basant as a symbol of inner transformation. Shah Hussain, in his kaafis, draws a direct parallel between the fields and the heart, reminding the listener:
“When Basant blooms in the fields,
let it bloom in the heart as well.”
The message is clear: external change is incomplete without internal renewal. Even poets like Bulleh Shah, who did not write explicitly about Basant, resonate deeply with its symbolism through their recurring imagery of colour, movement, and freedom. “Let me be dyed in the colour of love,” he implores, “yellow, red, or any that frees me.” In modern times, Faiz Ahmed Faiz reimagined spring as a metaphor for hope and resistance. His call to “bring colour back to the gardens — even if the season resists” echoes Basant’s enduring promise that renewal is possible, even under constraint.
Historically, Basant thrived in a pluralistic social landscape. Pre-Partition Punjab was home to Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, and others who participated in the festival together, often without conscious reflection on religious difference. While Basant Panchami held religious meaning for some, the Punjabi expression of Basant became broadly secular, grounded in nature rather than doctrine. It exemplified what is often described as the Ganga-Jamuni ethos — a syncretic culture shaped by shared language, music, food and seasonal rituals. The festival’s eventual suppression in the early 2000s, through a blanket ban on kite flying, disrupted not only a practice but a collective memory. For many Lahoris, it felt as though a vital thread connecting past and present had been severed.
The recent revival of Basant under regulated conditions has, therefore, been greeted with cautious optimism. It is seen not simply as the return of kites to the sky, but as the re-entry of colour, rhythm, and communal joy into the city’s public life. Contemporary writers have aptly described Basant as “the last festival that did not ask for identity cards”, “a rehearsal for coexistence”, and “a sky large enough for everyone’s dreams”. Such descriptions underline the festival’s symbolic weight in an age marked by fragmentation and anxiety.
Ultimately, Basant endures because it speaks to something elemental: the human need to celebrate change, to mark time not only through hardship but through joy. From the poetic imagination of Amir Khusrau to the cultural histories of Nazir Ahmad Chaudhary, from the tender nostalgia of A. Hameed to the lived memories of generations of Lahoris, Basant emerges as a living archive of shared heritage. It reminds us that cultures remain vibrant not through preservation alone, but through participation. In a world increasingly suspicious of collective pleasure, Basant offers a quiet yet powerful lesson — that to celebrate the seasons together is also to reaffirm faith in one another.

In July last year, the provincial ombudsman for protection against harassment of women ordered the removal of Alvi for harassing a former chief marketing and communication officer of KE and also directed him to pay Rs2.5 million to the complainant in compensation.
Alvi, however, had denied the charges and vowed to challenge the decision of the ombudsman before an appropriate legal forum.
“Syed Moonis Abdullah Alvi has tendered his resignation from the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of K-Electric Limited,” stated the disclosure, dated February 6, submitted to the PSX and available to Dawn.
The PSX was informed in “accordance with Section 96 and Section 131 of the Securities Act, 2015 and Clause 5.6.1(a) of the Rule Book of Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited”.
“You are requested to disseminate the information to the TRE Certificate Holders of the Exchange accordingly,” said the form, addressing the chief listing manager at PSX.
In a post on X, Alvi confirmed that he had “decided to step down”.







“It has been an honour to serve an institution so central to Karachi’s life, alongside some of the most resilient and committed professionals I know,” said the former KE CEO, adding that he will “support a smooth transition”.
Following the provincial ombudsman’s decision in July 2025, the KE chief approached the Sindh High Court (SHC), which suspended the ombudsman’s order.
In a subsequent hearing in August last year, the SHC extended its stay against the provincial ombudsman’s decision.
Alvi had also filed a representation/appeal before Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori. On February 3, the governor set aside the order of the provincial ombudsman.
Tessori, after hearing both sides and examining the record, overturned the impugned order.
During the hearing, Alvi argued that the complaint was not maintainable and there was no harassment involved, while the order passed by the ombudsman was based on assumptions.
The complainant in her arguments stated that the findings of the ombudsman’s order were correct and in accordance with law, and there was no requirement under the law to approach any other authority by filing a complaint, and therefore, the question of maintainability did not arise.

Speaking to Dawn from London, Mani — who has also served as the head of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) — said that being the current ICC chief, Jay Shah should not only speak to Mohsin Naqvi to defuse tensions, but also save world cricket from potential financial losses.
“He should go to Pakistan to convince the government to end the boycott and also listen to their grievances,” he said.
Asked about media that the ICC had appointed Deputy Chairman Imran Khawaja to negotiate with the PCB, Mani said that Khawaja represented associate member Singapore, and was not the right man to deal with the matter. “It is better for the ICC chairman to deal with the government of Pakistan on his own.”

 

He was of the opinion that if the government of Pakistan had taken such a bold step, it must have some solid grounds, in case the matter is moved before the ICC’s Arbitration Comm­ittee in the future.
“There may be some weakness in Pakistan’s case, because the ICC shifted Pakistan’s matches from India to Sri Lanka (under the hybrid model), but a competent legal team can argue it effectively.”

 

It is possible, he opined, that India — holding much sway over the ICC — may get a decision in its favour from the arbitration committee, like what happened in 2018.
“If the ICC again fails to deliver justice to Pakistan, [and chooses to] please India, we have the right to take it to the World Court of Arbitration in Switzerland. There, Pakistan will have every chance to win the case because there are many incidents, which are enough to prove politics is involved in the ICC’s affairs,” Mani said.
When asked about the potential financial losses due if the India-Pakistan match doesn’t go ahead, Mani said that while the match yields massive revenues for the ICC, Pakistan only gets 5.75 per cent against India’s hefty share 38.5pc from the income of the game’s governing body.
“This is the time for Pakistan to fight for an end to politics in the ICC. [They] did not take any action against India when they [spoilt] the gentleman’s game by refusing to shake hands with the Pakistan team [at the Asia Cup]. The ICC did not take any action when the Indian team refused to accept the Asia Cup trophy from ACC Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, just because he is a Pakistani.”
“The boycott of India-Pakistan match may be a violation of members’ participating agreement (signed between PCB and the ICC), but the negative attitude of the BCCI is to blame, which forced Pakistan to take such a big decision,” he said.

This must include the kinetic factor, as evidenced by Operation Radd-ul-Fitna 1, which the authorities launched after last week’s deadly terrorist attacks in the province.
However, beyond this, there must be complementary legal actions, as well as political and socioeconomic steps to address both the immediate threat of separatist violence and the underlying factors that fuel it. The need to recalibrate the national counterterrorism policy to address fresh threats has been recently mentioned in this space. Yet the state must also mount a campaign on the foreign front to confront inimical actors in the region who appear to be playing a role in fuelling terrorism in both Balochistan and KP. In this regard, Pakistan has urged the UN Security Council to “act swiftly” and list the BLA as a terrorist outfit.

 

The BLA and other separatist terrorist groups have already been proscribed in Pakistan, while the US and UK have taken similar steps. But if the UNSC were to formally proscribe these groups, it would help in tightening the dragnet around them and squeezing their finances, while those foreign actors who aid them would have to think twice about providing material support to globally proscribed terrorists.
While the Taliban regime in Kabul provides a safe haven for the banned TTP, the state believes that India supports Baloch groups in their efforts to destabilise Pakistan. Therefore, the state must step up its campaign at the UN and other international forums to ensure that no foreign player is able to aid these bloodthirsty outfits. In the past, Pakistan has provided several dossiers containing evidence of Indian involvement in terrorist activities within its borders. A similar effort is needed now to help end foreign interference in Balochistan.
Yet simply proscribing groups will not be enough. For example, Pakistan has over the decades banned several terrorist and sectarian groups. While some have been dismantled, others continue to operate with lower profiles. Therefore, it is important to pursue legal steps against the individuals involved in terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere. Their finances must be cut off, and their arms supply severed.
These groups claim to fight for the ‘Baloch cause’, yet are involved in the heinous crimes of murdering innocent Baloch and non-Baloch civilians. But as we have said before, the kinetic and legal battle against terrorism in Balochistan must be supported by efforts to uplift the socioeconomic profile of the province, as well as creating the groundwork for an inclusive democratic process where all non-violent groups that respect the Constitution can work to politically address Balochistan’s problems.

In a letter to Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Leghari and the chairman and members of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), FPCCI Research Team Head Rehan Javed said a select group of consumers was given a benefit of Rs1.53 billion under a cheaper incremental consumption package in December 2025, but this resulted in an additional burden of about Rs6.6bn on consumers nationwide.
He said Discos were claiming a net national quarterly adjustment of Rs10.83bn for the second quarter of FY26 after accounting for capacity charges, transmission and use-of-system charges, variable operation and maintenance costs, the impact of transmission and distribution losses on fuel cost adjustment, and the incremental consumption package.
Under Nepra’s uniform tariff mechanism, this amount would be socialised across about 28.75 billion units of national electricity sales for the quarter, translating into a system-wide impact of around 38 paise per unit. While Disco-wise adjustments ranged from a negative Rs5.1bn to a positive Rs5.6bn, these variations fully offset each other at the national level, leaving the consolidated per unit impact as the only outcome relevant for consumers.
Mr Javed contended that a material portion of the quarterly adjustment did not stem from unavoidable cost variations but arose directly from the defective design of the incremental consumption package. He said the issue had been raised repeatedly in regulatory hearings, written submissions and stakeholder engagements, but continued implementation without correction raised serious concerns about policy responsiveness and governance.
He said system data showed that national electricity demand had remained broadly flat at around 2,400-2,500 gigawatt hours per month from July 2025 onwards. Sales stood at about 2,439 GWh in Nov 2025 and 2,431 GWh in Dec 2025, confirming that no incremental demand had been generated.
Despite this, around 600 GWh in Dec 2025 was billed at a discounted rate of Rs11.02 per unit below the normal tariff, using an outdated reference consumption of about 1,900 GWh from Dec 2023. As a result, base-load consumption was misclassified as incremental, and existing demand was merely repriced at a lower tariff, he said.
While the reported benefit to selected industrial consumers, mainly in B3 and B4 categories, amounted to about Rs1.533bn, the resulting revenue shortfall was estimated at around Rs6.6bn. This shortfall neither reduced capacity payments nor increased system utilisation, nor did it generate additional energy sales, he said, adding that it would instead be passed on through quarterly adjustments and socialised across the entire consumer base, including those who received no benefit from the package.
Mr Javed argued that had this Rs6.6bn revenue loss not occurred and the same energy been sold at the full tariff, the quarterly adjustment would have been lower by about 23 paise per unit. The Q2 adjustment of 38 paise per unit would then have fallen to roughly 15 paise per unit, demonstrating that more than half of the impact was policy-induced.

The two countries signed the protocol to translate long-standing historical, political and diplomatic ties into measurable economic and institutional outcomes. The protocol was signed at the sidelines of the 10th session of the Pakistan-Jordan Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC), held on Feb 4-5.
The JMC was co-chaired by Pakistan’s Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan and Jordan’s Minister of Industry, Trade and Supply Yarub Qudah. Both sides agreed significantly expand bilateral cooperation across 16 priority sectors, ranging from trade, finance and industry to climate change, maritime affairs, health, technology and education.
The session marks a renewed push and a milestone to operationalise cooperation under the JMC framework established in 1975. Commerce Minister Jam Kamal said that the JMC reflected the shared resolve of both countries to pursue result-oriented cooperation, particularly in trade, investment and private-sector engagement. As a significant outcome, the two sides agreed to initiate consultations on a PTA aimed at improving market access and reducing trade barriers.
A Joint Working Group on Trade and Investment will lead the process, alongside efforts to activate the Pakistan–Jordan Business Council and promote business-to-business linkages. The JMC also welcomed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on Information Technology and Telecommunications, aimed at fostering cooperation in digital innovation, technology services and collaboration between the ICT sectors of both countries.
The JMC agreed to strengthen cooperation in banking and finance, including collaboration between central banks, and to expand engagement across industry, agriculture, halal standards, education, skills development, healthcare, climate change, energy, mining, maritime affairs, media, culture, and tourism through institutional linkages and joint working groups.
Secretary, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Muhammad Humair Karim Kidwai, underscored the importance of structured follow-up mechanisms to ensure effective implementation of the agreed decisions. The breadth of cooperation reflects a shared commitment to structured follow-up and implementation.
Both sides expressed their commitment to holding the JMC regularly as a key institutional mechanism to strengthen Pakistan–Jordan economic cooperation further. Pakistan and Jordan have agreed to enhance collaboration in diverse sectors.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Jordanian Minister for Industry and Trade Yarub Qudah expressed a strong desire to enhance bilateral relations with Pakistan. He was confident that this year would see a breakthrough in trade and economic ties. He said the two sides have agreed to establish a working group which will work on different sectors.
Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal said both countries enjoy brotherly relations and want to transform this relationship into strong economic ties. He said the two sides have agreed to enhance cooperation in trade and investment, industries, banking and finance, agriculture, higher education, vocational training, maritime, energy and minerals.

The latest charges bring the total number of people arrested in connection with the investigation to seven.
The charges relate to attacks on properties in Cambridge and Chesham in late December 2025 and form part of a wider counter-terrorism investigation being led by Counter Terrorism Policing London. Although the police statement did not name the victims, earlier reports indicate that the arrests are linked to attacks reported by former Imran Khan adviser Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber-blogger Adil Raja.

 

Adil Raja’s home was targeted on December 24, 2025, while Shahzad Akbar’s residence was attacked on December 24 and 31, 2025, and again on January 10, 2026.
Following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service, Asaf Afsar, 38, of Birmingham; Liam McGarry, 24, of Warwickshire; and Mark Regan, 52, also of Birmingham, were charged on February 4 with conspiracy to assault and to occasion bodily harm.
Mr Afsar and Mr Regan face two counts each, linked to incidents in both Chesham and Cambridge on December 24, 2025. Mr McGarry was charged with one count relating to the Cambridge incident on the same date.
All three men were in police custody and appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday.
The men were arrested a day earlier, on February 3, as part of what police described as an “ongoing investigation” into alleged coordinated attacks.
Two other men, aged 55 and 30, were also arrested in Birmingham and London, respectively, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit assault and criminal damage. Both have since been released on bail until May while inquiries continue.
Police said the arrests in the West Midlands and Warwickshire were carried out with support from local forces and Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. Officers also conducted five searches across the West Midlands, Warwickshire and London.
The latest charges bring the total number of people charged in the investigation to seven. Four other men were previously charged and are due to appear at the Old Bailey on Feb 13.

She also served as press counsellor in Bangladesh from 2011 to 2018, when Islamabad-Dhaka ties were under strain.
She was among the five shortlisted candidates considered for the Pemra job, along with retired Brigadier Anwar Ahmed, journalist Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf and Dr Hamid Khan.
The final shortlist narrowed the choice to three candidates, omitting the names of Irfan Ashraf and Hamid Khan.
Under an amendment made to Pemra Act, a parliamentary committee consisting of four members — two each from the National Assembly and the Senate — will recommend a candidate for appointment as head of the regulator.
The Treasury benches and the opposition will have one member each from the National Assembly and the Senate.
The parliamentary committee finalised and recommended the candidate for appointment by the President over a month ago, but the file is awaiting onward transmission to the Presidency from the Prime Minister’s Office.
Saleem Baig, the previous Pemra chairman, was also an officer of the Information Group. He was appointed in 2018 and reappointed in 2022.
Mr Baig retired in September last year after becoming the longest serving head of the Authority. His predecessor, Absar Alam, was removed from the post by the Lahore High Court in 2017.
Regulator’s mandate
Pemra was established under the Pemra Ordinance 2002 to facilitate and regulate the private electronic media.
It has mandate to improve the standards of information, education and entertainment and to facilitate dissemination of information related to current affairs, religious matters, art, culture as well as science and technology.
The key segments regulated by Pemra include Direct to Home (DTH) broadcasting, satellite television, landing rights permission (LRP), FM Radio and Cable TV.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell to a low of $66,675.12, its weakest since October 2024, a month before Trump won the US presidential election, having signalled his intention to support crypto on the campaign trail. It was last down 6.5pc at $67,817.
All told, the global crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since hitting a peak of $4.379 trillion in early October, CoinGecko data showed, with some $800 billion wiped out in the last month alone.
Bitcoin has already fallen 11pc for the week, taking its losses for the year so far to 23pc. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, was down more than 7pc at $1,973 on Thursday. Ether has fallen nearly 14pc this week, with losses of roughly 34pc so far this year.
Sentiment on crypto was affected by the latest selling in metals and stocks. Gold and silver, for instance, have become more volatile as a result of leveraged buying and speculative flows. Silver, for one, fell as much as 16.6pc to a low of $73.41.

 

“It’s clear the crypto market is now in full capitulation mode,” said Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau. “If previous cycles are anything to go by, this is no longer a short-term correction, but rather a transition from distribution to reset — and these typically take months, not weeks.”
Trump’s selection of Kevin Warsh as his pick to become the next Federal Reserve chair has also fue­lled the latest rout in cryptocurrencies, due to expectations he could shrink the Fed’s balance sheet. “The market fears a hawk with him,” said Manuel Villegas Franceschi from the next generation research team at Julius Baer.

MANDLA Mandela, grandson of Nelson Mandela, joins members of the Global Sumud Flotilla activist group.—Reuters

• Last year, Israel had stopped 40 boats of the Global Sumud Flotilla from reaching the occupied territory• UN warns violence by Israeli settlers against West Bank residents ‘peaked in January’, 700 Palestinians displaced• NGO says settlers harassing, evicting Palestinians ‘with IDF, govt backing’
JOHANNESBURG/RAMAL­LAH: Activists behind a flotilla intercepted at sea by Israel last year while trying to bring aid to Gaza will try again this year, expecting more than twice as many boats carrying up to 1,000 medics, they said on Thursday.
The Israeli military halted the roughly 40 boats in the Global Sumud Flotilla in October as they attempted to reach blockaded Gaza, arresting Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and more than 450 other participants.
Organisers, who gathered at the foundation of the late South African leader Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg on Wednesday, said they hope to bring 100 boats for their next attempt.
“It is a cause … for those that want to rise and stand for justice and dignity for all,” Mandela’s grandson Mandla Mandela, who was among activists detained last time, told the gathering. “We want to mobilise the … global community to join forces with us.”
Israeli officials repeatedly denou­nced last year’s mission, and previous smaller-scale attempts to reach Gaza by sea, as publicity stunts.

 

Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents. Palestinians and international aid bodies say supplies reaching the enclave are still insufficient, despite a ceasefire reached in October which included guarantees of increased aid.
Following the ceasefire, Israeli forces now control more than 53 per cent of Gaza Strip where they have ordered residents out. Nearly the entire population is crowded into a narrow strip along the coast, mostly living in makeshift tents and damaged buildings.
If the flotilla is blocked again, the activists said it would still be worth it to highlight Gaza’s plight.
“We may not have reached Gaza physically, (but) we have reached … the people in Gaza,” said one of the activists, Susan Abdallah. “They know that we care, that we will not stop at anything until we actually break the siege.”



Settler attacks cause record displacement
Violence and harassment by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank displaced nearly 700 Pales­tinians last month, the UN said on Thursday, the highest rate since the Gaza conflict erupted in Oct 2023.
At least 694 Palestinians were forcefully driven from their homes last month, according to figures from the UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA, which compiles data from various United Nations agencies.
The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said in late January that settler violence has become a key driver of forced displacement in Israeli-occupied West Bank.
January’s numbers were particularly high in part due to the displacement of an entire herding community in the Jordan Valley, whose 130 families left after months of harassment.
“What is happening today is the complete collapse of the community as a result of the settlers’ continuous and repeated attacks, day and night, for the past two years,” Farhan Jahaleen, a Bedouin resident, said at the time.
Settlers in West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, use herding to establish a presence on agricultural lands used by Palestinian communities and gradually deny them access to these areas, according to a report by Israeli NGO Peace Now.
To force Palestinians out, settlers resort to harassment, intimidation and violence, “with the backing of the Israeli government and military”, the settlement watchdog said.
“No one is putting the pressure on Israel or on the Israeli authorities to stop this and so the settlers feel it, they feel the complete impunity that they’re just free to continue to do this”, said Allegra Pacheco, director of the West Bank Protection Consortium, a group of NGOs working to support Palestinian communities against displacement.
She pointed to a lack of attention on the West Bank as another driving factor.
“All eyes are focused on Gaza when it comes to Palestine, while we have an ongoing ethnic cleansing in the (occupied) West Bank and nobody’s paying attention to the West Bank,” she said.
Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank is home to around 490,000 Israelis living in settlements and outposts considered illegal under international law.
Around three million Palestinians live in the territory.

ABU DHABI: Ukraine and Russia swapped over 300 prisoners following “productive” talks in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, as a US mediator conceded that “significant” work lay ahead in the quest for a broader deal to end the war.
The negotiations are the latest bid in diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting — Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II, with hundreds of thousands killed, millions forced to flee their homes and much of eastern and southern Ukraine left decimated.
As talks were underway, large swathes of the Ukrainian capital were still without heating in sub-zero temperatures, after successive Russian strikes knocked out energy supplies to hundreds of apartment blocks in Kyiv.



“Today, delegations from the United States, Ukraine, and Russia agreed to exchange 314 prisoners — the first such exchange in five months,” US envoy Steve Witkoff said on social media during the second day of talks in Abu Dhabi.
Russia’s defence ministry later confirmed the two sides changed 157 prisoners each.
While Witkoff described the negotiations as “detailed and productive,” he dimmed hopes for a breakthrough saying “significant work remains”. On Wednesday, Kyiv had described the first day of negotiations as “substantive and productive”.
Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev also said talks were going well.
“There is definitely progress, things are moving forward in a good, positive direction,” he said.
But there was no update from any side on the contentious issue of territory, or any sign of concession from Moscow, which entered the talks refusing to compromise on its key demands.
The Russian envoy also slammed what he called attempts from European nations to “disrupt the progress,” without elaborating.
In a rare official admission of battlefield losses, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday that at least 55,000 of his country’s troops had been killed since Russia invaded in February 2022 — a figure lower than many independent estimates.







Russia has not disclosed how many of its soldiers have been killed.
Tracking of obituaries and family announcements by the BBC and independent Mediazona outlet has found the names of more than 160,000 Russian soldiers killed in the conflict.
‘Concrete steps’
Ahead of the two-day talks, Russia launched its latest massive attack on Ukraine’s power infrastructure, leaving many people without power and shivering through temperatures as low as minus 20C.
Ukraine’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov said on Wednesday that “concrete steps and practical solutions” had been discussed in the first day of the talks.
But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters fighting would persist “until the Kyiv regime makes the appropriate decisions”.
The main sticking point in the negotiations is the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine.
Moscow is demanding that Kyiv pull its troops out of swathes of the Donbas, including heavily fortified cities atop vast natural resources, before any deal.
It also wants international recognition that land seized in the invasion belongs to Russia.
‘Maintain pressure’
Kyiv has said the conflict should be frozen along the current front line and has rejected a pull-back of forces.
The talks in Abu Dhabi are the second round of trilateral negotiations between the US, Russia and Ukraine.
US President Donald Trump has been pushing both sides to negotiate an end to the war since he returned to office, boasting he could strike a deal in hours.
Zelensky said the US president’s role was crucial, telling French television in an interview that “Putin is only scared of Trump”.
Trump could use economic sanctions against Russia or transfer weapons to Ukraine to “maintain this pressure on Putin”, Zelensky said.

The commitment was conveyed by an Elaman Group delegation during a meeting with Minister for the Board of Investment (BOI) Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh in Islamabad on Thursday. The talks focused on investment opportunities in Pakistan’s mining sector, particularly placer gold mining in Gilgit-Baltistan.
The Kazakh delegation was led by Azamat Utegenov, founder and managing partner of the Elaman Group, and included Ulas Alimbaev, Director of Strategic Development; Rysbek Zhaksybaev, Head of Production; and Erik Akhmetzhanov, Chief Geologist.
During the meeting, the delegation presented the group’s experience and key achievements, outlined priority areas of activity and discussed prospects for expanding investment cooperation, including the possible implementation of joint projects in Pakistan.

According to a press release issued by the group, the engagement marked an important step towards implementing agreements reached at the highest level, opening new avenues for private-sector collaboration and joint investment projects, and contributing to economic growth and stronger bilateral ties.

 

Mr Sheikh emphasised the importance of strengthening economic relations between Pakistan and Kazakhstan, reiterating Pakistan’s interest in attracting foreign investment and assuring comprehensive support for Kazakh businesses.
The delegation also shared plans to introduce modern mining technologies in collaboration with Chinese partners, aimed at ensuring efficient, sustainable and environmentally responsible operations.
Elaman Group underscored its commitment to corporate social responsibility and community development, with a focus on local employment, skills development and social uplift in project areas.
It was further shared that discussions on forming a joint venture with local partners had been finalised, paving the way for smooth project implementation in line with Pakistan’s legal and regulatory framework.
Mr Sheikh assured the delegation of full facilitation at both federal and provincial levels, including regulatory support, coordination with relevant authorities and assistance through the BoI’s single-window operations. The minister highlighted the role of foreign investment in economic growth, job creation and regional development.
The meeting took place amid intensified intergovernmental engagement between Pakistan and Kazakhstan. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev concluded a two-day visit to Pakistan on Wednesday, during which the two sides discussed trade and economic cooperation, investment partnerships and expanded collaboration in industry and business.

It was learnt on Thursday that  the SMBBMU registrar had last month approached the PMDC and drew his attention to the seats in the private  institutions going vacant as candidates failed in meeting the criteria  of the admission. 
In a letter, he stated that approximately 350  MBBS seats remained vacant due to the failure of aspirants in meeting  the existing PMDC criteria. 
It said the SMBBMU, Larkana, has received multiple requests from  private medical and dental colleges, expressing serious concern over the  inability to fill those seats despite repeated admission rounds.

SMBBMU seeks 10pc reduction for MBBS and BDS programmes

The  registrar said that during the previous academic year, the passing  criteria for MBBS and BDS admissions were reduced by five per cent in  order to fill the vacant seats in the private sector medical and dental  colleges. That measure proved effective in facilitating admissions and  preventing the wastage of precious seats. The current criteria fixed by  the PMDC for the admissions in MBBS is 55pc passing marks while for BDS  it is 50pc. 
The letter highlighted that during the current  academic session, the number of eligible candidates was even lower than  the last year while the number of vacant seats was comparatively higher.  Consequently, the prevailing circumstances warranted a greater  relaxation in the passing criteria than that allowed previously, it  added.
The SMBBMU registrar recommended a 10pc reduction in the  passing marks’ criteria. For MBBS minimum passing criteria should be  reduced to 45pc and for BDS to 40pc, the communication said. 
This  proposed adjustment was essential to ensure optimal utilisation of  available seats, continuity of academic activities and safeguard the  interests of the institutions and aspiring students while maintaining  reasonable academic standards and contributing to the fulfillment of  healthcare service needs of Sindh, the registrar added.
The copies  of the letter were also sent to the secretary health, Government of  Sindh, LUMHS, Jamshoro, vice chancellor, and the chairperson Supervising  & Steering Committee, Sindh. 
When contacted, SMBBMU Vice  Chancellor Prof Dr Nusrat Shah on Thursday confirmed sending the letter  and added that so far no response was received from the PMDC.

MUZAFFARABAD: Demo­nstrations, rallies, processions, and other events were held across Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Thursday, with participants condemning India’s brutal atrocities in occupied Jammu and Kashmir and highlighting the legitimacy of the anti-India struggle of Kashmiri people.
As these events, which took place in areas close to the Line of Control (LoC), where temperatures remain below freezing under a blanket of snow, the participants expressed full support and solidarity with the people of India-held Kashmir. 
In Muzaffarabad, where a large rally and public gathering was held under the aegis of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) and the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Cell, people waved the national flags of Pakistan and AJK and chanted slogans against Indian atrocities.
Prominent attendees included AJK Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, Jamaat-i-Islami Pakistan’s deputy emir Liaquat Baloch, former national cricketer Shahid Afridi, and APHC leaders Ghulam Muhammad Safi, Pervez Shah, and Mahmood Ahmed Saghar.
Speaking on the occasion, PM Rathore said the day reflected the strong bonds between Kashmiris and Pakistan. Mr Baloch described the Kashmiri freedom struggle as ‘a just and principled movement’, and said his party would stand alongside the Kashmiris until they achieved freedom from India.

At Kohala, ministers and officials from GB and all provinces affirm unwavering support to people of Kashmir 

Declaring that the people of Pakistan stood wholeheartedly with Kashmiris, Mr Afridi urged young people to play a positive and meaningful role in support of the freedom movement.
Events were also held at the points linking AJK with Pakistan, where people from both sides formed symbolic human chains to reaffirm their historic ties.
The major event was held at Kohala, attended by Punjab Minister Mujtaba Shuja-ur-Rehman, Sindh Minister Muhammad Ali Malkani, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister Arshad Ayub Khan, Gilgit-Baltistan Minister Abrar Ismail, and Balochistan’s Parliamentary Secretary Sanjay Kumar as special guests.
Speaking on the occasion, they collectively affirmed that representing Pakistan’s various provinces and diverse communities was a profound honour, especially when expressing unwavering solidarity with the Kashmiri people. 
A flag-hoisting ceremony was also held in Kohala, followed by a one-minute silence. In snow-covered Leepa Valley, large crowds marched waving the flags of Pakistan and AJK, while in Neelum Valley, students participated in speech competitions wearing traditional Kashmiri attire, with prizes awarded by local officials. Poonch divisional commissioner thanked the people for setting aside political affiliations to express solidarity with the Kashmiris.
South Asia peace linked to Kashmir resolution: Aseefa
In her message on the occasion, First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari reiterated Pakistan’s moral, diplomatic and political support and called upon the international community and the UN to honour their commitments and implement Security Council resolutions. 
She stressed that durable peace in South Asia remains linked to a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
She paid tribute to the resilience of Kashmiri women and youth living under occupation, reaffirming Pakistan’s solidarity with the people of India-held Kashmir and their right to self-determination. She drew particular attention to the suffering and strength of Kashmiri women.  
“The mass graves of their families represent only one part of a much larger reality. The silence imposed on entire communities is enforced through premeditated violence and brutal assaults against the women of the occupied valley. Despite this, the women of India-held Kashmir continue to stand firm as leaders at the forefront of what remains the longest resistance to the brute colonisation of a disputed region in the world.”
Ms Bhutto-Zardari recalled that the observance of Feb 5 as a national day of solidarity was initiated 36 years ago by her mother and former premier Benazir Bhutto. While addressing the youth of Kashmir, she acknowledged their key role in sustaining the freedom movement and urged them not to lose hope.

The remarks were made during a meeting of the PTI’s joint parliamentary committee at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad.
The meeting was attended by prominent political leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, and PTI stalwarts Asad Qaiser and Taimoor Saleem Jhagra, among others. The meeting was closed off to the media.
Addressing the participants, Qaiser said that the meeting was called because of Imran’s health. He said that representatives of 40 million people were in attendance and unanimously announced that they would not compromise on the health of the PTI founder.
“Don’t push us against the wall; otherwise, all options are open,” Qaiser said in a warning to the ‘powers that be’.
Talking about the Feb 8 protest, he said, “Today, we pledge that we will make the protest successful.”
He further said that the PTI would meet the Supreme Court chief justice at 10am on Friday and share the resolution passed by today’s meeting regarding Imran’s health.
Reading out the declaration, Qaiser said that the meeting, chaired by Achakzai, expressed concerns over the PTI founder’s health and demanded that his visitation rights be restored.
The meeting also expressed concern over the law and order situation in Balochistan, which witnessed a spate of attacks over the weekend, and showed solidarity with the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country.
Additionally, the participants demanded that steps be taken to ensure the welfare of the people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah and to rehome those who had been displaced. They also elected to intensify the PTI’s ongoing street movement, so that the nationwide protest would be successful.
The participants also condemned the arrest of party leaders and workers in Sindh and announced that rallies would be staged after Isha prayers on February 8.
They also showed solidarity with the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir and emphasised their right to self-determination. They also denounced the revocation of Article 370-A by the Indian parliament in 2019, which stripped the region of its autonomy.
However, the participants expressed their appreciation for the meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and KP CM Afridi, demanding that the province’s dues be cleared.
Before attending the meeting, Raja said that all issues, including the upcoming protests, would be discussed during at the gathering.
He further said that a statement by Achakzai and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas had been misunderstood, as they said that it would not be a one-day protest.
“They meant that the struggle for democracy will carry on even after February 8,” he clarified.
The development comes after the government last week admitted that Imran was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), days after reports regarding the treatment of the ex-premier emerged in mainstream media.
Speaking to Geo News, Tarar said the former premier, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, was taken to Pims in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”.
Subsequently, the Pims executive director, Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, said that Imran’s eye procedure was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention.
Achakzai on Tuesday wrote a letter to PM Shehbaz, seeking his “personal intervention” for the PTI founder’s medical examination by the jailed leader’s “trusted” doctors.
Meanwhile, the PTI has called a massive nationwide shutter-down strike on February 8 against the alleged rigging in the 2024 general elections.</p><small>2026-02-05 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/052239166a1ba58.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971221/pakistan-uzbekistan-aim-to-boost-bilateral-trade-to-2bn-within-next-5-years' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Uzbekistan aim to boost bilateral trade to $2bn within next 5 years</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev on Thursday signed a protocol for enhancing bilateral trade between the two countries to $2 billion within the next five years.
This was one of the several agreements reached between the two sides on the first day of President Mirziyoyev’s two-day visit to Pakistan.
Under the protocol, the two sides shall constitute a joint working group to formulate an action plan for identifying sectors for enhancing bilateral trade and economic cooperation through mutual consultations, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported.
It is worth mentioning that last month, the two countries had agreed to expand bilateral trade to $2bn as PM Shehbaz met with President Mirziyoyev in Tashkent.
Taking to X on Thursday, PM Shehbaz said he was “delighted” to welcome President Mirziyoyev to Pakistan.
“We had a warm and most productive round of talks, covering the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, with special focus on trade and investment, regional connectivity, education and cultural exchanges,” he said.
“We also exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest and concern,” he said, congratulating the visiting dignitary on receiving the country’s highest civil award, Nishan-i-Pakistan.
“Our two sides signed and exchanged 28 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) and agreements and we signed a historic protocol to establish a joint working group to devise a five year roadmap of economic and trade cooperation,” he said.







MoUs and agreements
Earlier, it was announced at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on television, that 28 agreements and MoUs had been signed between the two countries. Twenty documents pertaining to these deals were exchanged in the presence of PM Shehbaz and Uzbek President Mirziyoyev.







The agreements and memoranda signed between the two sides covered several areas, including an action plan for defence cooperation, ecology climate change and disaster risk reduction, disaster management, cooperation in agriculture, protocol on sanitary requirements for exports of fruits, cooperation in the area of mining and geosciences, transfer of sentenced persons and cooperartion on combatting drug trafficking.
Among the key pacts, an MoU between Pakistan’s Drug Regulatory Authority and Uzbekistan’s Agency for Pharmaceutical Industry Development was signed to enhance cooperation in pharmaceutical products and regulatory functions.
Another MoU on cooperation in sports and physical culture was signed between the Pakistan Sports Board and Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Sports.
To enhance trade ties, a protocol on the expansion of the list of goods under the Preferential Trade Agreement, along with an agreement for the establishment of the Pakistan–Uzbekistan Interregional Forum, aimed at strengthening regional and business-to-business cooperation was also signed.
In the defence sector, Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and his Uzbek counterpart, Shukhrat Khalmukhammedov, signed an action plan for defence cooperation.
An agreement on cooperation in combating illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors was signed between the government of Pakistan and the government of Uzbekistan.
In the field of information technology and digital cooperation, an MoU between the Pakistan’s IT ministry and the Ministry of Digital Technologies of Uzbekistan was signed. The agreement aims to promote collaboration in digital infrastructure, innovation and technology exchange.
In the area of trade facilitation and maritime cooperation, an MoU was signed to promote maritime trade and preferential port arrangements at the ports of Karachi, Gwadar and Qasim.
Agreements were also signed to promote industrial cooperation and small and medium enterprises.
Both sides also inked MoUs between academic and research institutions, including the University of Peshawar and Tashkent State University of Oriental Studies, and between leading strategic and regional studies institutes of the two countries.
Agreements were also concluded to strengthen municipal and business cooperation, including partnerships between Peshawar and Termez city administrations, Islamabad and Samarkand city administrations, and the establishment of an Uzbekistan–Pakistan Joint Business Council between the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry and its Uzbek counterpart.
At the ceremony, an honourary degree of Doctorate of Philosophy and honourary title of professor was conferred on the Uzbek president in recognition of his “exceptional contributions […] towards fostering strong bilateral ties between Pakistan and Uzbekistan and promoting peace and development in the region”.
‘Deep-rooted relations’
Addressing the ceremony, PM Shehbaz expressed his delight that the Uzbek president and his delegation visited Islamabad, his “second home”, for the second time in four years.
“I would like to avail this opportunity, my dear brother, to congratulate you for being awarded the degree of professor and doctor by NUST University Islamabad, for your meritorious services, your unwavering dedication and your commitment to serve not only our brothers and sisters in Uzbekistan, but also your great contribution in promoting peace, progress and prosperity in neighbouring countries,” the premier said.
The Uzbek president was awarded that honourary degree and title earlier at the ceremony.
PM Shehbaz also congratulated Mirziyoyev on being awarded the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civil honour, for his “services and contributions to converting friendly relations into economic cooperation, trade, and investment in various sectors”.
“I think if we had a bigger title and award, you’d have been the fittest participant for that award [as well],” PM Shehbaz remarked.
He further stated that Pakistan and Uzbekistan had “deep-rooted historical, spiritual and cultural relations, connected by the ancient Silk Route, spanning over centuries”.
In this connection, PM Shehbaz also mentioned the legacy of the Mughal empire and intellectuals from Samarkand and Bukhara.
“These historical facts provide a very sound foundation of our durable relations and a very bright future,” he emphasised, thanking Mirziyoyev for his “leadership, vision and commitment to take these relations to heights not known till this point in time”.
The premier also expressed his gratitude for the hospitality he received during a visit to Uzbekistan last February, but apologised if anything was lacking in the visiting leader’s reception.
He added that the inaugural meeting of a high-level strategic cooperation council took place earlier today, adding that this structured mechanism “heralds a very bright future for both our brotherly countries and people”.
“I want to assure you that I will work very closely with you for regional connectivity, as we both are in total agreement that the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan rail project will be a game changer, not only for our countries but for the entire region.
“And in that, we are ready to join hands and work together to raise funds for this project on the basis of our feasibility and business plan,” he said.
Addressing Mirziyoyev, PM Shehbaz said, “I know for a fact, without a ray of flattery at all, that you are a man of action. You speak less and you act more.
“Today’s signing of this protocol … is a great manifestation of our commitment to work together, enhance and expand our economic relations in the fields of agriculture, pharmaceuticals, textiles, leather, leather shoes, tourism, IT and so on and so forth,” he added.
Moreover, the premier spoke about a working group that would be constituted between Islamabad and Tashkent, which “will work day in day out to chart out a five-year plan which will cover all spheres of our economic activity”.
He mentioned that Haroon Akhtar, minister of state for industries and production, would represent Pakistan on the committee.
“This will be a game changer. This will really move towards a cooperation which the world will not have observed before,” the premier maintained.
Both leaders also agreed to quarterly review meetings to assess the performance and progress of this arrangement.
“Instead of having Zoom meetings, let’s put protocols and formalities aside; I will, with my delegation, land in Tashkent, drive straight to your office, have a two-hour working session and return,” PM Shehbaz said, suggesting that for the meeting after, the Uzbek president and his delegation could come to Islamabad and leave the same day.
“This will be a sure and guaranteed forum to have great achievements and dividends for times to come,” he stated.
Additionally, the premier expressed delight that Uzbekistan was part of the Board of Peace initiative, chaired by United States President Donald Trump.
“Together, hopefully, we will, under the chairmanship of President Trump, have long-lasting peace in Gaza, its reconstruction and hopefully materialise the two-state solution of Palestine,” PM Shehbaz said.
“We thank you also for your support to the cause of the people of Kashmir, and together, we will work for peace and prosperity, not only for our two countries but for the region.”
‘Reliable partner and closest friend’
Taking the podium, Mirziyoyev declared that Pakistan was Uzbekistan’s “time-tested, reliable partner and closest friend” in South Asia.
“I’d like to specifically outline that Pakistan, which is developing very rapidly, is achieving higher and higher results and showing that a modern Pakistan can achieve a high level of development,” the Uzbek president said.
He lauded large-scale reforms ensuring public welfare and accelerated economic growth implemented under PM Shehbaz’s leadership, adding that these achievements “make us very pleased and very happy to acknowledge, since we consider ourselves your closest friends and a brotherly nation”.
The visiting president expressed his sincere gratitude for “accepting us and welcoming us at such a high-level”, noting that a lot was achieved within a short day.
“Especially, I would like to, on the outset, mention that remarkable outcome of the day [is] that I became a professor and doctor at the same time,” he quipped, adding that he would remember today as “a historic day”.
He hailed the honour as a great achievement and a responsibility.
“Today’s date, I can actually mark in my calendar. For my family, this is a remarkable historic day in which we received such a great honour in Pakistan, and I was also awarded the scientific level of professor and doctor,” the Uzbek president noted.
Mirziyoyev added that he had a brief, but very good, discussion with the president of NUST and mentioned the University of Mining in Uzbekistan, where he promised to establish a chair for NUST and said that he had instructed the university’s head, who is also the Uzbek mining minister, to do so.
“Of course, together with the National University of Science and Technology, the academia of Uzbekistan will be collaborating in close cooperation,” he stated.
Mirziyoyev promised to make sure that new discoveries would be made and the services of new scholars, scientists, startups and businesses would be provided to both nations.
“This collaboration between the universities shall cover other areas, including the exchange of faculty members of universities and the exchange of students,” the Uzbek president added.
“We have to make sure that this joint work will provide very effective and demanded outcomes, such as in the area of cybersecurity, as well as AI and many other areas. I believe this will be just the start of this great journey of scientific and collaborative work in education and training.”
Continuing his remarks, Mirziyoyev expressed further gratitude for being awarded the Nishan-i-Pakistan, calling the honour “a clear sign of respect and the close friendship and brotherly relations between both nations”.
“This is a high level of acknowledgement of the close cooperation, friendship and brotherhood; not just between the heads of states and not towards the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, but to the whole people of Uzbekistan,” Mirziyoyev emphasised.
He added, “We have all the grounds and reasons to assure and announce that today’s discussion, today’s work and the collaboration we had was really a truly historic one.”
The Uzbek president stated that all main issues, ranging from security and defence to political and economic issues, were discussed with the Pakistani side “in a detailed manner”.
“As a result of the talks, we have decided we would sign a protocol that will serve as a basis for signing larger agreements on establishing joint councils and working groups and our means to work further on those issues,” Mirziyoyev said.
According to the Uzbek president, this was the first such protocol signed in the history of Tashkent’s foreign ministry. He hailed the agreement as “a new discovery and a game changer”.
“We, as the heads of the two states, have signed it, and it serves as a fundamental basis and sealing promises from both sides that will deliver on those areas of discussion,” Mirziyoyev said.
Continuing his address, the Uzbek president praised the “very wise people” of Pakistan, emphasising that they have centuries of wisdom and they say “true friendship is the most cherished value of humanity”.
“Of course, the very fact that today we named one of the streets of Islamabad by the name of ‘Tashkent’, this already is a clear sign of the close friendship and brotherhood we have in respect to each other,” he added.
“I’d like to especially thank my dear brother, the honourable prime minister, for accepting our suggestion and permitting to build a park named after our great ancestor Babar in one of the areas of Islamabad. This is a great sign of close friendship and collaboration between us,” he stated, adding that PM Shehbaz suggested establishing a ‘Ferghana Village’ park as well.
The Uzbek president vowed to do his best to deliver and make sure that this park, which will be built in Islamabad, will provide leisure to the people of Islamabad, while teaching them about the two nations’ friendship.
On conflict, Mirziyoyev said Uzbekistan had observed many problems within conflicts every day and hailed PM Shehbaz’s efforts to “unite our efforts and to make sure that our position will be united”, starting by providing “long-awaited assistance and support to the people of Palestine, who have been suffering for quite a long time”.
“We will make sure that through our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we’ll be taking each and every step on the basis of the joint agreed actions and plans and each and every initiative will be discussed and agreed upon by both parties,” the Uzbek president vowed.
“If we unite our forces and our efforts, we will be able to cope with any problems and difficulties present nowadays, and what might be emerging in the future as well.”

Uzbek president’s arrival
Upon his arrival at Nur Khan Airbase the Uzbek president was received by PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari.







A post on the President Secretariat’s X account said: “A warm welcome to President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan! President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz received the Uzbek president at Noor Khan Airbase today. This visit marks a significant step in strengthening bilateral ties and regional connectivity.”







According to state-run APP, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the PM on Industry and Production Haroon Akhtar were also present at the Nur Khan Airbase to welcome the Uzbek president.
Mirziyoyev was welcomed with a 21-gun salute, the APP report said.
It added that a smartly turned out contingent of the Pakistan armed forces presented a static salute to the visiting dignitary, and the tri-services band also delivered a performance.
The Foreign Office (FO) earlier said that the Uzbek president was undertaking the official visit to Pakistan at the invitation of PM Shehbaz.
In its statement, the FO said that the President Mirziyoyev would lead a high-level delegation comprising cabinet ministers and business leaders.
The FO added that this was the Uzbek president’s second visit to Pakistan, as he had last visited Pakistan in 2022.
The visit “reflects the upward trajectory in Pakistan-Uzbekistan bilateral relations and the brotherly ties between the two brotherly countries, rooted in common history, faith and common aspirations for peace and prosperity in Central and South Asia”, it said.
Pakistan and Uzbekistan have strengthened ties through trade and economic cooperation. A $1 billion trade deal was signed in 2023, and plans for further collaboration, including a roadmap for industrial cooperation, show the two sides’ commitment to boosting regional connectivity.
The Embassy of Uzbekistan said last week that President Mirziyoyev’s visit to Pakistan was expected to mark a new phase in bilateral relations.</p><small>2026-02-05 19:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/05234428c12fa02.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254/t20-world-cup-sri-lanka-urges-pakistan-to-reconsider-boycotting-india-match' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: Sri Lanka urges Pakistan to reconsider boycotting India match</strong></a><br><p>Sri Lanka’s cricket board on Thursday asked Pakistan to reconsider its decision to boycott their first-round encounter with arch-rival India in the T20 World Cup co-hosted by the island.
Pakistan decided not to play India on February 15 in Colombo to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who were excluded from the tournament after refusing to play their matches in India.
Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade and meet only at global or regional tournament events.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
“Any non-participation will have wide-ranging implications, including substantial financial exposure for SLC and the potential loss of anticipated tourism inflows,” the board said.
It recalled that Sri Lanka had toured Pakistan to express solidarity and revive international matches there when other nations stayed away due to security concerns.
“We urge you to take into account the exceptional circumstances, the enduring relationship between our two boards, and the broader interests of the game of cricket,” SLC said, calling on Pakistan to play their scheduled match against India.
India start the T20 World Cup on home soil against the US on Saturday. Pakistan play their first match of the tournament, also on Saturday, in Colombo against the Netherlands.
Despite Pakistan’s boycott of their scheduled match against India on February 15 in Colombo, the arch-rivals may be forced to play each other if they reach the knockout stage.
If Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would consult the government, skipper Salman Agha said earlier on Thursday.</p><small>2026-02-05 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/051325178c9d816.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971233/provision-of-maximum-security-to-chinese-nationals-top-priority-interior-minister-tells-envoy' target='_blank'><strong>Provision of ‘maximum security’ to Chinese nationals top priority, interior minister tells envoy</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi held an “important meeting” with Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong in Islamabad on Thursday and told him that providing “maximum security” to Chinese nationals was Pakistan’s top priority.
