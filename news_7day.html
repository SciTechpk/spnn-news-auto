US President Donald Trump “believes firmly we cannot have a nuclear-armed Iran,” Wright told reporters in Paris on the sidelines of meetings of the International Energy Agency.
“They’ve been very clear about what they would do with nuclear weapons. It’s entirely unacceptable,” Wright said.
“So one way or the other, we are going to end, deter Iran’s march towards a nuclear weapon,” he added.
US and Iranian officials held talks in Geneva on Tuesday aimed at averting the possibility of US military intervention to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme.
Iran said following the talks that they had agreed on “guiding principles” for a deal to avoid conflict.
US Vice President JD Vance, however, said Tehran had not yet acknowledged all of Washington’s red lines.</p><small>2026-02-18 11:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18163117ed6a535.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974141/govt-says-no-power-or-gas-loadshedding-during-sehr-iftar' target='_blank'><strong>Govt says no power or gas loadshedding during Sehr, Iftar</strong></a><br><p>The power and petroleum ministers on Wednesday assured the nation that there would be no electricity and gas loadshedding during Sehr and Iftar during the month of Ramazan.
Addressing a joint press conference alongside Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik, Power Minister Awais Leghari said, “We have decided that there will be absolutely no loadshedding in any area — unless there is a huge fault God forbid — during the timings of Sehr and Iftar.
“Even economic loadshedding in areas with high-loss feeders will be restricted at the time of Sehr and Iftar,” he said.
Leghari noted that it was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s wish that those fasting were provided with utility services in a proper and timely manner so they “do not face any issues”.
Meanwhile, Malik stated that “complete arrangements” had been made to ensure the supply of gas “with maximum pressure from 3am to 10:30pm, especially during Sehr and Iftar”.
Leghari affirmed that it would be ensured that “there is no suspension of electricity during these timings across Pakistan”.
He highlighted that a special control room has been established at the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) to monitor all feeders and ensure the same.
“You have the 118 helpline; please file a complaint on it if you face any kind of issues. It will be addressed immediately,” the power minister said.
In his remarks, Malik said the decision regarding no gas loadshedding was taken after consultations with the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), so that the public could be provided with “as many facilities as possible”.
For gas-related issues, consumers can lodge a complaint on 119, the petroleum minister stated, adding that situation rooms have been established in the SNGPL and SSGC head offices.
Malik contended that the gas supply in the winter this year was comparatively better than in previous winters.

Rahman was sworn into office on Tuesday after a landslide election victory, taking over from the interim administration that had led the country of 170 million people since a deadly 2024 uprising that toppled the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina.
The 50-member cabinet announced in a gazette notification issued late Tuesday includes Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, 76, a businessman and veteran lawmaker who has now returned to the finance ministry.
Chowdhury is tasked with reviving growth after months of turmoil that rattled investor confidence in the world’s second-largest garment exporter.

 

He had previously served in the cabinet of Rahman’s late mother, three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia, but was forced to resign in 2004.
According to media reports, his resignation came after he had granted permission for Taiwan to open a commercial office in Dhaka.
Chowdhury has not spoken publicly about the issue.
He was also arrested several times during Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule, as her government regularly targeted opposition leaders in cases often decried as politically motivated.
Rahman, 60, has appointed himself defence minister, as his government faces a daunting list of challenges, including improving security and healing rifts in a country polarised by years of bitter rivalry.
Bangladesh is squeezed between India — where border tensions are high — and Myanmar, where clashes have spilled over into frontier areas.

 

Bangladesh is home to more than a million Rohingya refugees who have fled Myanmar.
Khalilur Rahman is the foreign minister, an experienced diplomat and former UN official who holds degrees from universities in Dhaka and the United States.
Khalilur Rahman held the security portfolio in the caretaker government and helped mediate trade talks with the United States.
He faces the tricky task of balancing regional relations after ties with neighbour India soured during the interim government, and Dhaka deepened engagement with New Delhi’s arch-enemy Pakistan.
In separate posts on X, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar conveyed his “heartiest congratulations” to Khalilur Rahman and State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shama Obaed Islam on their appointments.
“I am confident that his vast diplomatic experience and commitment to regional peace, stability and connectivity will greatly benefit the people of Bangladesh, the region, and beyond,” Dar said about his counterpart.
“I look forward to working closely with him to further deepen the brotherly ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh, and to advance mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral cooperation.”







For the state minister, Dar expressed his wish to work closely with her to further strengthen Pakistan-Bangladesh relations and to advance “regional peace, stability, and mutually beneficial cooperation in areas of shared interest”.







India’s Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar congratulated his counterpart, saying in a statement that they would work together to “advance our cooperation”.







PM Rahman was expected to chair his first cabinet meeting later on Wednesday.
Other members of the cabinet include veteran politicians, former ministers and lawmakers, as well as academics and several party workers.</p><small>2026-02-18 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/181334036425f4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974086/ttap-calls-off-parliament-house-sit-in-but-insists-on-personal-physicians-access-to-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP calls off Parliament House sit-in but insists on personal physicians’ access to Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) announced on Wednesday it would end its days-long sit-in at Parliament House over ex-premier Imran Khan’s health concerns.
However, it reiterated the demand being voiced by Imran’s family to grant the PTI founder access to his personal physicians and allow jail meetings with his relatives.
Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas — flanked by National Assembly counterpart Mehmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja — addressed the media in Islamabad after a Supreme Court hearing concerning Imran’s cases.
“Thanks to God, there is a minor improvement compared to the situation before, when the vision had gone completely — just a little bit,” Abbas told reporters.
However, he criticised the government for “not taking on board” Imran’s family or personal doctors. The senator reiterated that Imran’s longtime physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, should be allowed to examine the PTI founder.
Stressing that the opposition members would be glad to know about even the slightest improvement in Imran’s condition, Abbas said, “Therefore, as the month of Ramazan is also beginning, we will end our sit-in that we were staging in the parliament.
“And in the next stage, we can take different measures as TTAP and we will do so as we have time,” he added.



“If our rulers want to solve this issue, which has been raised across the world and the world has voiced concerns, then witnessing [is necessary],” Abbas said, calling for Imran’s personal physicians to be granted access to Imran.
“When Imran Khan sahib has said he has concerns, then it means there are concerns,” the Senate opposition leader emphasised, calling for the ex-premier’s jail meetings with his sisters.
“Whatever their demands are, which will satisfy them, should be taken,” he said, calling on the public to pray for Imran’s prompt recovery.
Abbas also termed the demand by Imran’s family to have him treated at Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital as “genuine”, noting that there were independent and competent doctors there who were not subordinate to any government medics.

 

Recalling the “extremely worrying” earlier reports of vision loss in Imran’s right eye, Abbas noted that the Adiala jail staff had not taken timely action to provide medical care to Imran.
“This was a crime. God-willing, we are about to approach the court about this,” he announced.
The senator stressed that the objective of the TTAP sit-in was to ensure that the “government does not commit any more mistakes”. “People across Pakistan — whether opponents or critics — were worried.”
Claiming that Parliament House’s gates were shut, Abbas alleged that the parliament was “made a jail”.
“Our MNAs were confined in the [Parliament] Lodges. The friends from KP were confined in the KP House,” he said, adding that cases under terrorism charges were filed against TTAP members.
Abbas further said that Achakzai had vowed to go on a hunger strike if the reports of “Imran completely losing his eyesight” had turned out to be true.
Earlier in the day, the TTAP leadership — including Achakzai, Abbas, Gohar and Raja — reached the SC to show solidarity with Imran during the hearing of his cases.
“They may announce further strategy regarding the protest and will also address the crackdown on PTI supporters,” TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai had told Dawn.
The TTAP also shared a video of Achakzai inside the SC premises and speaking to Imran’s sister Aleema Khan.







Ahead of the SC hearing, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi met with Imran’s three sisters — namely Aleema, Noreen Niazi and Uzma Khanum.
“A detailed discussion was held on Imran Khan’s health, judicial matters, other affairs and the challenges being faced in these,” the PTI said.







SC again denies Latif Khosa meeting with Imran
Meanwhile, the SC again denied PTI leader Latif Khosa a meeting with Imran, as the court indefinitely adjourned multiple cases concerning the ex-premier.
A three-member bench, headed by Justice Hashim Khan Kakar and including Justices Salahuddin Panhwar and Ishtiaq Ibrahim, resumed hearing a set of petitions regarding the PTI founder.
When the bench took up the matter of Imran’s eligibility to contest polls, Khosa requested that a meeting be arranged between him and the jailed party founder.
To this, Justice Kakar replied, “You have taken away the power of taking suo motu notice from us. How can we order a meeting in a criminal case?”
Justice Panhwar also questioned how the bench could issue directives in a case that was not fixed before it.
Therefore, the bench dismissed Khosa’s request for a meeting.
At one point, Justice Kakar told Khosa “not to speak about political matters while standing in the court”. “Speak on politics in the parliament,” the judge remarked.
He added, “Now that you have said such things, tickers will also be aired about this and vlogs will also be made.”
The SC then issued a notice to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and adjourned the hearing for an indefinite period.
During his conversation with Justice Kakar about an old judgment that he had cited, Khosa brought up the matter of PTI’s intra-party elections.
At this, ostensibly referring to Gohar, the judge acknowledged, “A big, living PTI chairman is sitting before us.”
The appeals against Imran’s acquittal in the cipher case were adjourned without any proceedings as the prosecutor general informed the bench that the detailed order of the case had not been submitted.

 

The prosecutor general sought more time to submit the detailed order.
Here, Barrister Salman Safdar, who had appeared as Imran’s lawyer, informed the SC that he had not been issued a notice in the case.
Justice Kakar observed that the court could issue a notice to him, but noted that the appeal’s maintainability was yet to be decided.
Separately, the SC also indefinitely adjourned Imran’s appeal against a Rs10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during his time as the Punjab chief minister.
Imran’s lawyer stated he had challenged the additional sessions court hearing the case, contending that the district and sessions courts have the authority to conduct the trial. The court then issued a notice to PM Shehbaz’s counsel Mustafa Ramday.
KP CM announces ‘Free Imran Khan Force’
In yet another attempt to secure Imran’s release from jail, CM Afridi announced the formation of a “Free Imran Khan Force” for a “peaceful” movement.
Addressing a press conference outside the SC, Afridi emphasised that a “public movement has now become unavoidable after persistent violations of court directives”, according to a PTI post on X.
The KP CM said the “Free Imran Khan Force” will offer memberships for youth from across the country and would include professionals, members from the Insaf Students Forum (ISF), as well as the PTI’s youth, women and minority wings.
“The Free Imran Khan Force will wage a completely peaceful struggle. After his release, Imran Khan will himself dissolve the force,” CM Afridi was quoted as saying.
The chief minister elaborated that the membership cards would be ready within four to five days, with youth from Peshawar taking oaths after Eidul Fitr.



TTAP ‘demands’ full medical access for Imran
In the early hours of Wednesday, the TTAP also shared a list of five “immediate and unconditional demands”.
The first was immediately granting Imran “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan, so “they could conduct a medical examination independently”.
The alliance further asked for certified copies of Imran’s medical tests, diagnostic reports, X-rays, scans and laboratory results to be shared with his personal physicians.







The TTAP also demanded that the PTI founder’s personal doctors be “given full authority to formulate their independent medical opinion without the presence or pressure of the government’s medical board”.
It further sought “regular and continuous follow-up examinations” of the PTI founder by his personal physicians.
Lastly, the TTAP demanded that, for transparency and accountability, the government clarify in writing why “any obstruction or delay occurred in the provision of treatment, diagnosis, and medical facilities”, and also provide assurance that such negligence will not be repeated in the future.
The TTAP stressed that any kind of “delay, excuses or staged actions” would be unacceptable. “The matter of Imran’s health is not political, but a requirement of human and constitutional responsibility,” it added.
Family members and senior party leaders have repeatedly attempted to meet him at Adiala jail in recent weeks, but most visits have been blocked by authorities.
The SC’s intervention on February 10 allowed PTI lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Imran, with the ex-premier telling the counsel he had “15 per cent” vision left in his right eye. This followed a “medical procedure” that Imran underwent on the night of January 24.
A report prepared by a team of doctors who visited Imran on February 15 stated that, unaided, Imran’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left.
However, the PTI founder’s family and the opposition alliance rejected the report and demanded that Dr Yusuf and family members be allowed regular and confidential access to monitor his condition.
The TTAP framed their sit-in as a push against the government’s alleged negligence and lack of transparency regarding Imran’s treatment.

Ten-year-old Ashfaq lives in a bustling household of ten siblings in Sindh’s Ghotki district, some 540 kilometres north of Karachi. Two and a half years ago, when he was just eight, Ashfaq’s world had narrowed to the confines of a bed, his body ravaged by a mysterious, relentless illness.
A second-grade student at that time, Ashfaq arrived at the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) in Karachi in June 2023, cradled by his father and his 25-year-old sister. He was febrile and gasping for air, his skin ghost-white from severe anaemia. Most heartbreaking for the family was Ashfaq’s inability to walk; the very bones that should have carried him through childhood were now sources of agonising pain.
Ashfaq was brought to the paediatric oncology department, run by the medical charity Child Aid Association under the public-private partnership model. As the head of paediatric oncology, I examined Ashfaq and the grim reality became clear: he had been suffering in silence for 10 long weeks and the signs were pointing towards a childhood cancer illness.

Every year, 10,000 Pakistani children are diagnosed with cancer. Less than half receive proper treatment. While childhood cancer survival rates exceed 80 percent in wealthy nations, they plummet below 30 percent in Pakistan. On International Childhood Cancer Day, a doctor reveals how a historic pledge could lead to hope for families across the nation…

ONE CHILD AMONG THOUSANDS
Ashfaq’s story, though tragic, is not unique. It is the hauntingly familiar narrative of countless children who arrive at our centre, their young lives pushed to the brink by delayed diagnosis and systemic hardship.
Childhood cancer, a devastating health concern, affects approximately 400,000 children each year globally, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates issued in February 2025. While survival rates in high-income countries exceed 80 percent, they plummet to under 30 percent in low- and middle-income regions, the WHO notes.
According to non-profit Pakistan Society of Paediatric Oncology (PSPO), around 10,000 children are diagnosed with cancer annually in Pakistan. But less than half receive proper diagnosis and treatment, because of the limited number of paediatric oncology centres and cancer registries. Currently, there are eight paediatric oncology departments across Pakistan. Two cancer registries exist — one in Karachi and the other in Lahore — but both track adult and child patients together.
In October 2025, PSPO launched a national paediatric cancer registration programme, involving multiple hospitals across Pakistan. It aims to maintain accurate and comprehensive records, in order to improve diagnosis, treatment and survival rates for children battling cancer.
Among the most common types of childhood cancers, leukaemia leads with nearly 30 percent of cases. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a specific, aggressive type of blood cancer, has a high cure rate with contemporary treatments — as high as 80 percent among children, according to the US National Library of Health — yet access remains a challenge.
THE JOURNEY TO SURVIVAL
Following Ashfaq’s arrival at the NICH in 2023, my team quickly worked to diagnose and stabilise him, running blood tests and imaging studies, providing blood transfusions and medications over the next few hours. The results, confirmed the next day by a bone marrow test, revealed a diagnosis of ALL. The family was completely shocked, as they had never imagined a child could have cancer.
Following many hours of counselling, my oncology social workers and I worked to convince the family to arrange accommodation in Karachi. This was crucial because the child needed a long course of chemotherapy and, being immunocompromised, would not have been able to travel back and forth from home.
Ashfaq’s family initially refused, having already depleted their savings on the journey to Karachi. After two or three more sessions, we managed to convince the father — a farmhand — to give the child a fighting chance. I also emphasised that the disease has a good chance of a cure, provided the child receives the complete, necessary sessions of chemotherapy. The family ultimately agreed to stay and begin treatment for their child, full of hope for recovery.
FROM BEDRIDDEN TO THE PLAYGROUND
Today, on International Childhood Cancer Day, Ashfaq’s story represents both tragedy and triumph. After completing his rigorous chemotherapy regimen, he is now in remission — a joyous outcome for his family and our medical team. He returned home to Ghotki, joyfully reuniting with his family
Life began to resume its normal rhythm as he eagerly went back to his studies, embracing the future with renewed vigour. The family was grateful to the medical team for their care and the hospital for providing the child’s complete treatment free of cost, transforming a time of hardship into one of celebration and relief.
Without financial support, the same treatment would have cost at least Rs1 million over the course of treatment — a sum beyond what the family could afford. Given this financial barrier, his recovery demonstrates the power of comprehensive care and community support.
But Ashfaq’s access to such care is the exception, not the rule.
CLOSING THE GAP
Unfortunately, paediatric cancer treatment outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) significantly lag behind those in high-income countries. One reason for this disparity is accessibility to cancer care services for children with cancer.
Another major reason is high treatment abandonment rates — failure to start or complete curative-intent therapy after a cancer diagnosis. Broadly, lack of financial resources, medical facilities, and social support services contribute to the poor outcome rates we see in LMICs. Each of these barriers to treatment intersects and exacerbates the others.
In July 2025, Pakistan became the second country in the WHO-designated Eastern Mediterranean Region to join the Global Platform for Access to Childhood Cancer Medicines, co-founded by WHO and St Jude’s Children Research Hospital in Tennessee, USA. The platform aims to address the lack of treatment affecting at least 50 percent of paediatric patients and to increase their survival rate from 30 percent to 60 percent by 2030.
This is made possible thanks to the pledge of the government of Pakistan, the professional commitment of the Pakistan Society of Paediatric Oncology and the dedication of national stakeholders to standardise childhood cancer care and establish training and build research infrastructure in the country, thereby tackling low survival rates due to access issues.
Today, Ashfaq runs and plays with his siblings in Ghotki — a simple joy that seemed impossible when he arrived at our doors unable to walk. But for every child like him who makes it home, there are countless others who never reach us at all.
The question isn’t whether we can save these children. We know we can. The question is whether we will reach them in time.

“Spring flowers, tailoring and embroidery,” reads a sign outside Alavi’s small store, which opened in January after a months-long search for work.
“I really feel proud because I can support my family, my parents and three sisters. I can pay the rent,” said Alavi, who was wearing a burgundy coat that had a few pieces of leftover coloured thread stuck to it.

Demonstrating her new skills, she guided material through her sewing machine to create delicate silk leaves and flowers.
Alavi is one of more than five million people who have returned to the country since 2023 from Pakistan and Iran, which have been pushing back Afghans after hosting them for decades.
Having grown up in rural Bamiyan province, where she helped her parents with farm work alongside school, the family moved to Iran in 2021.
“In Iran, there were more job opportunities, and there, men and women can work,” she said.
They picked cabbages for a living near the central city of Isfahan, before returning to Afghanistan in 2024.
“My father couldn’t find a job, nor could I or my sisters. I was very hopeless, because there were no jobs in Bamiyan,” she said, her smile fading.

Only one per cent of women who returned from Pakistan or Iran have found full-time jobs, while two per cent have a business, according to a survey by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
Alavi struggled for months, before being picked along with 25 other women for embroidery training under a programme backed by the UN refugee agency.
“I started to have hope, and my hope grew bigger with the course,” she said.
‘No work for women’
Alavi was given a range of equipment including a sewing machine, fabric and cash for a solar panel — essential in a country where power cuts are commonplace.
Her teacher, Rayhana Darabi, described Alavi as “very capable, very talented”.
“She was so dedicated that she would not miss anything and learned everything that same day,” said Darabi.
The embroidery teacher lost her job in December when the programme was discontinued, as part of broader aid cuts hitting people across Afghanistan.
Alavi is the only woman from the programme to have successfully opened a business so far, with her best friend’s support, bringing great pride to those around her.

“We were truly very happy. Women in Afghanistan today — not only in Bamiyan but all over the country — face many challenges and rules and regulations,” said her teacher.
The Afghan Taliban authorities rule by a strict interpretation of Islamic law, barring women from the majority of professions while permitting some to work in industries such as handicrafts.
Alavi appealed to donors to restart the training programme. “Because there is no work for women here,” she said.
Last year, women were the majority among nearly 2,400 people trained under UNHCR programmes.
The agency said this month it needed $216m this year to support displaced people and returnees across the country, but its appeal was currently just eight per cent funded.

 

With opportunities increasingly limited, Alavi encouraged her fellow returnee women to seek out any chance available.
“Don’t sit at home,” said the entrepreneur, surrounded by embroidered dresses, scarves and tablecloths.
Decorated across one of the scarves, which Alavi said she would like to wear, she had embroidered purple butterflies taking flight.</p><small>2026-02-18 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18113108478042e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974081/global-leaders-parliamentarians-send-well-wishes-for-a-blessed-and-peaceful-ramazan' target='_blank'><strong>Global leaders, parliamentarians send well-wishes for a ‘blessed and peaceful’ Ramazan</strong></a><br><p>As the Ramazan moon was sighted in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the USA, and other countries on Tuesday night, wishes poured in from politicians and parliamentarians worldwide for the start of the holy month.

United States President Donald Trump, in a statement issued by the White House, sent his “greetings and best wishes to all those celebrating Ramadan”.
“Every Ramadan stands as a reverent season of spiritual renewal, reflective meditation, and appreciation for God’s countless blessings,” he said. “This sacred time for many Americans emphasises prayer and fasting, strengthens familial and community ties, and affirms our shared values of compassion, charity, mercy, and humility.”
He added, “The God-given right to freely worship is a hallmark of our nation and a pillar of our prosperity and strength.
“For this reason, every day, my administration is ensuring that all citizens can practice their faith, follow their conscience, and worship freely — because freedom of religion means the freedom to practice your religion proudly and without fear of persecution.”
He offered prayers for “happiness and fulfillment at home, unity and peace throughout the world, and blessings in the year to come”.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, on his official X account, wished Muslims in Canada and around the world “a blessed and peaceful month of reflection and prayer”.







Meanwhile, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said, “I extend my best wishes to Muslim communities across Ontario who are observing this sacred month of prayer, reflection and togetherness.”







Anthony Albanese, prime minister of Australia, also issued a statement on X wishing Muslims in Australia for Ramazan.
“The sacred weeks of Ramadan are a chance for Muslims to reaffirm their faith, to reflect, to forgive and to practice acts of love and kindness,” he said. “It is also an expression of the compassion, gratitude and togetherness that have been the hallmarks of the story of Muslims in Australia.”
He reaffirmed that the country’s “strength, success and unity” was built on the fundamental right of every Australian “to practice their faith in peace and safety, proud of who they are”.
He further acknowledged the grief caused to Australian Muslims by the conflict in the Middle East, saying that there was “much to be done”.
“Over the month ahead, may your faith sustain and comfort you,” he added.







United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer wished “Muslim communities in the UK and across the world a peaceful and blessed holy month”.







London Mayor Sadiq Khan said, “As Londoners come together to celebrate the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, our capital shines bright as a beacon of hope and diversity. From my family to yours: Ramadan Mubarak.”

“May this holy month bring peace, wisdom, and blessings through the reflection and spiritual renewal that make Ramadan so meaningful,” she said.







Pete Buttigieg, the US secretary of transportation, sent “warm wishes for peace and joy” to Muslims around the world.







Zohran Mamdani, the recently-appointed mayor of New York City, simply posted “Ramadan Mubarak”, alongside a video showing various iftar foods.







The city council’s Speaker Julie Menin, while wishing the Muslim community, said she had convened a group of Muslim leaders to discuss confronting Islamophobia as well as improving access to halal meals.
“As we begin the holy month of Ramadan, we must recognise the heightened safety concerns many Muslim families are feeling,” she said, stressing that the NYC council was committed to ensuring that “Muslim New Yorkers are safe, respected, and celebrated”.







US Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib sent “love” to Muslims around the world during the holy month, saying, “May it strengthen our commitment to build a more just world.”
She also noted that this was the third Ramazan to take place during the ongoing genocide in Gaza and said, “We hold in our hearts the Palestinians still facing violence.”







Meanwhile, US Representative Jim McGovern wished “a blessed month full of peace, hope, prayer, and reflection to all those celebrating in Massachusetts and around the world”.







Rep. Sarah McBride also wished a “blessed and peaceful” Ramazan to all those observing in Delaware and across the globe.
“This holy month is a time of reflection, discipline, and deep compassion for others — a reminder of the strength found in community and the power of service,” she said.

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said, “Let there be no doubt that our state will continue to shine as a beacon of hope and diversity for all” during the holy month.







Meanwhile, Virginian Governor Abigail Spanberger wished Virginians beginning their celebrations, saying, “I’m wishing you an easy fast and a peaceful, reflective, and joyful holy month.”







Virginian Senator Tim Kaine also wished Muslim communities in the state and around the world a “blessed and meaningful month”.
“I hope this time brings peace and prosperity to all observing,” he said on X.







Californian Senator Adam Schiff wished for a time of “reflection and spiritual growth for you and your loved ones”.







Minnesotan Rep. Ilhan Omar said, “May this blessed month bring peace, hope, and renewal.”

Judicial Magistrate Hamidul Rahman Nasir conducted the trial, which involved testimony from several witnesses, including the victims and police investigators.
The incident took place on April 2, 2021, when a dispute erupted at the man’s residence in the jurisdiction of the Shafiqabad police station.
According to the first information report (FIR), the conflict began when the man allegedly pressured his wife to seek employment against her wishes. When she refused, he and several of his family members reportedly began to beat her.
Following a telephone call from the wife, her mother and brother arrived at the scene.
The prosecution argued that during the ensuing confrontation, the man assaulted his mother-in-law, tearing her clothes and beating her until she lost consciousness. Neighbours eventually intervened to rescue the victims.
The couple had been married for about one year and three months before the incident, and the wife gave birth to a daughter three months ago, according to the FIR.
The FIR, however, stated that after only two months of marriage, the husband began subjecting his wife to routine physical abuse. As a result, she stayed at her parents’ house for about eight months and received medical treatment at their expense.
The defence contended that the FIR was fabricated and noted the absence of official Medical Legal Certificates (MLCs).
However, the prosecution explained that hospital protocols during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic and police negligence during the investigation contributed to the lack of formal documentation.
The magistrate found the man guilty under Section 354 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which addresses assaulting or using criminal force against a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty.
The magistrate observed that minor inconsistencies in testimony due to the passage of time did not invalidate the consistent core allegations against the primary accused.
He also relied upon recent legal precedents from the Supreme Court (SC) and Lahore High Court (LHC) regarding delays in registering FIRs, stating that victims should not be penalised for police inefficiency.
In the judgment announced on Tuesday, the magistrate sentenced the husband to three months of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs1,500 for assaulting his wife.
He was also awarded another three-month rigorous imprisonment for assaulting his mother-in-law, along with a fine of Rs1,500.
The magistrate’s order said both sentences would run concurrently.
After the announcement of the verdict, the accused, who was present in the court, was taken into custody and shifted to the district jail to serve his sentence.
Four other accused were exonerated for lack of evidence.
An alarming number of over 15,000 cases of violence and harassment against women occurred in Punjab in the first half of 2025, and an average of 85 women face violence every day, according to the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO) in its bi-annual Violence Against Women Punjab 2025 factsheet.
The findings depicted a grim picture of women’s safety in Punjab. On average, nine women were raped every day, 51 were kidnapped, and 24 endured domestic violence during the first half of the year.
In January, the SC called out societal apathy towards victims of domestic violence, noting that despite sustained maltreatment by their husbands and in-laws, women are still forced to return to the same abusive environments.</p><small>2026-02-18 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18125928465cdc4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974093/truly-embarrassing-indian-professors-false-claim-over-building-chinese-made-ai-robot-sparks-outrage' target='_blank'><strong>‘Truly embarrassing’: Indian professor’s false claim over building Chinese-made AI robot sparks outrage</strong></a><br><p>An Indian professor has falsely suggested a Chinese-made robot dog displayed at a major AI summit was developed by her university, prompting backlash in a situation that politicians derided as “embarrassing” on Wednesday.
The silver mechanical dog — a model sold by Chinese startup Unitree —appeared at a booth run by the private Galgotias University at this week’s AI Impact Summit in New Delhi.
Following online uproar over the professor’s claim in a televised interview, Galgotias said that while it did not build the machine, “what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies”.
“You need to meet Orion,” the professor told an Indian TV reporter as the dog performed tricks such as waving at the camera and springing up on its hind legs.
“This has been developed by the centres of excellence at the Galgotias University,” she said, touting the institution’s investments in artificial intelligence technology.
“As you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes… it’s quite naughty also,” she said.
In a statement posted on social media platform X, the university said: “Let us be clear — Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed.”
The “recently acquired” Unitree robodog is a “classroom in motion” and “our students are experimenting with it, testing its limits”, it said.







India’s Congress opposition party used the incident to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is hosting nearly 20 world leaders and dozens more national delegations at the five-day summit.
“The Modi government has made a laughing stock of India globally, with regard to AI. In the ongoing AI summit, Chinese robots are being displayed as our own,” the party wrote in a post on X.
“This is truly embarrassing for India,” it added, calling the incident “brazenly shameless”.







The TV reporter who had conducted the interview, Tapas Bhattachary, urged viewers to take a broader perspective.
“If one out of hundreds of exhibitors wasn’t being upfront about their innovation, I would not give up on the entire India’s youth who are very innovative,” Bhattachary said.</p><small>2026-02-18 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18105809b0f840f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974082/14-suspected-militants-killed-during-ctd-operations-in-quetta-barkhan' target='_blank'><strong>14 suspected militants killed during CTD operations in Quetta, Barkhan</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The Balochistan Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Wednesday said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts.
In a statement, the CTD said eight armed men were killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area.
“Eight armed persons were killed in a fire exchange during the operation,” read the statement, adding that three CTD personnel were injured during the action.
According to the CTD, weapons and ammunition were recovered from the killed miscreants. It noted that the dead individuals were said to be from a banned outfit.
In a separate statement, the CTD said “six terrorists were killed in a fire exchange” during an intelligence-based operation in Barkhan.

 

“All security personnel remained safe,” it stated, adding that arms and ammunition were recovered from the killed militants.
“The terrorists were involved in the planning of disruptive actions,” the CTD said, reaffirming to continue its efforts to eliminate terrorism.
The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
On February 5, security forces concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The operation was initiated as security forces responded to a spate of attacks across the province on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days.
During simultaneous operations, around 180 suspects were arrested and a huge cache of arms and ammunition was seized by Frontier Corps and police, officials said.</p><small>2026-02-18 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1811014696bcf9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974083/two-officials-martyred-in-militant-attack-on-police-station-customs-office-in-dera-ismail-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Two officials martyred in militant attack on police station, customs office in Dera Ismail Khan</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Two officials were martyred and two others injured when militants attacked Yarik police station and a customs office in Dera Ismail Khan on Wednesday, police said.
According to officials, attackers opened fire with automatic weapons on the Yarik police station and a nearby customs office, located along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) route.
A police spokesperson said the officials martyred in the attack were customs official Israr Khan and police constable Mohammad Bilal.
The injured, identified as Hazrat Umar and Khayal Mohammad, were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital’s trauma centre, where they were undergoing treatment.
Police said the attackers also fired at passenger buses travelling on the CPEC route, causing panic in the area. A customs vehicle was set ablaze during the assault.
Security personnel returned fire, prompting the assailants to flee. A heavy police contingent reached the site soon after the incident, and a search operation was launched in the surrounding area.
Investigations are underway, and officials said efforts were ongoing to apprehend those involved in the attack.
Earlier this month, at least four policemen, including a station house officer (SHO), were martyred when armed militants attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area of Dera Ismail Khan.

The incident sparked concern among the fellows of the student when they found her in a pool of blood and immediately alerted the college management.
The student (F) was a resident of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and living in the government hostel of the FJMU.
According to reports, the student suffered multiple head and neck injuries besides the bone fractures. She was rushed to the emergency ward of the attached Sir Ganga Ram Hospital from where she was shifted to the operating theatre after initial assessment.
According to FJMU Vice Chancellor Prof Khalid Masood Gondal, her condition was very critical. She underwent a major neuro surgery by a team of senior doctors, but she succumbed to her injuries.
Prof Gondal said the incident occurred at the FJMU girls hostel wherein she accidentally fell from the building. “We have constituted a medical board comprising senior doctors,” the FJMU VC said adding that he has also formed another five-member fact-finding panel of senior doctors and other experts to probe into the matter and submit a report within 24 hours.
Prof Bilquis Shabbir, the Dean Undergraduates, was made the head of the committee.
The VC said she may have fallen accidentally from the building. However, the eyewitnesses and some sources in the institute claimed that she jumped from the building in an attempt to end her life. Immediately, no reason for her extreme step was available.
Earlier, two students, including a female student of a private university in Raiwind, had also jumped from the building.

The Palestinian news agency Wafa, citing local sources, reported that “Israeli forces detained Sheikh al-Abbasi inside the courtyards of Al-Aqsa Mosque“ on Monday evening without giving any reason.
It added that the arrest “comes amid escalating Israeli measures against the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, including restrictions on imams, preachers and worshippers stationed there, limitations on the entry of worshippers, and intensifying incursions carried out by settlers under heavy protection from Israeli police”.
Hamas condemned the arrest of al-Abbasi in a statement on Tuesday, saying he had been “served with an order banning him from the mosque”.
The movement said the measure “constitutes blatant interference in the affairs of Al-Aqsa and an unacceptable assault on its imams”.
Hamas added: “The escalating violations by the fascist occupation government against the sanctity of Al-Aqsa Mosque, the imposition of restrictions on worshippers’ access, the prevention of logistical preparations for the month of Ramazan, and the intensification of raids by settler groups are dangerous interventions that fall within its persistent attempts to control and Judaize the mosque, restrict freedom of worship there, and impose temporal and spatial division.”

 

The movement called on the “Palestinian people in Jerusalem, across the West Bank and inside the 1948 territories to remain stationed at Al-Aqsa, travel to it and maintain its presence, and stand as a bulwark against plans to tamper with its identity”.
Hamas also urged the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Arab and Islamic nations “to take urgent action through all possible channels to protect Al-Aqsa Mosque from the danger of Judaization, and to take practical steps to pressure the occupation and force it to halt its violations”.
Occupied Jerusalem, particularly the Old City and the vicinity of Al-Aqsa Mosque, has been witnessing rising tensions amid tightened Israeli security measures, including arrests and ban orders against religious figures and Palestinian activists in Jerusalem.
Israeli police have also said they would deploy in force around the Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramazan, as Palestinian officials accused Israel of imposing restrictions at the compound.
Over the course of the month of fasting and prayer, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Al-Aqsa — Islam’s third-holiest site, located in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed.
The Al-Aqsa compound is a central symbol of Palestinian identity and also a frequent flashpoint.
Under long-standing arrangements, Jews may visit the compound, but they are not permitted to pray there.</p><small>2026-02-18 05:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/181017418aabee6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974077/ukraine-war-talks-to-resume-in-geneva-as-us-signals-progress' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine war talks to resume in Geneva as US signals progress</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were to resume a second round of peace talks in Geneva on Wednesday, as Washington’s top envoy signaled optimism in its bid to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II.
The talks are the latest diplomatic bid to halt the fighting, which has killed hundreds of thousands, forced millions to flee, and decimated much of eastern and southern Ukraine.
The United States has been pushing for an end to the nearly four-year war, but has failed to broker a compromise between Moscow and Kyiv on the key issue of territory.
Two previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides in Abu Dhabi failed to yield a breakthrough.
But US envoy Steve Witkoff, representing the Trump administration at the talks, said President Donald Trump’s diplomatic efforts had made strides in Washington’s bid to end the conflict.
“President Trump’s success in bringing both sides of this war together has brought about meaningful progress,” he wrote on X, without elaborating.
“Both parties agreed to update their respective leaders and continue working towards a deal.” The latest talks “lasted six hours” and “were very tense”, a source close to the Russian delegation told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address he was ready “to move quickly towards a worthy agreement to end the war”, but questioned whether Russia was serious about peace.
“What do they want?” he added, accusing them of prioritising missile strikes over “real diplomacy”.
Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with the ensuing conflict resulting in a tidal wave of destruction that has left entire cities in ruins.
Breakthrough hopes low
For the Geneva talks, the Kremlin reinstated nationalist hawk and former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky as its lead negotiator.
Ukrainian national security secretary Rustem Umerov was leading Kyiv’s side and said negotiations would continue Wednesday.
He thanked Washington for its mediation and said he informed European allies of the outcomes from the first round of talks, which he said had focused on “practical issues and the mechanics of possible solutions” to the conflict.
“I have concluded a separate meeting with representatives of the United States and European partners — France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy and Switzerland,” he wrote on Telegram.
“We discussed the results of today’s round of negotiations and aligned our approaches on further steps.” Zelensky has repeatedly said his country is being asked to make disproportionate compromises compared to Russia.
Trump put pressure on Ukraine on Monday to make a deal, saying they “better come to the table, fast”.
Zelensky told Axios on Tuesday it was “not fair” that Trump kept calling on Ukraine to broker a deal, adding that lasting peace would not be achieved if “victory” was just handed to Russia.
“I hope it is just his tactics and not the decision,” Zelensky said.Hopes for a breakthrough remain low.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had told journalists to expect no major news from the first day of talks.
‘Disregards peace efforts’
Even before talks were underway, Ukraine had accused Russia of undermining peace efforts by launching 29 missiles and 396 drones in attacks overnight into Tuesday that authorities said killed four people and cut power to tens of thousands in southern Ukraine.
Late Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff said Russia had fired 28 missiles and 109 guided aerial bombs at its territory since the beginning of the day.
“The extent to which Russia disregards peace efforts: a massive missile and drone strike against Ukraine right before the next round of talks in Geneva,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga wrote on social media.
Russia, meanwhile accused Ukraine of launching more than 150 drones overnight into Tuesday, mainly over southern regions and the Crimean peninsula — occupied by the Kremlin in 2014.
Russia occupies around one-fifth of Ukraine — including the Crimean peninsula it seized in 2014 — and areas that Moscow-backed separatists had taken prior to the 2022 invasion.
It is pushing for full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region as part of any deal, and has threatened to take it by force if talks fail.
But Kyiv has rejected this deeply unpopular demand, which would be politically and militarily fraught, and signalled it will not sign a deal without security guarantees that deter Russia from invading again.
Russia has been slowly seizing territory across the sprawling front line for months.
But its wartime economic worries are mounting, with growth stagnating and a ballooning budget deficit as sanction-hit oil revenues drop to a five-year low.</p><small>2026-02-18 05:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18073111e740b01.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974063/imf-team-due-on-feb-26th-for-review-budget-talks' target='_blank'><strong>IMF team due on Feb 26th for review, budget talks</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: An Inte­r­national Monetary Fund (IMF) mission led by Iva Petrova is due to visit Pakistan on Feb 26 to review implementation of the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the $1.1bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), officials said.
During the almost two-week visit ending March 11, the engagements would be of greater significance as both sides would also discuss budget proposals based on performance this year and set broad contours of the upcoming budget (for the fiscal year 2026-27), particularly those relating to provincial finances.
The programme’s performance as of end-Dece­mber 2025 — the period for review — has mostly been up to the mark, alb­eit with a revenue shortfall, which authorities bel­i­eve could be reduced following a recent super tax ruling by the Federal Cons­t­ituti­onal Court that went in the government’s favour.
The power sector would also remain under added scrutiny given volatile policymaking in the recent months, including those relating to the industrial sector, residential fixed cha­rges and so on, altho­ugh circular debt numbers are within the target range.
On the positive side, Pak­istan has met almost all quantitative performa­nce criteria for end-Dece­mber 2025. However, it is lagging behind in indicative targets and structural benchmarks, which could affect future programme implementation.
Given the biannual reviews of the $7bn EFF and the $1.1bn RSF, the two sides will have to agree on past performance as well as forward-looking implementation plans.
Upon the successful completion of the review, Pakistan will be eligible for the disbursement of about $1bn (760 million Special Drawing Rights) under the EFF and another $200m under the RSF by the end of April.
Meanwhile, Topline Research said it expected Pakistan to meet nearly all quantitative performance criteria (QPCs).
“As per our calculation, Pakistan is likely to meet nearly all seven QPCs; however, data for one indicator is not known yet,” it said, referring to the floor on targeted cash transfers, which it said was missed in the previous review by Rs1bn.
However, it perhaps missed the point that the slippage was only technical in nature, as lower spending was not related to beneficiaries but to lower administrative expenses.
Topline also observed that net international reserves were likely to remain below at around $6.7bn against the $7bn benchmark for September 2025 and below $6bn for December 2025 against the $6.5bn benchmark.
“The net domestic assets (NDA) of the SBP are likely to remain in the range of Rs12.5-13.5tr vs the ceiling target of Rs14.9-15.1tr for September and December 2025,” it said.
It said that as per the State Bank, foreign currency swaps stood at $2.2bn for September 2025 and $1.86bn for December 2025, compared to ceiling targets of $2.25bn and $2bn, respectively. It also estimated primary surplus figures of Rs3.5tr and Rs4.1tr for September and December compared to targets of Rs460bn and Rs3.2tr.
“The government guarantees and floor on cash transfer spending are also likely to be met as per our channel checks. Similarly, the new tax return target is also expected to be achieved,” Topline said.
It added that the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) indicative criteria were missed by Rs336bn but hoped that a portion of this missed target could be collected through the super tax verdict, though the collection would still remain below the annual target.

The Green Shirts returned to Lahore late Tuesday night after suffering defeats in all their matches against Germany and hosts Australia, concluding a winless campaign across both legs of the competition.
Media reports highlighted serious lapses in arrangements, particularly inadequate and delayed accommodation in Hobart, which left players discontented and affected their preparation.
PHF president Tariq Hussain Bugti, speaking to Dawn, said the responsibility for all logistical and financial arrangements — including hotel bookings, air travel, TA/DA and visas — rested with the PSB.
He cited directives from the senate standing committee on sports, which had designated the PSB as the body to handle financial matters for the team’s FIH Pro League participation.
“The PHF has accepted the senate committee’s ruling and is not interfering in these affairs,” Bugti said. “Our priority remains ensuring the national team’s participation in this important competition, which provides valuable exposure against top-ranked teams.”
A PSB official, Rana Nasrullah, countered that the team management had sufficient funds at its disposal, with players also carrying USD 1,650 each.
“If funds were available, why was the hotel arrangement mismanaged? There was also no proper cooking system, forcing players to prepare their own meals,” he said.
When queried about food-related issues, Bugti noted that the squad was en route home and a detailed report would be available upon their arrival in Lahore.
Both the PHF president and the PSB welcomed the prime minister’s directive for a probe. Federal sports minister Rana Sanaullah has constituted an inquiry committee to investigate the matter.
“It is a positive step, and the PHF will present its position before the committee,” Bugti added.
Separately, sources indicated that accommodation payments of USD 3,750 from the first leg in Argentina remain pending.
It is relevant to note that, amid past allegations of financial irregularities against the PHF, the prime minister had released Rs250 million to secure Pakistan’s participation in the Pro League, with the PSB appointed as custodian of financial affairs.
Reports also suggest the PSB had booked the hotel but payment issues arose.
A PHF official, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed the PSB provided a cheque of Rs10 million to the team management for accommodation upon arrival.
However, hotel rates had increased by then, leading to limited bookings — including a guest house — and shared or substandard rooms, leaving players dissatisfied with both lodging and food.
Sources added that players may address a press conference in Lahore to clarify the situation.
Pakistan captain Emmad Butt, in a video statement, had earlier refuted claims that the team was left without any hotel accommodation or forced onto the streets.
Players have also expressed discomfort over their daily TA/DA allowance of USD 40 from the PSB, which falls short of the USD 100 stipulated in PHF regulations.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office issued a statement: “Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken notice of the mismanagement in hockey affairs reported in the media, and enquiries are being conducted. Immediate action will be taken against those found responsible.”
Following the notice, Sanaullah expressed grave concern, stating that the PHF’s actions had tarnished the country’s and the sport’s reputation. “Such behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Strict action will be taken against those responsible for mismanagement and bringing disrepute to the sport,” he warned.
While the minister has initiated the inquiry, no specific names of committee members have been announced. Observers have noted that an inquiry conducted solely by PSB or ministry officials may lack full independence, and a neutral body would better serve impartiality.

JERUSALEM: As Israeli authorities barred the imam of Al Aqsa Mosque from entering the compound, 93 states — including the eight-nation Muslim bloc — slammed Tel Aviv’s move to designate lands in the occupied West Bank as so-called “state land”.
Last week, the Israeli cabinet approved measures that would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory.
Israeli NGOs have also raised alarm over the government’s settlement plan, which they say would mark the first expansion of Jerusalem’s borders into the occupied West Bank since 1967.
According to a statement, issued by the Palestinian mission to the United Nations, 85 nations as well as the European Union (EU), Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and Arab League called for the immediate reversal of the Israeli annexation of the West Bank.
States who signed up to the latest statement include Algeria, Andorra, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chad, China, Colombia, Cuba, Cyprus, North Korea, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Liberia, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, South Korea, Russia, San Marino, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tajikistan, The Gambia, Turkiye, Uganda, UAE, Tanzania, UK, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Yemen and Zimbabwe.







An earlier statement from the foreign ministers of the eight-nation Muslim bloc also condemned Israel for approving procedures for the registration and settlement of land ownership across extensive areas of the occupied West Bank.
“This illegal step constitutes a grave escalation aimed at accelerating illegal settlement activity, land confiscation, entrenching Israeli control, and applying unlawful Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and undermining the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” said the statement.
“This step reflects an attempt to impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land, thereby undermining the two-state solution, eroding the prospects for the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian State, and jeopardising the attainment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region.”
Warning by NGOs
The planned development, announced by Israel’s Ministry of Construction and Housing, is formally a westward expansion of the Geva Binyamin, or Adam, settlement situated north-east of Jerusalem in the West Bank.
But the area to be developed lies on the Israeli side of the separation barrier built in the early 2000s, while Geva Binyamin sits on the West Bank side of the barrier, and the two are separated by a road. In a statement, Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now said there would be no “territorial or functional connection” between the area to be developed and the settlement.
“The new neighbourhood will be integral to the city of Jerusalem,” said Lior Amihai, Peace Now’s executive director.
“What is unique about that one is that it will be connected directly to Jerusalem, but it will be beyond the annexed municipal border. So it will be in complete West Bank territory, but just adjacent to Jerusalem,” he said.
Imam barred from Al Aqsa
Sheikh Muhammad Al-Abbasi, a senior imam of the Al Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem, said on Tuesday that Israeli authorities had barred him from entering the compound, just days before the start of the holy month of Ramazan.
“I have been barred from the mosque for a week, and the order can be renewed,” he said, adding that he was not informed of the reason for the ban.
On Monday, Israeli police said they had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.

Speaking at the session, industry specialists noted that while AI offers significant opportunities to improve governance and service delivery, its integration into the civil bureaucracy will not be immediate.
It was highlighted that digital contributions account for more than 50 percent of GDP in China, whereas the share remains very low in Pakistan, underscoring the need for adoption across all sectors.
The session was held for media professionals and digital activists at the head office of Huawei Pakistan, which also serves as a global back office for Huawei.

Strong local cloud presence essential as data sovereignty, AI sovereignty fast becoming matters of national security, says Huawei official

Experts argued that AI tools could help streamline public services, support evidence-based decision-making, and reduce delays in administrative processes.
Kashif Iqbal, a technical expert at Huawei, said Pakistan has a strong IT workforce, noting that Pakistanis form the second-largest group of employees at Huawei after Chinese nationals.
More than 20,000 students participate annually in global competitions organised by Huawei, and Pakistani participants have consistently secured positions among the top three, outperforming competitors from around the world.
Although basic infrastructure already exists in Pakistan, including in the public sector, the digitisation of data is essential for AI systems to function effectively.

 

“AI is the right direction for transforming the public sector, but it will take time for senior executives and government officials to fully understand and effectively use these technologies,” said Ahmed Bilal Masood, CEO of AI and Cloud Business at Huawei Pakistan.
He highlighted that Huawei is a key supplier of AI equipment used in establishing cloud services and ICT solutions in Pakistan.
“Data sovereignty and AI sovereignty are becoming matters of national security globally, which is why a strong local cloud presence is essential,” Mr Masood said, adding that despite the challenges, AI is a critical driver for reforming Pakistan’s public administration. Embracing artificial intelligence, he said, could help modernise outdated systems and improve public service delivery.
“AI is being adopted in all fields, from traffic management to enhancing the performance of hospitals and educational institutions.” However, he cautioned that successful implementation would depend on the enactment and enforcement of cyber laws, including data protection legislation, as technology alone cannot drive change.
Faisal Ameer Malik, Huawei’s Chief Technology Officer for the Middle East and Central Asia region, said the concept of AI was introduced in 1956, with a major breakthrough occurring in 2011 by Google. However, the concept gained widespread prominence during and after the Covid era.
He noted that between 2012 and 2022, AI was largely applied to small data models, but due to widespread digitalisation, current AI systems are based on large data models.
He added that around 170 countries have released national digital strategies, while 60 countries have elevated AI to the level of a national strategy. Pakistan has already approved its National AI Policy in 2025.

DEMONSTRATORS protest in front of New York’s Trump Tower.—Reuters

• Hillary accuses Trump of orchestrating ‘cover-up’• Los Angeles mayor calls for 2028 Olympics chief to resign• Hyatt boss steps down
SANTA FE: Lawmakers in the US state of New Mexico passed legislation on Monday to launch the “first full investigation” into what happened at Zorro Ranch, where the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is accused of trafficking and sexually assaulting girls and women.
A bipartisan committee will seek testimony from survivors of alleged sexual abuse at the ranch, located about 50 kilometres south of Santa Fe, the state capital. Legislators have urged local residents to testify.
Meanwhile, former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton accused President Trump of orchestrating a ‘cover-up’ over the Epstein files.
“Get the files out. They’re slow-walking it,” the former first lady said in an interview with the BBC.
In other developments, the mayor of Los Angeles called upon Casey Wasserman, the chief organiser of the 2028 Olympics committee, to resign after his name figured in the Epstein files.
Thomas Pritzker, the chairman of the Hyatt chain of hotels, said he had decided to leave his position after emails revealing his ties to Epstein came to light.
Truth commission
The “truth commission” named by New Mexico, comprising four lawmakers, seeks to identify ranch guests and state officials who may have known what was going on at the 7,600-acre property, or taken part in alleged sexual abuse in its hacienda-style mansion and guest houses.
The Democratic-led investigation adds to political pressure to uncover Epstein’s crimes that has become a major challenge for President Donald Trump, weeks after the Justice Department released millions of Epstein-related files that shed new light on activities at the ranch.
The files reveal ties between Epstein and two former Democratic governors and an attorney general of New Mexico.
The committee started its work on Tuesday, and will deliver interim findings in July.
“He was basically doing anything he wanted in this state without any accountability whatsoever,” said lawmaker Andrea Romero, a Democrat.Testimony to the committee could be used for future prosecutions, she said.
Victim advocates applauded the move, saying Zorro Ranch had been overlooked by federal investigations that focused on Epstein’s Caribbean island and New York townhouse.
“Many of the survivors had experiences in New Mexico, and as we’ve learned, you know, there were local politicians and other people that were aware of what was happening in New Mexico,” said attorney Sigrid McCawley, whose law firm has represented hundreds of Epstein survivors.
Hillary Clinton slams ‘cover-up’
“Get the files out. They are slow-walking it,” Clinton, who is due to testify before a Congressional committee on the issue next week, told the BBC in Berlin.
Former president Bill Clinton features regularly in the files, but no evidence has come to light implicating either of the two in criminal activity.
The couple has been ordered to give closed-door depositions before the House Oversight Committee, which is probing the deceased financier’s connections to powerful figures and how information about his crimes was handled.
“We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public,” Hillary Clinton told the BBC. “I just want it to be fair,” she said. “I want everybody treated the same way.”
Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has called on Casey Wasserman, whose name was also mentioned in the Epstein files, to step down as chief organiser of the 2028 Summer Olympics.
Bass told CNN it was “unfortunate” the Olympic organisers were supporting Wasserman after revelations he exchanged flirtatious emails with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. He said: “My opinion is that he should step down. That’s not the opinion of the board.” She said that “we need to look at the leadership” of LA28.
Hyatt CEO resigns
The executive chairman of the Hyatt hotel chain also stepped down after emails revealing his ties to Jeffrey Epstein came to light.
Businessman Thomas Pritzker maintained contact with Epstein well after the latter was convicted in 2008.

WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrives here on Wedne­sday (today) to attend the global summit of the Boa­rd of Peace (BoP) hosted by US President Donald Trump, stepping into a forum that seeks to go beyond Gaza in restoring global peace and stability.
The summit’s immediate focus is expected to be threefold: consolidating a ceasefire in Gaza, mobilising financial pledges for the BoP — with Washin­gton announcing an initial commitment of $5 billion — and finalising the contours of a proposed global forum that Trump hopes can achieve what the United Nations could not.
Participants are also likely to discuss the proposed International Stab­ilisation Force (ISF), tas­k­ed with securing reconstruction zones and supporting a post-conflict governance arrangement in Gaza.
For Pakistan, the question of contributing troops to the ISF has assumed particular importance after it reportedly figured in discussions between Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Diplomatic sources say several Muslim countries are open to participating in a stabilisation mechanism but are reluctant to accept any combat role that could place their forces in direct confrontation with Hamas. They are also seeking a clear political horizon for Palestinian statehood and opposing Israeli moves towards ann­e­x­ation in the West Bank.
The institutional design of the BoP — a compact, leader-driven body with an operational arm in the form of the ISF and a dedicated financing pool — reflects Washington’s preference for coalition-based mechanisms operating outside the slower multilateral framework of the United Nations. This has raised questions among diplomats and scholars about both effectiveness and legality.
Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the United States, Britain and the United Nations, was unequivocal in her assessment. “The jury is out on whether the Board of Peace can deliver peace. The absence of any Palestinian representation on the Board raises questions about its legitimacy,” she said. “If the principal party to the issue is excluded, how is this going to advance the peace process or carve out a post-conflict future for the people of Gaza.”
Dr Lodhi warned that externally imposed governance arrangements risk reproducing older power hierarchies. “Externally controlled governance arrangements make this a colonial-style project,” she observed, adding that “at least half of the countries invited to be members didn’t join the body as they had reservations about its role, legality and effectiveness as well as Trump’s pretension of turning this into a parallel body to the UN Security Council”.
She also questioned Islamabad’s early decision to sign on. “Pakistan should not have joined the Board in such haste and should have waited to see what exactly it will do, especially given the widespread view that it can end up becoming an instrument for continuing Israeli occupation.”
For PM Shehbaz, the visit is not only about Pakistan’s potential role in a new stabilisation architecture but also about navigating a complex web of domestic and external pressures, according to Akbar Ahmed, Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at American University.
“PM Shehbaz Sharif faces as sticky a wicket as can be imagined when he arrives in Washington for his meetings with President Trump,” Prof Ahmed said. “He is bringing with him two sets of dilemmas: an internal one and an external one.”
On the domestic front, he noted, the prime minister must manage a difficult civil-military balance amid rising security challenges. He added that Shehbaz Sharif also faces a politically sensitive decision regarding the continued incarceration and health of former PM Imran Khan.
Externally, the challenge is even more complex. “On the one hand, he must continue his newly formed amiable relationship with President Trump, which gives him access to American military and economic structures, and on the other, the consistent and immeasurable support that China has provided,” Prof Ahmed said, pointing to tensions on both the eastern and western borders as factors that make this balance unavoidable.
“With both the western border with Afghanistan and the eastern border with India heating up, Shehbaz Sharif cannot ignore this balance between America and China. His performance will be watched carefully and his words weighed. He will need all his legendary skills of survival.”
In that sense, the Washington visit is as much about testing the contours of Pakistan’s evolving relationship with the United States as it is about Gaza. For the Trump administration, the summit is expected to secure troop commitments for the ISF, financial participation in reconstruction and political endorsement for a US-led stabilisation model.
For Muslim and Arab countries, participation is tied to a permanent ceasefire, a credible pathway to Palestinian statehood and a non-combat mandate for any multinational force.
How PM Shehbaz positions Pakistan between these competing expectations — while coordinating with like-minded states and maintaining strategic equilibrium between Washington and Beijing — will determine both the immediate diplomatic outcome of the summit and the longer trajectory of Pakistan’s role in the emerging post-conflict framework for Gaza.

The State Bank of Pakistan data revealed that consumers opted for more loans in January due to the change of model year and registration, as the growth in December 2025 was slightly slower than in November 2025.
Auto financing has been struggling to beat the peak of Rs368bn recorded in June 2022 when annual car sales volumes were around 240,000 units.

 

Auto sector expert Mashood Ali Khan said that the current trend shows consumers are increasingly leveraging bank financing to purchase vehicles, contributing to a gradual recovery in automobile sales despite prevailing economic challenges. This is a strong indicator that consumer demand still exists, and it only needs supportive policy to accelerate further.
The growth momentum comes primarily under the State Bank’s existing Rs3 million auto financing cap, enabling a large segment of middle-income consumers to access vehicle ownership. “I believe that the auto sector holds significantly greater potential if financing limits are revised upward to Rs6 to Rs7m.”
By doing this, the auto market will witness a substantial expansion, particularly in the sedan and mid-range vehicle segment, which remains largely inaccessible to financing-dependent consumers under current limits, he added.
“If financing ceilings are increased and interest rates continue to ease, Pakistan’s annual auto sales could potentially cross 200,000 units a year again,” he emphasised.
He said the small-car segment remains the primary beneficiary of financing due to its alignment with the SBP financing cap. A segment of consumers is also seeking to access sedans through partial financing combined with personal savings, highlighting the demand gap created by the current financing ceiling.
Banks are offering more flexible financing options, including comparatively lower markup rates, reduced down-payment requirements, and easier repayment structures. “This has supported recovery, but policy alignment is essential to unlock the sector’s full potential,” he said.
Raising financing limits, while supporting consumers, would also generate broader economic benefits, including industrial production growth, employment generation, vendor development, and increased government revenues through taxes and duties, he said.
He said continued interest rate moderation could further strengthen financing activity in the coming months. “I stress that revising financing limits remains the single most impactful policy intervention to accelerate growth,” Khan said.
Sales are likely to remain upbeat in view of a 137pc increase in imports of semi- and completely knocked-down kits by the local assemblers to $1.144bn in 7MFY26 from $706m in the same period last fiscal year.

Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka restrained police from arresting the PTI founder in the said cases and also extended the pre-arrest bail of Bushra Bibi in one related matter. The hearing was adjourned till Feb 18.
During the proceedings, the PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were represented by their legal team. However, despite earlier directions, the former prime minister could not be produced before the court through a video link. Owing to his absence and the unavailability of his counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, arguments on the acquittal application could not be advanced.
The court subsequently directed that the PTI fou­nder must appear at the next hearing either personally or via video link.
The cases against the PTI founder stem from the May 9 incidents and incl­ude charges of attempted murder, submission of fake receipts and other offences. A separate case has also been registered against Bushra Bibi for allegedly submitting fake receipts.
Also, Additional Distr­ict and Sessions Judge Amir Zia extended the interim bail of Bushra Bibi in a case related to the November 26 protest.
Meanwhile, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra deferred indictment proceedings in the Sangjani Jalsa case due to the non-appearance of the accused PTI lawmakers.

Meanwhile, the alleged move continues to draw criticism.
On Monday, it was claimed by an X account, The Stratcom Bureau — which mainly shares defence- and security-relates news — that the “government of Punjab, Pakistan has acquired a new, 2019-manufactured Gulfstream GVII-G500 aircraft for their VIP transport role”.
In a separate post by the same account, it was claimed that “the registration number of the luxury plane is N144S” and its “old Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) registration would be changed to Pakistani registration soon”.
The post also said that the approximate asking price for the aircraft was $38 million to $42m.
Meanwhile, the US FAA registry shows that the aircraft is currently owned by TVPX Aircraft Solutions Inc. Trustee, which, as per its website, commonly acts as the registered owner for aircraft trusts, facilitating the buying, selling, and leasing of planes, particularly for non-US citizens or for privacy reasons.



According to flight tracking service Flight Radar, the aircraft has been flying between various airports in Punjab since at least February 12.
Dawn reached out to several officials for a confirmation of the purchase’s claims, but they remained tight-lipped on the matter.
Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman and Additional Chief Secretary Ahmad Raza Sarwar did not respond to calls and text messages to clarify the Punjab government’s position.
Punjab Additional Secretary (Welfare) Waseem Hamid, however, denied the claims of the aircraft’s purchase before abruptly disconnecting the call.
Dawn also tried to contact Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, but she, too, did not respond to any calls or the query sent to her as a text message.
Amid this silence by the officials, the reported purchase of the aircraft continues to draw criticism, including by former finance minister Miftah Ismail and ex-Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair.
Sharing the Stratcom Bureau’s post on X, Miftah juxtaposed the reported purchase of the aircraft with the recent hike in petroleum prices by the government.
“So while Pakistanis are supposed to tighten our belts and sacrifice, Punjab’s entitled VIPs are fastening their seatbelts for taking off in luxury private jets,” he said.







Similarly, Zubair posted on X: “Such a beautiful plane worth more than 1,000 crore, which has been bought by the Punjab govt for the use of its CM and party’s elite.”
He questioned whether a nation facing economic difficulties, with 45 per cent of the people living below the poverty line and amid record unemployment — afford this luxury.
“The Punjab government may issue a denial if not true,” he said about the claims of the aircraft’s purchase.

The TTAP particularly accused Naqvi of attempting to “distort” facts to “cover up the deteriorating health and treatment meted out to” the former prime minister.
The allegations came in response to a press conference by Naqvi earlier in the day, who asserted that the government did not want to “politicise” the matter of PTI founder Imran Khan’s health and blamed the opposition for doing the same.
The opposition, PTI and Imran’s family have voiced concerns over the former prime minister’s health after his eye ailment came to light late in January.
Addressing the media in Lahore, Naqvi referred to the recent medical report prepared by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday.
“The medical report also came forward yesterday and everything is clear as per it. Neither we nor the government want to politicise this,” he said, adding that there were certain “requests” which the authorities allowed but were not suitable to publicise at the moment.
“Putting up such a show is extremely inappropriate, especially misleading people,” the minister said.

 

“Still, we picked our best government and private doctors because it had been three days and the checkup had not taken place,” he insisted.
Naqvi said he then invited PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan to reach Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday to witness Imran’s checkup but the former refused, citing party consultations.
Detailing the communication between the authorities and the opposition, Naqvi said Gohar was given the time of 2:30pm. “We kept on waiting for an hour but Gohar sahib replied in the negative, that he has consulted with his party and would not be able to come.”
“Our intention was that the checkup be performed in front of everyone,” he asserted, adding that the doctors were at the Adiala jail for about 1.25-1.5 hours for the examination.



Naqvi stated that Gohar, along with the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders — Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai — and their preferred doctors, was then invited to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad.
There, the doctors who examined Imran briefed the opposition leaders as well as spoke on the phone to the “two doctors” named by the PTI, with each conversation lasting for about 45 minutes. “They asked each and everything,” Naqvi said about the PTI-recommended doctors.
“Excellent. This is the best treatment. Even if we had to provide treatment, we would have done the same,” he quoted the doctors as saying.
According to Naqvi, the opposition representatives also expressed satisfaction over the treatment and said they would inform their supporters about it.

 

Asked about former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s claims that Naqvi made unmatched efforts for Imran’s release, the minister said, “One thing, which is not new, is that I have believed from the first day that dialogue is the solution to everything.
“This is not my personal opinion; the prime minister has also said what I say, and we are following those instructions. […] If you ask about my personal view, I always say talks are the [answer],” he said.
Responding to another question, he said there were “sensible people” in every party and if they had been listened to, the “PTI would not have been in the current situation, nor would have done the May 9 things”.
On whether any action was being taken against the former Adiala jail superintendent whom the PTI holds responsible for aggravating Imran’s health issue, Naqvi stated: “We will check with the Punjab government what they are doing on it. But they are on it.”
‘Politicians onboard but Aleema vetoed everything’
However, the minister claimed, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum told the PTI that the “issue would die down” if the opposition accepted the government’s arrangements.
“The medical checkup could not take place for three days just because of her. On one hand, they claim to have great empathy, relation and everything. On the other hand, politics has been done to the utmost over this.”
The interior minister then questioned why roads were being blocked despite all the steps taken for Imran’s treatment.
“If your intention was good, then you would have agreed on the first day. Almost all political leaders used to be on board but Aleema Khan sahiba vetoed them. She used to reject everything,” Naqvi said.
“The problem is they want to cash this matter,” he contended.



During his media talk, Naqvi recalled how the issue of Imran’s eye ailment came to light after the government confirmed that the PTI founder was taken to Pims for a minor procedure.
He noted that the treatment was merely an injection that needed to be administered.
The minister pointed out that “as a precaution, so there are no germs”, Imran was taken to the hospital, even though doctors suggested it could be done in jail.
“I will tell you very clearly that when any prisoner needs treatment, it is our duty,” he affirmed, questioning whether all thousands of prisoners were accorded the same facilities as Imran was being provided.
The interior minister said he believed that journalists should be provided with a tour of prisons so they could witness the facilities available there.
Naqvi quipped that if the aim was political vendetta, then the first step would be to adopt a strict demeanour and restrict their facilities to what is provided to an ordinary prisoner as per the jail manual.
“If we wanted to exact political revenge, the first step would be to [tighten] him,” he said.
On the topic of the ongoing road blockades due to PTI protests, the minister said: “Our duty is to tell people to be aware of whatever cells in your party that are doing this; they are enemies of your people that have different objectives and want to do their own politics.
“[…] It is now clear to me about at least some individuals that they are more worried about their politics than his (Imran’s) health.”
The interior minister affirmed that the government would ensure the implementation of the recent Peshawar High Court (PHC) order that has directed the KP government and its police to reopen the roads.
Demand for 1-week hospital admission
Recalling previous contacts between the government and the opposition with the mediation of NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Naqvi asserted: “We made one thing very clear that in the matter of treatment, we will provide whatever facility is available to any incarcerated person as per the Constitution and the law.”
He stated that the government had sought the name of a “non-political” eye specialist for examining Imran, but the other side refused and insisted on a family member accompanying the doctor, which was also agreed to.
“I am saying all this as it is on record and you can ask the PTI leaders about this,” the minister affirmed. He further said that the name of Kasim, who he said was a cousin, was also given by the party to come along, which was allowed.
“When both things had taken place, they said ‘no, not like this, you must admit him to a hospital for a week and we will not accept anything else’,” Naqvi claimed.
The minister said the authorities would “100 per cent” have Imran hospitalised for “even two weeks” given that the doctors recommended it.
“But if the doctors do not recommend, then how can we have him admitted?” he asked. “It is not possible that just on your recommendation we admit him to hospital for one week.”
Separately, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry posted on social media platform X that Imran would be administered an injection in the next few days, and a second injection would be administered after a month.
The minister said this was expected to lead to further improvement in Imran’s condition, adding: “His (Imran’s) treatment will continue at the best hospital of Islamabad/ Rawalpindi and under the supervision of expert doctors.”







Chaudhry asserted that Imran’s family was taken into confidence at every stage.
He further said: “The government clarifies that no negligence will be committed. All prisoners are equal for us and their health is the state’s responsibility.
“Politicisation should be avoided on this matter, and baseless doubts should not be spread.”
The minister alleged that the PTI was “giving a political colour to this sensitive matter to hide its internal divide”.
TTAP terms Naqvi’s presser contrary to facts
Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) termed Naqvi’s press conference “blatantly misleading and contrary to the facts”.
In a statement, the opposition alliance said that the government was attempting to “distort” facts and create a “fabricated narrative to cover up the deteriorating health and treatment meted out to” the incarcerated former premier.







“Concealing the facts from the nation is unacceptable,” the TTAP said. It added that the “distrust of government doctors and demand for the presence of Imran’s personal physician during the medical examination was not an act of stubbornness but rather a unanimous decision taken by his family, the leadership of PTI and the TTAP”.
It said that only the incarcerated leader’s family “has the right to make a decision regarding his health”.
The opposition alliance reiterated its demand for Imran’s personal physicians to be present, stressing that inviting the political leadership “was just a facade”.
It also claimed that the “prolonged solitary confinement in which Imran has been kept comes under the category of torture, as per international human rights standards”.
It recalled that Imran last met his personal physician in November 2024, while meetings with family “have remained suspended for two-and-a-half months”.
It added that under such circumstances, “claiming that he was being given the best of facilities was a mockery of truth”.
The TTAP warned the government “against attempts to suppress the truth, distort facts, and cover up rights violations”.
Imran’s sisters dispute Naqvi’s account
Separately, Imran’s sisters — Aleema, Uzma Khanum and Noreen Niazi — also disputed Naqvi’s account while addressing a press conference in Islamabad.
First to speak among them, Aleema, said the daughter and sister-in-law of Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, had conveyed a message by the former premier after they met the latter at the Adiala jail today.
Aleema said Imran had complained about the condition of his eye and asked for his reports to be shared with his personal physicians, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf.
“Imran Khan has also said that his blood tests should be conducted and that the results be shared with his personal physicians,” Aleema added. “I ask why he is saying so,” she added, without further elaborating on the remark.
She further said that Imran had stated that his vision had been perfect but he began facing problems around three months back. “He said he conveyed to the jail superintendent that he was unable to see, but no one bothered to provide him medical treatment for three weeks.”
Aleema said Imran had also suggested initiating a case of criminal negligence against the jail superintendent.
She maintained that “we had demanded that Imran be moved to Shifa International Hospital, and the government initially agreed to it. But, they suddenly said later that he would be moved to Al Shifa Eye Hospital”.
Moreover, she continued, they had also shared the names with the government of the doctors they wanted to examine Imran. “But we were told that we should change the names, so we changed the names. Later, we suggested that Dr Nosherwan Barki be allowed to meet Imran Khan, but we got the message that it was not possible,” she claimed.
Aleema also claimed that before leaving for a visit to Sri Lanka, Naqvi had given them the guarantee that Imran would be treated at Shifa International Hospital, but the commitment was not fulfilled.
“They (government) said that [Imran’s] sisters will not be allowed to meet him. We accepted it and suggested that doctors should be allowed to meet Imran Khan, but that suggestion was also rejected,” she said.
Aleema went on to say that if Naqvi was not afraid of Imran, he should allow moving the PTI founder to Shifa International.
“They are scared of Imran Khan,” she asserted, urging “all Pakistanis” to raise their voice for the former premier.
Speaking after Aleema, Uzma claimed she had received a “call from the government” and was informed that Imran’s cousin, Qasim Zaman, could be allowed to visit him.
“I replied that Dr Barki and Dr Yusuf should be sent instead,” she said, further claiming that she was told that it was “not acceptable”.
Uzma went on to claim that she was later informed that while Imran’s family would not be allowed access to him, Dr Yusuf could visit him. But, even he was not allowed, she added.
She accused the doctors who had signed Imran’s medical report of “derailing their credibility”, saying that the report neither detailed any diagnosis nor any treatment plan.
Uzma further maintained that “we have received messages from doctors from around the world that the report was not prepared by doctors. That is why we were demanding that at least one doctor of our choice be included in the medical board [for Imran]”.
She also said that “an injection cannot be administered in jail”.
“We do not know what kind of injection was administered to Imran. Was it an injection of poison?” she asked, adding that during her last meeting with Imran, he had expressed the fear that he would be killed in jail.
PTI takes exception to minister’s remarks
Meanwhile, the PTI took exception to Naqvi’s remarks regarding Imran, wherein he said that if the government wanted to harm the former premier it would have done so at the jail.
“Given credible reports of vision loss, this statement is deeply alarming. A senior official openly implying deliberate worsening of custody conditions raises serious concerns about hidden mistreatment,” the party said on X.
“Public threats on national TV make it legitimate to question humane treatment in prolonged solitary confinement without independent medical oversight, family contact or transparency,” the party said.







“Prolonged solitary confinement is internationally recognised as harmful, especially with pre-existing conditions. Combined with deteriorating eyesight and treatment secrecy, the threat to ‘tighten’ conditions becomes far more sinister,” it said.
“This is not mere rhetoric; it concerns actual custodial reality. A state claiming rule of law must prove it through actions, not threats. When power lacks transparency and such insinuations are normalised, the risk of custodial abuse becomes urgent and credible,” it added.</p><small>2026-02-17 17:42</small></div><hr>
