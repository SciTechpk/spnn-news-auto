PM Shehbaz arrived in Vienna a day earlier on a two-day visit, with the Foreign Office (FO) noting that it marked the first visit by a Pakistani prime minister to Austria since 1992.
PM Shehbaz and Stocker held a “restricted meeting” at the Federal Chancellery today, which was followed by delegation-level talks, a press release issued by PID said.
The delegation talks included Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, and Foreign Secretary Ambassador Amna Baloch.
The statement read: “Both leaders recalled the friendly and historic ties between the two countries and committed to work together more closely to further strengthen the bilateral relationship in diverse fields, including economic cooperation, trade and investment, tourism, hospitality, education, IT, healthcare and human resource development and mobility.
“To this end, they agreed to work for the early finalisation of MoUs (memoranda of understanding) under consideration related to these areas.”
The premier and the chancellor also “exchanged views on regional and global developments, and agreed on the central role of the United Nations in addressing the challenges of peace and security, peaceful settlement of disputes, sustainable development, climate action and protection and promotion of human rights”.

 

“They expressed their shared commitment to multilateralism and appreciated mutual support for each other’s candidatures, while working together with the international community for strengthening the UN system,” PID added.
PM Shehbaz thanked Stocker for the “meaningful and productive meetings” during the visit, which he said would lend fresh impetus to bilateral ties.
He also extended an invitation to the chancellor to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at his earliest convenience.

According to the PID statement, the premier and the chancellor co-chaired a meeting of chief executive officers (CEOs) from leading Austrian and Pakistani companies working in a wide range of areas.
“It was agreed to expand G2G (government to government), G2B (government to business) and B2B (business to business) engagements between the two countries through the effective utilisation of the existing platforms,” the statement read.
The prime minister invited the Austrian businesses and companies to participate in the upcoming EU-Pakistan Business Forum to be held in Islamabad in April this year.
PM Shehbaz and Austrian Federal Economic Chamber Vice President Carmen Goby also witnessed the signing ceremony of an MoU between Pakistani and Austrian companies.







In a post on X later, PM Shehbaz stressed that his visit “carries special significance as we are having a high-level visit after more than three decades”.
“It also coincides with the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Pakistan–Austria diplomatic relations,” he noted.
He termed the meeting with Stocker “most warm and productive”, reiterating that the two reaffirmed their countries’ resolve to work closely in diverse fields.







‘Pakistan working to jointly ban illegal immigration’
Separately, PM Shehbaz stated that Pakistan was working with European partners to “jointly ban” illegal immigration.
Addressing the Pakistan–Austria High-Level Business Roundtable in Vienna, he affirmed Pakistan was “absolutely” against illegal immigration and was “working with our European friends — Austria, France, and Germany — to jointly ban this illegal immigration [and bring it] to a grinding halt”.
He assured Austria that Pakistan would fulfil its “demand for skilled labour” as per the international certification required by it.
Every year, many young Pakistanis leave the country via illegal routes in hopes of better employment opportunities.
A 2023 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the European Union (EU) found that 24,000 Pakistanis entered EU countries illegally over the past three years.



At the outset of his address, the premier stressed that Pakistan and Austria shared “long-standing friendly relations”.
The premier outlined the areas in which the two countries remained “proactively engaged”, including mining and minerals and renewable energy.
He detailed that he held meetings with the leadership of Austria, stating that he aims “to take many of these discussions to their logical conclusion”.
He noted that 6o per cent of Pakistan’s population was young and “needed modern training in their hands, including laptops, AI, and IT-led initiatives”.
PM Shehbaz highlighted that Pakistan held “huge potential” in the field of agriculture.
“Here, Austria can be a great partner, providing Pakistan with experience and modern technology to have value-addition in the field of citrus root, and make marmalade, juices and export them to Austria, the Middle East and other parts of the world”, the premier added.
FM Dar’s remarks
FM Dar delivered the opening at the roundtable, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said.
It added that the forum brought together leading businesses from both countries, reflecting the positive momentum in Pakistan–Austria trade and investment ties.
Speaking on the occasion, Dar emphasised expanding cooperation in trade, investment, technology, and innovation, while highlighting Pakistan’s ongoing economic reforms and focus on improving the ease of doing business.
He noted the “natural complementarities between Austria’s technological strengths and Pakistan’s dynamic market and young workforce”.
The FO statement said that he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to a stronger partnership with Austria and expressed confidence that enhanced business-to-business linkages, institutional collaboration, and sustained political engagement would open new avenues of growth, connectivity, and long-term economic partnership with Austria and across the European region.







Earlier on Monday, PM Shehbaz was welcomed by Stocker upon his arrival at the Austrian Chancellery and was presented with a guard of honour, the Prime Minister’s Office said.







The statement said that the national anthems of both countries were played at the arrival, and both leaders “introduced their respective delegations to each other before proceeding for tête-à-tête and the delegation-level talks”.
The premier also penned his remarks in the guest book at the Chancellery.

The ruling party’s leaders and workers have closed M-1 at Swabi rest area since last Friday to demand early treatment of their incarcerated leader, Imran Khan, for “vision loss”.
The closure of M-1, the main artery connecting Peshawar with the rest of the country, has put the Grand Trunk Road, the other major road, under immense strain as the neglected highway is unable to cater to the traffic diverted from the motorway.
Also, the GT Road is facing closures by PTI activists, causing massive inconvenience to people travelling to attend urgent business meetings and exams, take international flights from Islamabad airport and seek treatment. The businessmen, whose supplies have got stuck along the road, are also distressed.

Businessmen wonder why PTI govt troubling people of KP

Jan Mulk, a businessman, who was travelling from Islamabad to Peshawar on Sunday evening, told Dawn that he left Islamabad at around 4:30pm and reached Attock at around 6:30pm before finding himself caught in a huge traffic jam at Attock crossing.
“Hundreds of vehicles were stuck in a long traffic grid lock and there was not even any way to turn back,” he said.
The businessman said that the Attock traffic gridlock forced him to return and spend the night in Islamabad before coming to Peshawar next morning.
“There were women, children and elderly, with a large number of them being on foot due to road closure and unavailability of public transport,” he said.
Mr Mulk said transporters in Attock were charging commuters Rs1,000 for a trip to Rawalpindi.
Khan Zaman Afridi, president of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Transporters Association, told Dawn that road closures had made life difficult for transports.
“Nearly 3,000 vehicles leave Peshawar General Bus Stand on a daily basis but the number has dropped to around 1500 due to road closures,” he said.
Mr Afridi said almost all public transport used the M-1 and now its closure has diverted all the traffic to the GT Road and a usual trip of two to three hours on motorway was taking over 10 hours on GT Road.
“GT Road is not old GT Road and is full of potholes and full of vans, Qingqi motorcycle-rickshaws and push carts, so it is very difficult to traverse and now, the entire motorway traffic has been diverted to it, causing massive traffic snarl,” he said.
Mr Afridi said that due to the road closures, many people had stopped travelling, and commuter arrivals at bus stands had almost halved as only people who had to attend urgent business meetings travelled in compulsion.
“It is ironic that the KP government is inflicting pain on its own people,” he said.
A representative of Faisal Movers told Dawn that his transport company had stopped its Peshawar-Islamabad operations since the start of the M-1 closure.
Junaid Altaf, president of KP Chamber of Commerce and Industry, questioned the rationale for the motorway closure.
“Who are they troubling? Is it the people of KP or residents of Punjab and Sindh who are being affected due to the M-1 closure?”
Mr Altaf said that KP chief minister and his cabinet had been sitting in Islamabad for the past many days, leaving their offices and official duties unattended.
He said that the prolonged closure of Pak-Afghan border points had already ruined the province’s business community and now, the politicians didn’t understand that the trucks stranded on the road to KP carried raw material to factories in the province and prolonged closure was hurting the business community as well as the economy of the province.
“If PTI thinks the people of KP deserve this for voting them to the powers, then it is ok and we deserve it,” he said.
Malik Sohni, president of All Pakistan Agriculture Produce Traders Federation, told Dawn that road closures had resulted in an over 10pc increase in the vegetable prices in the provincial capital.
He said that in the current season, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, okra, garlic, peas and leafy vegetables were transported from Punjab to Peshawar.
Mr Sohni said that as vegetables were perishable, prolonged blockages not only caused spoilage but also drove the prices up.
“Prices automatically go up when fresh supplies don’t reach on time,” he said.

The analysis, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, examined 22 previous studies involving nearly 2,000 adults across Europe, North and South America, China and Australia.
Researchers compared short-term fasting regimens — including the popular 5:2 diet and time-restricted eating plans that confine meals to eight-hour windows — with traditional advice to reduce calorie intake, or no dietary guidance at all, over periods of up to 12 months.
The findings were stark: the fashionable approach made little discernible difference to either weight loss or quality of life when measured against standard dietary advice. Luis Garegnani, the lead review author from the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, said intermittent fasting might be a reasonable option for some individuals, but the current evidence does not justify the enthusiasm observed on social media. While the authors expressed moderate confidence in the findings, they noted some underlying studies used less robust methods.
Nevertheless, the rev­i­ew is likely to pour cold water on a trend that has gained enormous traction online.

LONDON: The British Museum has removed the word ‘Palestine’ from some of its gallery displays, revising maps and information panels in its ancient Middle East collections on the grounds that the term was used inaccurately and is no longer historically neutral.
Reports in leading British papers, including The Guardian, said the changes affect displays in the museum’s ancient Levant and Egypt galleries, where parts of the eastern Mediterranean coast had previously been labelled as ‘Palestine’, and some individuals described as being of “Palestinian descent”.
At least one panel in the Egypt galleries was amended to replace “Palestinian descent” with “Canaanite descent”.
The revisions followed representations from UK Lawyers for Israel (LFI), a voluntary group of solicitors, which wrote to the museum’s director arguing that the retrospective application of the term ‘Palestine’ across thousands of years obscured historical change and erased the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah from around the first millennium BCE.
In its response, the museum said that while ‘Palestine’ had been widely used in Western and Middle Eastern scholarship since the late nineteenth century as a geographical designation, it no longer carried a neutral meaning and is now often understood as referring to a modern political territory.
The museum said it uses ‘Can­aan’ for the southern Levant in the later second millennium BCE, UN terminology for modern political boundaries, and ‘Palestinian’ as a cultural or ethnographic identifier where appropriate.
The decision has prompted criticism from historians and members of the public, with more than 5,000 people signing a petition calling for the museum to reverse the changes and arguing that they contribute to the erasure of Palestinian presence from public memory.
The Guardian also noted that while several displays have been updated, the museum claims these changes were made last year after feedback and audience research. Historian and author William Dalrymple criticised the move, calling it ridiculous to remove the word ‘Palestine’, when it has a greater antiquity than the word ‘British’.
“The first reference to Palestine is on the Egyptian monument of Medinet Habu in 1186 BCE. The first reference to Britain is the 4th century BC when it appears in the work of the Greek traveller Pytheas of Massalia,” he wrote on X. In a subsequent post, Dalry­mple said that after speaking with the museum’s director, Nich­olas Cullinan, he had lear­ned that reports about the muse­um cancelling the name ‘Palestine’ altogether were inaccurate.







Quoting Cullinan, Dalrymple wrote: “To reassure you we are not removing mention of Pales­tine from our labels. Indeed, we have a display on at the moment about Palestine and Gaza.”
According to the historian, the director of the British Museum had said that only two panels in the ancient Levant gallery were amended last year during a routine gallery refresh, and that the director had not been aware of the issue until it became public. Cullinan was quoted as saying he had not seen the letter from UK Lawyers for Israel until recently and was “disgusted by the whole thing”.
Criticism
Academics who spoke to Middle East Eye defended the historical validity of the term. Marchella Ward, a lecturer in classical studies at the Open University, said “ancient Palestine” was a legitimate scholarly descriptor. “I use the term ‘ancient Palestine’ frequently in my own research and will continue to do so,” she said, adding that claims the term is illegitimate are aimed at “the erasure of Palestinians”.
The campaign group Energy Embargo for Palestine accused the museum of hypocrisy, saying it claims to objectively communicate history while “preparing itself to rewrite history, to erase Palestine, and its millions of people, out of the history books”.
Critics also argue that the museum’s decision fits into what they describe as a broader pattern of pressure exerted by UKLFI on public bodies.
According to the European Legal Support Centre (ELSC), a forthcoming database documents hundreds of incidents of alleged anti-Palestinian repression in the UK between 2019 and 2025, with UKLFI appearing in a significant number of cases.
Giovanni Fassina, executive director at ELSC told Middle East Eye that the targeting of the British Museum was part of a “very clear pattern” of letters threatening legal action or alleging breaches of UK law.
ELSC and the Public Interest Law Centre have submitted a complaint to the Solicitors Regulation Authority over UKLFI’s alleged use of strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs).
The UK Charity Commission has also confirmed it is investigating the group’s charitable wing following complaints by advocacy organisations.
UKLFI had argued in its letter that describing ancient civilisations as Palestinian creates “a false impression of continuity”.

The message, posted by Erdogan’s team on X, said he had talked with Al Nahyan by phone.
“During the course of the call, President Erdogan expressed his sadness over the health problem experienced by (President) Al Nahyan and wished him a prompt recovery,” said the three-paragraph message.







Erdogan would travel to the United Arab Emirates at a later date, still to be determined, the message added.
Although the message — of which AFP has a screen grab — was quickly deleted from the account, it had already been picked up by official Turkish media.
Turkiye’s state broadcaster likewise took down its article on Erdogan that mentioned the Emirati leader’s health problem.
The official Emirati news agency, WAM, reported on the telephone conversation between the two leaders, but did not mention that Erdogan’s visit had been postponed.
Contacted by AFP, neither the Turkish presidency nor the Emirati authorities — who have themselves made no statement on their president’s health — have yet answered.
The Emirati leader’s team on Saturday evening released photos taken the same day showing Al Nahyan, known as MBZ, smiling and apparently in good health, with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar.

The outage, which str­u­ck the platform owned by Elon Musk, rendered the site largely inaccessible for approximately two hours before timelines began populating and functionality returned to normal.
The platform appeared to be operating as usual by 3:30pm GMT. The restoration came shortly after Down Detector, a website that tracks online service interruptions, recorded a sharp spike in user reports regarding the site’s performance earlier in the afternoon.
Downdector indicated that in Pakistan, the number of users reporting issues peaked at 6:54pm with a total of 275 complaints, subsequently decreasing to 8 by 7:54pm.
During the disruption, internet connectivity monitor Netblocks posted on the open-source social network Mastodon that X appeared to be suffering “international outages”.







Netblocks, which tracks technical issues on major platforms as well as government-imposed internet shutoffs, clarified that Monday’s breakdown was “not related to country-level internet disruptions or filtering”.
Access issues were verified globally, with journalists in countries including France and Thailand reporting an inability to access the platform.
Representatives for X did not immediately resp­ond to requests for comment regarding the cause of the outage.

A Shangla police official said a terrorist attacked a police party during a search-and-strike operation in the Kabalgram area, resulting in the martyrdom of three policemen. The police retaliated swiftly and eliminated two attackers.
The official added that the operation was ongoing in the area and a large police contingent had been dispatched to the spot.
The martyred personnel were identified as Head Constable Maqbool Ahm­ad and Elite Force constables Saeed-ur-Reh­man and Fida Hussain.
IED blast
Meanwhile, Bannu pol­ice said two people, including a Hafiz-i-Quran boy, were killed when an IED planted on a motorcycle parked outside shops near the Miryan police station exploded with a loud bang. At least 17 others were injured in the explosion.
According to Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) spokesperson Muha­m­mad Noman, the bodies of the deceased and the 17 injured were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital and Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital.
Police and security forces cordoned off the area immediately after the incident, collected evidence from the site, and launched a search operation.
RPO Sajjad Khan, Dep­uty Commissioner Bannu Muhammad Faheem Khan, ANP Senator Haji Baaz Muhammad Khan Advocate, Dr Pir Sahib Zaman, PTI district president Haji Gul Baaz Khan, and other leaders visited the DHQ Hospital to inquire after the injured. According to the bomb disposal squad, seven to eight kilogrammes of explosive material was used in the blast.

Under the notification, however, the Power Division also imposed a nominal Rs1,000 per consumer per month fixed charge on smaller industrial consumers, on the pattern of similar charges on residential consumers imposed last week. The new rates are effective from Feb 11, 2026.
This industrial consumer category is defined as B1 in official jargon for a connection load of up to 25kW. Its average tariff has been reduced from Rs30.80 per kwh (unit) to Rs26.03. This includes new off-peak rates of Rs25.48 instead of Rs30.05 and a new peak rate of Rs35.74 instead of Rs36.74 per unit. The fixed charges for the remaining three industrial categories have been kept unchanged at Rs1,250 per kilowatt per month.
The average energy rate for the B2 category, with a 25-500kW load, has been fixed at Rs26.16 per unit instead of Rs30.73. Its off-peak rate has been revised to Rs22.83 per unit instead of Rs27.41, while peak rates have been set at Rs35.68 instead of Rs36.68 per unit.

Tells Nepra to restore contractual rights of old net-metered solar consumers

Larger industrial consumers (B3) on 11–33kV transmission lines will now be charged an average energy price of Rs27 per unit instead of Rs31. Their off-peak rate has dropped to Rs23.67 from Rs28.24, while peak rates have come down to Rs35.68 from Rs36.68 per unit.
The tariff for the largest industrial consumers (B4) on main 66-132kV transmission lines has been reduced to Rs26.43 from Rs30.43 per unit. Their peak and off-peak rates are now set at Rs35.68 and Rs27.96 per unit instead of Rs36.68 and Rs23.38, respectively.
The Power Division also formally requested Nepra to suspend the withdrawal of specific contractual benefits to old prosumers under the PM’s directive. Nepra has again called for public comments within 30 days on fresh amendments to Nepra Prosumers Regulations 2026, notified only last week.
In the fresh amendments, Nepra is seeking deletion of subsection (2) of section 21 of the Prosumers Regulations 2026, which had changed payback rates for old consumers to Rs8.13 from Rs26 per unit and shifted them from net metering to net billing. The proposed clause now reads that existing approvals, licences and agreements will remain valid, and prosumers will continue to be billed under old rates and mechanisms until the expiry of their agreements.
Nepra introduced the prosumers regulations in February, attracting widespread condemnation from prosumers and political parties for disregarding government contracts.
Reacting to the backlash, PM Shehbaz Sharif sought a review of Nepra’s revised rules for rooftop solar users and directed the Power Division to file a reconsideration request to restore all contractual obligations to existing prosumers who had invested in response to government policies.
The PM directed that all possible protections for existing consumers be ensured and that a mechanism be formulated to prevent any undue transfer of the cost burden of 466,000 prosumers onto other national grid consumers.
Sources said Nepra suspended the controversial clauses. Other regulations for upcoming prosumers, including net billing and the Rs8.13 per unit payback rate, will remain in field as notified on Feb 9.
Under the new regulations, prosumers will be shifted to net billing instead of net metering, and their exported units will be credited for one month instead of the current three months.
Under net billing, electricity generated by a prosumer is purchased by the relevant distribution company (Disco), and the consumer is billed for electricity imported from the grid at about Rs37-55 per unit, after receiving credit for exports at the National Average Energy Purchase Price of Rs8.13 per unit.

JAKARTA: Indonesia is preparing a total of 8,000 troops for potential deployment to Gaza by June as part of a proposed multinational peacekeeping force but the final decision on deployment rests with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, the country’s army spokesperson said on Monday.
Army spokesperson Donny Pram­ono noted that initially 1,000 soldiers would be ready for deployment by early April.
“The departure schedule rema­ins entirely subject to the political decisions of the state and applicable international mechanisms,” Pra­mono said in a text message.
Indonesia’s foreign ministry clarified on Saturday that its military’s participation in the UN-mandated International Stabilisation Force should not be interpreted as a normalisation of political relations with Israel, a nation Jakarta does not recognise.
The deployment would carry a non-combatant, humanitarian mandate and requires the consent of the Palestinian Authority.
“Indonesia consistently rejects all attempts at demographic change or the forced displacement or relocation of the Palestinian people in any form,” the ministry said, adding that its troops would have no mandate to demilitarise any party.
The deployment plans are being announced as global leaders convene for the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, which will be chai­red by US President Donald Trump. Additionally, President Subianto is set to travel to Washington this week to participate in the event.
While the board was endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution to oversee the Gaza truce, the European Union insisted on Monday that while it will participate in the meeting, Brussels would not be joining as a member.
European Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Suica will represent the bloc in Washington.
“She will participate in the meeting of the Board of Peace for the specific part dedicated to Gaza. Let me stress that the European Commission, it’s not becoming a member to the Board of Peace,” EU spokesman Guillaume Mercier said.
Some member states have raised concerns that the board could morph into a rival to the UN. “We still have a number of questions regarding several elements in the Board of Peace: one concerning its scope, two concerning its governance, and three, its compatibility with the UN Charter,” EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said.
Meanwhile, Italy aims to play a role in stabilising the Middle East by offering training support while their Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed Rome is ready to participate as an observer.
“We are ready to train a new Gaza police force, and we are also ready to train a Palestinian police force,” Tajani told a news conference in Rome.
Ahead of the summit, President Trump announced that members of the US-led body have pledged more than $5 billion for Gaza’s reconstruction and committed thousands of personnel to international stabilisation efforts.
Trump plans to host the meeting on Feb 19 at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington.

JERUSALEM / ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan denounced the latest Israeli move to convert areas of the West Bank into “state property”, the UN chief called upon Tel Aviv to reverse its new, “unlawful” policy allowing registration of the occupied land in the occupied territory as state property.
Israel’s foreign ministry claimed the measure, approved late on Sunday, would enable “transparent and thorough clarification of rights to resolve legal disputes” but the move drew strong condemnations from across the globe for its violation of international law.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said this new measure was destabilising and unlawful, according to a statement by his spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
Pakistan also denounced the step as a clear violation of international law as well as relevant United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. Islamabad urged the international community to reject the decision, said a statement issued by the For­eign Office spokesperson. It added that the occupying power continued to disregard international law and its provocative actions undermined the prospects for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region.
“Pakistan calls on the international community to take concrete measures to end Israeli impunity, and ensure respect for international law,” the spokesperson added.
‘Undermine peace efforts’
Arab nations Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan also criticised the move as illegal. The measure is “aimed at impo­sing a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank” that would undermine peace efforts in the region, Saudi Arabia’s foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II said the actions “undermine efforts to restore calm and thr­e­aten to exacerbate the conflict,” according to a statement released by the royal court.
The European Union called on Israel to reverse the move. “This constitutes a new escalation after recent measures already aimed at extending Israeli control,” EU foreign affairs spokesman Anouar El Anouni said. “We reiterate that annexation is illegal under international law.”
The Ramallah-based Palest­inian Authority called for inte­r­national intervention to prevent the “de facto beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state”.
Israeli anti-settlement watc­­h­dog Peace Now called the measure a “mega land grab”. Jonathan Mizrachi, the NGO’s co-director, told AFP that the move would attribute new resources for land registration.
“There was a lot of ambiguity regarding the land, and Israel decided now to deal with it,” Mizrachi said, adding that the grey area over Area C land ownership was likely to be used against Palestinians.
“A lot of land that Palestinians consider theirs, they will find out it’s not theirs under this new registration process,” he said, believing the move would further the Israeli right’s annexation agenda.
Changing demography
Palestinians see the West Bank as foundational to any future Palesti­nian state, but many on Israel’s religious right want to take over the land.
The latest Israeli initiatives come in the wider context of increasing attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to rights groups.
“We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a recent statement.
US President Donald Trump has opposed Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, saying stability in the territory helps keep Israel secure.
However, he has held off from dire­ctly criticising the new Israeli measures, despite the international outrage.
Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, more than 500,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements and outposts, which are illegal under international law.
Around three million Palestinians live in the territory, which Israel has occupied since 1967.
Al-Aqsa restrictions
Israeli police said Monday that they would deploy in force around the Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramazan, as Palestinian officials accused Israel of imposing restrictions at the compound.
Over the course of the month of fasting and prayer, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Islam’s third-holiest site. Arad Braverman, a senior Jerusalem police officer, said forces would be deployed “day and night” across the compound, adding that thousands of police would also be on duty for Friday prayers.
Braverman said police had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.
The Palestinian Jerusalem Governorate said it had been informed that permits would again be restricted to men over 55.

As part of its Vision 2028 agenda, the SBP launched Cyber Shield, a major initiative aimed at strengthening the safety and robustness of the country’s banking and financial system.
The banks have been facing increasing incidents of cyber crimes, while the international organisations believe that every second Pakistani is facing the cybersecurity problem.
With the rapid digitisation and very high growth of online payments, cyber threats have also increased. Bankers said the situation is not alarming, but there is a need to implement quick remedies to control it, which would help strengthen the banking system in Pakistan.

Outlines key priorities to counter growing threats by 2030

“The milestones laid down in the strategy will be implemented in a phased manner by 2030. All regulated entities are required to align their internal cybersecurity programs with the strategy to ensure compliance,” said the SBP.
The central bank said the strategy has been designed to better protect banks and financial institutions from cyber threats, thus ensuring that people and businesses can continue to access financial services safely.
The SBP said it set out a clear roadmap to help financial institutions strengthen their systems and controls, prevent cyber incidents, respond quickly when cyber threats materialise, and recover effectively from them.
“As the banking ecosystem faces increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, the strategy aims to enhance cyber defences of the regulated entities through a holistic, forward-looking and collaborative approach,” said the SBP.
Bankers said cybersecurity experts are not available to meet the growing demand in financial institutions, as many young Pakistani experts prefer jobs abroad with higher pay. There is no attractive policy to retain cybersecurity experts in the country.
The SBP said the Cyber Shield focuses on five key priorities: strengthening the ability of banks to withstand cyber incidents, improving governance and accountability for cybersecurity, encouraging cooperation and information-sharing across the financial sector, building skilled cyber talent, and continuously updating security practices to keep pace with new risks.
“The SBP will closely monitor both global and domestic cyber developments and will update the strategy as needed to address emerging threats,” said the SBP.
By strengthening cyber resilience across the banking sector, SBP aims to safeguard customers, support digital innovation in a secure environment and ensure financial stability, it added.
About 90 per cent of bankers believe that cybercrime is the biggest challenge confronting the banking industry in the country, according to a previous survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Pakistan.
Seventy per cent list fraud as their major concern, and 60 per cent believe terrorism financing is the biggest threat, the survey showed.
“Banks in Pakistan operate within an evolving financial crime compliance ecosystem,” said the survey report.

ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power and Regulatory Authority (Nepra) came under fire on Monday over abrupt changes to the net metering policy, as the National Assembly Stan­ding Committee on Industries and Production questioned the rationale of the move which would “shatter the trust of the investors in the government policies”.
In a meeting held under the chairmanship of MQM’s Syed Hafeezuddin, the parliamentarians and the government officials criticised the policy change from net metering to net billing.
Earlier this month, Nepra drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network.
According to the committee chairman, the policy will have serious implications for the government’s reputation. When the regulator can honour the commitments made to the independent power producers, it should also respect the response by industries and individuals who availed the net metering policy introduced by the government, he said.
Mr Hafeezuddin said the industrial units opted for this policy and invested in solar power systems, but they have been left in a lurch after the new net billing policy was introduced by the government.

 

Members of the committee and even the industries secretary expressed concerns that the policy change would shatter the trust of investors in government policies as well as discourage industries from adopting clean technologies. The com­m­ittee noted that the premise used by Nepra to change the policy was not based on any “rat­i­onal study” by the power ministry.
“Pakistan needs to promote solar and other clean energy for the industries; it will help reduce the cost of doing business on a long-term basis,” Mr Hafeezuddin added.
Development projects
The key agenda of the NA panel’s meeting was to review and approve the ongoing development projects under the various departments of the industries ministry. After strict scrutiny of the project, the committee turned down a large number of projects, demanding their monitoring reports from the Planning Commission. The delay and cost escalation particularly irked the panel members.
“I know and I understand that Covid and dollar crises, and a change in government had some impact on all matters,” Dr Mehreen Bhutto said, adding that all projects had been delayed by six to nine years and the briefs given to the lawmakers were “always incomplete — why is that the case”.
Committee members, including Abdul Hakeem Baloch and Shahid Usman, contradicted the claims made by the departments under the Ministry of Industries regarding several development projects. Responding to the projects in Hub and Karachi, the chairman reprimanded the officials that he had been to these areas and the ground reality was different.
While Shahid Usman had a different picture of the projects in Gujranwala, Dr Bhutto highlighted that the briefs presented to the committee lacked even basic details.
“There is no mention of rupees in millions or billions in the brief, the details are incomplete,” she added.
The committee members noted that departments opt to go for new buildings and purchase land for projects instead of using the land of non-functioning state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
“It is understandable why the SOEs are making losses,” Mr Hafeezuddin said.
The committee also discussed the case of a former employee of the Engineering Development Board, Engineer K.B Ali, who was transferred back to his parent department but he has approached the court of law and obtained a stay order.

His statement comes against the backdrop of protests at multiple places by PTI activists in KP. The party workers have blocked entry and exit points to the province, resulting in inconveniences for the people and KP being cut off from the rest of the country.
The protests began on Friday, simultaneously with sit-ins by opposition parliamentarians and Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan leaders in Islamabad, over PTI founder Imran Khan’s health.
When KP CM was asked today about what would be the next line of action for PTI workers, he said: “We have not given any line of action to the workers. The workers have come out on their own. Our strategy was just for the parliamentarians.”







He said the plan devised for parliamentarians was to stage a “peaceful sit-in” outside the Parliament in Islamabad. “But, unfortunately, some of us were stopped at the KP House, some at the Parliament Lodges and some at the Parliament House.”
He again reiterated that “no official call” had been given to party workers for the protest, and they had taken to the streets of their own accord.
“They have shut down KP,” he acknowledged, apologising to the people of the province.
He said the PTI was facing a hard time, with its leader jailed and facing health issues.
“The [PTI] workers might have acted emotionally, but you [the people] please have patience. You have voted for the PTI, and you love Imran Khan. So if you have faced difficulties for two or three days for his sake, I apologise. Please wait a little more, and the situation will get better,” Afridi said.</p><small>2026-02-16 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1623331762fc921.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973697/iran-says-us-more-realistic-on-nuclear-issue-as-guards-begin-drills-in-hormuz-strait' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says US ‘more realistic’ on nuclear issue, as Guards begin drills in Hormuz Strait</strong></a><br><p>Iran said on Monday that the United States’s position on Iran’s nuclear programme “has moved towards a more realistic one”, a day ahead of a second round of US-Iranian talks in Geneva.
Tehran’s foreign minister arrived in Geneva for the new round of indirect negotiations with the US, as the Revolutionary Guards began military drills in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping lane for oil and gas.
The two sides recently resumed indirect talks, mediated by Oman, after US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
“A cautious assessment is that, from the discussions that have taken place in Muscat to date, at least what we have been told is that the US position on the Iranian nuclear issue has moved towards a more realistic one,” said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei, the official IRNA news agency reported.
According to Tehran, talks mediated by Oman will be held on Tuesday in Switzerland.
Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed, including Iran’s ballistic missiles and support for armed groups in the region.
The war games being conducted by the Guards, the ideological arm of the military, aim to prepare it for “potential security and military threats” in the Strait, Iranian state TV said.
Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a strategic waterway through which about 20 per cent of global oil passes, as both sides ramp up pressure with talks set to resume.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday, “We’re hopeful there’s a deal”.
“The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things.”
Meanwhile, Iran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, wrote on X that he was meeting in Geneva with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, “for deep technical discussion”.







Grossi later confirmed the meeting on X, calling the conversation with Araghchi “in-depth” ahead of Tuesday’s “important negotiations”.







Protest crackdown
Araghchi is also set to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as other international officials, Iran’s foreign ministry said.
“I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal. What is not on the table: submission before threats,” Araghchi added on X.







Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House confirmed on Sunday.
The latest talks follow repeated threats from Trump of military action against Tehran, first over Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protests, and then more recently over the country’s nuclear programme.
The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.
On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure.
His remarks came before demonstrations outside Iran against its authorities swept a number of cities, including in the US, over the weekend.
‘Viable’ deal
Iran’s deputy foreign minister told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifts sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy.
“If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement,” said Majid Takht-Ravanchi.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that any deal must involve the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran as well as Tehran’s ability to enrich more.
The whereabouts of Iran’s stockpile of around 400 kilogrammes of uranium enriched to 60 per cent remains unknown, with inspectors having last seen it in June.</p><small>2026-02-16 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/161221476e1305a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973639/ttap-says-extending-protest-at-parliament-house-till-tuesday-to-see-govt-response-to-call-for-access-to-imran' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP says extending protest at Parliament House till Tuesday to ‘see govt response’ to call for access to Imran</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The opposition decided on Monday to extend its sit-in at the Parliament House till Tuesday — one of the two court-mandated days for meeting incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan — to “see the government’s response” to their call for allowing access to the former premier.
Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the Supreme Court’s intervention last week led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which said only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye.
This prompted a strong response from opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP), which began a sit-in at the Parliament House for the fulfilment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination.
The protest, which began on Friday, entered its fourth day today, with TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai saying that it would continue till Tuesday.
He shared this information with Dawn hours after a medical report was released following Imran’s examination at the Adiala jail on Sunday.
“We have gone through Imran Khan’s medical report, but we will not be satisfied unless his family and personal physicians are allowed to meet him,” he said, adding that the opposition had asked for Imran’s cousin Dr Nosherwan Barki and other family physicians to be provided access to him.
He also reiterated the opposition’s demand for shifting Imran to Shifa International Hospital, claiming: “We got a commitment from [Interior Minister] Mohsin Naqvi, [Parliamentary Affairs Minister] Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and [Prime Minister’s Assistant on Political Affairs] Rana Sanaullah that Imran Khan will be moved to the hospital.”
But, he continued, the government sent a team to the Adiala jail instead for Imran’s medical examination.
“The government deviated from its commitment,” he claimed.
Earlier in the day, routes to the Parliament House, which were blocked ahead of the sit-in on Friday, were cleared.
Speaking to Dawn in the morning, Yousafzai said it was a surprising step that all the routes had been cleared.
“First of all, we are going to have breakfast after four days, as previously we were eating only dates and biscuits and were being forced to drink tap water. It has been decided to merge the sit-in at the Parliament lodges with the one at Parliament House,” he had added.
The opposition’s sit-in was initially held at three places, including the Parliament House, led by TTAP head Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. The protest outside the Parliament Lodges was led by PTI parliamentarians, while at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, KP CM Sohail Afridi led the demonstration.
The sit-in at the KP House was also ongoing on Monday night, in which KP Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sohail Afridi has also been participating.
Speaking to the media there, he stressed that getting medical treatment under the supervision of his personal physicians and in the presence of his family was Imran’s constitutional right.
“Imran Khan is not an ordinary prisoner. He is a former prime minister and the leader of a major political party,” Afridi said, adding that barring the PTI founder’s family and personal physicians from meeting him was increasing “apprehensions”.
He stressed that the health of Imran Khan was a matter “beyond politics and must be treated accordingly”.
If Imran’s medical report released today was accurate, “there is no justification for denying access to his personal doctors and family”, he said.
On Sunday, a team of doctors examined the PTI founder at Adiala Jail and left the premises after around an hour, sources said.
The party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital.
“We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party.
“We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad,” he told Dawn.</p><small>2026-02-16 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16224547c622ed5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973714/sri-lankas-8-wicket-win-over-australia-leaves-2021-champions-on-brink-of-exit-from-the-tournament' target='_blank'><strong>Sri Lanka’s 8-wicket win over Australia leaves 2021 champions on brink of exit from the tournament</strong></a><br><p>Sri Lanka’s Pathum Nissanka scored the first century of the 2026 T20 World Cup on Monday to put his side into the Super Eights and leave Australia on the brink of elimination.
Nissanka scored 100 not out off 52 balls with five sixes and 10 fours as Sri Lanka, chasing Australia’s 181, reached 184-2 with two overs to spare in Kandy to win by eight wickets.
A victory by Zimbabwe over Ireland in Group B on Tuesday, or against Sri Lanka on Thursday, would eliminate the 2021 champions.
If Zimbabwe lose both, Australia will need to beat Oman in their final match on Friday by a big margin to get through on net run rate.
Nissanka was involved in a 97-run stand off 66 balls with Kusal Mendis for the second wicket with the wicketkeeper-batsman posting his third fifty in the competition.
Nissanka became the first Sri Lankan to score two hundreds in T20 internationals.
After Mendis’s dismissal, Nissanka and Pavan Rathnayake put on 76 off 34 balls to see Sri Lanka to victory.
Nissanka played some glorious cover drives off the spinners and played some elegant flicks against the quicks.
Sri Lanka came into the World Cup after a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of England, but have gained momentum and have won all three games so far.
Australia’s campaign has been plagued by injuries.
Their captain, Mitchell Marsh, who missed the first two games, returned and gave them a rollicking start by scoring 54.
Marsh and Travis Head (56) scored 104 runs off 51 balls for the first wicket.
With Australia eyeing a total in excess of 200, Sri Lanka’s slow bowlers kept them to 181 with leg-spinner Dushan Hemantha picking up 3-37.
Australia collapsed as they looked for quick runs, losing their last six wickets for 21 in 24 balls.</p><small>2026-02-16 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16214624e3caf94.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973712/israel-police-to-deploy-around-al-aqsa-for-ramazan-palestinians-report-curbs' target='_blank'><strong>Israel police to deploy around Al-Aqsa for Ramazan, Palestinians report curbs</strong></a><br><p>Israeli police said on Monday that they would deploy in force around the Al-Aqsa Mosque during the holy month of Ramazan, which begins this week, as Palestinian officials accused Israel of imposing restrictions at the compound.
Over the course of the month of fasting and prayer, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Al-Aqsa — Islam’s third-holiest site, located in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed.
Arad Braverman, a senior Jerusalem police officer, said forces would be deployed “day and night” across the compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, and in the surrounding area.
He said thousands of police personnel would also be on duty for Friday prayers, which draw the largest crowds of worshippers.
Braverman said police had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.
He did not say whether age limits would apply, adding that the final number of people would be decided by the government.
The Palestinian Jerusalem Governorate said in a separate statement it had been informed that permits would again be restricted to men over 55 and women over 50, mirroring last year’s criteria.
It said Israeli authorities had blocked the Waqf — the Jordanian-run body administering the site — from carrying out routine preparations, including installing shade structures and setting up temporary medical clinics.
A Waqf source confirmed the restrictions and said 33 of its employees had been barred from entering the compound in the week before Ramazan.
The Al-Aqsa compound is a central symbol of Palestinian identity and also a frequent flashpoint.
Under long-standing arrangements, Jews may visit the compound, but they are not permitted to pray there.
Israel says it is committed to maintaining this status quo, though Palestinians fear it is being eroded.
Braverman reiterated on Monday that no changes were planned.</p><small>2026-02-16 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16185545dad7be7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973704/x-briefly-hit-by-international-outages-monitors' target='_blank'><strong>X briefly hit by ‘international outages’: monitors</strong></a><br><p>Service was restored to Elon Musk-owned social network X on Monday afternoon after it had failed to show posts to users in many countries.
The site was displaying content, allowing users to post and otherwise functioning normally again around 1530 GMT, after the Downdetector tracking website reported a spike in outage reports around two hours before.
Downdector showed that reports of issues peaked in Pakistan at 6:54pm, with 275 users flagging problems, before slowly tapering down to 8 by 7:54pm.
X had appeared to be suffering “international outages,” connectivity monitor Netblocks posted on the open-source social network Mastodon during the disruption.
The breakdown was “not related to country-level internet disruptions or filtering”, added Netblocks, which regularly flags technical issues with popular online services and sites as well as interference by national governments.
Its most recent posts about similar outages for X came on February 9, the day after the Super Bowl in the US, and February 1.
AFP journalists in countries including France and Thailand had also been unable to access X on Monday afternoon.
Spokespeople for X did not respond to AFP’s request for comment on the outage before service was restored.
Musk laid off thousands of people at the former Twitter and changed its name after buying the service in 2022.
He has since merged it with his xAI company, which develops the Grok chatbot.
xAI is set to in turn be absorbed by Musk’s rocket firm SpaceX, with that merged entity expected to go public as early as summer this year.

The government increased petrol and HSD prices by Rs5 and Rs7.32 per litre, respectively, on Sunday night. The ex-depot price of petrol now stands at Rs258.17 per litre and of HSD at Rs275.70 per litre.
The government said the new prices will continue till the end of February, owing to movement in international market prices.
A statement on the PPP’s website said Marri strongly rejected the federal government’s decision to increase the prices of petroleum products, terming it “unjust and ill-advised” ahead Ramazan.
According to the statement, Marri said that raising the price of petrol and diesel just days before Ramazan “is a highly unfair and unwise move”.
She described the increase as a “petrol bomb” dropped on the public at a time when people were already struggling with “record inflation”.
The PPP lawmaker said, “The government should have focused on providing relief to inflation-hit citizens instead of imposing additional financial burdens.”
“The hike in petroleum prices will severely affect the poor, labourers, and middle class and will trigger a fresh rise in food prices and transportation costs,” she warned.
The statement said Marri highlighted the “contradiction” in the federal government policies.
“On one hand, the government is announcing a Ramazan relief package, while on the other, it is fuelling inflation through price hikes. It is a clear policy failure,” Marri was further quoted as saying.
She urged the government to “concentrate on addressing unemployment, inflation, and the ongoing economic crisis rather than taking decisions that further aggravate public hardship”.
Marri demanded that the government immediately review and withdraw the increase in petroleum prices and take concrete steps to provide real relief to the people.
Meanwhile, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said that raising petrol and diesel prices before Ramazan would “add to inflationary pressure and further strain the budgets of the poor and middle class”.
“I urge the government to reconsider this decision and prioritise meaningful economic relief for the people,” he said.

Mobina Town police said that the fire broke out in the bushes near the university.
Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the rescue service received information about blaze around 4:00pm.
“Initially, two fire tenders were sent. However, due to heavy winds and dry bushes, the fire spread rapidly, engulfing a plant nursery near the varsity,” the rescue spokesperson said.
He said that due to the gravity of the situation, four more fire tenders were dispatched, which managed to extinguish the fire. He said the bushes were at a distance; therefore, no casualties were reported.
He said that the Rescue 1122 recently “rehabilitated” one fire tender at the university and advised them to utilise it in emergency cases to prevent the spread of flames.
Khan recalled that a few months earlier, a huge fire had erupted in the vicinity of the same area, which had claimed the life of one man residing in the area in a makeshift hut.</p><small>2026-02-16 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1620303449c4e9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973692/federal-govt-assures-sc-of-compliance-with-directives-issued-concerning-imran' target='_blank'><strong>Federal govt assures SC of compliance with directives issued concerning Imran</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Monday assured the Supreme Court (SC) that PTI founder Imran Khan had been allowed to speak to his children, adding that the medical examination of the ex-premier was also carried out by an expert team.
Last week, a two-judge SC bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi had instructed the government to form a medical team to examine incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan after a report submitted by his lawyer, Salman Safdar, revealed that the former prime minister had lost 85 per cent of the vision in his right eye. The court had also asked authorities to arrange calls between Imran and his children.
On Monday, the government, through Deputy Attorney General Raja Muhammad Shafqat Abbasi, filed a fresh application in the SC.
The government said it was placing on record the report prepared by the Adiala jail superintendent to highlight the SC’s earlier directions, issued on Aug 24, 2023, in exercise of powers under Article 184 of the Constitution (a provision now scrubbed through the 27th Constitutional Amendment).
“Otherwise, such an order was not germane or in any manner connected with the matter at hand, which arose out of criminal proceedings underway against Imran,” the report said, adding that in deference to the SC, proceedings culminating in the directions issued on Feb 12 were “not objected to”.
In its Aug 24, 2023 order, a three-judge SC bench, headed by then-CJP Umar Ata Bandial, had directed the attorney general for Pakistan to furnish an official report regarding the living conditions of the PTI founder in his jail cell. At that time, Imran was incarcerated at Attock jail.

 

The report submitted on Thursday highlighted that Imran had been given better class prison facilities while efforts were being made by the jail administration to keep his living conditions in line with ‘Better Class’ prisoners under the jail manual.
It said that Imran’s place of confinement at Adiala jail was safe, secure and was properly manned by the prison staff. The jail superintendent and other officers of the jail frequently check the security arrangements in place, the report added.
On the provision of food, the report said that Imran was eating meals of his own choice since being incarcerated. The federal government’s report said that his diet plan consisted of dates, honey, walnuts, coffee, porridge, lassi, milk, chia seeds, orange juice, chicken, mutton, lentils, salad, mixed pickle, dry fruits, and green tea.
The report said that for the purpose of cooking, a labourer had been provided, who prepared meals in a designated kitchen area adjacent to the compound. A separate safe and secure mechanism has been undertaken for purchasing raw material for cooking, the report said.
The report said that Imran was currently confined in a designed compound that comprised seven cells. It said that there was a corridor in front of the cells, which Imran used for walking and exercise. Further, there was an adjacent lawn, where the ex-premier read books and newspapers.
“It is worth mentioning here that keeping in view the increasing population trends in Central Jail, Rawalpindi, as many as 30-35 inmates can be accommodated in the compound where the petitioner is currently housed,” the report said.
The report said that Imran had been provided with a cycling machine, stretching bands, a chin-up rod and other equipment under the orders issued by a special court on October 23, 2023.
It further said that Imran was being provided adequate healthcare facilities, sanitation and toiletries. It said that he was visited by the jail’s medical officers thrice a day, who checked his vitals and recorded the data in his medical record.
It said that a number of consultants from public tertiary care hospitals had also visited Imran, the record of which was available with the jail administration.
The report said that Imran had access to clean and filtered drinking water, and the toilet facilities were also adequate. It said Imran had access to natural light, fresh air and exercise from dawn to dusk and was free to move from early in the morning till night.
The report said that Imran had seasonal clothing, bedding, a hygiene kit, shoes and other articles of day- to-day use. “He has access to all essential items without any restriction,” the report concluded.
SC releases written order
Meanwhile, in a seven-page order on the Feb 12 proceedings, the SC reiterated that the three petitions in the case at hand had become infructuous. These petitions emanated from the same criminal trial in a case pertaining to the concealment of gifts, instituted on a complaint filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) through the district election commissioner, Islamabad.
The order said that though the petitions assail different interlocutory and procedural orders, they stemmed from a common factual and procedural background.
It said that the orders impugned in the first two petitions had merged into the final judgment of a trial court on Aug 5, 2023, which had already been challenged by Imran before the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Similarly, the third petition, concerning the refusal to transfer the case, had also become infructuous by virtue of the final judgment passed by that court, from which the transfer was sought.
The petitioner’s substantive challenge to that final judgment, including the alleged irregularities or illegalities during the trial proceedings, was presently sub judice before IHC in its appellate jurisdiction, the order reminded.
Accordingly, the petitioner retained the right to agitate all his grievances before the appropriate judicial forum, which, in the present circumstances, was the IHC – the appellate court where his appeal against the trial court’s Aug 5, 2023 final judgment was pending adjudication.
“However, in due deference to the earlier orders passed by a three-member SC bench on Aug 23 and 24, 2023, where it was observed that the court would await the decision of the high court before proceeding further in these petitions, we adjourn the present petitions sine die, to be taken up after the decision of the petitioner’s appeal before the high court,” it said.
“In the meantime, if the petitioner has any grievance, the appropriate course will be to first approach the high court, where his appeal is pending adjudication,” the order said.
The written order noted that Imran had “generally expressed satisfaction with the prevailing conditions of his confinement and has not raised any concerns necessitating accommodations beyond the existing level of care”.
“Both reports (friend of the court and jail superintendent) corroborate this finding and are further reinforced by the assurances provided by the attorney general for Pakistan,” the Supreme Court order said.
Accordingly, the concerns of the SC regarding the petitioner’s living conditions in jail, as reflected in the order of Aug 24, 2023, were addressed, and that order was complied with, the order said.
Latif Khosa writes to CJP
Separately, PTI leader Latif Khosa wrote a letter to CJP Afridi on Monday, voicing concerns over the medical examination of Imran in “secrecy” at the Adiala jail on February 15 (Sunday).
In his letter, Khosa raised concerns to this end, identifying himself as a counsel for Imran in a plea pertaining to the Toshakhana case against his client.
He said Imran’s medical examination in “secrecy, without notice to the family or independent doctors, has given rise to serious apprehensions”.
“The continued exclusion of the petitioner’s family and personal medical practitioners from information concerning his health has created unavoidable doubts. Such secrecy not only undermines confidence in the medical process but is also causing unrest and distress among his family members, friends and supporters,” the letter, seen by Dawn, stated.
Khosa underlined in the letter that Imran was 73 years old, and “his advancing age and declining health are matters of grave concern not only for his family but for the people of Pakistan at large”.
“Being one of the most widely supported political leaders in the country, public interest in his wellbeing is natural and unavoidable. Yet, despite this, he remains deprived of basic human necessities during a period when his medical condition demands care and transparency,” he added.
He further said that “for the past few months, reports have surfaced across Pakistan raising serious concerns regarding the deterioration of the petitioner’s eyesight and overall health”.
“These reports, coupled with the continued denial of access to family members, have created deep uncertainty.”
In these circumstances, Khosa continued, the SC was approached for relief and appointed Barrister Salman Safdar as a “friend of the court” on February 10, permitting him to visit Imran in jail.
Barrister Safdar was asked to submit a report detailing Imran’s living conditions and health status after the visit, Khosa recalled, adding that he subsequently submitted the report to the SC on February 11.
“The report confirms that the petitioner has been left with only approximately 15pc vision in his right eye. It further records, particularly paragraph 8, that despite the petitioner’s repeated complaints of blurred and hazardous vision, no timely or adequate medical intervention was undertaken by the jail authorities, which ultimately resulted in complete loss of his vision in one eye,” Khosa claimed in his letter.
Terming these findings “alarming”, Khosa noted that Imran was medically examined at the Adiala jail on Sunday.
“Shockingly, the said examination was carried out in the complete absence of his family members, personal doctors, or legal representatives. No prior intimation was given to them regarding the said medical checkup,” he claimed.
He further brought it to the CJP’s attention that it was being “claimed in certain quarters that the family and party members were informed but voluntarily chose not to attend [the examination]”.
“These assertions are wholly incorrect and unrealistic. At no stage were the petitioner’s family members, personal physicians or counsel were informed. In fact, when the petitioner’s sisters approached the authorities, they were denied access.
“Instead, a panel of handpicked doctors was formed to conduct the examination. The petitioner’s personal doctors, family members, and legal team were denied access,” he maintained.
Khosa highlighted that Imran, on the other hand, had “repeatedly sought access to his personal doctors, namely Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yousaf, for independent examination and treatment of his deteriorating eye condition”.
He also mentioned in the letter that Imran was taken into custody on August 5, 2023 and initially kept at District Jail in Attock. He was moved to the Adiala jail after around three months and had been incarcerated there since.
“Throughout this prolonged period of incarceration, his fundamental and statutory rights have consistently been violated. While earlier his family members and close associates were permitted to meet him in accordance with jail rules, it has now been over four to five months that no meeting has been allowed. His family has effectively been denied access to him,” Khosa complained in the letter.
He requested the CJP to direct the relevant authorities to provide an attested copy of Imran’s medical report of his examination conducted on February 15.

 

The report was released today.
Khosa also sought permission for Imran to be provided immediate access to his personal doctors, including Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yousaf, for his independent medical examination and treatment.
The PTI lawyer further requested the CJP to issue directives for moving Imran to “Al-Shifa Hospital for immediate treatment of his ailment, which clearly cannot be adequately treated within Central Jail, Rawalpindi”.
He also asked the court to “direct that the petitioner’s family members be duly informed and granted reasonable access regarding his medical condition and any future medical condition”.</p><small>2026-02-16 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16195919bcd6fc9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973707/in-meeting-with-naqvi-sri-lankan-president-appreciates-pakistans-support-during-difficult-times' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with Naqvi, Sri Lankan president appreciates Pakistan’s support during ‘difficult times’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a meeting with a delegation from Pakistan on Monday, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appreciated Islamabad’s support during “difficult times”.
The Sri Lankan president shared photos of the meeting held in Colombo on social media platform X, saying that he had met Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Chaudhry Salik Hussain.
“We reaffirmed our enduring friendship [and] appreciated Pakistan’s support to Sri Lanka during difficult times,” the post by Dissanayake said.







He further stated that the “Pakistan delegation conveyed special thanks from Pakistan’s president and prime minister for Sri Lanka’s timely intervention when Pakistan’s participation in the T20 [World Cup] was uncertain”.
Days ahead of the ongoing T20 global showpiece, the Pakistan government had decided that the country’s cricket team would not play against India in the group-stage match.
The decision had come after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
Pakistan withdrew its decision to boycott the India match on February 9, saying: “The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the Bangladesh Cricket Board, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges.”
Ahead of the withdrawal, PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Dissanayake. The Sri Lankan president urged Pakistan to play the match against India, in response to which PM Shehbaz said he would inform him about a “final decision” regarding the match after consultations, state-run PTV News reported.
And after Pakistan announced its decision to play the match, Dissanayake thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.
“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said in a post on X.
Joint strategy against cybercrime, financial fraud mafia
Separately, Pakistan and Sri Lanka agreed to develop a joint strategy against cybercrimes and financial fraud mafias.
The understanding was reached during a meeting of Naqvi with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala.
According to a handout released by the Interior Ministry’s media wing, the meeting focused on strengthening bilateral cooperation and matters of mutual interest.
Both Ministers also discussed ways to enhance cooperation in internal security and joint efforts in counterterrorism and anti-narcotics operations.
‎It was agreed to strengthen institutional collaboration between the interior ministries of Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The two sides also decided to improve coordination to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking.
Matters relating to joint training programs for police and paramilitary forces were also discussed.
Naqvi offered training opportunities for Sri Lankan police officers at the National Police Academy of Pakistan. He stated that officer exchange programs would enhance the professional capacity of forces in both countries and open new avenues of cooperation between the two ministries.
He also emphasised the need to expand collaboration to effectively combat cybercrime and financial crimes. Naqvi also invited the Sri Lankan minister to visit Pakistan and expressed gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to him during his visit.
The Sri Lankan minister welcomed Naqvi, stating that it was a matter of great pleasure for Sri Lanka and affirmed their commitment to promoting cooperation with Pakistan in areas of mutual interest.
Security cooperation
Naqvi also met with Sri Lanka’s Secretary of Defence Air Vice Marshal (Retd.) Sampatha Thuyacontha.
The meeting included discussions on Pakistan–Sri Lanka security cooperation and defence matters. Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to further enhance bilateral security cooperation.
‎The defence secretary acknowledged that Sri Lanka had also been a victim of terrorism and expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s steadfast support to the government in its fight against terrorism.
Naqvi stated that security relations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka had remained strong over the years and reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening security cooperation with Sri Lanka.
Naqvi also met Sri Lankan Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs Sunil Kumara Gamage, with discussions focusing on enhancing cooperation in sports, particularly cricket.
Both sides agreed to strengthen collaboration between the respective sports ministries and promote bilateral cooperation in cricket and other sports.
Naqvi stated that cricket and other sports would further strengthen bilateral relations. He also appreciated the excellent arrangements made during the T20 World Cup and thanked the Sri Lankan authorities for their hospitality.
He extended an invitation to the Sri Lankan sports minister to visit Pakistan.</p><small>2026-02-16 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16183510989dd05.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973703/india-hosts-five-day-ai-summit-as-safety-concerns-grow' target='_blank'><strong>India hosts five-day AI summit as safety concerns grow</strong></a><br><p>A global artificial intelligence summit kicked off in New Delhi on Monday with big issues on the agenda, from job disruption to child safety, although some attendees warned the broad focus could make concrete commitments from world leaders less likely.
While frenzied demand for generative AI has turbocharged profits for many tech companies, anxiety is growing over the risks that it poses to society and the environment.
The five-day AI Impact Summit aims to declare a “shared roadmap for global AI governance and collaboration”.
It is the fourth annual gathering addressing the problems and opportunities posed by AI, after previous international meetings in Paris, Seoul and Britain’s wartime code-breaking hub Bletchley.



Touted as the biggest edition yet, the Indian government is expecting tens of thousands of visitors from across the sector.
That includes 20 national leaders and 45 ministerial-level delegations, who will rub shoulders with tech CEOs, including Sam Altman of OpenAI and Google’s Sundar Pichai.
“The AI Impact Summit will enrich global discourse on diverse aspects of AI, such as innovation, collaboration, responsible use and more,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X.
It is “further proof that our country is progressing rapidly in the field of science and technology”, and “shows the capability of our country’s youth”, added Modi, who was to inaugurate the event later on Monday.







At the busy conference site, panels and roundtables were held on topics ranging from how AI can make India’s treacherous roads safer to how South Asian women are engaging with the technology.
Three ‘sutras’
But whether Modi and the likes of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Brazil’s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will take meaningful steps to hold AI giants accountable is in doubt, said Amba Kak, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute.

 

“Even the much-touted industry voluntary commitments made at these events have largely been narrow ‘self-regulatory’ frameworks that position AI companies to continue to grade their own homework,” she told AFP.
The Bletchley gathering in 2023 was called the AI Safety Summit, but the meetings’ names have changed as they have grown in size and scope.
At last year’s AI Action Summit in Paris, dozens of nations signed a statement calling for efforts to regulate AI tech to make it “open” and “ethical”.
The United States did not sign, with Vice President JD Vance warning that “excessive regulation… could kill a transformative sector just as it’s taking off”.

 

The Delhi summit has the loose themes of “people, progress, planet” — dubbed the three “sutras”. AI safety remains a priority, including the dangers of misinformation such as deepfakes.
“There is real scope for change” although it might not happen fast enough to prevent harm to minors, said AI Asia Pacific Institute director Kelly Forbes, whose organisation is researching how Australia and other countries are requiring platforms to confront the issue.
AI for ‘the many’
Organisers highlight this year’s AI summit as the first hosted by a developing country.
“The summit will shape a shared vision for AI that truly serves the many, not just the few,” India’s IT ministry has said.



Last year India leapt to third place — overtaking South Korea and Japan — in an annual global ranking of AI competitiveness calculated by Stanford University researchers.
But despite plans for large-scale infrastructure and grand ambitions for innovation, experts say the country has a long way to go before it can rival the United States and China.
Globally, AI could threaten jobs in industries from software development and factory work to filmmaking, with India’s large customer service and tech support sectors particularly vulnerable.

 

Shares in the country’s outsourcing firms have plunged in recent days, partly due to advances in AI assistant tools.
Asked about Indian call centres, startup co-founder Peush Bery told AFP at the summit that AI voice tools “will definitely remove that job” within a few years, but that society would evolve to cope.
“New jobs come up, new fields come up”, such as working with data to ensure AI tools can recognise many different accents, Bery said.</p><small>2026-02-16 13:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16171634555899d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973694/people-of-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-living-in-the-stone-age-says-punjab-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>People of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa living in the stone age, says Punjab CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday said that the people of PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were living in the stone age, critising the province’s government for not taking steps for development in the age of technology.
Addressing a laptop distribution scheme at a Gujrat university, CM Maryam highlighted that students in Punjab had access to Honhaar scholarships, laptop schemes, Parwaz Card, green buses and technical training programmes.
“So there is Honhaar here, and incitement there, but this is nothing to rejoice about,” she said, adding that she was extremely upset that the “people of KP were still living in the stone age”.
Maryam stated: “They do not know what development is. They do not realise that Honhaar scholarships also exist if one does not have the resources for their child’s studies.
“They do not know that you must have a gadget or a laptop or an iPad or a computer in your hands if you are to meet global standards in today’s age.”







Indirectly noting that the PTI had been in power in KP for the past “13 years”, she said the public there “does not even know what development is”.
The chief minister quipped that the KP government’s response to every need was that it was providing them “awareness”.
Maryam emphasised that blocking major roads in KP did not affect the businesses in Punjab but rather the economic activity of KP itself.



During her address, Maryam also recalled the time when her mother Kulsoom Nawaz was hospitalised due to cancer in 2017 and 2018, as well as when her father and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif was ill during his imprisonment in 2019.
Noting that Nawaz was in his 70s when he was jailed, the Punjab CM said, “He got sick after multiple heart attacks and his platelets dropped. He had cardiac pain [but] such a joke was made out of his ailment.”
She continued: “When my father and I were in jail, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and her disease was ridiculed so much; it was even said that she was not sick and it is all a drama.”
Maryam then recalled that Kulsoom was on a ventilator in a London hospital when certain individuals “entered the ICU through deception by wearing doctors’ uniforms to verify whether it was true or false”.

 

“When my mother passed away, my father said, ‘One has to die to prove their innocence here’,” she said, adding that she was in a jail cell when Nawaz informed her about Kulsoom’s death.
The PML-N leader then played some old video clips of ex-premier Imran Khan from when he was in power. In the clips, the PTI founder threatened to get the TV and air conditioner removed from the prisons of the PML-N leadership.
Maryam asserted: “I am swearing by God that till today, neither I nor Nawaz Sharif or Shehbaz Sharif even thought of removing his AC or shutting off his food and TV.
“In fact, Nawaz Sharif said one day that he (Imran) has one AC, give him two ACs as he should not face any problems.”







She further said she was the “first woman” to be locked in the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) jail and a cell had to be vacated for her as they did not have a dedicated women’s prison.
The Punjab CM then played another video of ex-PM Imran, wherein he commented on the “long list” of health issues Nawaz was facing.
“You can have differences on policies and policies, but you cannot turn political disagreements into personal enmities,” Maryam emphasised.
“My children, you must never do this,” she told the audience, referring to the actions taken by the PTI government of jailing PML-N leadership and “making fun” of the ailments.

 

“The time circles back, but my father was telling me at dinner the other day to never wish bad for even one’s political opponents,” she said.
“You all must not do what he or his party is doing,” the politician stressed. “Those who are ill, we pray that God may give them recovery soon,” she added.
Speaking on Imran’s current health issues, Maryam said, “The kind of facilities and the doctors he needs are being provided to him, and I am telling you this on oath that no one wishes ill for him.”
She called for lies, accusations, incitement, vandalism and fitna to be “thrown out” of politics.

The statement comes days after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that Imran had only 15pc vision left in his right eye, prompting the apex court to form a medical team to examine him before February 16 (today).
Subsequently, a team of five doctors arrived at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday, where the ex-premier is incarcerated, and carried out a detailed eye examination, took blood samples and checked his blood pressure. However, the PTI rejected the check-up conducted without his family and personal physicians.
Addressing Bar Association Ferozewala in Punjab’s Shahdara on Monday, Tarar referred to the “latest report that had to be submitted” regarding Imran’s health.

 

The minister added that he discussed it with Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan and the “relevant” individuals before coming to the bar association.
Tarar stated: “They said thanks to God, the examination was carried out again on the Supreme Court’s order and there is no such thing about 35 or 25 [per cent].
“If he uses glasses for his eyesight, then one eye is approximately 70pc fine and the other eye is 6/6. There is nothing as such to worry about.”
According to the Cleveland Clinic, having 6/6 vision or 20/20 vision means you see the world with normal clarity and sharpness.
Before commenting on Imran’s health, Tarar stressed the need to “pay attention to our national issues”.
“We took difficult financial decisions, but the fruits of those can be seen now,” he stated, asserting that Pakistan was now “performing way better economically”.
The law minister stressed that political stability was crucial for economic stability. “There is a lot of noise these days that what is about happen and what has been done to the PTI founder,” he noted.
Addressing the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, Tarar said it was the “first time that a government was taking official measures to deprive the citizens of their rights”.
He then referred to the blockades of major roads and KP’s entry and exit points by PTI protests, which have cut off the province from the rest of the country.

 

“Article 15 [of the Constitution] allows freedom of movement, but the blockage of motorways and GT Road on the official level is unconstitutional,” the law minister pointed out.
He expressed the hope that the PTI would “rectify” the situation itself after looking at the latest report. “Otherwise, the federal government will have to take some action,” Tarar warned.
He further said it was the responsibility of PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, as well as the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, to “ensure that the KP government adheres to the Constitution”.
Imran’s physician urges authorities to allow access
Meanwhile, Imran’s long-time personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf released a video statement, saying that last night he spoke on the telephone to the two Islamabad-based eye doctors who were treating the ex-premier for his eye condition.
He said he asked his colleague, Dr Khurram Azam Mirza, a Lahore-based retinal specialist, to join the phone call.







Dr Yusuf said that the phone call lasted 40 minutes, during which the doctors provided a background of when they first examined Imran, what his symptoms were, details of the treatment prescribed and what the future treatment plan.
“Their latest assessment was yesterday afternoon … they told us that, in their view, Imran had shown significant improvement as a result of treatment and his vision had improved significantly as well,” he said.
“I would be extremely happy if I was able to confirm that this was the case. Unfortunately, because I have not seen him myself and have not been able to participate in his care or talk to him, I am unable to either confirm or deny the veracity of what we have been told,” he said.
Dr Yusuf appealed to the authorities to allow him or Dr Faisal Sultan, ideally both of them, and physicians nominated by Imran’s family to examine the ex-premier and participate in his care.
He also called for Imran to be treated at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, saying that it was “appropriately equipped and of a suitable standard” for treating the PTI founder.
CRVO in Imran’s right eye
Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 10, last week submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living conditions in the prison.
In his report, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6/6 vision in both eyes”.
While his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yusuf had previously been permitted access, “despite repeated requests and a deteriorating ocular condition, no such access was allowed during the relevant period”, the ex-premier was quoted as saying.
A medical report dated February 6 — signed by Pims Executive Director Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander and addressed to the Adiala jail administration — was also submitted to the SC.

 

It stated that a qualified ophthalmologist from Pims conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiala jail of Imran and a “diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made”.
This was then followed by Imran undergoing medical treatment at Pims.
The ex-premier’s family and the PTI have been demanding that he be moved to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital for a comprehensive check-up, with the opposition even staging a sit-in at Parliament House for the past four days.</p><small>2026-02-16 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/161127565ccf8f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973643/bears-wipe-out-over-5000-points-from-kse-100-as-index-closes-in-the-red' target='_blank'><strong>Bears wipe out over 5,000 points from KSE-100 as index closes in the red</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) benchmark index, the KSE-100, closed in the red, down 5,149.80 points from its previous close.

Field Marshal Munir made the remarks during a meeting with the Deputy Ruler of Abu Dhabi and National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, during which they discussed “ways to further strengthen bilateral cooperation across various sectors, particularly in the fields of economic collaboration, investment and security,” according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The two leaders also “exchanged views on regional developments and emphasised the importance of continued coordination to promote peace and stability in the region,” ISPR added.
Field Marshal Munir, during the meeting, “expressed his sincere appreciation and gratitude to the government of the UAE for its longstanding investments and continued support to Pakistan’s economy and security over the decades”.
As per ISPR, the army chief “noted that such support reflects the deep-rooted historical relations between the two brotherly countries and commended the constructive role of the UAE leadership in advancing economic and social development in Pakistan”.
During the meeting, the field marshal reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to continuing joint efforts to “further strengthen this partnership in all fields, in a manner that serves the interests of both brotherly peoples and contributes to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region”.
Pakistan and UAE maintain close bilateral relations. Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a telephone call with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, lauding the Gulf country’s “consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan”.
Last month, Field Marshal Munir met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at Qasr Al Shati Palace, where the two reviewed bilateral cooperation between the two countries.</p><small>2026-02-16 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16135912c7fa581.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973657/at-least-2-killed-17-injured-in-explosion-near-police-station-in-kps-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>At least 2 killed, 17 injured in explosion near police station in KP’s Bannu</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: At least two people were killed and 17 others injured in a powerful explosion near Miryan Police Station in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Monday.
According to a statement by the police, the blast occurred when a time bomb planted in a motorcycle detonated. A child was among those killed in the explosion.
Police sources said the blast took place near shops located in front of the station. Although police personnel remained unharmed, civilians in the vicinity were caught in the blast. Several of the injured are reported to be in critical condition.
Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) spokesperson, Muhammad Noman Khattab, stated that the victims were brought to District Headquarters Hospital and Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital.
Rescue 1122 officials said emergency teams promptly reached the scene and moved the bodies and injured to nearby hospitals.
Following the incident, a heavy contingent of the Bannu police reached the scene, along with the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) and the Quick Response Force (QRF).
Police and security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search operation, added the police statement. Evidence is being collected and an investigation has been initiated.
The BDS team also engaged in clearing the affected site “to ensure timely and effective prevention of any possible further threat”, the police statement said.
Meanwhile, Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan visited the hospital and enquired after the injured, it said.
Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security forces coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.
In January, two boys were injured in an explosion in the Domel area of Bannu, one of whom succumbed to his injuries after two weeks.
Earlier that month, the former nazim of Domel, Fida Muhammad Khan Wazir, was injured in a bomb blast outside his office.</p><small>2026-02-16 09:56</small></div><hr>
