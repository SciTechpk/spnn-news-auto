<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01214650139f87b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945831/us-senate-rejects-plan-to-end-government-shutdown' target='_blank'><strong>US Senate rejects plan to end government shutdown</strong></a><br><p>Efforts to bring a quick end to the US government shutdown floundered Wednesday when senators rejected a plan to resolve an acrimonious funding stand-off between President Donald Trump and Democrats in Congress.
With the government out of money after Trump and lawmakers failed to agree on a deal to keep the lights on, many federal departments and agencies have been closed since midnight.
Senate Democrats — who are demanding extended health care subsidies for low income families — refused to help the majority Republicans approve a House-passed bill that would have reopened the government for several weeks while negotiations continue.
Around 750,000 public sector workers are expected to be placed on furlough — a kind of enforced leave, with pay withheld until they return to work.
Essential workers such as the military and border agents may be forced to work without pay and some will likely miss pay checks next week.
Shutdowns are a periodic feature of gridlocked Washington, although this is the first since a record 35-day pause in 2019, when Trump was in his first term. They are unpopular because multiple services used by ordinary voters, from national parks to permit applications, become unavailable.
This time, the shutdown comes against a darker backdrop, with Trump racing to enact hard-right policies, including slashing entire government departments.
The White House is threatening to turn many of the furloughs into mass firings.
“A lot of good can come down from shutdowns,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn’t want. They’d be Democrat things.”
Democrats — motivated by grassroots anger over the expiring health care subsidies for low-income families and Trump’s dismantling of government agencies — have been withholding Senate votes to fund the government as leverage to try and force negotiations.
No compromise
Republicans in the House of Representative have already passed a stop-gap funding fix to keep federal functions running through late November while a longer-term plan is thrashed out.
But the 100-member Senate does not have the 60 votes required to send it to Trump’s desk, and Democrats say they won’t help unless Republicans compromise on their planned spending cuts — especially in health care.
“It’s the job of senators on both sides of the aisle to come together,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer told CNN.
“And here’s what we hope now — that the Republicans have seen they don’t have the votes.”
With no compromise on the table, both plans were expected to fail again.
Talks that have taken place so far have been unusually bitter, with Trump mocking Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on social media.
Senate Republican leaders, who have just one rebel in their own ranks, need eight Democrats to join the majority and rubber-stamp the House-passed bill.
They got three moderates to cross the aisle in an initial vote Tuesday and were hoping to peel off five more as the shutdown chaos starts to bite. But Wednesday’s result went exactly the same way.
Democrats will be acutely aware however that the party trying to force policy changes by holding back votes on government funding has usually failed in the past.
“Chuck Schumer, at the behest of a bunch of liberal far-left activist groups, has walked his Democrat colleagues into a box canyon. There’s no way out, folks,” Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters at the US Capitol.
Congress is out Thursday for the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday but the Senate returns to work on Friday and may be in session through the weekend. The House is not due back until next week.</p><small>2025-10-01 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01211615e1a5b18.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945870/mobile-and-internet-restored-across-afghanistan-afp-journalists' target='_blank'><strong>Mobile and internet restored across Afghanistan: AFP journalists</strong></a><br><p>Mobile networks and the internet were restored across Afghanistan on Wednesday, 48 hours after the Taliban authorities shut down telecommunications.
Confusion gripped the South Asian country on Monday night when mobile phone service and the internet went down without warning, freezing businesses and cutting Afghans off from the rest of the world.
The massive blackout came weeks after the government began cutting high-speed internet connections to some provinces to prevent “immorality”, on the orders of shadowy supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.
AFP journalists reported on Wednesday that mobile phone signals and wifi had returned to provinces across the country, including Kandahar in the south, Khost in the east, central Ghazni, and Herat in the west.
The Taliban government has yet to comment on the telecommunications shutdown.
On Wednesday night, hundreds of Afghans poured onto the streets in the capital Kabul, spreading the word that the internet was back.
“It’s like Eidul Azha; it’s like preparing to go for prayer,” said 26-year-old Sohrab Ahmadi, a delivery driver.
“We are very happy from the bottom of our hearts.”
After days of tension, Afghans celebrated by buying sweets and balloons, as drivers honked their horns, phones pressed to their ears.
“The city is alive again,” Mohammad Tawab Farooqi, a restaurant manager in the city told AFP.
Businesses, airports, banks closed
It is the first time since the Taliban government won their insurgency in 2021 and imposed a strict version of Islamic law that communications have been cut in the country.
Netblocks, a watchdog organisation that monitors cybersecurity and internet governance, said the blackout “appears consistent with the intentional disconnection of service”.
It said connectivity had slowed to one per cent of ordinary levels.
A government official warned AFP minutes before the shutdown on Monday evening that the fibre optic network would be cut, affecting mobile phone services, “until further notice”.
There were widespread closures of businesses, airports, and markets, while banks and post offices were unable to operate.
Afghans were unable to contact each other in or out of the country, and many families stopped their children from going to school during the uncertainty.
Those living in Herat and Kandahar travelled to border towns to catch signals from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan.
The United Nations said on Tuesday the shutdown “left Afghanistan almost completely cut off from the outside world”, and called on authorities to restore access.
Internet connections have been extremely slow or intermittent over the past weeks.
On September 16, when the first internet services were first cut in northern provinces, Balkh provincial spokesman Attaullah Zaid said the ban had been ordered by the Taliban’s leader.
“This measure was taken to prevent vice, and alternative options will be put in place across the country to meet connectivity needs,” he wrote on social media.
“Recent studies in Afghanistan found that internet applications have badly affected the ongoing, economic, cultural and religious foundations of society,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-01 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01125217dc59b6f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945833/10-terrorists-killed-during-ctd-operation-in-quetta-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>10 terrorists killed during CTD operation in Quetta: spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>At least ten terrorists were killed in Quetta’s Aghbarg area during an exchange of fire with security personnel from the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD), a spokesperson said on Wednesday.
“Ten terrorists were killed during an exchange of fire between them and the CTD team in the Aghbarg neighbourhood of Quetta,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
“CTD carried out the operation after receiving a tip-off from intelligence agencies,” he said, adding that “upon reaching the area, they were attacked by the terrorists but promptly retaliated.”
“Heavy ammunition and weapons were recovered from the slain terrorists,” as per the statement.
The spokesperson said that the “terrorists had previously been involved in attacking security forces and belonged to a banned terrorist outfit.”
“The slain terrorists have not yet been identified,” the spokesperson said, adding that their “bodies have been transferred to a hospital for identification purposes.”
“Further investigation into the matter is underway,” the statement said.
The Inter-Services Public Relations confirmed that 10 terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij were killed in a separate statement.
The development comes a day after 10 people, including four security personnel, were martyred in a suicide car blast near the headquarters of the Frontier Corps (FC) in Quetta.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.</p><small>2025-10-01 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01175454d029cfd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945859/so-far-so-good-aurangzeb-says-talks-with-imf-headed-in-right-direction' target='_blank'><strong>‘So far, so good’: Aurangzeb says talks with IMF headed in right direction</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday said that talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were headed in the “right direction”.
An IMF mission led by Iva Petrova held a formal kick-off meeting with Pakistan’s economic team to review the implementation of the EFF and RSF. The programme’s performance as of the end of June this year — the period under review — has been mixed.
The start of the next review period, ending December this year, has also been off the mark, particularly in revenue collection. The two sides now have to agree on corrective measures during their dialogue to meet the next biannual targets.
Today, Aurangzeb spoke to reporters as he left a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue in Islamabad. The minister told reporters that the $7.1 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the $1.1bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) were being reviewed.
“So far, so good,” he said. The EFF is undergoing its second review, while the RSF is being reviewed for the first time.
When asked about the reviews and whether they will conclude by October 8, Aurangzeb said: “Whatever discussions are happening, they are moving in the right direction.”
Additionally, Aurangzeb also spoke about the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) recording a shortfall of Rs198bn in the first quarter of the fiscal year.
“We want to get FBR tax to gross domestic product (GDP) of 11 per cent by the end of this fiscal year,” he said. “We want to remain very committed to that target. As you know, there are certain pending court cases … let’s see how the court decides and that can help bridge some of this gap.”
 


Pakis­tan and the IMF reached a three-year, $7bn aid package deal in July last year, giving much-needed respite to the nation. The new programme aimed to enable Pakistan to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
In May this year, the IMF board approved a fresh $1.4 billion loan to help Pakistan strengthen its economic resilience to climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters. However, the disbursement of funds is contingent upon successful completion of reviews under the EFF, an IMF official said.
The opening session of the IMF talks which kicked off on Monday was attended by key economic stakeholders, including the State Bank of Pakistan governor, finance secretary and chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
While power sector benchmarks for the end-June 2025 period were comfortably met, revenue collection fell short by about Rs1.2 trillion — almost 1pc of GDP — in the last fiscal year, and the first two months of the current fiscal year have shown similar shortfalls.
The mission will remain in Pakistan for almost two weeks and will also hold forward-looking discussions with the authorities to push for faster implementation of the end-December 2025 targets.
Upon the successful completion of the review, Pakistan will be eligible for the disbursement of about $1bn (760 million Special Drawing Rights) by the end of next month.</p><small>2025-10-01 15:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011822042632f6f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945861/4-terrorists-apprehended-in-intelligence-based-operation-in-khuzdar-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>4 terrorists apprehended in intelligence-based operation in Khuzdar: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Four terrorists were apprehended during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district on Wednesday, a statement released by the military’s media affairs wing said.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted an IBO on the reported presence of “terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan”.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups such as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own forces apprehended four [terrorists] trying to flee cowardly by disguising in women’s attire,” the ISPR said.
“Weapons and ammunition was also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” it added.
The ISPR further said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, adding that security forces were determined to wipeout the “menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice”.
Meanwhile, security forces carried out an IBO in Balochistan’s Kech District, where a terrorist hideout was busted and three Indian sponsored terrorists belonging to Fitna al Hindustan were successfully neutralised, the ISPR said.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the [dead] khwarij and terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” the military media wing said in a statement.
“[The] security forces of Pakistan are determined to eliminate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism and their facilitators to justice.”
Earlier, the ISPR said that an IBO had been carried out in Quetta district, in which 10 terrorists were killed.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti congratulated security personnel on the successful IBOs in the province today.
“Security forces conducted two successful operations against terrorists operating under Indian patronage,” he said in a statement, adding that 13 terrorists had been killed.
“Security forces thwarted the evil intentions of terrorists, [and] the sacrifices of the forces for establishing peace in Balochistan are unforgettable.”
Bugti said that operations in Balochistan would continue “until the complete elimination of terrorists operating under Indian patronage”.
Last week, security forces killed 17 “India-sponsored” terrorists during an IBO in Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

“In the past few days, such questions have been raised that now a dialogue has begun, which, in our understanding, is not appropriate. It is neither beneficial for politics, nor for democracy,” he said at a press conference in Lahore.
“And this is our [PPP’s] view, not a suggestion to anyone,” he added.
The PPP and PML-N continued to engage in a war of words over flood relief, as PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asserted that the BISP was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by the recent floods in the country, while PML-N’s Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz accused his party of “politicising” the issue.
Furthermore, the tensions between the ruling coalition partners on Tuesday flared in parliament as the PPP lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest CM Nawaz’s diatribe against their party.
“This is the first time that we decided to help the government without taking ministries in the government … without sharing power in the executive,” Kaira said at the press conference.
“We did this so that the government, with unity, could resolve the country’s problems, and we could support it,” he added.
He continued that his party would support the federal government in every possible way.
“[We have] supported it on every issue, when Pakistan was at war we supported it, in assemblies we supported it, we supported legislation, we did no favour; we do not keep count of favours. We did this thinking that we must find solutions to the country’s crises. Otherwise, there were formulas for power sharing, formulas for terms … many formulas were discussed.”
However, he added that the purpose was not to give the federal government “a blank cheque that whatever it does, whatever the PML-N does, we will support it“.
“If our opinion proved better, they would accept it; if their views proved better, we would accept it. Otherwise, we would come to a middle ground and find a compromise, that is the method. We have tried this so far and will continue to do so.”
But he regretted that in the “last few days, a two-way dialogue began and on one side of that dialogue are some colleagues of the PPP and on the other side, the Punjab government”.
He said the recent floods caused immense damage, people’s homes were looted, crops destroyed, and human lives as well as livestock were lost.
“Wherever there was any mistake, or where we thought there might be a better way to do the work, we gave our suggestions; if our suggestions were not accepted, we criticised [the move]; if we were not heard, we protested — this is our democratic right. And this is also the way.
“If you do not accept it, if you do not want to do that, then fine, but we will tell the people of Punjab, we too are Punjabis. We will tell the people of Punjab that in our view this crisis has both immediate and long-term solutions. We will present our ways based on our experience.”
Criticising CM Maryam’s remarks, he said: “Now if we give our suggestions and you do not listen and if we criticise [you], you say that you will not allow anyone to speak … and that if a finger is raised here, you will break it and you will not spare them.
“We only offered ways to deal with the floods, but in response, the Sindh government was targeted. Some objections were very painful. We were accused of an electricity subsidy [and] other matters.”
We know the present government is not at fault, but there are certain objections. The PPP chairman said that on the devastation caused by the floods, people must be given immediate relief, and that can be done through the BISP. That is a tried and tested method we have, and the other thing is that [you] should declare an agricultural emergency.”
He continued that the BISP has now become a subject of debate; some want money to be disbursed through it, others do not.
“So the cash grant under BISP is for immediate relief; it provides initial relief. And this is not the first time we have done this in 2023, 2022, 2010, 2011; such amounts were used for the flood-affected people. You did not accept that idea, that’s okay. We only give you our opinion.”</p><small>2025-10-01 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0118563781c0706.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945863/us-offers-security-guarantees-to-qatar-after-israel-strikes-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>US offers security guarantees to Qatar after Israel strikes: White House</strong></a><br><p>The United States will regard “any armed attack” on Qatari territory as a threat to Washington and will provide the Gulf Arab state with security guarantees, the White House said, after an Israeli strike on the country last month.
“In light of the continuing threats to the State of Qatar posed by foreign aggression, it is the policy of the United States to guarantee the security and territorial integrity of the State of Qatar against external attack,” said an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump on Monday.
In the event of an attack on Qatar, the United States will “take all lawful and appropriate measures — including diplomatic, economic, and, if necessary, military — to defend the interests of the United States and of the State of Qatar and to restore peace and stability,” the order said.
The agreement comes after an Israeli strike on the key US regional ally on September 9, targeting officials from Hamas who were discussing a US peace proposal to end the conflict in Gaza.
 
 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Qatar’s prime minister from the White House on Monday, apologising for strikes and promising not to do so again, the United States said. Netanyahu was in Washington to meet Trump, and had until then been defiant since ordering the September 9 strikes.
Qatar is a key US ally in the Gulf and hosts the largest US military base in the region at Al-Udeid, which also includes a regional headquarters for elements of US Central Command.</p><small>2025-10-01 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01184830efcfb1c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945837/islamabad-court-recalls-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-as-imaan-mazari-husband-appear-before-judge' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court recalls non-bailable arrest warrants as Imaan Mazari, husband appear before judge</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad District and Sessions Court on Wednesday recalled the non-bailable arrest warrants issued against human rights defenders and lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha after the two appeared in court.
Arrest warrants had been issued for the two lawyers yesterday for failing to appear before the court in a case related to controversial tweets. A junior lawyer informed the court that Mazari and Chattha had left for another appearance in Rawalpindi after marking their attendance earlier in the day.
The case was heard by Judge Mohammad Afzal Majoka, with police deployed outside the courtroom for tight security.
While the couple appeared in court today, they did not respond with a confirmation or denial when the charge sheet against them was read out.
“We will hire lawyers and can respond to the court regarding this after that,” Chattha said. “We have filed a new application regarding our documents … No indictment can be made until this application is decided.”
The accused had earlier applied to obtain their written statements submitted before the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) under Section 161 (examination of witnesses) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and other documents. Section 161 deals with the power of the police to examine witnesses orally during an investigation and to reduce their statements into writing.
Judge Majoka then directed the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to provide the documents to both the lawyers and adjourned the hearing until 11:30am.
When the hearing resumed, Judge Majoka issued an order on the accused couple’s miscellaneous application for the documents.
Former Islamabad High Court Bar president Riasat Ali Azad, along with Islamabad Bar Association President Naeem Gujjar and its ex-president Qaiser Imam, also appeared before the court.
The prosecution had initially expressed ignorance about the written statements, but once the judge began dictating the order, the statements were handed over to Mazari and Chattha.
Subsequently, the two decided to challenge the trial proceedings till the current stage of framing of charges and their lawyers requested additional time from the court. The request was accepted, and the hearing was adjourned until October 7.
Last week, Mazari filed a grievance letter over “inaction” on her workplace harassment complaint against Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar.
On September 11, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements in reaction and called for the judge’s dismissal from the post of the IHC top judge.
Mazari had also approached an inquiry committee of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against Justice Dogar.</p><small>2025-10-01 13:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011716561575ef1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945855/competition-commission-of-pakistan-approves-ptcls-acquisition-of-telenor-with-conditions' target='_blank'><strong>Competition Commission of Pakistan approves PTCL’s acquisition of Telenor with conditions</strong></a><br><p>The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has approved Pakistan Telecommunications Limited’s (PTCL) acquisition of mobile carrier Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers shareholdings, according to a press release issued on Wednesday.
According to the telecommunication company’s website, one of its subsidiaries is mobile carrier Ufone. As part of the deal, Telenor and Ufone will merge.
 
 

According to the press release, the merger was announced today at a press conference at the CCP’s head office. CCP Chairman Dr Kabir Ahmed Sidhu, CCP Registrar and Head of Legal Ambreen Abbasi and members Salman Amin and Shahzad Hussain shared the key highlights of the agreement.
“They explained that [the] CCP conducted a comprehensive review of the merger transaction,” the press release read. “The review examined market structure, concentration levels, efficiencies, and potential competition risks.”
Dr Sidhu emphasised that the commission’s decision “ensures a level playing field for all telecom operators and safeguards consumer interests”.
“The merger aims to enhance service quality, expand product offerings and accelerate technological innovation, including the rollout of 5G,” he was quoted as saying.
“The CCP [has] studied various international precedents, including orders from the United States, United Kingdom and European Union, involving similar transactions before granting approval.”
According to the press release, Abbasi explained that the assessment considered possibly lessening competition in the relevant sub-markets, market shares and efficiency claims. She underlined that the merger was approved conditionally, with safeguards designed to prevent anti-competitive conduct.
Some of the key conditions listed in the press release were:

PTCL and the merged entity will maintain separate boards and independent management structures.
Chief executive officers and senior management must meet strict competency and integrity requirements, with UAE-based telecom company Etisalat ensuring professional leadership.
An independent third-party will monitor compliance, audit transactions, and submit quarterly reports to CCP for five years.
Related party transactions and cross-subsidisation will be prohibited unless
conducted competitively and at arm’s length.
Non-discriminatory access will be applied to capacity and infrastructure for all operators. PTCL and MergeCo shall submit all its existing and future Reference Interconnect Offers (RIO) to the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) for approval. PTCL shall offer interconnection to all operators in accordance with RIO as approved by the PTA.
PTCL shall seek the PTA’s approval for its wholesale pricing structure in relation to IP Bandwidth, LDI, Domestic Leased Line and telecom infrastructure services provided to PTA licensees, as well as associated companies including MergeCo. PTCL shall not set predatory retail prices.
Mandatory compliance will be ensured with service quality standards, innovation policies and PTA tariff approvals.
PTCL and Telenor must demonstrate that claimed efficiencies are passed on to consumers through better services, pricing and infrastructure investments.
The CCP reserves the right to direct divestiture of assets or business segments in case of future violations.

In the press release, Amin was quoted as saying that these conditions are specifically aimed at preventing favouritism, predatory pricing and barriers to market entry, while ensuring continued regulatory oversight by the CCP and PTA.
Last week, the CCP raised concerns over PTCL’s non-cooperation and delay in providing critical information for evaluating the merger, with the watchdog citing potential competition risks and warned of cross-subsidisation between PTCL and Ufone, both of which operate under joint management.</p><small>2025-10-01 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0114524624df35a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945844/have-never-apologised-to-bcci-nor-will-i-ever-do-so-mohsin-naqvi-hits-back-at-indian-media-reports' target='_blank'><strong>‘Have never apologised to BCCI nor will I ever do so’: Mohsin Naqvi hits back at Indian media reports</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Asia Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday refuted claims by Indian media that he had apologised to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the trophy handover issue at Sunday’s Asia Cup final.
The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from the ACC chief, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. Subsequently, Indian skipper Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup.
Later, Indian media alleged that Naqvi had himself refused to hand the trophy over to the Indian team.
Today, several Indian outlets, including IndiaToday, Financial Express and Hindustan Times, reported that Naqvi had now apologised to the BCCI, but that he still refused to hand them the trophy.
Responding to an India Today post about their report on social media platform X, Naqvi stated, “Indian media thrives on lies, not facts. Let me make it absolutely clear: I have done nothing wrong and I have never apologised to the BCCI nor will I ever do so.”
He called the claims “fabricated nonsense” and “cheap propaganda”, saying it was aimed at misleading Indian people.
The PCB chairman slammed India for continuing to “drag politics into cricket, damaging the very spirit of the game”.
“As ACC chairman, I was ready to hand over the trophy that very day and I am still ready now,” he said. “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.”
 






During the Asia Cup, Naqvi had previously expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” from the Indian side after Yadav seemingly politicised the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May.
Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention. Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The PCB had lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Yadav’s remarks, leading to him reportedly being fined 30 per cent of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct.
Meanwhile, pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were also reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against India.
Following the final, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on winning the match, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor.
Naqvi had also responded to Modi’s post on X, saying: “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”.
“Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he had said.

According to the United Nations’ International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef), Pakistan is home to over 19 million child brides, with nearly 1 in 6 young women married before the age of 18 and as many as 4.8m girls married before the age of 15.
“In view of the fact that the alleged detenue has attained puberty and appears to have given free and voluntary consent, she shall be at liberty to reside with the petitioner,” read a verdict issued by Justice Muhammad Azam Khan for a hearing held on July 11.
The verdict was issued on a plea filed by Muhammad Riaz, challenging a June 23 order by an Islamabad-East district judge that denied the recovery of the girl after her family members allegedly “forcibly” took her away from the man’s house on June 21.
According to the order, the birth certificate, which was registered after the marriage, said the girl was aged 15 at the time of solemnisation of her Nikkah on May 30. However, the Nikahnama “vaguely records her age as ‘almost 18 years’”, and the court noted it was not empowered to “conclusively decide the question of age”.
 
 

The girl was presented before the court on July 11, when she “unequivocally
affirmed that she had contracted marriage with the petitioner of her own choice and expressed her desire to reside with him, explicitly declining to return to her parents”, the order stated.
“It is noteworthy that even during her stay at the Crisis Centre, Islamabad, she has consistently maintained this position.”
Justice Khan observed that the trial court “overlooked” that the petitioner’s counsel had highlighted that there was “great apprehension to the life, honour and dignity of the detenue” if she remained in the custody of the respondents.
Justice Khan noted that while a marriage wherein either or both of the parties were under 18 was “not void under the Shariah, it is nonetheless punishable by law and treated as contrary to public policy, especially where it undermines the minor’s physical, emotional, and educational development”.
The order delved into the legal definitions of “child”, “child marriage” and “child abuse”, and considered various questions, including whether a marriage “valid under the Islamic law/Shariah can be considered void under the statutory law, particularly in light of the Act of 2025”.
 
 

The IHC order also mentioned the Islamabad Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025 (ICMRA) passed in May, which raised the minimum marriage age for girls from 16 years to 18 years.
However, the judge pointed out that the ICMRA “does not render the marriage itself void” but has been “enacted merely to punish the party contracting, arranging and/or solemnising a marriage with a child”.
“This bifurcation, where the marriage is considered valid under one body of law but criminal under another, creates a legal paradox that risks frustrating the very objective of the statute, which is to act as a deterrent against child marriages and protect minors from premature unions that could harm their physical, emotional, and educational well-being,” Justice Khan wrote.
On the question of whether child marriage would fall within the definition of
Sections 375 and 377A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and thereby constitute “rape”, the judge observed that prior precedents do not consider consummation within such a marriage as “rape”. The “element of lawful relationship and consent within marriage fundamentally distinguishes” underage marriages from rape cases, he added.
The petitioner’s counsel, Advocate Shumaila Rafique Awan, cited previous Supreme Court orders from 1970 and 2021 to “assert that the marriage contracted is valid under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO, 1961), therefore, the petitioner has the right to recover his wife and protect their lawful union”.
Advocate Mirza Irfan Ghazanfar, the counsel for two of the respondents, contended that the earlier order did not “call for any interference” and that the girl was not sui juris (of age) at the time of the Nikkah.
The respondents’ lawyers, as per the order, cited a 2022 IHC ruling to “contend that marriages contracted between a minor and an adult are considered void ab initio, as the same constitute a criminal offence under the Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929”.
Legal clarity urgently needed to ‘safeguard minors from harm’
Despite constitutional protections, disparities in legal marriage age persist across provinces, with only Sindh and the Islamabad Capital Territory enforcing 18 as the minimum age for girls — a gap that continues to expose millions to early pregnancies, domestic violence, and educational exclusion.
Given the sensitive nature of the case, the court made “certain recommendations in aid of legislative clarity and institutional consistency”.
These included urging the federal government to undertake a legislative review to get rid of “inconsistencies across various statutes qua the
determination of age”.
 
 

“It is recommended that the federal government adopt a clear statutory
stance regarding the marriage contracted involving minors, even if they
have attained puberty and show signs of mental maturity. It is necessary
to do so in order to protect children of tender age.
“To uphold Constitutional rights and safeguard minors from harm, statutory clarity is urgently needed,” the judgment stressed.
The judge listed various discrepancies in different statutes, including the PPC, Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979, Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939, Guardian & Wards Act 1890, Majority Act 1875, National Commission on the Rights of Child Act 2017, Juvenile Justice System Act 2018, and the Islamabad Capital Territory Child Protection Act 2018.
Justice Khan strongly recommended that the federal government “launch a sustained and comprehensive awareness campaign to educate citizens, public officials, Nikkah registrars, and community leaders about the harmful consequences and legal implications of child marriages”.
The judge stressed that the district administration and licence-issuing authorities shall ensure that all Nikkah registrars are fully informed about the provisions and penal consequences under the ICMRA, and that they must be trained to “strictly avoid solemnising or registering any marriage involving a
minor”.
 
 

To prevent the registration of underage marriages, Justice Khan called on the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) and relevant marriage registration authorities to integrate the Birth Registration Certificate into their systems, ensuring verification of age before issuing a Marriage Certificate.
The court further directed that “all Guardian Courts, Family Courts, and Courts exercising jurisdiction under Section 491 [of the Code of Criminal Procedure] must engage Child Protection Officers (CPOs) under the Islamabad Child
Protection Act 2018 to conduct a statutory welfare assessment”.
“The CPO’s report should be treated as an essential aid in determining
custody, care, or marital status of the minor,” the order added, emphasising that the approach would ensure child-centric, evidence-based decision-making in line with Constitutional protections under Articles 9 (security of person), 14 (inviolability of dignity), 25 (equality of citizens), and 35 (protection of family, etc).
The judge also urged that “all courts dealing with cases involving alleged child marriages adopt a participatory, protective and trauma-informed approach, one that treats the minor not merely as a subject of parental or spousal authority, but as a rights-bearing individual whose voice must guide
the inquiry and whose welfare must define the outcome”.
In view of the recommendations, the judge ordered that copies of the judgment be sent to the law, human rights and interior ministries, the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, the Islamabad chief commissioner, the Nadra director general, the Council of Islamic Ideology (CCI) secretary, as well as all district and sessions judges.</p><small>2025-10-01 11:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011626285738823.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945848/more-ingredients-for-life-discovered-in-ocean-on-saturn-moon' target='_blank'><strong>More ingredients for life discovered in ocean on Saturn moon</strong></a><br><p>The ocean hidden under the icy shell of Saturn’s moon Enceladus harbours complex organic molecules, a study said on Wednesday, offering further evidence that the small world could have all the right ingredients to host extraterrestrial life.
Just 500 kilometres (310 miles) wide and invisible to the naked eye, the white, scar-covered Enceladus is one of hundreds of moons orbiting the sixth planet from the Sun.
For a long time, scientists believed Enceladus was too far away from the Sun — and therefore too cold — to be habitable.
Then the Cassini space probe flew past the moon several times during a 2004-2017 trip to Saturn and its rings, discovering evidence that a vast saltwater ocean is concealed under the moon’s kilometres-thick layer of ice.
Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide, and phosphorus.
When the spacecraft passed over the moon’s south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.
These jets were propelling tiny ice particles — smaller than grains of sand —  into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon’s surface, others collected around one of Saturn’s many rings.

When Cassini flew through Saturn’s outermost “E” ring, it was “detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,” Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space Agency.
By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules — including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.
But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years —  or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.
So the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.
Luckily, they already had access to some.
When Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon’s surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft’s Cosmic Dust Analyser at around 18 kilometres a second.
But it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.
Back to the moon?
Study co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that “the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn’s ‘E’ ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus’s ocean”.
French astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was “not much doubt” that these molecules were in the moon’s ocean.
But this confirmation provides “another piece in the puzzle,” she added.
It also shows that recent technology, such as artificial intelligence, allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.
But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.
The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.
After all, “Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,” the agency said in the statement.
Khawaja added that “even not finding life on Enceladus would be a huge discovery, because it raises serious questions about why life is not present in such an environment when the right conditions are there.”</p><small>2025-10-01 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011441176509c96.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945843/man-allegedly-guns-down-brother-3-family-members-in-abbottabad-police' target='_blank'><strong>Man allegedly guns down brother, 3 family members in Abbottabad: police</strong></a><br><p>A man allegedly shot dead his brother, sister-in-law, and their two daughters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Abbottabad district on Wednesday, according to the police.
Abbottabad Police Spokesperson Azam Mir Afzal told Dawn.com that the incident took place in the Bandi Attai area of Havelian.
“The suspect allegedly killed his brother along with his family members, but the motive behind the murders could not be immediately ascertained.”
He said a police team had been dispatched to the area and a first information report (FIR) was being registered at the Havelian police station.
According to the spokesperson, the suspect killed his brother, his sister-in-law, and two nieces before fleeing the scene.
The spokesperson added that police had reached the spot and the bodies of the victims were shifted to the Havelian hospital for post-mortem.

“Additionally, it noted a shutdown of cellular services on election night, which reduced the transparency of the process and impacted the efficiency of receiving results,” a COG press release said on Tuesday.
The report had been the subject of some controversy after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had buried the report after finding the elections to be riddled with problems.
The COG noted areas for improvement and provided recommendations for strengthening the independence of the country’s democratic institutions, the press release said.
A “Letter of Transmittal”, written by COG Chairperson Dr Goodluck Jonathan and included in the report, noted the denial of election symbol to the PTI, the  consecutive convictions of the party’s founder Imran Khan, and limitations on freedom of association and assembly.
It then said: “When looked at in isolation, some — though not all — of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party’s ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”
The COG chairperson wrote: “We noted with concern a number of factors in the pre-election period that significantly impacted the level playing field, most crucially the non-allocation of the bat symbol to PTI and the registering of PTI candidates as independents.
 
 

“While the for this decision had a basis in law, the negative consequences of this decision appeared vastly disproportionate to the offence this decision sought to address.”
The Supreme Court had revoked the PTI’s bat symbol just weeks before the elections over not holding its intra-party polls, forcing the party’s candidates to contest as independent candidates without a unified symbol.
Other “issues of concern” noted by the COG included Imran’s convictions in three separate cases days before the election. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the group said.
It also noted “limitations on journalistic freedoms, including in relation to freedom of speech and a culture of impunity for perpetrators of violence against journalists, which may have led to self-censorship”.
Forms-45 ‘may have been altered’
The 161-page report also mentioned the Forms-45 controversy that has been at the heart of rigging allegations levelled by the PTI during those elections.
“In several constituencies, the Group reviewed documentation that suggested that Form 45s may have been altered to change the total number of votes received by candidates, and that these altered forms were used to compile the tabulated results on Forms 47, resulting in some candidates being illegally returned as elected,” the COG report read.
 
 

It said the COG was informed that, in many cases, the Forms-45 submitted to the Returning Officer (RO) differed from the copies of Forms-45 “received at the polling station by agents of independent candidates and other party agents”.The COG also “reviewed documentation that appeared to show that a significant number of Forms 46 had been altered”.
Providing its assessment of the English-language media coverage, the COG noted that the mainstream media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting”.
“However, some sections of the media covered some candidates and political parties more favourably than they did others, with PTI-affiliated independent candidates receiving less positive coverage in national mainstream media.”
The report pointed out that state-owned PTV News “lacked balance, with the majority of its coverage concentrated on PML-N and the PPP — especially the former” — while PTI-affiliated independent candidates were not given as much coverage.
The COG said it was “informed that broadcasters were prevented from saying Imran Khan’s name, instead being instructed to refer only to the chair of PTI”.
 
 

Moreover, the group noted that “some English language newspapers published obvious campaign messages of PML-N and its leader on 7 February” despite the campaign period ending the day before.
The report also detailed the COG’s assessments on the pre-poll activities; the voting, counting and results process; the inclusion of women, youth, the transgender community and religious minorities; and the legal environment, including certain recent rulings and a letter by judges alleging interference.
“Jurisprudential inconsistencies in two of the most significant and consequential cases in the pre-election period had severe impacts in terms of the level nature of the playing field,” the COG said, specifying the SC’s reversal of the lifetime ban for politicians, and the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision, later upheld by the apex court, to withhold the bat symbol from PTI.
Reduction in voter registration gender gap
In its report, the COG also “commended the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) efforts to ensure inclusive elections”.
“It noted the ECP’s expansion of its Gender and Social Inclusion Wing as a worthwhile endeavour, which contributed to a reduction in the voter registration gender gap from 12 per cent in 2013 to 7.7pc in the 2024 election.
“The group further noted the establishment of the ECP’s gender hotline for reporting election-related harassment and intimidation. There was also an improvement in youth voter turnout.”
The press release, citing the report, added that despite challenges, the “potential for improving future polls was encouraging”.
“The potential of Pakistan’s democracy is enormous. Pakistan has a vibrant and diverse media; women and the youth are more engaged than ever; and Pakistan’s CSOs play a critical role in the democratic life of the country, continually pushing for reform and improvement.”
The report proposed reforms to various aspects of the electoral process, including the legal framework and its interpretation, election administration, and laws impacting political rights, women’s participation, pre-election campaigns, and the role of the media,  the press release said.
The COG noted areas for improvement and provided recommendations for strengthening the independence of the country’s democratic institutions, the press release said.
It further stated: “The group highlighted, among others, the conditions which appeared to limit fundamental political rights and impacted one party’s ability to fairly contest the election. Additionally, it noted a shutdown of cellular services on election night, which reduced the transparency of the process and impacted the efficiency of receiving results.”
The report concluded that these developments may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process”.
‘Delayed’ report
According to the letter of transmittal appended to the report, it was submitted by the COG to the Commonwealth Secretary General on Nov 20, 2024. A press statement issued alongside the report did not explain the inordinate delay in its publication.
In September, the PTI had called on the COG to release this report, claiming that it laid bare “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting of PTI and its founder, Imran Khan”.
However, in a statement issued on Sept 14, the COG said it was aware that a version of its report on the 2024 Pakistan general elections was circulating online, but that they did not comment on leaked documents as a matter of policy.
“The government and the Election Commission of Pakis­tan have already received the report. The full report, as we had communicated earlier, will be released later this month, along with a number of COG reports currently in the publication pipeline,” the COG statement said.
The PTI’s demand came after a recent report by the independent news outlet Drop Site News claimed that the COG had “buried their report” after finding the Feb 8 general elections to be riddled with problems.
Although the group’s report on Pakistan was yet to be officially released back then, media outlets claimed to have obtained leaked copies of the report.</p><small>2025-10-01 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0112314082e1b36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945826/did-muslim-countries-agree-to-a-different-version-of-trumps-gaza-plan-heres-what-we-know' target='_blank'><strong>Did Muslim countries agree to a different version of Trump’s Gaza plan? Here’s what we know</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday unveiled a 20-point plan for Gaza. Subsequently, eight Arab or Muslim-majority nations — Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt — “welcomed the role of the American president and his sincere efforts aimed at ending the war in Gaza”.
In Pakistan, the government’s so-called approval of the plan had drawn flak from politicians, journalists and activists alike, who termed the deal a “two-state surrender’’ with the scales weighing heavily in Israel’s favour.
Subsequently, signs began appearing that not everyone was happy with the draft made public by the White House. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar seemingly distanced Pakistani decision-makers from the plan. He also made it clear in so many words that the US peace plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included.
This came after Trump had previously claimed that both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir were behind the plan “100 per cent”. However, in yesterday’s presser, Dar said the “document has been issued by the US” and that it was “not our document”.
The question that has arisen after these developments is whether the Muslim countries, whose leaders had met Trump last week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss a possible deal on Gaza, had backed a plan that looked different. Here’s what we know:
‘Deal significantly different’
According to US news outlet Axios, the deal now before Hamas is significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention.
“Trump presented the situation as straightforward,” Axios reported. “Israel, the US and its Arab partners were all aligned on a final plan, and Hamas had to agree or face annihilation.”
However, the publication stated that behind the scenes, reality was murkier.
While Trump and Netanyahu were discussing the plan on camera at the White House, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani was presenting it to Hamas leaders in Doha, Axios reported, citing a knowledgeable source.
 
 

“Officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey were furious over the changes, according to sources with knowledge,” it reported. It further said that the Qataris had tried to convince the Trump administration to not release the plan due to these objections but the White House did so anyway.
It noted that while the eight Muslim and Arab countries had welcomed the deal in an initial statement, the “Qataris told the other countries that after that generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details,” the report quoted one source as saying.
‘Netanyahu secured key edits’
Meanwhile, The Times of Israel reported that during the extensive meeting with Trump, Netanyahu had managed to secure “significant 11th-hour changes” to the proposal regarding the scope and nature of Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, along with the disarmament of Hamas.
The publication stated: “Point 3 of what was then a 21-point plan obtained by The Times of Israel stated that “Israeli forces will withdraw to the battle lines as of when the [US special envoy Steve Witkoff’s] proposal was presented to prepare for hostage release.”
The Times of Israel noted that the previous version did not specify which Witkoff proposal and the plan published on Monday stated that “Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed-upon line“ without any further elaborations. It stated, however, that it appeared to refer to a “new map” that was “included in the updated version that illustrated three phases of Israeli withdrawals from Gaza”.
The report further said that the map shows that “Israeli troops will be able to remain in the majority of the Gaza Strip even after the first pullback of Israel Defence Forces (IDF) troops in preparation for all of the hostages to be released”.
“They will then be able to remain in those positions until the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) of Arab and Muslim countries is prepared to deploy and fully operate to disarm Hamas, the plan states. Even after the second phase of the withdrawal, the IDF will remain in over a third of the Strip, the map indicates,” the report said.
“The third withdrawal will clear the final troops out of Gaza, but the map shows that a security buffer zone will be established along the perimeter of the entire Strip, another Israeli demand aimed at mitigating the threat of another October 7-like invasion,” it said.
 

Map released by the White House.

Further, the report said that point 16 of the original US plan simply stated that the IDF “will progressively hand over the Gaza territory that [it] occup[ies].”
It added that the updated version added two lines that “further qualify the nature of the withdrawal in Israel’s favour”, stating that IDF “will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarisation that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the US“.
“Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,” the plan announced on Monday states.
Concessions on disarmament
The Times of Israel further stated that Netanyahu managed to secure concessions regarding disarmament during a meeting with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and top adviser Jared Kushner at his hotel in New York on Thursday and Sunday.
“Whereas last week’s version granted amnesty to ‘Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence’, the plan published Monday adds that those members also have to ‘decommission their weapons’,” the publication said.
It further noted that point 13 of the plan originally stated: “There will be full commitment to destroy and stop building any offensive military infrastructure.”
However, the updated version goes into much greater detail on the issue, stating that “all military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt,“ it reported.
“There will be a process of demilitarisation of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy-back and reintegration program, all verified by the independent monitors,” the plan released on Monday said.
‘Arab mediator less bullish than Netanyahu’
The Times of Israel quoted a diplomat from one of the mediating countries as saying that while Arab and Muslim leaders met Trump last week, Netanyahu managed to secure “the last word”, convincing Washington to make additional changes to the plan at a point in the process when it was much harder for them to intervene.
“Speaking to Trump last also allowed Netanyahu to secure something of a concession from the US president,” the report said. It quoted the diplomat as saying that it would be difficult for Egypt and Qatar to convince Hamas to accept the US proposal as is and it would likely take them several days to respond.
Qatar says ‘clarification’ needed
Meanwhile, Qatar, a key mediator, has also said that further talks were needed over details of Trump’s peace plan. The Associated Press quoted three Arab officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, as saying that changes had been made in the original proposal that Arab and Muslim countries had worked out with Trump — changes in favour of Israel.
The Arab officials who spoke to the AP expressed frustration with the White House’s 20 points. “This is not what we agreed on,” said one. “This is the Netanyahu plan,“ the publication reported the official as saying.
Separately, the Qatari prime minister has also told Al Jazeera that there were certain things within the plan that needed “clarification” and “discussion and negotiation”.
 


“The main focus is how we protect the people in Gaza. In the end, we are a mediator. When we started the plan last week [..] we delivered it to Hamas, the negotiating delegation and the discussions with them were in generality.
“We hope that everyone will look at the matter constructively and we tried to make use of the momentum now to end the war in Gaza. I believe that should be the primary priority,” he said.

The atmosphere was highly charged following the death of one person and injuries to several others a day earlier.
Although government offices remained open, attendance was thin for want of transport. Banks were also open but hardly saw any client. All private businesses and shops, including medical stores, remained closed. Even street vendors were nowhere to be seen.
Angry youngsters, some carrying batons, blocked intercity roads in many areas of the state capital till afternoon by placing different obstacles and torching bushes.
Nevertheless, some private vehicles and motorcycles were seen running through the roads sporadically, without facing serious resistance from the activists.
On receiving information about blockades, police personnel swiftly rushed to clear the road obstacles.

According to witnesses, at several such places they lobbed tear gas shells to quell disturbance and also made arrests.
In some areas, law enforcers were also pelted with stones from the mountain slopes, forced them to retreat to safety.
On Tuesday, there were reports of minor casualties on both sides, but these could not be verified as government officials refrained from sharing anything with the media.
Authentic figures of detainees could not be obtained either.
This correspondent tried to reach out to a number of senior officials, but their staff said “they were busy in meetings and unable to take calls”. One senior police official did attend the call after several attempts, but declined to confirm or contradict the number of detainees.
By the afternoon, thousands of people gathered at Muzaffarabad’s Lal Chowk where Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) leaders, including Shaukat Nawaz Mir, addressed them.
“A state is like a mother, but unfortunately ours has turned out to be a witch that killed its own children,” fumed Mr Mir.
On Monday, Muhammad Sudhir, a 30-year-old shopkeeper belonging to Neelum Valley, was killed in Muzaffarabad after sustaining gunshot wounds.
The JKJAAC alleged the shots were fired by the participants of a government-backed rally, led by Raja Saqib Majeed of Muslim Conference.
Late on Monday night, relatives and other activists had placed his body on the main artery in Chehla Bandi negibourhood to press the authorities for registration of an FIR against Mr Majeed and other accused.
The body was removed only after their demands were met.
“We have full recording evidence as to who fired upon peaceful protesters and at whose behest,” Mr Mir said.
Reports from Rawalakot said that thousands of people had assembled at Tourism Chowk, but police avoided confronting them.
According to local journalists, the participants might start a march on Wednesday either to some entry points or straight to Muzaffarabad.
In Dadyal, where tensions had escalated immensely in a similar protest in May last year, thousands of people threw huge containers into the river from Palaak Bridge where they had been placed by the administration, apparently to block movement between Kotli and Mirpur district.
Media affected
Meanwhile, the absolute suspension of internet and mobile phone services since Sunday hit the journalist community hard as no local newspaper could be published for the second consecutive day on Tuesday.
Many of those working for the national and international media, as well as some of the vloggers, had to travel to Garhi Habibullah in the neighbouring KP, from where they filed their stories and uploaded the stuff on Sunday and Monday.
But on Tuesday it was learnt that internet services had also been snapped in Garhi Habibullah, forcing some of the journalists to travel up to Mansehra for filing reports.

In Bogo city in the north of Cebu province, which was near the epicentre of the shallow quake that struck off the coast just before 10pm on Tuesday, the hospital has been “overwhelmed,” Civil Defence official Raffy Alejandro told reporters.
The death toll of 69 was based on data from the Cebu provincial disaster office and was subject to validation, said Jane Abapo, an information officer at the regional Civil Defence office. Another official said more than 150 people were injured.
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr assured survivors of swift assistance, saying cabinet secretaries were on the ground directing relief operations, as he expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones.
Cebu, one of the Philippines’ most popular tourist destinations, is home to 3.4 million people. Despite the damage, Mactan-Cebu International Airport, the country’s second busiest gateway, remained operational.
Another hard-hit town, San Remigio, was placed under a state of calamity to help the response and relief efforts. Vice Mayor Alfie Reynes appealed for food and water for evacuees, as well as heavy equipment to aid search and rescue workers.
“It is raining heavily and there is no electricity, so we really need help, especially in the northern part because there’s a scarcity of water after supply lines were damaged by the earthquake,” Reynes told DZMM radio.
In the nearby town of Pilar, resident Archel Coraza said most of his family were asleep when their house began to shake violently.
“I woke them up and we all rushed outside into the street,” he told DZMM. Coraza, who lives close to the shoreline, said he saw seawater recede after the tremor.
Local media posted videos of people rushing out of their homes as the ground shook and buildings collapsed, including a church that was more than 100 years old.
Reynes said among the deceased were some people who had been playing basketball in a sports complex in San Remigio when it partially collapsed due to the quake.
Earthquake monitoring agencies put the quake’s depth at around 10km and recorded multiple aftershocks, the strongest having a magnitude of 6. There was no tsunami threat following the quake.
The Philippines lies in the Pacific “Ring of Fire“, where volcanic activity and earthquakes are common. The country had two major earthquakes in January, with no casualties reported. In 2023, a 6.7-magnitude offshore earthquake killed eight people.</p><small>2025-10-01 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011155170a9f313.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945830/china-launches-visa-to-attract-foreign-tech-talent' target='_blank'><strong>China launches visa to attract foreign tech talent</strong></a><br><p>China kicked off a new visa programme on Wednesday to attract foreign talent in science and technology. This is part of ongoing efforts to position itself as a world leader in those sectors ahead of the United States.
The Chinese measure, announced in August, starkly contrasts with recent US policy, with the Trump administration suddenly introducing new and expensive changes to its skilled worker visas last month.
China’s new K visa significantly simplifies the immigration process for those eligible, according to state media.
“Against the backdrop of some countries retracting, turning inward, and sidelining international talent, China has keenly seized this important opportunity and promptly introduced this policy,” state newspaper People’s Daily said in a comment piece on Tuesday.
In contrast to many other visa categories, the K visa does not require a domestic employer or entity to invite the applicant.
“K visas will offer more convenience to holders in terms of the number of permitted entries, validity period, and duration of stay,” state news agency Xinhua reported in August.
The official description for those able to apply is “young foreign scientific and technological talents”, but the exact age, educational background, and work experience requirements needed are as yet unclear.
Xinhua said visa-holders will be able to “engage in exchanges in fields such as education, culture, and science and technology, as well as relevant entrepreneurial and business activities”.
Across the Atlantic, the US tech industry has been rattled by unexpected changes made by the Trump administration to the H-1B visa procedure.
H-1Bs allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States for three years, with a possible extension to six.
Such visas are widely used by the tech industry, but the new H-1B visa policy now requires a one-time $100,000 fee.
Indian nationals account for nearly three-quarters of the permits allotted via a lottery system each year.
The People’s Daily article on Tuesday pushed back at what it called “strange rumours” around the new visa, creating “immigration problems” in China.
“The so-called ‘immigration crisis’ will not materialise, we should have cultural confidence,” it said.</p><small>2025-10-01 07:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01111136f7a9345.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945827/32-magnititude-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-karachi-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>3.2-magnititude earthquake jolts parts of Karachi: PMD</strong></a><br><p>A 3.2-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Karachi on Wednesday morning, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said.
According to PMD, the earthquake was recorded seven kilometres north west of Malir at 9:34am, with a depth of 10km.
In June, the metropolitan city recorded a series of low-intensity tremors — starting from June 1 and ending on June 22  — mostly near Malir. Their intensity ranged from 1.5-magnitude to 3.8-magnitude on the Richter scale.
According to experts, the fault lines passing along the areas of Landhi, Quaidabad, Gadap and Malir had become active after several decades and were releasing accumulated energy in the form of low intensity earthquakes in areas close to them.
Previously, experts have often warned that a powerful seismic hazard can put the lives of thousands at risk and damage critical infrastructure.
The city’s close proximity to several seismic faults, including the Allahbund fault, which runs parallel to Sindh’s coast, and the junction of the Indian, Arabian and Eurasian plates, makes it susceptible to natural seismic activity.</p><small>2025-10-01 06:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011046380a70231.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945823/pakistan-repays-500m-eurobond-on-schedule-reflecting-fiscal-discipline-stronger-economy' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan repays $500m Eurobond on schedule, reflecting ‘fiscal discipline, stronger economy’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has repaid its $500 million Eurobond on schedule, with the government saying the timely servicing reflects fiscal discipline, stronger reserves, improved ratings, and a more sustainable debt profile.
The bond, meant to raise funds from global investors, was issued in 2015 with a 10-year tenor and matured on September 30 this year.
Taking to the X platform, Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad announced the development, saying, “Timely debt servicing remains business as usual, reflecting the country’s commitment to financial discipline.”
 






He said the development was encouraging as it comes at a time when external buffers and liquidity have improved, sovereign ratings have been raised, and investor confidence is rising, with Pakistan’s bonds recently trading at a premium.
Schehzad further said that the debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio had improved from 77 per cent in FY20 to 70pc in FY25.
“External debt’s share in total public debt has declined from 38pc to 32pc in FY25, reducing FX vulnerability,” Schehzad added. “Debt growth has moderated sharply in FY25 versus in earlier years.”
Looking ahead, easing global borrowing costs, alongside stronger fundamentals, position Pakistan to access markets on more competitive terms and continue building a more sustainable debt profile, he said.
“This is a steady step forward — repayment as expected, but with stronger fundamentals, improved investor sentiment, and a more resilient outlook.”
Pakistan faced a prolonged economic crisis over the last few years, marked by critically low foreign exchange reserves, an acute balance-of-payment crisis, and the looming risk of default in 2023. The crisis was averted after the International Monetary Fund released a crucial loan tranche, while support from friendly countries, including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, also played a key role.
After averting default, Pakistan has undertaken tough IMF-prescribed reforms to stabilise its economy and bolster macroeconomic indicators. This year, global credit rating agencies like Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P Global raised Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating.</p><small>2025-10-01 06:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01110026d9c5b07.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945792/pakistan-india-on-us-watch-list-for-human-trafficking' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India on US watch list for human trafficking</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: The US State Department’s Trafficking in Per­sons (TIP) Report 2025 has placed both Pakistan and India among the countries that do not fully meet minimum standards for eliminating trafficking but are making “significant efforts” to do so.
The annual report, released in Washington, reviews efforts by governments worldwide to combat human trafficking, which the State Department defines as modern-day slavery involving forced labour, sexual exploitation, and other forms of coercion.
The report identifies Pakistan as a destination for men, women, and children subjected to forced labour, particularly migrants from Afg­hanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Traffickers also exploit women and girls — and to a lesser extent, boys — from Afghanistan, Iran, and other Asian countries in sex trafficking within Pakistan.
The report notes that individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual remain highly vulnerable to exploitation. Since Pakistani law criminalises same-sex conduct, these groups face systemic discrimination and violence, further heightening their risk of being trafficked.
Civil society organisations told US officials that large-scale violence against women and girls, including so-called “honour killings,” leaves women especially susceptible to trafficking networks. The report highlights that refugees and stateless persons are among the most vulnerable. This includes Afghans without proper documentation, sta­teless people of Bengali, Bihari, and Rohingya origin, as well as religious and ethnic minorities such as Christians, Hindu Dalits, and Haz­aras. Many of these groups are trapped in bonded labor schemes.
Afghans — both undocumented migrants and registered refugees — face additional risks due to frequent harassment by authorities and the threat of deportation. Lacking legal protections, many turn to the informal economy for work, where they are easily exploited.
The report also criticises Pakistan for not having a clear definition of “statelessness”. International orga­nisations estimate that hundreds of thousands of stateless people in the country lack access to basic identity documents and essential services, leaving them particularly vulnerable to traffickers.
“Traffickers exploit Rohingya ethnicity stateless persons and Afghans in forced labour in Pak­istan,” the report warns.
The report also keeps India in Tier 2 — countries making efforts but falling short of minimum sta­ndards. India, it says, demonstrated “overall increasing efforts” compared to the previous reporting period. Positive steps included greater funding for specialised courts handling child-related cri­mes (including trafficking), preve­ntion campaigns, and the repatriation of Indian nationals exploited in online scam operations in Sou­th­east Asia.
The Indian government also expanded awareness pro­gr­ams on safe overseas employment and improved victim identification procedures through the Railway Protection Force. Advisories were issued to state governments to curb trafficking and ensure foreign victims were not wrongly punished for immigration violations stemm­ing directly from being trafficked.
New Delhi failed to provide comprehensive national data on investigations, pro­s­ecutions, and convictions of traffickers. Victim services remained insufficient and varied widely from state to state, while courts rarely awarded restitution to victims, leaving many waiting years for compensation.
The absence of an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate anti-trafficking policies further undermined efforts. Moreover, law enforcement often misclassified cases, particularly those involving bonded labour, and corruption among some government officials fueled a perception of impunity for traffickers.

Irrigation Minister Aqi­b­­ullah Khan and Educ­ation Minister Faisal Khan Tarakai, whose removal was reportedly approved by Imran Khan in the meeting with the CM, shared their ide­n­t­ical resignation letters on social media.
“With utmost res­p­ect, I, Faisal Khan Ta­r­­akai, hereby tender my resignation from the office of mi­­n­i­ster for elementary and secondary ed­u­c­a­t­ion, gov­e­rnm­ent of Khyber Pak­h­t­u­nk­h­wa,” Mr Tarakai said.
He said it had been an honour to serve in this capacity, entru­sted to him by Imran Khan and he “remai­ned highly indebted to him for confidence as well as for the opp­o­rtunity to contribute to the transforma­tion and uplift of the education department and system in KP”.
Mr Tarakai said that he performed to the best of his abilities to ensure and implement Imran Khan’s vision of transparency, efficiency and merit during his tenure as the minister. He said he would remain committed to the cause and vision of Imran Khan, while reiterating  his commitment to the PTI as a worker.
Both former ministers were not available for comment when appr­oached by Dawn.
A PTI source told Dawn that there were rumours of the reshuffling of at least five ministers, including the two who stepped down. These rumours had been circulating for quite some time, but the resignation was still unexpected.
“The chief minister had informed both Qaiser and Shahram about the de-notification of their younger siblings; however, both said the ministers would resign ins­tead,” another source said.
Both ministers, hailing from Swabi district, are siblings of two senior party leaders. Aqibullah Khan is Asad Qaiser’s brother, while Faisal Khan Taraki is the younger brother of MNA Shahram Khan Tarakai, who had served as the provincial health minister in the Mahmood Khan government.
Sources told Dawn that Imran Khan green-lig­hted the removal of both ministers. Mr Gandapur had initially bristled at the prospect, saying it would further aggravate his problems. They alleged Mr Tarakai was “ineffective, irresponsive and not fully in control of his department”.
A Tarakai House spokesperson told Dawn that Mr Tarakai resigned because he was “not all­owed to work”. “The truth is that Mr Tarakai is a hard-working person, and when he was not allowed to work, he had no other option (but to step down),” the spokesperson added.
About Aqibullah Khan, sources claimed that his ministry was being run by his brother Asad Qaiser.
Asad Qaiser, however, denied meddling in his brother’s ministry. He said that he had been to his brother’s office only once for a briefing along with other party lawmakers. “This was my only visit to my brother’s office and there is no question of influencing or interfering with his ministry aff­airs,” Mr Qaiser added.
A senior PTI leader alleged that CM Gan­dapur had developed a ‘grudge’ against the ministers for their successful Swabi power show in February this year. The source claimed that the chief minister was unh­appy with the minister for supporting the public meeting arranged by PTI KP President Junaid Akbar Khan.
In a video message, CM Gandapur said he and Imran Khan had discussed reforms in the government almost six mon­ths ago and he had also spoken to Asad Qaiser and Shahram Tarakai about cabinet changes. He said in the Monday meeting, the cabinet reshuffle was discussed again and he later met Mr Faisal and Mr Aqib to inform them about the decision. He said more changes were in the pipeline, terming them a routine affair.

• Reveals Indonesia has committed 20,000 troops; Islamabad expected to make a decision soon
• Axios claims Netanyahu negotiated changes to draft agreed between Trump, Muslim leaders

ISLAMABAD / WASHI­N­GTON: A day after US President Donald Trump unveiled his ambitious plan to end the war in Ga­za, signs have began to emerge that not everyone is happy with the draft made public by White House.
This was evident from Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s presser on Tuesday, where he made it clear in so many words that the US peace plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included.
The “document has been issued by the US”, he said, seemingly distancing Pakistani decision-makers from the plan, even though Trump has previously claimed that both PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir are behind it ‘100pc’.
“This is not our document, which we sent to them. There are some key areas that we want covered… If they are not covered, they will be covered,” he said.
Consider Trump’s anno­u­ncement of the 20-point plan as “an announcement from their side”, he said.
Mr Dar, who is also the deputy prime minister, added that Pakistan owned the joint statement given on behalf of eight Muslim countries. “If there is a difference, we will go by this,” he said.
In response to a question, the foreign minister said the plan put forward by Trump envisions an independent technocrat government of Pales­tinians, to be overseen by an international body — mostly comprised of Palestinians.
He was also guarded about the possibility of sending troops to become part of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF).
“On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies… there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan’s leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.
Mr Dar maintained that this would be a special force for Gaza alone, and the arrangement for its deployment would be documented at the UN Security Council.
Road to deal
During the presser, Mr Dar expounded on the diplomatic process that led to the finalisation of the pea­ce plan, saying that one of the main purposes of attending the UN General Assembly was to work with some “like-minded countries” on trying to end the misery in Gaza as a “member of the Muslim ummah”.
Eight countries, including Pakistan, agreed to take up this matter very proactively with President Trump during the US visit, he said.
Dar said a preparatory meeting was held before the Muslim leaders’ huddle with Trump.
The meeting with Trump was meant to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid to the strip without any hurdles, stop the forced displacement of Pales­tinians and make arrangements for the return of those displaced from the Gaza, plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and stop Israel’s attempts to annex the West Bank, he said.
“These objectives were conveyed to him (Trump), and he was asked to work with us on achieving them,” Dar said, adding that the US president then proposed that his team would devise a “workable solution” with the foreign ministers of the eight Muslim countries that participated in the meeting.
He said it was decided that the details of meetings held in this regard would be “secret” and “classified”.
After sharing further details of how the proposal for ending the Isr­aeli onslaught in Gaza was finalised, Dar said he had received messages from the Saudi foreign minister.
“He told me that five countries had reached a consensus on joint statem­ent [regarding the Gaza plan] and that our agreement was needed on this matter as well, and that they had also reached out to Indonesia and the UAE.
“I then consulted the foreign secretary and proposed some changes. I spoke to the Saudi foreign minister again … as I had some objections … He then send me a revised version … and the joint statement was released.”
When asked to assure that “you still believe in the two-state solution”, he said there was no change in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine. “And I rather would say the seven other countries are also with us on this.”
The repeated reference to the Mus­lim bloc’s joint statement is being seen as a ‘mild protestation’ over cha­nges to the terms of the deal, which were ostensibly carried out at Israeli PM Benjamin Netan­yahu’s request.
Changes to the draft
According to US news outlet Axios, the deal now before Hamas is significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention.
The main stumbling block, it seems, were the last-minute edits secured by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu when he held a six-hour meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
These included the conditions and timetable for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and the proposal ties Israel’s withdrawal to the progress of disarming Hamas, and gives Israel a veto over the process.
Even if all conditions are met and three phases of withdrawal are completed, Axios reported that Israeli forces would still remain within a security perimeter “until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.
Although there was no push-back publicly, officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkiye were furious over the changes behind the scenes, Axios reported.
According to the report, the Qat­a­ris even tried to convince the Trump administration not to release the det­ailed plan on Monday due to those objections. The White House relea­s­­ed it anyway, and pushed the Arab and Muslim countries to support the plan. The eight Muslim countries then issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s announcement, but without expressing full support for it. The Qataris told the other countries that after the generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details, sources told Axios.
Quoting a senior Arab official involved in the negotiations, the Axios report said that while Netanyahu had managed to change the text, it still has a lot of very positive elements for the Palestinians.
Deadline for Hamas
After Qatar and Egypt shared the 20-point plan with Hamas on Monday, President Trump gave the group “three to four days” to accept the proposal, or meet “a very sad end”.
Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said Israeli and Arab leaders had already endorsed the plan and that “were just waiting for Hamas” to make its decision.
“Hamas is either going to be doing it or not, and if it’s not, it’s going to be a very sad end,” Trump said as he left the White House. Asked whether there was scope for further talks on the proposal, he replied: “Not much.”
A source close to Hamas told Reu­t­ers the plan was “completely biased to Israel” and imposed “impossible conditions” that aimed to eliminate the group.
Qatar’s foreign ministry has said Hamas is studying the White House proposal “responsibly”.
However, a senior Hamas figure told the BBC that the group is likely to reject Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, saying it “serves Israel’s interests” and “ignores those of the Palestinian people”.
The source said the group is unlikely to agree to disarming and handing over their weapons.
