The status was granted by the EU in 2014, resulting in a 108 per cent increase in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs.
In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan.
The upcoming GSP+ monitoring mission will scrutinise Pakistan’s record on 27 international conventions tied to the trade scheme. Maintaining GSP+ status is critical for Pakistan to keep export costs low.
What is GSP+ status?
According to the EU, GSP+ status is a special incentive awarded to developing countries to “pursue sustainable development and good governance” in exchange for cutting import duties to zero on two-thirds of the tariff lines of its exports.
Governments with this status need to implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, good governance and the environment.
This means that Pakistan, in exchange for implementing the 27 conventions, can enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on European exports, which include apparel, home textiles and surgical instruments, according to a 2022 report by the commerce ministry.
Export earnings from the EU rose to $3.17 billion in July-October, up from $3bn over the corresponding months of last year, according to figures compiled and released by the State Bank of Pakistan on Monday.
The EU will monitor a country granted GSP+ status to make sure it continues to be a party to the international conventions and implements them effectively. It also has to comply with reporting requirements and accept regular monitoring in accordance with the conventions.
The country in question and the EU will maintain frequent dialogue and have meetings on the implementation of the 27 conventions, with a public report submitted to Brussels for review every two years.
Has Pakistan implemented these conventions?
According to the EU’s GSP Convention Compliance Database, Pakistan has ratified 27 international conventions, most recently ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1976) and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1987) in 2010.
Regarding the EU’s monitoring of Pakistan, the body prioritised 13 key areas:

Enforced disappearances
Torture prevention
Death penalty
Freedom of expression and belief and minority rights
Violence against women, transgender persons, and minorities
Right to information
Labour inspectorates
Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining
Child and forced labour
Combating climate change and environmental degradation
Fight against corruption
Drug control
Reporting

In 2023, when Pakistan’s GSP+ status was extended, the Fourth GSP Report highlighted the ongoing issue of impunity in cases of enforced disappearances, though it acknowledged “continuous progress” on the rights of women and children, the protection of transgender people, environmental conservation and good governance.
In January this year, EU Special Representative for Human Rights Olaf Skoog urged the government not to use military courts to pursue cases against citizens and opposed amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act.
In the first half of 2025, a total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, which was formed in 2011. The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said.</p><small>2025-11-19 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19221149964e669.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956090/saudi-crown-prince-heads-to-a-friendlier-us-congress' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi crown prince heads to a friendlier US Congress</strong></a><br><p>Lawmakers are set to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) at the United States Capitol on Wednesday on the second day of a visit to the US that has aimed to tout stronger-than-ever economic and security ties with Washington while brushing off scrutiny of his human rights record.
President Donald Trump gave bin Salman a lavish welcome at the White House on Tuesday and defended him over the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, which US intelligence agencies have concluded the crown prince approved.
 
 

A handful of Republican members of Congress, including House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast attended a black-tie dinner at the White House for bin Salman on Tuesday, according to a White House official.
MBS was considered an outcast by Washington in the aftermath of the Khashoggi killing, but his rehabilitation was rubber-stamped this week.
In one example of this, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who as a US senator in 2019 denounced the crown prince as a “gangster”, sat a few steps away during Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting. Trump repeatedly said it was “an honour” to be friends with the Saudi leader.
This was in sharp contrast to Washington’s view of the Saudi leader during Trump’s first term, as members of Congress became angry with Riyadh’s role in the civil war in Yemen and its human rights record, fueled by Khashoggi’s murder at a Saudi consulate in Turkiye.
“He is reckless, he’s ruthless, he has a penchant for escalation, for taking high risks, confrontational in his foreign policy approach and I think increasingly willing to test the limits of what he can get away with the United States,” Rubio said at the time.
There were multiple and persistent calls from members of Congress for accountability.
The crown prince has denied ordering the operation but acknowledged responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto ruler.
In 2019, Congress passed a resolution demanding an end to military support for the Saudi-led coalition waging war in Yemen, although there were too few votes to overturn Trump’s veto.
Subdued reception
Although memories of that time may have faded, MBS’s reception on Capitol Hill on Wednesday was likely to be far more subdued than the welcomes given to other world leaders.
The crown prince arrived at the Capitol building on Wednesday morning, where congressional aides said Johnson was holding a reception for him attended by some Democratic as well as Republican members of Congress.
The meeting was not announced and the speaker’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Neither Johnson nor Republican Senate Leader John Thune planned the type of press opportunity, with photos and brief remarks, that is often held when world leaders visit the Capitol.
A handful of lawmakers criticised MBS this time around.
Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, where Khashoggi lived, blasted Trump after the Oval Office meeting with MBS.
“Instead of rolling out the red carpet for MBS and leveraging the presidency for private hotel deals, Trump should be demanding accountability on behalf of Khashoggi’s Virginia-based family and pressing Saudi Arabia to advance US security interests. Unfortunately, this is just the most recent example of Trump placing his personal financial interests above the interest of the American people,” he said in a statement.
MBS, who agreed in the meeting to increase the kingdom’s planned investments in the US to $1 trillion from $600 billion, is also attending an investment conference in Washington on Wednesday that will include CEOs from major US companies.
The two sides also announced new agreements on arms sales, civil nuclear cooperation and artificial intelligence after the meeting.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the foreign relations panel, said she was concerned about some of the initiatives announced during the visit, and called on Trump and his administration to brief the committee on every commitment.</p><small>2025-11-19 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/192150193ae7f91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956088/4-terrorists-killed-in-separate-operations-across-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>4 terrorists killed in separate operations across KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed four terrorists in separate engagements across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Wednesday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), multiple intelligence-based operations (IBO) were carried out between November 17 and 18, with the dead terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“On [the] reported presence of khwarij, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the security forces in Bajaur district,” the statement read. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, one kharji was sent to hell.”
The ISPR said that two more terrorists were killed in IBOs conducted in the areas of Spinwam and Zakir Khel in North Waziristan, while another terrorist was killed in an IBO in Dera Ismail Khan District.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian sponsored killed khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement added.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as [the] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm e Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
Yesterday, the ISPR said that 38 terrorists had been killed in counter-terrorism operations carried out from November 15-17 in KP.
The first IBO was conducted by security forces in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said.
In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan district, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said.
In a separate statement later in the day, the ISPR said two IBOs took place between November 16-17 in Bajaur district and Bannu district, killing 11 and 12 terrorists, respectively. It added that terrorist ringleader Sajjad alias Abuzar was also killed in the Bajaur IBO.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-19 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/192124406eadac8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956087/pti-denounces-brutal-attack-on-imrans-sisters-will-observe-countrywide-black-day-on-friday' target='_blank'><strong>PTI denounces ‘brutal’ attack on Imran’s sisters, will observe countrywide ‘black day’ on Friday</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Wednesday strongly condemned the Punjab government for unleashing “a reign of terror” on party founder Imran Khan’s sisters, party leaders, lawyers, and workers outside Adiala Jail, describing the act as utterly intolerable and completely unacceptable.
The party announced that the opposition alliance would observe a countrywide ‘black day’ on Friday to demand the restoration of the Constitution, the rule of law and ‘real freedom’, as Imran repeatedly stated that the nation was left with no choice but to choose between freedom and death.
Speaking at a press conference alongside Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Niazi — as well as Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and other party leaders, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja condemned the acts carried out on Tuesday night and issued a stern warning to the authorities.
He stated that the PTI continued to urge those in power to abandon their “reckless arrogance” and act responsibly before it was too late. Raja emphasised that it was the undeniable constitutional right of Imran’s sisters to meet their brother — a right no authority could take away.
The PTI secretary general warned that no society could survive, let alone progress, without the freedom of speech, press, conscience and an independent judiciary.
“We are confronting a power structure intoxicated by its own might, blind to morality and law,” he said, vowing, “We will expose this tyranny, for God’s justice may be silent but is relentless — no oppressor will escape it.”
Speaking on the occasion, Aleema denounced the alleged assault on her sister and others by police units.
She alleged that a female officer openly directed male personnel to beat the protesters.
“Yesterday, our people, including MPAs and MNAs, were subjected to violence,” Aleema said.
Imran’s sister claimed that the PTI founder was placed in solitary confinement while party members peacefully exercised their court-approved right to demand justice.
She recalled that police allegedly threw 71-year-old Noreen to the ground, dragged her, forcibly pulled women’s dupattas, slapped them and beat young girls, locking them in vans with male detainees.
“Women officers, armed with batons, acted as Gullu Buttnis, and one even directed the others, shouting: ‘Beat them,’” she added.
“Do you think that by beating us you can silence us? We will return and you cannot intimidate us,” Aleema vowed.
She further asked, “Is this country now ruled by gangsters?”
Imran’s sister affirmed that the family would continue to stand outside the jail for her brother, exposing oppressors and injustice.
Aleema recalled that on August 4, 2023, a day before his arrest, Imran was asked to leave the country.
“But he made it clear: I will not abandon my country,” she said, highlighting his 500-day-long trial without personal demands.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram condemned the treatment and manhandling of Imran’s sisters, stating that such coercive and arbitrary tactics could not break the courage of the family, party leaders or workers.
He vowed that the party would continue to strive for the country’s real independence, true democracy, constitutional supremacy and judicial independence come what may.
Noreen vowed that the nation would never forget the tragedies of May 9 and November 26.
“Those who have played with the lives of innocent people will never find peace,” she said, expressing gratitude to those on social media who continued “exposing the truth despite immense pressure”.
“Every act of oppression will be accounted for,” she declared. Noreen stated that the authorities had crossed all limits — assaulting citizens, demolishing homes and smashing mobile phones to silence the people.
“This brutality will not erase the truth, nor break the resolve of the people,” she asserted.
She noted that her son, Hassan Niazi, remained imprisoned, yet the “oppression outside jail is even more frightening”.
Recounting her own ordeal, Noreen said, “I still do not know where they took the woman who grabbed me. She pulled me by my hair, threw me to the ground and dragged me across the road.”
Noreen praised those facing military trials for their bravery and unwavering resolve despite intimidation.
Uzma expressed deep concern over her brother’s condition, stating that he had been in solitary confinement for the past two weeks.
“Yesterday, we simply requested permission to see him to ensure his well-being,” she said. She added that Imran urged the nation to prepare, declaring that the time had come to choose between freedom or death.
“If they want to beat us, let them. If they want to throw us in jail, let them. We are not afraid.“
Abbas too condemned the treatment of women outside Adiala Jail, calling the manhandling and snatching of headscarves an “unforgivable national disgrace”.
“No civilised society, culture, or moral framework — legal, religious or traditional — permits violence against women. What happened yesterday stains our collective conscience,” he said.
“What crime has the PTI founder committed? His sole ‘offence’ is speaking the truth and standing fearlessly with the people,” he remarked.
Abbas described the movement as unstoppable, highlighting this Friday’s countrywide ‘black day’, symbolised by black flags and ribbons, as a “decisive moment”.
“All notions of lifetime immunity violate the Holy Quran, Sunnah and Constitution — a false idol born of fear,” he added, urging critics of Imran to emulate his “integrity, courage, and commitment to justice” rather than harbouring hatred.
KP Minister Meena Khan Afridi said that after the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the path to justice had become extremely difficult, yet the judiciary must at least ensure the implementation of its own orders.
He noted that Imran’s sisters and elected representatives reached Adiala Jail in full accordance with court directives, yet in the freezing cold, they were assaulted with water and police unleashed further violence.
Afridi warned the station house officer involved in the events that “only your uniform shields you” and asked Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nwaz how she could authorise violence against women. He said KP would seek action and vowed they would return until allowed to meet Imran.</p><small>2025-11-19 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19191613822dbb2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956083/pakistan-needs-to-do-more-on-fulfilling-gsp-plus-conventions-ahead-of-review-eu-envoy-says' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan needs to ‘do more’ on fulfilling GSP Plus conventions ahead of review, EU envoy says</strong></a><br><p>European Union (EU) Ambassador to Pakistan Raimundas Karoblis on Wednesday said that the country needed to “do more” in terms of fulfilling its commitments under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) ahead of a review.
The status was granted by the EU in 2014, which led to a 108 per cent hike in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs. In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan, to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on European exports.
The upcoming GSP+ monitoring mission was delayed from June because of the Iran-Israel conflict and will scrutinise Pakistan’s record on 27 international conventions tied to the trade scheme, which grants duty-free access to most Pakistani exports.
In an interview on DawnNewstv show ‘Doosra Rukh’ today, the EU ambassador was asked about whether Pakistan needed to do more to fulfil the requirements of the scheme, to which he said: “Yes, we are saying that. We are saying that it should be, well, needs to be, to do more.”
He said it would be a periodic monitoring mission that would assess the implementation of all necessary United Nations conventions for the scheme’s application.
“There are human rights, labour rights, environmental issues as well, and good governance. Quite a lot of meetings will be with state institutions, but also with civil society organisations, with human rights defenders, but also with the companies and actually with people who are working in the companies.”
He said a report would subsequently be issued with further recommendations based on the findings of United Nations bodies, since they were responsible for monitoring the conventions.
Karoblis stressed that implementation of the conventions was “really important”.
Outlining areas of concern, he pointed to human rights, the death penalty, blasphemy, forced disappearances, minority rights, women’s rights, child labour and forced labour.
“It will probably be the last monitoring mission of the present GSP+ scheme, because the new scheme will enter into force soon, probably from 2027, and Pakistan will need to reapply in order if it would like to continue with the GSP+ preferences. So it means that the report of the monitoring mission will be one of the most important sources assessing the progress and compliance with Pakistani commitments vis-à-vis the UN.”
The ambassador highlighted that the EU had already identified the main issues that it was asking Pakistan to address.
He said that the EU did see “certain progress”.
 
 

Karoblis said that the issue of forced disappearances in particular was one of the EU’s “priorities”, saying it was one of the issues on which “we have questions and we see the problems in the context of the GSP+”.
“Of course, we understand that some structures were established, such as the Commission of [Inquiry on Enforced] Disappearances. Of course, we will look into whether it is enough, whether it is sufficient, but of course, we will have a lot of questions on that for the institutions.”
Questioned about his thoughts on the recently enacted contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, he said it was an “internal issue”.
 
 

However, he did say on the issue of the judiciary’s independence that “we have different views” and different opinions and thoughts were being solicited from the opposition, think tanks, civil society organisations, and international organisations working in Pakistan.
The envoy also said that there was a need to discuss the issue of recent military trials of civilians.
“Maybe during discussions we will have some justifications. So, well, of course, the security situation is problematic. There are a lot of challenges which we really see.”
Noting a deteriorating human rights climate, former EU ambassador Riina Kionka had called on Pakistan in August to show ‘credible’ and ‘visible progress’ on human rights and labour reforms, signalling that the EU’s next trade preference scheme will demand stronger compliance.
“Pakistan needs to show more visible progress, especially ahead of the upcoming GSP Plus monitoring mission in November,” she said.
“Governance is looking pretty good, (progress on) environment also positive. But labour rights need more work, and human rights remain the most challenging area.”
On human rights, she was blunt: “If you talk to many human rights defenders, civil society activists —and even just live here, like I have for three years — you often see … a clear degradation. Our monitors read the newspapers. They have networks, they know what’s going on. So, they’re in a position to judge whether things are moving in the right direction or not.”
European lawmakers and civil society, she added, were increasingly vocal about conditioning trade support on rights performance: “Why should we continue to offer this level of support if there’s no reciprocal progress on the values side?”
Similarly, in January, the EU had warned Pakistan not to take its GSP+ status for granted. Olof Skoog, the EU Special Rep­resentative for Human Rights, had urged the government not to use military courts to pursue cases against citizens, and opposed recent moves to restrict freedom of expression.
Talking to Dawn, he said he had conveyed these messages in separate meetings with top government functionaries, including the army chief, the chief justice and members of the federal cabinet.
The focus of his visit was to engage with the government on pressing human rights issues and learn about Pakistan’s plans to address them ahead of the GSP+ monitoring mission.</p><small>2025-11-19 16:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19214626c3c9bdc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956026/fm-dar-holds-talks-with-eu-council-president-on-gsp-plus-status' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar holds talks with EU Council president on GSP Plus status</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar discussed the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) scheme with European Union Council President Antonio Costa on Wednesday ahead of an upcoming review this month.
The status was granted by the EU in 2014, which led to a 108 per cent hike in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs. In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan, to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on European exports.
The upcoming GSP+ monitoring mission was delayed from June because of the Iran-Israel conflict and will scrutinise Pakistan’s record on 27 international conventions tied to the trade scheme, which grants duty-free access to most Pakistani exports.
The Foreign Office (FO) said that FM Dar called on Costa for a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, in which they “exchanged views on various areas of mutual interest, including GSP+, trade and economic cooperation expansion, and regional and global security developments”.
The two also reaffirmed their steadfast commitment to multilateralism.
The FO said both sides noted with satisfaction the “positive trajectory” of the Pakistan-EU relationship and agreed to further strengthen the “mutually beneficial partnership” across various domains.
FM Dar also acknowledged and appreciated the EU’s support to Pakistan both bilaterally and on multilateral platforms.
The FO said both sides agreed to continue working together to advance common priorities and deepen cooperation across key sectors.
 






FM Dar reached Belgium earlier today after attending a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Moscow. During the three-day visit, he will attend the seventh strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the European Union (EU).
 






The Pakistan-EU Strategic Dialogue is the highest level of institutionalised interaction between the two sides, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a press release today. FM Dar was in Moscow to lead the Pakistani delegation at the SCO summit.
According to the FO, Dar will co-chair the seventh session of Pakistan-EU Strategic Dialogue at the invitation of Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy.
The dialogue will review cooperation between Pakistan and the EU in all sectors under the Pakistan-EU Strategic Engagement Plan 2019, it said.
 






In Brussels, the deputy premier will also participate in the fourth EU Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum, which will be held over the next two days and will be chaired by Kallas.
Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts and engagements with senior EU officials, according to the FO.
Dar’s visit to Brussels marks a “significant milestone in Pakistan-EU relations”, the statement highlighted, affirming that Islamabad remains committed to developing a “comprehensive and mutually beneficial partnership” with the EU.
Separately, after arrival in Brussels, Dar posted on X that he “look[s] forward to engaging with the president of the European Council, EU high representative/ vice-president, EU commissioners, members of the European Parliament, and other leaders attending the IMPF”.
 






When departing from Russia, Dar expressed his gratitude to the host government for its “warm hospitality and the successful organisation” of the SCO moot, the FO said on social media platform X.
He also appreciated the support extended by the embassy of Pakistan in Moscow and the teams at the FO for facilitating his visit.
 






Dar meets Russian FM, Qatari PM on sidelines of SCO summit
Earlier today, the FO said that Dar met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the 24th summit of the SCO’s Council of Heads of Governments (CHG).
In a statement, the FO said both sides “reviewed the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and expressed deep satisfaction at the current positive trajectory of relations”.
Dar congratulated Lavrov on the successful hosting of the meeting, noting the “vital role of both countries’ leadership […] as well as bilateral institutional mechanisms in further strengthening bilateral relations”, according to the statement.
“The leaders also exchanged views on regional and international issues. Taking into account the excellent coordination at multilateral fora, including the United Nations and the SCO, they pledged to deepen them further in the interest of both countries,” the FO added.
 






Dar also held an “informal discussion” with Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani on the sidelines of the CHG meeting, according to the FO.
The two ministers exchanged views on “bilateral relations and priorities for regional cooperation”, it added.
 






Interactions with Chinese premier, Central Asian leaders
Among a string of posts, the FO also posted pictures of Dar meeting Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Chinese Premier Li Qiang on the margins of the summit, where they discussed enhancing collaboration among the member states of the SCO.
 






He also met Adylbek Kasymaliev, chairman of the cabinet of ministers and head of the presidential administration of the Kyrgyz Republic, and congratulated him on assuming chairmanship of the SCO Heads of State.
“Highlighting the importance of regional collaboration, the two leaders exchanged views on SCO initiatives and Kyrgyzstan’s assumption of the rotating presidency,” the FO said.
 






Meeting Uzbekistan’s PM Abdulla Aripov, Dar “appreciated the positive momentum in Pakistan-Uzbekistan relations and underscored the importance of high-level interactions and cooperation at multilateral fora”.
 






Dar also met with Tajikistan’s PM Kokhir Rasulzoda, congratulating him on his assumption of the chairmanship of the next CHG meeting. He reaffirmed his commitment to strengthening bilateral ties between the two countries across diverse areas, the FO said.

Citing PPL’s General Manager Exploration and Core Business Development, Arshad Palekar, Bloomberg reported that the artificial island will be created about 30 kilometres off the coast of Sindh, near Sujawal. He said this on the sidelines of an oil and gas conference in Islamabad.
“Planned with a height of six feet, the platform will prevent high tides from interrupting round-the-clock exploration work,” he said.
 
 

Pakistan’s drilling efforts are gaining fresh momentum after United States President Donald Trump indicated an interest in the country’s “massive oil reserves” in a social media post in July.
Since then, Islamabad has awarded offshore exploration licenses to local companies PPL, Mari Energies Ltd and Prime International Oil and Gas Company.
“The project, a first for Pakistan, builds on Abu Dhabi’s experience, where artificial islands for drilling have been successfully built,” Palekar said.
Construction of the island will be completed in February, and operation will start immediately after, according to Palekar. The company aims to drill around 25 wells.
Vitol and Cnergyico, Pakistan’s largest oil refiner, delivered the country’s biggest single shipment of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) for ship refuelling, the global trading firm said in a statement late Monday.
This shipment came from Cnergyico’s first large-scale batch of fuel that meets International Maritime Organisation (IMO) low-sulphur rules. The company began producing it after importing its first US crude oil cargoes earlier this year.
The move will enable large vessels refuelling in Pakistan to now sail longer routes from east to west without needing to stop elsewhere, while also giving the country a stronger local supply of environmentally compliant marine fuel.</p><small>2025-11-19 16:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1920212261e1142.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956084/japans-biggest-fire-in-nearly-50-years-ravages-170-buildings-kills-one' target='_blank'><strong>Japan’s biggest fire in nearly 50 years ravages 170 buildings, kills one</strong></a><br><p>A fire ripped through more than 170 buildings and killed one person in a southern Japanese coastal city on Wednesday, with military and firefighting helicopters scrambling to extinguish the country’s largest urban blaze in almost half a century.
Aerial footage from broadcasters showed houses reduced to rubble and thick plumes of smoke rising from the hilly Saganoseki district of Oita city, which overlooks a fishing harbour renowned for its premium Seki-brand mackerel.
The flames had also spread to nearby forested slopes and an uninhabited island more than one kilometre off the coast, likely due to strong winds, local media reported.
The blaze started on Tuesday evening and has burned 48,900 square metres — roughly the size of seven soccer fields — forcing 175 residents in the district, some 770 kilometres southwest of Tokyo, to flee to an emergency shelter, Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency said.
The cause of the fire was under investigation, the agency added.
One person has been found dead, local media reported, citing police sources, while a woman in her 50s was reported to be hospitalised for mild burns.
“I extend my heartfelt condolences to all residents who are evacuating in the cold,” Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in a post on X.
“The government will provide the maximum possible support in collaboration with local authorities,” she wrote.
 


The fire has caused power outages at around 300 houses in the district, according to Kyushu Electric Power.
The number of buildings and size of the area engulfed in flames make it the largest urban fire in Japan since a 1976 blaze in Sakata, excluding incidents caused by earthquakes.
In 2016, a fire in Itoigawa burned 147 buildings and about 40,000 square metres. No one was killed.</p><small>2025-11-19 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19191100872cd82.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956082/on-world-toilet-day-over-15bn-people-still-have-no-access-to-basic-sanitation' target='_blank'><strong>On World Toilet Day, over 1.5bn people still have no access to basic sanitation</strong></a><br><p>“In a world reshaped by rising climate pressures, urban growth, and inequality, safe sanitation remains a cornerstone of public health and human dignity,” says United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement on World Toilet Day on November 19.
Established by the World Toilet Organisation in 2001, the day was made an official United Nations Observance in 2013.
Every year, UN-Water — the UN’s coordination mechanism on water and sanitation — sets the theme for this day. In 2025, the theme is ‘Sanitation in a changing world’, which, according to the UN reminds us “that no matter what the future holds, we’ll always need the toilet”.

“The humble toilet is an icon of progress — preventing disease, protecting the environment, and preserving dignity and opportunity. Without safe sanitation, sustainable development falters. Contaminated water can spread diarrhoeal illnesses, which kill over 1,000 children a day,” says Guterres.
It is important to note, however, that over 1.5 billion people still do not have basic sanitation services, such as private toilets or latrines, according to World Health Organisation. Of these, 419 million still defecate in the open, for example, in street gutters, behind bushes or into open bodies of water.
“Untreated human waste pollutes ecosystems and fuels greenhouse gas emissions,” the UN chief points out. “And for millions of women and girls, the lack of a secure toilet means missed work and school.”

Poor sanitation reduces human well-being, social and economic development due to impacts such as anxiety, risk of sexual assault, and lost opportunities for education and work, according to the WHO.
It is linked to transmission of diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera and dysentery, as well as typhoid, intestinal worm infections and polio; furthermore, it exacerbates stunting and contributes to the spread of antimicrobial resistance.
Even where there are toilets around the world, some hardly warrant the name. In a Syrian refugee settlement camp in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, for example, toilets surrounded by graffiti-covered corrugated sheet sit right up against flimsy tents. In the Marcory district of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, a “private” stall is simply built of spare bits of lumber and metal.

The statement from the navy’s Directorate-General Public Relations (DG PR) said the PN Tabuk was conducting a regional maritime security patrol in support of the Saudi-led Combined Task Force 150 under the Combined Maritime Force (CMF), a naval partnership that includes the United States, when it intercepted a “suspicious dhow” operating in the Arabian Sea.
“Subsequently, the ship successfully conducted a major counter-narcotics operation onboard stateless dhow, resulting in the seizure of over 2000kg of ice,” the statement said, adding that the capture was the third consecutive successful interdiction conducted in the last two months by PN ships.
The navy said these successful operations demonstrated its “enduring resolve and unwavering commitment” against illicit trafficking at sea.
“The scale of the operation, coupled with its flawless execution, underscores not only PN’s professionalism but also the effectiveness of multinational coordination under CMF.”
“PN remains steadfast in its resolve to safeguard national maritime interests and uphold principles of the United Nations Convention on the Law of Sea while contributing to the global commons through maritime security efforts,” the statement concluded.
 






Last month, PN Yarmook seized narcotics worth more than $972m from sailboats in the Arabian Sea.
In August, the navy and the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) had seized about 1,250kg of illicit drugs worth $38m from smugglers near Balochistan’s Pasni coast.</p><small>2025-11-19 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19153652ca5122b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956036/reserved-seats-case-justice-mandokhail-says-ros-rightly-showed-41-candidates-as-independents' target='_blank'><strong>Reserved seats case: Justice Mandokhail says ROs rightly showed 41 candidates as independents</strong></a><br><p>Supreme Court’s Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail has observed that returning officers (ROs) correctly prepared lists of 41 independent candidates during the 2024 general elections, as it was PTI’s decision-makers who “compelled” them to contest in that manner.
Justice Mandokhail, a member of the now-defunct Constitutional Bench (CB), made the observation in his additional note in the reserved seats review case. In its June 27 ruling, the CB, by a majority of seven judges, had overturned the earlier SC judgment of July 12, 2024 that had granted reserved seats to the PTI.
While seven judges had accepted all review petitions filed by the ruling coalition parties, three others — including Justice Mandokhail — had partially allowed them, and two had rejected the pleas outright on the first day of the hearing.
Justice Mandokhail had maintained his original July 2024 order of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats. In his note uploaded on the SC website on Tuesday, the judge detailed the reasoning for his ruling and how the CB could not include all judges who were part of the original bench due to the post-26th Amendment scenario.
“Apparently, it was the PTI’s decision-makers’ decision, which compelled the 41 candidates and others to submit their nomination papers independently,” Justice Mandokhail wrote, adding that the majority of the original SC bench did not “consider this important aspect of the case”.
The judge noted that to the extent of those 41 candidates, the ROs “correctly prepared [a] list of contesting candidates while drawing Form-33, showing them as independents” and those 41 individuals then joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) by exercising their right provided under Article 51 (6d) of the Constitution.
 
 

Justice Mandokhail pointed out that the 41 candidates had declared themselves as independents in their nomination papers submitted by Dec 24, 2023, which was before the January 2024 SC verdict that revoked the PTI’s bat symbol — the same judgment that PTI argued led to “peculiar circumstances” and therefore the independent declarations.
PTI’s Salman Akram Raja said that the party “administration had decided that the candidates should submit their nomination papers independently to avoid any unwarranted situation”, the note recalled.
“They did not claim to be affiliated with PTI nor showed their intention to leave SIC and join any other party. Under such circumstances, how could it be presumed that their declaration as independent candidates was on account of that judgment?” Justice Mandokhail said.
He added that if Raja’s contention about peculiar circumstances was “believed to be correct, a question arises as to how those 39 returned candidates and the number of others who lost elections, submitted their nomination papers declaring themselves as PTI’s candidates?”
However, about the 39 PTI-backed people who had submitted their party nomination papers, Justice Mandokhail maintained that the ROs and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had “mis-exercised their jurisdiction by declaring the PTI’s 39 affiliated candidates as independents [and] by refusing to allot reserved seats to PTI on the strength of its affiliated returned candidates”.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan then, the CB, through a short order on June 27, had overturned the July 12, 2024 majority judgment that declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies.
Majority of CB refused ‘best solution’ on way to include original bench judges
In his additional note, Justice Mandokhail also touched upon the matter of not being able to include judges from the SC bench that gave the original July 2024 verdict.
He noted that after the 26th Amendment, the CB was specifically authorised to hear constitutional matters and hence, a 13-member CB was formed out of the 15 judges nominated by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP). The bench excluded Justices Shakeel Ahmad and Ishtiaq Ibrahim as they were part of the Peshawar High Court bench whose order had been challenged.
While the judge stated it was “not practicable” to fix the petitions before the same bench that had delivered the judgment under review, he noted that the purpose of fixing the review pleas before the same judges was “to ensure judicial continuity and consistency”.
“There is no bar upon the JCP to nominate all judges of the Supreme Court,” Justice Mandokhail maintained.
“In order to make it practicable to fix these CRPs (civil review petitions) before the same bench, I proposed that the matter be referred to the JCP to nominate the rest of the members of the original bench,” he wrote, as that would allow the constitutional committee to reconstitute the CB and include the original bench’s judges.
 
 

“Had the matter been referred to the JCP, the [Supreme Court Rules] of 1980
could have been implemented within the parameters of the Constitution. It was the best solution to resolve the problem, which would have fostered
public trust and confidence in the judiciary.
“However, the majority members of the CB did not agree and decided to proceed with the matter through the available members nominated by the JCP,” Justice Mandokhail revealed.
‘Presumption that 41 were PTI candidates not supported by any evidence’
In its detailed judgment released last month, the CB ruled that the original SC verdict was not justified in granting relief to PTI by invoking Article 187 of the Constitution — which empowers the court to do complete justice — when no issue regarding the grant of reserved seats to the party was pending before it.
In the detailed verdict, 10 judges of the 12-judge CB held that there was no justification in giving relief to the PTI under Article 187, especially when appeals were filed and pursued by the SIC under Article 185(3) (appeal against high court order) of the Constitution.
 
 

Now, in his additional note, Justice Mandokhail explained that the majority members of the original bench declared 41 MNAs as independents and gave them an option to join any political party within 15 days, “despite the fact that the matter of 41 candidates was never pending before the Supreme Court as well as before any of the fora below”.
“The decision of the majority members proves the fact that those 41 candidates were actually independents,” the judge observed.
“By now, it is well settled that a candidate who is elected with an affiliation of a particular political party or after being elected independently, joins any political party, cannot leave that particular party nor can join another,” Justice Mandokhail observed, adding if the candidate does so, he will face the consequences of losing his seat, as provided by Article 63A(1) of the Constitution.
“We have already held that no authority including the Supreme Court has the power to declare a candidate independent or change his status contrary to his declaration,” Justice Mandokhail emphasised.
He added that while there was no doubt on the SC’s jurisdiction under Article 187 to do complete justice in a matter pending before it, such power was not unlimited and hence, “cannot be expanded in any circumstance”.
 
 

Noting that pendency of a matter was a condition precedent under Article 187, the judge pointed out that “there was no matter pending before the Supreme Court with regard to declaring 41 candidates as independents nor did they claim such relief”.
Justice Mandokhail further said the majority members of July 2024 order “overlooked Article 51(6)(d) and consequences of Article 63A(1) of the Constitution” in declaring the 41 MNAs as independents.
“The presumption of majority members that those 41 candidates belonged to PTI has not been supported by any evidence or material available before them,” he wrote.
The labelling of those 41 lawmakers as independents and the option given to them to join a party in 15 days was “an error of the Constitution and law, as well as an error of facts floating on the surface of the record”, the judge declared.
 
 

Justice Mandokhail also acknowledged, “Judges are humans and humans are bound to make mistakes, which is a normal human psyche.
“The Supreme Court is the ultimate forum having inherent powers,” he added, noting that it had the power under Article 188 to review any judgment “only when serious injustice could be seen in its judgment or order on account of clear and evident mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record”.
“A mistake or an error in the judgment under review can only be corrected when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character, leading to a miscarriage of justice make it necessary to revisit the matter with a view to correction or improvement in the judgment, not to substitute its view,” Justice Mandokhail said.</p><small>2025-11-19 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19182056d287833.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956077/cm-maryam-announces-allocation-of-80-e-buses-for-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>CM Maryam announces allocation of 80 e-buses for Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday announced the allocation of 80 electric buses for Rawalpindi, aiming to improve public transportation and reduce congestion.
The chief minister was scheduled to inaugurate the new transport system in the garrison city on October 15, but the ceremony was cancelled due to the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan protest in Islamabad.
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of the electric bus initiative in Rawalpindi today, CM Maryam said, “The electric buses are equipped with modern amenities, including air conditioning, free Wi-Fi, and charging ports.”
The initiative, the chief minister highlighted, is part of a broader effort to enhance infrastructure and public services in Rawalpindi. Other projects include signal-free corridors, flyovers, and hospitals.
“The government has allocated significant funds for road construction and improvement,” she said, adding that the electric buses are part of a larger plan to promote sustainable transportation and reduce pollution.
“The buses are wheelchair accessible and have dedicated compartments for women,” CM Maryam pointed out.
She detailed that the fare for the buses is Rs20, with free travel for women, the elderly, and children with special needs.
“The government has also launched initiatives to improve healthcare, education, and social welfare,” CM Maryam said. “New hospitals and schools are being built, and existing ones are being upgraded.”
“Crime has reduced by 70 per cent in Punjab, and efforts are being made to further improve public safety,” she claimed. “The initiatives are part of a broader effort to promote development and improve the quality of life for citizens.”
Earlier today, Dawn reported that in the first phase, 45 e-buses will be operated on four routes and the number of buses will be expanded in the coming days.
“As Kutchery Chowk remodeling project is in progress, it is not included among the routes,” said Regional Transport Authority (RTA) Secretary Asad Shirazi told Dawn earlier.
A total of seven buses will be operated from Saddar to Qabristan Chowk at Misrial Road via Qasim Market, Shalley Valley (total 7 kilometres), eight buses on the second route from Fawara Chowk to Koral Chowk via Liaquat Bagh and Sir Syed Road and the Old Airport Road (11.3 kilometres) and seven buses on the third route will be from Saddar Metro Bus Station to Munawar Colony via Tulsa Road.
Moreover, 14 buses will be operated on the fourth route from Marrir Metro Bus Station to the Motorway Chowk via The Mall and Peshawar Road (13.1 kilometres).</p><small>2025-11-19 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/191659288039c6a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956074/karachi-mayor-briefs-industrialists-on-project-to-recycle-sewage-water-for-industrial-use' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi mayor briefs industrialists on project to recycle sewage water for industrial use</strong></a><br><p>Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday met with industrialists in the metropolis’s SITE Area and Haroonabad and briefed them on ongoing sewage treatment and water recycling projects aimed at industrial use.
The mayor, accompanied by a delegation of industrialists, conducted a detailed visit to the SITE Limited Sewerage Treatment Plant. On the occasion, Chief Executive Officer of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), Ahmed Ali Siddiqui, briefed the mayor and the industrialists on the technical aspects and the current status of the treatment plants.
“For the first time in Karachi’s history, a formal process of treating wastewater and recycling it for industrial purposes is being initiated to provide industries with a reliable, sustainable and uninterrupted water supply,” Wahab said.
He added that the TP-III treatment facility in Mauripur has become operational again after a long time, and after 25 years, complete cleaning and rehabilitation work has been carried out at the TP-I treatment plant in Haroonabad, while construction at the TP-I plant located behind the SITE Industrial Area is progressing rapidly.
“The deadline for the completion of the first phase of the project has been set for December 31,” Wahab said. “In the initial phase, 20 MGD (million gallons per day) of water will be treated at the secondary level, while 1 million gallons of water per day will be recycled for industrial use.”
A key objective of this project is to prevent untreated wastewater from flowing into the sea, thereby protecting marine life and the environment. International standards and SDGs have been kept in view while planning and executing this initiative.
Wahab further stated that industries in Karachi require approximately 150 MGD of water daily, and this project will help meet at least 150 million gallons of this industrial demand.
He expressed hope that, if the recycled water system runs successfully, Karachi will earn the distinction of establishing Pakistan’s first “Industrial Water Park“.
Wahab added that the PPP government is taking serious and result-oriented measures to ensure a sustainable, safe, and quality-controlled water supply to the city’s industries.
“This project will play a vital role in Karachi’s industrial growth and long-term economic stability,” the mayor emphasised.</p><small>2025-11-19 12:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1915471063008c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956043/us-european-countries-call-on-iran-to-work-with-un-watchdog' target='_blank'><strong>US, European countries call on Iran to work with UN watchdog</strong></a><br><p>Iran must “cooperate fully” with the UN’s nuclear watchdog, according to a draft resolution submitted to the agency’s board by Britain, France, Germany and the United States, and seen by AFP on Wednesday.
Tensions between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog have repeatedly flared in recent years, with relations being further strained in the wake of a 12-day war in June that saw Israeli and US strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities.
Since the war, agency inspectors have not been granted access to key nuclear sites such as Fordo and Natanz, which were hit in the strikes in June, but they have been able to visit other sites.
The draft, which is expected to be voted on by the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) during its meeting this week, stresses that it is “imperative” for Iran to comply with its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
It also urges Iran to provide “access that the agency requests”.
Last week, the IAEA called on Iran to allow it to verify its enriched uranium inventories, especially its sensitive stockpile of highly enriched uranium that was “long overdue”, according to a confidential report seen by AFP.
“Iran has failed over the past five months to provide the IAEA with requested information regarding the status of its enriched uranium stockpiles and safeguarded nuclear facilities,” the resolution reads.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that the country had no undeclared uranium enrichment sites.
Araghchi added there was “no enrichment” taking place at present because the sites were damaged in the recent war with Israel.
The assertion came after US media outlets, including the Washington Post and the New York Times, reported that Iran had accelerated construction at a secret underground nuclear site called “Pickaxe Mountain”, or Kuh-e Kolang, near its Natanz facility.
In mid-June, Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran, triggering a 12-day war during which the US briefly joined with strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.
In the aftermath of the war, Tehran suspended its cooperation with the IAEA and restricted the watchdog’s inspectors from accessing the bombed sites, accusing it of bias and failing to condemn the attacks.
During Sunday’s forum in Tehran, Iranian officials warned the UN body against adopting an anti-Iran resolution.
“In case of a resolution, Iran will consider a review of its relations with the IAEA and will conduct a fundamental review,” said Iran’s deputy foreign minister Kazem Gharibabadi.</p><small>2025-11-19 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19162601b80038b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956030/report-submitted-to-us-congress-mentions-pakistans-military-success-over-india-during-may-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Report submitted to US Congress mentions Pakistan’s ‘military success’ over India during May conflict</strong></a><br><p>A report submitted to the US Congress has mentioned Pakistan’s “military success” over India during the four-day conflict in May this year.
“Pakistan’s military success over India in its four-day clash showcased Chinese weaponry,” said a report submitted to the US Congress on Tuesday by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, formed to report on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the US and China.
Pakistan initially said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat during the conflict, but later raised the tally to seven. Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and says it hit 26 Indian targets after three air bases were targeted. US President Donald Trump, who continues to comment on the conflict, most recently said that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.
In its annual report, the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission referred to the May conflict and said that China used it to “test and promote its own defence capabilities”.
The report submitted to Congress also highlighted China’s role in the conflict, saying that it drew global attention as “Pakistan’s military relied upon Chinese weaponry and reportedly leveraged Chinese intelligence”.
It also cited New Delhi’s claims of China helping Pakistan with “live inputs on Indian military positions throughout the crisis”, adding that “Pakistan denied these allegations, and China neither confirmed nor denied its degree of involvement”.
According to the report, China expanded its military cooperation with Pakistan in 2025, “compounding its own security tensions with India”.
In November and December 2024, China and Pakistan held the three-week Warrior-VIII counter-terrorism drills, and in February this year, China’s navy participated in Pakistan’s multinational AMAN drills, the report recalled, adding that these exercises highlighted “growing defence cooperation” between the two countries.
“India’s commentators viewed the drills as losses in their relationship with
China and as direct security threats to its territorial positions,” the report said.
Referring to the May conflict, the report said, “While [the] characterisation of this conflict as a ‘proxy war’ may overstate China’s role as an instigator, Beijing opportunistically leveraged the conflict to test and advertise the sophistication of its weapons, useful in the context of its ongoing border tensions with India and its expanding defence industry goals.”
The report also mentioned that as Pakistan’s largest defence supplier, China provided approximately 82 per cent of the country’s arms imports from 2019 to 2023.
The May clash was the first time China’s modern weapons systems, including the HQ-9 air defence system, PL-15 air-to-air missiles and J-10 fighter aircraft, were used in active combat, serving as a real-world field experiment, the report added.
It also stated that China reportedly offered to sell 40 J-35 fifth-generation fighter jets, KJ-500 aircraft and ballistic missile defence systems to Pakistan in June. “That same month, Pakistan announced a 20pc increase in its 2025–2026 defence budget, raising planned expenditures to $9 billion despite an overall budget decrease.”
“In the weeks after the conflict, Chinese embassies hailed the successes of its systems in the India-Pakistan clash, seeking to bolster weapons sales,” the report alleged.
It also mentioned allegations by the French intelligence of China initiating a
“disinformation campaign to hinder sales of French Rafales in favour of its own J-35s” and using “fake social media accounts to propagate AI and video game images of supposed ‘debris’ from the planes China’s weaponry destroyed”.
 
 

The conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p><small>2025-11-19 12:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19143238d834fb3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956039/court-finds-sania-zehras-husband-guilty-of-her-murder-sentences-him-to-death' target='_blank'><strong>Court finds Sania Zehra’s husband guilty of her murder, sentences him to death</strong></a><br><p>An additional district and sessions judge in Multan has sentenced to death the husband of the 20-year-old pregnant woman who was killed last year in Multan, it emerged on Wednesday.
Sania Zehra — a mother of two — was found dead in her room on July 9 2024, hanging from a ceiling fan. Her father, Syed Asad Abbas, had claimed that her sudden death was not a suicide but an alleged murder. He said his daughter’s in-laws were disguising the murder as a suicide.
A first information report (FIR) was registered at the New Multan police station on his complaint under Sections 148 (rioting armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
In a one-page court order, dated November 18 — a copy of which is available with Dawn — Additional Sessions judge Mohsin Ali Khan ruled that Syed Muhammad Ali Raza has been “duly convicted of the Qatal-i-Amd of Sania Zehra deceased,” and sentenced the convict to “death as Ta’zir under Section 302 (b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).”
“Syed Muhammad Ali Raza convict, shall be hanged by neck till his death is pronounced,” the court order read.
According to Section 302(b) of the PPC, “whoever commits Qatal-i-Amd shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life as ta’zir.”
The court also directed the convict to pay Rs500,000 to the victim’s family as compensation under Section 554-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898,“ adding that “in case of default he (the convict) shall undergo imprisonment for six months.”
In two separate court orders — both seen by Dawn — the brother of the main convict, Syed Haider Raza, and his mother, Syeda Azra Parveen, were also found guilty of the murder of Zehra.
The court sentenced them both to life imprisonment and directed each of them to pay Rs500,00 to the family of the victims.
Sania Zehra case
In July 2024, a 20-year-old pregnant mother of two was found dead in Multan. The FIR, which narrated the victim’s father’s complaint, stated that he received a call from a police official, who asked him to head to his daughter’s residence.
The complaint said that after the family reached the scene, they found the victim hanging from a ceiling fan. It said that when the forensic specialist arrived at the scene and tried to untie the noose around the victim’s neck, it opened up quite easily. It said that a doctor present at the scene said that the victim had died at 6pm that day.
The police registered a case under sections 302, 148, and 149 of the PPC against the husband of the deceased, Ali Raza, his brother Ali Haider, father Jeevan Shah, mother Azra Bibi, sister Kanwal Bibi, and sister-in-law Syeda Dua on the complaint of the deceased’s father.</p><small>2025-11-19 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19152549b4f7bf7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956037/ajks-18-new-ministers-take-oath-of-office-2-advisers-appointed' target='_blank'><strong>AJK’s 18 new ministers take oath of office; 2 advisers appointed</strong></a><br><p>A day after newly-elected Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore’s oath-taking, 18 legislators from the PPP were sworn in as ministers for his cabinet on Wednesday.
The oath to the 18 ministers was administered at Aiwan-i-Sadr in Muzaffarabad by AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, who was substituting as the acting president due to the illness of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood. Mahmood reportedly could not travel to the regional capital due to health issues.
PM Rathore, as well as former AJK premiers Sardar Tanveer Ilyas and Haji Yaqoob Khan, were also present on the occasion. A large number of PPP workers and supporters, as well as several senior civil servants, also attended the ceremony.
The newly-appointed ministers are Mian Abdul Waheed, Sardar Javed Ayoub, Javed Iqbal Budhanvi, Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, Amar Yasin, Sardar Ziaul Qamar, Syed Bazil Ali Naqvi, Nabila Ayub Khan, Deevan Ali Chughtai, Malik Zafar Iqbal, Chaudhry Arshad, Chaudhry Muhammad Rasheed, Yasir Sultan, Sardar Muhammad Hussain, Chaudhry Akhlaq, Faheem Akhtar Rabbani, Rafique Nayyar and Ali Shan Soni.
Of them, the first eight were elected on the PPP ticket in 2021. The rest had contested the elections on the PTI ticket and recently joined the PPP.
Nabila Ayub Khan is the only female minister in the cabinet who was elected on a reserved seat. No MLA elected on refugee seats has been inducted in the cabinet.
The portfolios of cabinet members were not immediately announced. A notification issued later in the day said  Mian Abdul Waheed was designated as the most senior minister.
At the oath-taking ceremony, a notification of the appointment of two advisers to the government was read by the secretary of services and general administration. Sardar Ahmad Saghir, whose mother Shahida Saghir is a directly elected MLA, and Sardar Fahad Yaqoob, son of Haji Yaqoob, have been appointed as the advisers.
Shahida was also elected on a PTI ticket but deserted the party afterwards and joined the PPP recently.
The AJK Constitution legitimises the appointment of advisers to the government, but it is silent on their oath-taking. Nevertheless, an oath was administered to the two new advisers by PM Rathore.
Rathore was sworn in as the new AJK premier on Tuesday, a day after Chaudhry Anwarul Haq was ousted through a vote of no-confidence. He is the fourth PM elected in AJK in as many years.</p><small>2025-11-19 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19072416ca82d66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955967/pti-says-imrans-sisters-manhandled-violently-detained-by-police-while-camped-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>PTI says Imran’s sisters manhandled, ‘violently detained’ by police while camped outside Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>The PTI said late on Tuesday that police manhandled and “violently detained” the sisters of ex-premier Imran Khan from outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with the party founder.
The PTI had held a protest outside the jail on Tuesday, where Imran is currently incarcerated, but the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him. Subsequently, the party held a sit-in outside the jail and criticised the prison administration for violating the court order in this regard.
In a post on social media platform X after midnight, the party said Aleema Khan, Noreen Niazi and Dr Uzma Khan were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when the police action happened.
It added that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi, MNA Shahid Khattak and other party workers, including several women, were “subjected to violence and picked up by police”.
“What should be routine weekly court-mandated family visits, in accordance with Imran Khan’s rights as a prisoner, are being used as a tool of oppression and violence against his family members and supporters,” the party said.
 






Videos shared by the party on social media platform X showed workers, Aleema and Uzma gathered around Noreen, who appeared visibly shaken. “Those women were dragging [her] on the road,” Aleema said as Noreen’s hands trembled.
In a later video shared by the party, Noreen said that female police officials grabbed her by her hair and forced her down to the ground. “I didn’t understand it. I still don’t understand what happened,” she said, asserting that PTI workers were sitting peacefully outside the jail.
 






Aleema said that at one point, Noreen was “practically unconscious” as she was dragged on the floor. “Thank goodness we saw and managed to set her free,” she said.
She also asserted that the incident would not “scare us”, adding that a press conference would be held later. “The way the women dragged us, ripped away our chaddors … they should be ashamed.”
Aleema also alleged that her and her sisters were denied a meeting with Imran as “Asim Munir’s notification has not yet been signed”.
 






In another post, the party condemned the “inhumane, unlawful, and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family members. It said that the PTI founder’s sisters, along with his legal team, had arrived at the jail to meet him on Tuesday but were denied the meeting and forced to wait until night.
“By 10pm, despite spending twelve hours under severe distress, the Punjab government ordered an appalling operation that no civilised or democratic society could ever justify,” the PTI said.
 






It alleged that the area where Imran’s sisters were seated was “intentionally flooded with water”.
“The lights were switched off to plunge the entire place into darkness, and in the ensuing chaos, police physically assaulted Imran Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Noreen Khan and Uzma Khan,” it added.
It further said that one of the sisters was dragged “across the road, manhandled, and violently detained despite her cries and the pleas of those present”.
“This level of state oppression and cruelty represents an unprecedented assault on basic human dignity, constitutional freedoms, and moral norms,” it said.
Meanwhile, a senior Rawalpindi police official told Dawn that no action was taken against the PTI protesters. He said that they were only removed from the road they were occupying.
Later, in the afternoon today, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja held a press conference along with Imran’s sisters and party leaders.
He said the PTI would approach the Supreme Court with the appeal that when Imran’s family and party workers were barred from meeting the PTI founder, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) “remained silent”.
The PTI had previously moved the IHC, seeking meetings with Imran. The IHC had issued a verbal order, directing the relevant authorities to allow the meetings. Yet, there has been a restriction on meetings.
Aleema also addressed the press conference, maintaining all their protests outside Adiala Jail had been peaceful. She alleged that one of her sisters, who is a doctor, was “detained by police for hours last week” and police personnel stationed outside the jail had been “misbehaving” with them.
“Yesterday, too, we weren’t allowed to meet [Imran] and were protesting peacefully,” she said.
‘Our collective humiliation’
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the police action against Imran’s sisters and a member of his cabinet.
“The attempt to arrest MNA Shahid Khattak and other provincial and national assembly members is also condemnable,” he said, adding that things were now progressing to a point of no return.
 






“This is today’s Pakistan — where the sanctity of a woman’s veil is violated. The sisters’ only fault was that they came to meet their brother,” said ex-president Arif Alvi.
 






“With every crime, the usurpers feel more and more immune. Abductions, arrests, raids, military court trials, rigged elections, amendments — all are connected. Every time they get away with no accountability, they feel more immune. Every time the bureaucracy, media, and judiciary, instead of resisting falls in line, they are emboldened,” said activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir.
He said that the Iddat case against Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi, the recent discourse on an article published by The Economist about the couple and the manhandling of the PTI founder’s sister all served one purpose: to humiliate.
“It is a fallacy to think this is Imran Khan’s or PTI’s humiliation alone. It is our collective humiliation. We are all being shown the price of dissent, the price of seeking justice, demanding democracy, and resisting oppression,” he said.
 






Senior journalist Hamid Mir said that the current regime was not realising that the “inhumane and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family was tarnishing the country’s image globally.
“It’s becoming difficult for our diplomats serving in the West to defend at public forums,” he said.
 






Journalist Shahzad Iqbal termed the “dragging and manhandling [of] Imran Khan’s elderly sisters” a “shameless act of oppression”.
A day ago, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz “was saying we don’t indulge in politics or revenge and victimisation, and then imagine this happening in her provincial jurisdiction,” Iqbal added.
 






“Which Pakistan is this? What humanity is this?” asked Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. He said that the police action against Imran’s sisters was a “slap in the face of humanity and an example of the worst abuse of state power”.
“Those who lay their hands on women are neither worthy of being called Muslims nor Pakistanis,” he said.
 






PTI firebrand leader Sher Afzal Marwat condemned the treatment meted out to Noreen.
“Such brutality against a citizen — let alone a woman — is unacceptable. The state has reached a new low, and this abuse of power must end!” he said.
 






PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari said police had demonstrated “highly despicable behaviour” by attacking Imran’s sisters.
“We strongly condemn this disgraceful and unjustifiable act by the police,” he said.

Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenish water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Data from Punjab’s disaster management authority shows this year’s floods affected at least 4.7 million people across 4,700 villages.
Speaking at a press conference with National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik in Islamabad today, the climate change minister stated that “climate-induced disasters must be treated as a political priority,” noting that the 2022 floods alone caused losses exceeding 9 per cent of the GDP.
“Since 2010, there have been four to five floods. The most recent one, which has passed, its [damage] is still being assessed,” Dr Malik pointed out. “[Over 4,500] people have died in these floods. This many people don’t die in wars.”
He said the country’s political discourse ignores those most affected by extreme weather, describing climate vulnerability as the “core” around which national politics should revolve.
He said the prime minister chaired a detailed meeting earlier in the day where and was presented with assessments of riverine flooding, mountain torrents, urban flooding, coastal risks and glacial lake outburst floods.
 






According to Dr Malik, the government will ensure a three-tier approach: a 240 to 250-day “fix what is broken” phase focused on repairing damaged dykes and floodgates; a one-to-three-year expansion phase to upgrade undersized infrastructure such as Karachi’s drainage; and a three-to-five-year programme to build resilient systems.
The minister said the prime minister has also directed the integration of early warning systems at the tehsil and district levels, shifting alerts away from Islamabad so that local administrations receive the initial alarms.
Temporary schooling for displaced children, mobile healthcare units for injured survivors, and community-level training in vulnerable districts are also part of the short-term plan.
The NDMA chairman highlighted that Pakistan remains among the world’s most climate-affected countries. He said NDMA’s forecast indicates that the 2026 monsoon could bring 22pc to 26pc more intense weather compared to this year.
“Disaster management is a devolved subject, but provinces and the federation have to work together [to combat losses],” he said, adding that tourism and movement would be controlled in June and July to mitigate damage.</p><small>2025-11-19 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/19104655deef3c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956019/air-india-lobbies-to-use-airspace-over-chinas-xinjiang-as-financial-woes-from-pakistan-ban-mount' target='_blank'><strong>Air India lobbies to use airspace over China’s Xinjiang as financial woes from Pakistan ban mount</strong></a><br><p>Air India is lobbying the Indian government to convince China to let it use a sensitive military airspace zone in Xinjiang to shorten routes as the financial toll from a ban on Indian carriers flying over Pakistan mounts, a company document shows.
The unusual request comes just weeks after direct India-China flights resumed after a five-year hiatus following a Himalayan border clash between the nations.
Air India has been seeking to rebuild its reputation and international network after a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed in Gujarat in June, killing 260 people and forcing it to briefly cut flights for safety checks.
But that effort is being complicated by the closure of Pakistan airspace to Indian carriers since diplomatic tensions erupted in late April.
For Air India, the country’s only carrier with a major international network, fuel costs have risen by as much as 29 per cent and journey times by up to three hours on some long-haul routes, according to the previously unreported document submitted to Indian officials in late October and reviewed by Reuters.
The Indian government is reviewing Air India’s plea to diplomatically ask China to allow an alternative routing and emergency access to airports in case of diversions at Hotan, Kashgar and Urumqi in Xinjiang, aiming to reach US, Canada and Europe faster, the document said.
“Air India’s long-haul network is under severe operational and financial strain … Securing Hotan route will be a strategic option,” it added.
The airline, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, estimated the Pakistan airspace closure’s impact on its profit before tax at $455 million annually — a significant amount given its fiscal 2024-25 loss stood at $439m.
The Chinese foreign ministry said it was not aware of the situation and referred Reuters to the “relevant authorities”.
Air India and civil aviation authorities in India, China and Pakistan did not respond to Reuters’ queries.
Without Hotan, some routes becoming ‘unviable’
The Chinese airspace Air India is seeking to access is ringed by some of the world’s highest mountains of 20,000 feet or more, and is avoided by international airlines due to potential safety risks in case of a decompression incident.
More critically, it also falls within People’s Liberation Army’s Western Theatre Command, which is equipped with extensive missile, drone and air-defence assets and shares some airports with civilian aircraft, military analysts say.
The Pentagon’s December report on China’s military said the command’s responsibilities include responding to any conflict with India.
China’s military has much greater control of the country’s airspace than in most other aviation markets, restricting flight paths. Open-source intelligence tracker Damien Symon said China’s military has recently expanded an airbase at Hotan.
China’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Data from AirNav Radar shows no non-Chinese airlines departed or arrived at Hotan airport in the last 12 months.
Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said: “Air India can try, but it’s doubtful China will accede” to access given the region’s terrain, lack of emergency airports and possibility of security issues.
Airspace globally has been constricted due to proliferating conflict zones.
 
 

US carriers have been banned from flying over Russia since the Ukraine war began in 2022 and pulled out of many US-India routes. That gave Air India a near-monopoly on non-stop flights from India.
But after the Pakistan airspace closure, Air India’s Delhi-Washington route was suspended in August. Now other routes are under review, with the direct Mumbai- and Bengaluru to San Francisco routes “becoming unviable” due to an additional three hours of travel time, including a technical stop in Kolkata, the document said.
A flight from San Francisco to Mumbai on Lufthansa via Munich is now only five minutes longer than on Air India.
“Passengers (are) shifting to foreign carriers due to shorter flight time as they have the benefit of Pakistan overflight,” the document said.
Air India estimates the requested Hotan route in China could substantially cut extra fuel requirements and flight times, help restore passenger and cargo capacity it trimmed by as much as 15pc on routes like New York- and Vancouver-Delhi, and reduce losses by an estimated $1.13m per week.
Cash flow burden deepens finance woes
With no signs of airspace ban easing, Air India also wants “temporary subsidy till Pakistan airspace opens”, the document said.
Air India, which has placed $70 billion of aircraft orders, is seeking help resolving legacy tax issues.
India’s government indemnified the airline against claims payable before selling it to Tata in 2022, but several notices have been received related to old tax liabilities of $725m, raising legal and reputation risks, the document said.
A confidential government notice from March, seen by Reuters, showed tax authorities warned of “coercive steps” — which can include freezing of assets — to recover dues of $58m in one case.
Contesting such tax demands has led to “additional cashflow burden … despite assurances during disinvestment”, the airline said.</p><small>2025-11-19 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/191128557dc5377.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956017/2026-fifa-world-cup-draw-picture-gets-clearer-after-dramatic-night-of-action' target='_blank'><strong>2026 FIFA World Cup draw picture gets clearer after dramatic night of action</strong></a><br><p>A dramatic night of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup across the globe ended with joy and heartbreak in equal measure, and with 42 of the 48 teams at next year’s showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico now known.
Scotland, in hair-raising fashion, and Austria, after snatching a late equaliser, ensured they will be appearing at the World Cup for the first time since 1998, joining Spain, Belgium and Switzerland as the final five of the 12 automatic qualifiers from Europe.
Across the Atlantic, Curacao became the smallest country to ever win a berth at the finals, joining Haiti and Panama in locking up the three automatic berths from the North and Central American region.
In Asia, Iraq kept their World Cup qualification dream alive with a penalty in the 17th minute of injury time to secure a place in the six-team inter-confederation play-off tournament in March.
Bolivia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, New Caledonia, Suriname and Jamaica are the other teams in the playoff with two spots up for grabs.
The remaining four berths at the World Cup will be filled from Europe, through UEFA’s 16-team playoffs.
The draw for the World Cup is set for December 5 in Washington, DC.

Scotland’s stunning late show
At a rocking Hampden Park in Glasgow, injury-time wonder-goals by Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean handed Scotland a stunning 4-2 win over Denmark that secured top spot in Group ‘C’.
Level at 2-2 as the clock ticked past 90, Denmark were set to advance to the World Cup as group winners until Tierney curled in an exquisite finish from distance three minutes into injury time.
McLean then put the match beyond doubt as he lifted the ball over Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, who was well off his line, from the halfway line on 98 minutes.
“That just sums up this squad,” captain Andy Robertson told the BBC. “Never say die. We just keep going right to the end and one of the craziest games.
“We put the country through it, but I’m sure it’s worth it. We’re going to the World Cup.”

Earlier, Napoli midfielder Scott McTominay had given the hosts a third-minute lead with a towering overhead kick.
McTominay’s clubmate Rasmus Hojlund levelled for Denmark from the spot just shy of the hour, before his side went down to 10 as Rasmus Kristensen picked up a second booking.
An anxious Hampden Park let out a roar of ecstasy and relief in the 78th minute as Lawrence Shankland turned in from close range.
But Denmark struck back again through Patrick Dorgu four minutes later before Tierney and McLean stole the headlines.
Denmark, who only needed to avoid defeat to make sure of their third successive World Cup finals appearance, were left crestfallen.
From a position of control in the group they managed only one point from their last two games, including the home draw with Belarus on Saturday, which opened the door for Scotland to seal an automatic place with victory on Tuesday.
The Danes were the better side for most of the night too but must now face last-chance saloon in the playoffs.
“I thought we were pretty rubbish to be honest, but who cares?” Scotland talisman John McGinn said.
Austria’s late leveller
Michael Gregoritsch’s 77th-minute equaliser snatched Austria a 1-1 draw against visitors Bosnia that sealed top spot in Group ‘H’. Bosnia finished second in the group and go into the playoffs.
“I can’t believe it; we made it! I have been trying to reach the World Cup for 18 years. Finally now, at the end of my career, we got there. I can’t wait,” 36-year-old Austrian forward Marko Arnautovic said.
Needing a win to top the group and secure automatic qualification to their second World Cup after their maiden appearance in 2014, Bosnia stunned the home crowd when Haris Tabakovic headed in from close range to give them a 12th-minute lead.
The forward has now scored in each of their last three qualifiers, including in Saturday’s 3-1 win over Romania.

Ralf Rangnick’s Austria bounced back, retook control and put the ball in the net on the stroke of halftime but Konrad Laimer’s effort was overruled for a foul after a lengthy VAR review.
The visitors were content to sit back and soak up the pressure in the second half, hoping to catch Austria on the break.
But the hosts’ pressure eventually paid off when Gregoritsch saw Marcel Sabitzer’s cross sail past the Bosnian keeper before bouncing off the post and into his path for a powerful finish and his 23rd and most memorable international goal.
“It was difficult. It was really difficult,” Rangnick said. “Conceding a goal naturally made it even more difficult. But then we threw everything into it and were eventually rewarded. If Bosnia play like this, they will progress too.”
Spain, Switzerland qualify

Switzerland will appear in a sixth successive World Cup finals after drawing 1-1 in Pristina against Kosovo.
With the Swiss needing to avoid a defeat by six goals to seal top spot in Group ‘B’, they rarely looked troubled as Ruben Vargas handed them the lead in the 47th minute before Florent Muslija equalised.
Spain secured their place after a nervy 2-2 draw with Turkey in Seville, finishing unbeaten at the top of Group ‘E’ despite being given a genuine scare by their resilient visitors.
The European champions took an early lead through Dani Olmo in the fourth minute but Turkey, who needed an almost impossible seven-goal victory to claim the group, managed to equalise through Deniz Gul in the 42nd minute.
Turkey then stunned the home crowd by taking the lead in the 54th minute thanks to a Salih Ozcan strike from the edge of the box.
However, Mikel Oyarzabal levelled the match eight minutes later to avoid what would have been Spain’s first home defeat in a qualifier and Turkey had to settle for a place in the playoffs for next year’s finals in North America.

“We wanted to finish with a win and a clean sheet, so it’s bitter-sweet…
but we’re happy to qualify for the World Cup,” Olmo told TVE.
Belgium, semi-finalists in 2018, cruised into the draw for the World Cup with a Jeremy Doku-inspired 7-0 hammering of Liechtenstein.
The Manchester City winger grabbed a brace in Liege as Charles De Ketelaere also netted twice and Hans Vanaken, Brandon Mechele and Alexis Saelemaekers completed the rout.
In the other Group ‘J’ match, second-placed Wales also ran up seven goals as they beat North Macedonia 7-1 with Harry Wilson scoring a hat-trick of set-piece goals.
North Macedonia can, nonetheless, look forward to a play-off place courtesy of their Nations League performance.
Romania, who beat San Marino by the same scoreline, will also have the chance to reach the World Cup thanks to the Nations League after finishing third in Group ‘H’.
Sweden, who picked up just their second point of the qualifying campaign with a 1-1 home draw against Slovenia, advanced in the same manner.
Curacao seal fairytale
A nerve-shredding finale to the CONCACAF qualifying campaign saw Curacao — with a population of just 156,000 — squeeze into next year’s finals with a 0-0 draw against Jamaica in Kingston.
The team known as the ‘Blue Wave’ finished top of Group ‘B’ with 12 points from six games, one point clear of Jamaica.
Curacao, whose veteran Dutch coach Dick Advocaat was forced to miss the game due to a family issue in the Netherlands, are by far the smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup.
 






The previous smallest country to qualify for the tournament were Iceland in 2018, with a population of around 350,000.
Curacao finally booked their place after an extraordinary finale at Kingston’s National Stadium, where Jamaica — coached by former England manager Steve McClaren — launched a furious onslaught as they chased the win which would guarantee them a World Cup place at their opponent’s expense.
The Jamaicans hit the the woodwork three times in the second half, with substitute Bailey-Tye Cadamarteri going agonizingly close with a header that crashed off the post in the 87th minute.
There was more drama in store in stoppage time, when Jamaica were awarded a penalty after substitute Jeremy Antonisse’s sliding tackle brought down Dujuan Richards in the area.
Salvadoran referee Ivan Barton pointed to the spot to leave Curacao facing the prospect of a heartbreaking defeat.
But as Curacao’s players protested, the decision went to VAR and was dramatically overturned to leave the Caribbean islanders on course for the World Cup.
Haiti defy the odds
Haiti defied the odds to book their place, beating Nicaragua 2-0 in Curacao, where they have been forced to play their home fixtures because of the strife in their country, to finish top of Group ‘C’.
Haiti’s qualification was remarkable given that armed gangs have taken control of almost all of the capital, Port-au-Prince, in a conflict that has forced some 1.3 million people from their homes and fuelled famine-level hunger.
The levels of danger in Haiti are such that their coach, Sbastien Migne, has not been there since being appointed 18 months ago but the Frenchman has nevertheless managed to engineer a fairytale qualification their second after a first appearance in 1974.

Haiti started the final round of fixtures on Tuesday behind Honduras on goal difference, but goals from Louicious Deedson and Ruben Providence lifted them to 11 points, while Honduras drew 0-0 away at Costa Rica and finished on nine, missing out on a place in next year’s inter-continental playoffs on goal difference from Suriname.
Panama, meanwhile, grabbed the other automatic qualification spot on offer with a 3-0 win over El Salvador at home that saw them end up as winners of Group ‘A’.
Panama romped through their game, ahead early after a thunderous strike from wingback Cesar Blackman, with their second coming from the penalty spot courtesy of Eric Davis, who was in the squad when Panama made their only previous World Cup appearance in 2018.
Substitute Jose Luis Rodriguez added a third late in the game.
Suriname had been ahead of Panama on goal difference before the start of Tuesday’s games but lost 3-1 in Guatemala.
However, a late own goal kept them in World Cup contention as they will go, along with Jamaica, to the inter-confederation playoff tournament.
Iraq down UAE

In front of a packed-out Basra International Stadium, Iraq’s Amir Al-Ammari struck from the spot to claim a dramatic 2-1 home win over the United Arab Emirates and secure a 3-2 aggregate victory that took Graham Arnold’s side into March’s intercontinental playoffs.
After last week’s 1-1 first-leg draw, the UAE broke the deadlock in the 52nd minute on Tuesday, as Yahia Nader slipped the ball through for Brazilian-born forward Caio Lucas to fire the ball past Iraq goalkeeper Jalal Hachim.
Iraq, who are trying to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since their debut appearance in 1986, were second-best for much of the game but a set piece allowed Arnold’s side to pull level.
Al-Ammari swung his free kick from the left flank towards the six-yard box and Mohanad Ali’s header took a deflection off Nader that ensured goalkeeper Khalid Eisa had little chance of preventing the ball from crossing the line.
The home side piled on the pressure late on, with Ali missing two good chances to score a winner.
But VAR awarded Iraq the latest of penalties for a handball, and Al-Ammari stepped up to net the spot-kick and keep alive his nation’s hopes of ending their 40-year wait to play in a World Cup.

“Tonight, I’m pleased to announce that we’re taking our military cooperation to even greater heights by formally designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-Nato ally, which is something that is very important to them,” Trump said during a formal black-tie dinner at the White House.
“And I’m just telling you now for the first time, because they wanted to keep a little secret for tonight,” Trump said of the designation, which only 19 other countries have previously received.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

According to Politico, the other countries in that category include Israel, Jordan, Kuwait and Qatar.
The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments. US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June had made Saudi Arabia safer, Trump added.
Meanwhile, bin Salman had earlier promised to increase his country’s US investment to $1 trillion from a $600 billion pledge he made when Trump visited Saudi Arabia in May. But offered no details or timetable.
In his remarks at the dinner, the Saudi crown prince thanked Trump for the “warm welcome” accorded to him.
“This relationship started close to nine decades ago,” he said, adding that the two countries had worked together during this period.
“But today is a special day. We think the horizon of economic cooperation between US and Saudi Arabia, it’s bigger and wider,” he said, adding that the two were also signing agreements that would lead to deeper ties.
Defence agreement
Separately, a White House fact sheet said the two sides signed a Strategic Defence Agreement, which “fortifies deterrence across the Middle East,” makes it easier for US defense firms to operate in the country and secures “new burden-sharing funds from Saudi Arabia to defray US costs”.
The agreement appeared to fall short of the congressionally ratified Nato-style treaty Saudi Arabia initially sought.
The White House announced Trump had approved future deliveries of F-35 fighter jets and the Saudis had agreed to purchase 300 American tanks.
The sale of the stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, which has requested to buy 48 of the advanced aircraft, would mark the first US sale of the advanced fighter jets to Riyadh, a significant policy shift.
The deal could alter the military balance in the Middle East and test Washington’s definition of maintaining what the US has termed Israel’s “qualitative military edge”.
Until now, Israel has been the only country in the Middle East to have the F-35.
The two countries also signed a joint declaration on the completion of negotiations on civil nuclear energy cooperation, which the White House said would build the legal foundation for a long-term nuclear energy partnership.
Bin Salman has been seeking a deal to unlock access to US nuclear technology and help Saudi Arabia level up with the UAE and traditional regional foe Iran.
But progress on such a nuclear pact has been difficult because the Saudis have resisted a US stipulation that would rule out enriching uranium or reprocessing spent fuel.</p><small>2025-11-19 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/191202506d6e4c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956025/punjab-prosecutor-general-seeks-mechanism-for-verification-of-school-staff-faculty-using-sex-offender-database' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab prosecutor general seeks mechanism for verification of school staff, faculty using sex offender database</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab prosecutor general has sought a mechanism to check existing and future faculty and staff for any sex offender records in an effort to combat sexual violence at educational institutions, it emerged on Wednesday.
The proposal was made in a letter written on Tuesday by Punjab Prosecutor General Syed Farhad Ali Shah to the provincial Public Prosecution Department’s secretary, who will then forward the request to the federal law ministry.
The letter noted that the Sex Offenders Register, a countrywide database maintained by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), was a “powerful tool in the fight against sexual violence and for the protection of the most vulnerable in our society”.
However, Shah highlighted, there was a “critical gap in the safeguarding of educational institutions”.
 
 

He contended that the full potential of the database for preventative measures remained “largely untapped, particularly in environments where children and young adults are most susceptible”.
Therefore, the prosecutor general requested the Ministry of Law and Justice to develop and notify a formal mechanism that allowed “hiring authorities of all public and private educational institutions to request a character verification check specifically provided in the Sex Offenders Register maintained by Nadra, before completing the recruitment process”.
The mechanism should also enable the verification of “existing faculty members/teaching and non-teaching staff of educational institutions”, the letter added.
Shah further urged the law ministry to make this verification mandatory and a “non-negotiable part of the recruitment process for all staff, both teaching and non-teaching”. Clear guidelines be issued to all federal and provincial education departments, as well as to the administrations of universities, colleges and schools, the official requested.
Shah commended the promulgation of the Anti-Rape (Sex Offenders Register) Rules 2023 under the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021.
After various reforms in Pakistan’s anti-rape laws over the past decades, the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021 was hailed as a major milestone for victims. It expanded the definition of rape, introduced measures for time-bound trials for speedy justice for rape survivors and incorporated provisions for witness protection.
 
 

“Educational institutions-schools, colleges, and universities are meant to be safe havens for learning and growth,” the prosecutor general wrote.
He noted that the recruitment of faculty members, teaching staff, and non-teaching staff was currently based on academic credentials, professional experience, and background checks, “which cannot reveal a history of sexual offences”.
“This leaves a dangerous loophole through which a convicted sex offender could potentially gain employment in a position of trust and authority over students, thereby putting an entire student body at risk,” the official warned.
If implemented, the verification against the Sex Offenders Register “would serve as a robust deterrence and a proactive child protection measure”, the prosecutor general asserted.
“It would empower educational institutions to make informed hiring decisions and, most importantly, create a significantly safer environment for students, aligning perfectly with the spirit and objective of the anti-rape laws.”
During 2024, 1,828 out of 3,364 child abuse cases reported from all four provinces were cases of child sexual abuse, according to a report by Sahil.</p><small>2025-11-19 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/191102424500f05.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956023/punjab-govt-forms-12-jits-to-probe-cases-against-tlp' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt forms 12 JITs to probe cases against TLP</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government has formed 12 joint investigation teams (JITs) to probe several cases registered against the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in Lahore and Sheikhupura districts, it emerged on Wednesday.
The teams were notified by the provincial home department in similar notifications, of which 11 are dated November 6 and one was issued on October 31.
According to the notifications, seen by Dawn, the provincial government ordered the formation of five JITs under the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 for as many cases registered against the TLP in Sheikhupura district. Of these, four cases have been registered in Muridke tehsil and one in Ferozewala tehsil.
Another seven JITs have been formed to carry out the investigation in as many cases registered in Lahore. Of these cases, three have been registered in the  Nawankot area, three in Shahdara Town and one in the Ravi Road area.
For the cases registered in Sheikhupura, each JIT will comprise six members, including a superintendent of police (SP), sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), station house officer (SHO), investigating officer (IO), a representative from the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD) in the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP), and any co-opted member.
For the cases lodged in Lahore, each JIT is to have five members, including SP Investigation, DSP Investigation, IO, a representative from CTD in the rank of DSP and any co-opted member.
The notifications further added that the “convener of the JIT shall depute one of the members of the JIT, for the purpose of submission of the report,” as required by Section 19(1) of the ATA 1997.
Crackdown on TLP
In recent weeks, the Punjab government has intensified action against the TLP following a ban imposed on the party after a violent clash between TLP protesters and law enforcement personnel in Muridke last month.
The now-banned group had launched a protest march in support of Gaza and Palestine, planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration outside the US embassy. However, the group’s movement was thwarted as violent clashes erupted, with reports of party workers attacking law enforcement agencies.
Subsequently, the federal government imposed a ban on the party at the request of the Punjab government, concluding that TLP was “involved in terrorism and violent acts”.
 
 

Meanwhile, authorities continue to look for TLP Chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi, whose disappearance has seemingly baffled the Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies.
The TLP chief and his brother were marked as high-profile targets by the Punjab police for being wanted in more than 100 first information reports lodged against them.
On October 29, the duo, including 21 other senior TLP leaders, were placed on the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL) to prevent them from travelling abroad.
A senior officer in the Central Police Office (CPO) Lahore told Dawn on Nov 13 that so far, Lahore police have reportedly arrested a total of the group’s 1,250 key members, including their financiers and the workers wanted in over 100 criminal cases.
The official said the provincial capital has been the hub of activities of the TLP’s top leadership and other workers for housing the headquarters of party.
So, the major focus of the police remained on arrests of the hardcore members of the TLP from Lahore.
A list of the targeted TLP members was prepared on the basis of the geofencing carried out in Lahore’s route that they had used to launch the march on Islamabad and in Muridke, where they had encountered the LEAs.
The second list provided to all the 85 police stations of Lahore was of the financiers, the police official said, adding that the crackdowns continued daily.
As per sources, the sufferings of the families of the ‘wanted’ TLP members have increased manifold due to the frequent police raids at their homes.
A majority of the families have locked their houses and gone into hiding to avoid a police crackdown.
On Tuesday, Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari detailed that assets worth Rs23.40 billion belonging to the TLP had been frozen, along with 92 bank accounts linked to the organisation.</p><small>2025-11-19 07:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/190953501178cda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955983/confusion-deepens-over-relocation-of-islamabad-high-court-to-its-former-premises-at-g-10' target='_blank'><strong>Confusion deepens over relocation of Islamabad High Court to its former premises at G-10</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Confusion surrounding the supposed relocation of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to its former premises in G-10 has deepened after reports cited a November 7 letter that directed the shifting of official records to the old building.
The circulation of the letter on social media quickly gave rise to speculation that the high court itself was being moved, a claim denied by IHC senior hierarchy and the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA).
According to officials familiar with the development, the order to shift the record was issued solely to clear four courtrooms previously occupied by judges of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC).
These courtrooms were urgently needed for the shifting of the FSC judges as the authorities had planned establishment of the newly-formed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) in the building meant for FSC.

High court bar says administrative letter wrongly interpreted as relocation order

Under the initial plan, the FCC was to be housed in the FSC building, but judges of the Shariat Court resisted the unplanned relocation and refused to vacate their premises.
Their firm stance forced the authorities to make alternative arrangements, resulting in the temporary accommodation of FCC judges inside the IHC building.
 
 

So far, seven of the FCC’s sanctioned strength of 13 judges have been appointed through presidential orders, all of whom have taken oath and been allotted separate courtrooms within the IHC.
Court insiders however clarified that this arrangement was temporary and should not be misconstrued as a signal that the IHC was being moved out of its current Shahrah-i-Dastur premises.
IHC’s senior officials denied the rumours saying that ample space had been given to the FCC where it could easily perform its functions.
However, the FCC judges are not comfortable as they are still using their chambers in the Supreme Court building because of the paucity of space in the IHC.
At a press conference, IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja dismissed the speculation as “misleading and baseless”, stating that the administrative letter was wrongly interpreted as a relocation order.
Recalling the long struggle for a permanent high court building in the federal capital, he noted that the judiciary in Islamabad began in a rented structure in Aabpara in 1980. The Islamabad High Court was established in 2007, abolished in 2009, and re-established in 2010. The current building was secured largely through the efforts of former IHC judge Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, and it took more than a decade to shift the court to Shahrah-i-Dastur. “The High Court is not going anywhere,” he reaffirmed.
Jajja also said while the FCC was welcomed by the bar after its creation under the 27th Constitutional Amendment, disagreements within the judiciary should be resolved by judges themselves. “The judges resigned from their jobs; they have to fight their own battles. We stand with the institution, not individual conflicts,” he added.
In contrast, the Islamabad District Bar Association has expressed support for shifting the high court back to G-10. In a letter to Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Bar President Chaudhry Naeem Ali Gujjar and Secretary Abdul Halim described the relocation as a step that would enhance convenience for lawyers and litigants while improving judicial efficiency and reducing delays. They assured full cooperation with the Law Ministry and the IHC administration should the government decide to proceed with the move.
Meanwhile, sources confirmed that a high-level meeting was expected soon to decide the final seating arrangements for the IHC and FCC.
The meeting will determine whether the IHC will remain at Shahrah-i-Dastur, whether the FCC will shift elsewhere, or whether a mutual exchange of premises will be considered. Until then, officials stress that no decision has been taken regarding the relocation of IHC.

“Solar generation is increasing, but this does not have a significant impact on the grid,” Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) CEO Rehan Akhtar said while testifying before the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
Working under the Power Division, the CPPA is the key player responsible for the procurement of electricity from various sources and delivering to all distribution companies and handling their commercial affairs.
He said the energy costs had led to a shift to solar power. “They are now consuming more due to solar availability but their offtake from the national grid has not changed. Their withdrawal from the grid is almost stable. They are drawing the same quantities they were drawing earlier,” he said, adding, however, that the same could not be predicted about the future.

Net metering contribution jumped 173pc to 726m units in 2024

These comments came during the course of a public hearing on CPPA’s request for rebasing of power purchase price (PPP) with effect from January 2026 under the government’s policy directives.
The CPPA presented five different assumptions about the tariff revisions with effect from Jan 1, 2026. These assumptions presented a total average PPP price ranging between Rs25.95 per unit in the best case and Rs26.53 per unit in the worst case of currency devaluation to Rs300-310 from the existing Rs280-290 per dollar.
The existing PPP for FY26 stands at Rs25.98 per unit, showing a general sign of stability.
It was reported that net metering contribution had increased by 173pc to 726 million units in 2024 compared to 266m units in 2023, even though power distribution companies (Discos) showed 1pc growth. On the other hand, K-Electric offtake from the grid increased by 9.4pc as it started drawing the full 2,050MW.
 
 

Nepra was told that fuel costs were expected to remain generally stable with a minor risk of a 5pc increase in global prices in a worst-case scenario. Likewise, given foreign exchange reserve vulnerabilities, local currency had been estimated to increase by Rs10 in the first six months and Rs10 in the second half of the next calendar year in one case only. Interest rates were projected at 11pc for the first half and 10.5pc for the second half.
Industrial consumers bemoaned expensive energy costs, making their products uncompetitive. They said the industry was still cross-subsidising other consumers to the tune of Rs131bn, and all tariff reductions announced by the government had already vanished.
They said the CPPA’s calculation that demand will increase was inconsistent with ground realities, because consumption was going down because of high energy prices, the closing of industries and the shift to solar power.

Bunkering at a port is the process of supplying ships with fuel (such as marine gas oil, heavy fuel oil, or alternative fuels like LNG) for propulsion and onboard machinery.
It is a critical, tightly regulated operation that involves transferring fuel from land-based facilities, tanker trucks, or bunker vessels to the receiving ship’s fuel tanks.
Maritime Affairs Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Tuesday said the initiative was launched to accelerate the modernisation of port services and a broader upgrade of Pakistan’s maritime infrastructure.
He said the introduction of regulated bunkering would fill a long-standing gap in Karachi Port’s service offering, enabling it to compete more effectively with established bunkering hubs in the region and beyond.

Vitol begins refuelling ships with its barge at Karachi Port as Cnergyico starts supplying low-sulphur fuel

The minister said the availability of safe, reliable, and efficiently managed bunkering facilities is expected to attract more international shipping lines to Karachi, particularly those seeking streamlined port calls and predictable service standards.
Earlier, there was no refuelling facility for commercial shipping in the country, and ships had to obtain fuel from Fujairah or Singapore.
The fuel supply and bunkering facility will be executed by Vitol, a Swiss-based Dutch multinational energy and commodity trading company, through its barge.
Meanwhile, the Karachi-based Cnergyico refinery has started producing world-class ‘very low sulphur fuel oil’ (VLSFO) for ship refuelling.
The facility has also become essential as India has banned ships that enter or leave its ports from calling at any Pakistani port.
Sources at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) said that the availability of bunkering facilities would increase vessel traffic at the port, thereby improving revenue too.
Meanwhile, the maritime minister said that the move would translate into higher foreign-exchange earnings through port fees, marine services, and ancillary commercial activity such as repairs, supplies and maritime logistics.
Mr Chaudhry added that the new service would enhance Pakistan’s visibility in the international maritime market by demonstrating the country’s commitment to modern, environmentally responsible and globally competitive port management.
He said compliance with international standards covering fuel quality, safety procedures, documentation and transparency was essential for building confidence among ship-owners and global trading companies.
The minister said the first phase of operations would begin in collaboration with one of the world’s leading energy trading houses, which will conduct bunkering at Karachi Port in accordance with internationally certified practices.
He said the venture is expected to expand as domestic refineries supply larger quantities of refined fuel meeting global specifications, a development he described as a direct benefit to the national exchequer.
The minister noted that KPT had assessed existing bunkering practices, reviewed global procedures, drafted new documentation and engaged stakeholders to bring the service online.
He said the milestone reinforces KPT’s ambition to operate as a leading regional hub and signals the government’s intention to continue expanding port capabilities in line with international benchmarks.

Many spend years behind bars — far longer than the maximum sentence for their crime. Some, convicted by lower courts, are later acquitted by the higher judiciary. In this context, last month the Supreme Court overturned the convictions of two brothers, who had earlier been found guilty of carrying out the 2005 PIDC bomb attack in Karachi. In its detailed judgement issued last week, the court advised the federal and provincial governments to enact laws for the compensation and rehabilitation of “victims of miscarriage of justice” and to hold public officials accountable for dereliction of duty. The ruling exposes a deeply flawed parole and probation process due to a legal system that functions for the privileged not the poor. Courts should focus on setting time limits for both police investigations and the conclusion of trials. A report by NCHR, National Academy for Prisons Administration and Justice Project Pakistan testifies to the staggering jail rush: spaces for under 66,000 are crammed with over 102,000 inmates; three-quarters are under trial.
Society forgets that an undertrial prisoner is a detainee not yet convicted. The Supreme Court’s newly pruned status should give Chief Justice Yahya Afridi more time to focus on the undertrial population, better legislative provisions and implementation of judgements on rights such as bail and legal aid for the poor. Scores could have been acquitted or granted suspended sentences had trials been speedy. A streamlined judicial process offers relief, whereas prolonged incarceration can turn first-time offenders into hardened criminals. Jail reform must then be a priority. Besides vocational training and education for inmates, the authorities can look into options like electronic devices to keep track of undertrial prisoners, thus easing jail congestion. Lastly, compensation should be given to the acquitted — a small price for the loss of precious years of freedom.

In a public notice, the PFF has asked prospective partners to submit an expression of interest and a detailed proposal by early next month.
The big question remains, however, is whether the new competition would be based on the old model of the Pakistan Premier Football League — which had a mix of departments and smattering of clubs, and hasn’t been held since 2019 — or will it be franchise-based.
Franchise league merchants, several in number in Pakistan, will be quick to jump in; their plans have been in motion for years. The only thing lacking was an endorsement by the PFF.
For departments — many of whom have shut down their sports operations due to changing domestic policies and the decade of crisis in the PFF — and clubs, however, getting a proposal together would be more taxing. A proposal as such will also have to deliberate about the teams promoted from the last edition of the second-tier Pakistan Football Federation League, held in 2020 under the FIFA-appointed Normalisation Committee for the PFF.

Pakistan Football may soon get a new domestic league. But questions remain about what kind of league it will be and whether it will be what Pakistan really needs

PFF’s sense of urgency to start the league has been heightened by the visit to the country last week of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa. Sheikh Salman, FIFA’s senior vice-president, reaffirmed AFC’s support for the holding of the league.
“We will offer all the support we can,” Asia’s football chief told Eos in an interview during his visit. “It doesn’t necessarily have to be a pro league [at the outset] but maybe, in the future, it should be one. It will depend on the value of the market and how much we can sustain it.
“The solution is to bring the right people to guide and advise what needs to be done in your country. Each country is different from the other, so maybe a formula that is beneficial for Japan, might not work in Pakistan. If we take it step by step, we will see some difference.”

The clamour in Pakistan, though, is about a franchise football league on similar lines to cricket’s hugely-popular Pakistan Super League. There has also been a prolonged infatuation with the Indian Super League (ISL) across the border, which is seemingly teetering to its end after a decade-long run. Those backing the same model in Pakistan, however, remain unflinching.
Sheikh Salman, though, had some words of advice. “It should be a proper league and not one that runs for three months,” he said when asked about taking lessons from India. “It has to be a good balance between the football aspect and the commercial side. We want to keep it hand in hand, not one taking over the other.”
THE PROBLEMS OF ISL
The ISL was launched to huge fanfare in 2014, with hopes it would take football in India to great heights. It didn’t and, instead, it stands on the verge of collapse after the All India Football Federation received no bids on its tender for a new commercial partner by last week’s deadline.
Critics of the ISL said its formation cut the pathways for the grassroots, with the franchise owners more interested in adding more glamour. The former India national team coach, Stephen Constantine — who later steered Pakistan to their first-ever victory in a FIFA World Cup qualifier — said he wouldn’t go to see an “ISL match with seven foreigners in a team.”
Constantine’s reasoning was clear: as the coach of the Indian team, he wanted to see more Indian players play. Other Indian coaches, such as Shanmugam Venkatesh, the assistant of Constantine’s successor Igor Stimac, said the ISL was more about entertainment than about developing local players.
ISL’s short duration (it eventually became a six-month event) was always a talking point. India had to overhaul its running domestic system to make space for it, and its eventual succession to become the top-tier league. Now, its very existence is at stake.
During his tenure as Pakistan coach, Constantine had expressed his constant frustration at the local players not getting enough competition. “Anything would do,” he would say. “Just get the bloody league started.”
The question remains if there will be sizeable local representation in a franchise league. Franchise owners will want a return on their investment quickly and the eyeballs they need are most likely to come through foreign players.
It all boils down to the will of the prospective franchise owners and whether they can promise investment for developing local players with the franchise league, to create the pathways for the clubs — several thousands of them spread across the country — to rise to the very top.
And unlike cricket, where the PSL was to be the crowning jewel, the cream at the top with a domestic system very much running, football in the country at this point in time needs to start at the very base of the pyramid.
THE UZBEK MODEL
Sheikh Salman spoke during his interview about being patient but making steady progress, highlighting the rise of countries such as Uzbekistan and Jordan, who secured World Cup finals qualification for the first time in their history this year.
“When you look at a country like Uzbekistan, they have won the Under-17 Asian Cup [this year] and the Under-20 Asian Cup [in 2023],” he said. “That means progress is going steady, which is great. It is good for Asian football. Tajikistan played well in the last Asian Cup and it also shows football in Central Asia is booming, but that hasn’t been the case in South Asia.”
There’s something common in both Uzbekistan and Jordan: a no fancy-frills league, but one that is sure and steady. Uzbekistan has moved beyond the ill-fated experiment of its club Bunyodkor attempting to become a ‘super club’ in 2009, when it lured Brazilian great Rivaldo.
In fact, its age-group successes that have subsequently powered the national team could well be attributed to one club: Olympic Tashkent. Owned by the Uzbek Olympic Association, it is made up entirely of youth-level players and features in the top-tier league. It acts like a nursery, while ensuring competition for top under-23 talents who would otherwise be warming the benches of bigger clubs.
LEARNING LESSONS
The decade of crisis has meant the new PFF starts with a clean slate, but with a job to not only revive the league but also the domestic cup competition. The National Challenge Cup was last held in 2024 by the Normalisation Committee, featuring departments and clubs.
It is the franchise league that has dominated the agenda, though, with an Eos investigation showing last year that officials from global football body FIFA were also involved in the plan to get it underway during the tenure of the chairman of the Normalisation Committee appointed by it.
Officials of the government seem smitten by the franchise league plan as well, and the strong possibility remains that it will soon be off the ground — the only thing to be decided being which partner the PFF will choose.
Pakistan, though, should make an informed decision on what it needs and what it will get. It should heed the lessons others have learnt the hard way.
