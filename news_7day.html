<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091616034d61286.jpg?r=171951' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923012/pakistan-turkiye-to-establish-special-economic-zone-for-turkish-entrepreneurs-in-karachi-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Turkiye to establish special economic zone for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi: Dar</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday said Pakistan and Turkiye were pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi.
The announcement came after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan arrived in Islamabad earlier today on an official visit. Turkiye’s Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler is also visiting Pakistan.
Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect. In February, the two countries pledged to boost bilateral trade to $5 billion as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Islamabad.
“We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said, addressing a press conference alongside Fidan at the Foreign Office (FO).
 


Dar also mentioned other engagements, including the revival of the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad train, saying, “Our delegations are meeting in the coming weeks to finalise the roadmap for revival.”
The deputy PM further said that Pakistan has allocated land for the construction of a Maarif School in Muzaffarabad, referring to the Turkish Maarif Foundation, which Fidan said has more than 80 schools in Pakistan.
“A Maarif Foundation delegation is visiting Muzaffarabad today and visiting the site for evaluation,” he said.
Dar further stated that Turkish companies were being considered for undertaking the Jinnah Medical Complex and Daanish University megaprojects in Islamabad.
The Turkish companies will also be participating in offshore drilling projects and the privatisation of electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the power sector, he highlighted.
“We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar asserted.
He appreciated Turkiye’s indigenisation of the defence industry from 20 per cent to 80pc in the last few years, adding: “We would like to benefit from Turkiye’s experience and expertise.”
In his remarks, the Turkish foreign minister said defence cooperation will be further strengthened in the coming days, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Fidan called it a “strategic step”, emphasising that it was very important for the security of Pakistan and Turkiye. He asserted that both countries will continue to support each other in countering terrorism. Over a month ago, the two nations conducted a joint operation and arrested a high-ranking terrorist.
Referring to the recent Pakistan-India conflict, Fidan was “appreciative of Pakistan’s wisdom-oriented attitude”, Radio Pakistan stated.
He noted that Turkiye and Pakistan were intensifying their cooperation in the field of energy, including mining, precious stones, natural gas and oil. The minister also highlighted that the two nations have expanded their relations in other fields, such as the economy, education and culture.
Fidan reiterated the countries’ aim to increase their commercial relations to $5bn and expressed the firm resolve to take Pakistan-Turkiye relations to a higher level, Radio Pakistan added.
Following their meetings, Dar wrote on X: “Held productive discussions on the entire gamut of bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments.
’“Pakistan and Türkiye share deep-rooted bonds of brotherhood, mutual trust, and strategic cooperation,” the deputy PM stressed.
 






Air chief, Turkish defence minister agree to form joint working groups
Separately, a high-level delegation led by Guler called on Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) chief, at the Air Headquarters in Islamabad.
Both officials agreed on the establishment of “dedicated joint working groups to streamline and accelerate progress across various sectors of mutual interest”, according to a statement by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The meeting encompassed discussions on evolving regional security dynamics, progress of ongoing defence cooperation and prospects for future collaboration in emerging domains of warfare, ISPR said.
 


The Turkish defence minister expressed sincere gratitude to the air chief for the warm reception and gracious hospitality extended by the PAF.
He lauded PAF’s “exceptional performance under the insightful leadership of the air chief in the recent conflict with India, commending its operational preparedness and resolute defence of national sovereignty”, the ISPR said.
“Highlighting the longstanding fraternal ties between Turkiye and Pakistan, Yasar Guler conveyed Turkiye’s earnest desire to bolster bilateral defence relations through deeper industry-to-industry collaboration,” the ISPR highlighted.
Guler “particularly emphasised the need to explore joint ventures in cutting-edge domains, including niche disruptive technologies, advanced avionics and unmanned aerial systems”, the statement said.
The Turkish defence minister expressed his appreciation for PAF’s continued support in the pilot exchange programme, which he termed as a “vital initiative for fostering professional growth and operational understanding” between the two air forces.
During the meeting, the Air Chief Marshal Sidhu highlighted the enduring brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, emphasising the common aspirations and strategic convergence that bind the two nations.
 
 

He reaffirmed PAF’s “steadfast resolve to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in the domains of advanced training and aerospace technologies”, the military’s media wing said.
“Both dignitaries concurred on finalising the modalities for enhanced training collaboration and reaffirmed their strong commitment to expanding the scale and scope of joint bilateral and multilateral air exercises,” according to the ISPR.
The military’s media wing noted that the visit reflected the shared commitment of both nations to enhance strategic cooperation, solidify defence ties and promote “lasting institutional linkages” between the armed forces of Pakistan and Turkiye.
Dar, Fidan co-chair first meeting of joint commission
Meanwhile, Dar and Fidan co-chaired the first meeting of a joint commission established in February during President Erdogan’s visit, the FO said in a statement.
Dar expressed satisfaction with the progress of all 12 Joint Standing Committees (JSCs) working under the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC) framework, saying they have “either already met or are scheduled to meet in the coming weeks”.
 






Established in 2009, HLSCC is the highest decision-making forum bet­ween the two countries, guiding bilateral relations through joint standing committees covering trade, investment, defen­­ce, energy, agriculture, IT, health and education.
During the press briefing, Dar said that the JSC on security, defence and intelligence was scheduled to meet on July 24 in Islamabad, while the committee on transport and communication was expected to meet next week.
The trade and investment JSC met on June 20, Dar noted, adding that the committee on defence industries was scheduled to meet later in September.
“Similarly, other committees — health, science and technology; social sector development; culture and tourism; agriculture and water; energy and power; banking and finance; and the political and diplomatic coordination committee are expected to meet in the coming months,” he said.
The upcoming meeting of the Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC), co-chaired by Güler and Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan, is also expected to be held next week, FO said.
“This important platform is expected to further bolster economic cooperation between the two countries,” it highlighted.
The FO added that both sides exchanged views on a range of regional and global developments, and reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace.
Turkish ministers land in Pakistan
A day ago, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had announced that Fidan, along with Guler, will visit Pakistan on July 9. Fidan also paid a visit to Islamabad in May last year.
Fidan arrived in the early hours of Wednesday to hold discussions on bilateral issues, the Foreign Office said on X.
 






“During his official engagements in Pakistan, all important issues of mutual interest will be discussed,” the FO said. “The visit reflects the close and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, culture, and mutual trust.”
It added that upon their arrival, the visiting dignitaries were received by Pakistan’s Additional Secretary for West Asia, Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani.
 






On Tuesday, Pakistan had extended condolences to Turkiye after 12 Turkish soldiers died of methane exposure in Iraq during a search mission in the Claw-Lock Operation zone a day earlier.
Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met on the sidelines of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) summit in Khankendi, Azerbaijan, to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.
The two leaders discussed deepening cooperation in key areas, including trade, energy, defence, connectivity and investment. PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to working closely with Turkiye to promote peace, stability and sustainable development in the region.

The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered at Rawat Police Station a day ago on the complaint of Head Constable Shahbaz Anjum Kayani under Section 302 (Punishment of qatl-i-amd), and Section 311 (Waiver or compounding of qisas) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Under Section 311, the state becomes the complainant, as this provision is non-compoundable, and the case must proceed to a logical conclusion. The punishment for ‘honour’ killings, under Sections 311 and 302, includes the death sentence or life imprisonment. The option for a 25-year sentence under Section 302C is not applicable when Section 311 is invoked.
The FIR said the incident occurred at 11:30am a day ago in Dhok Chaudhrian, within the limits of the Rawat Police Station when Kayani received a tipoff from a source about the suspect asking his daughter to delete her TikTok account, but she refused. He added that the suspect was angered and shot his daughter in the name of ‘honour’, fleeing after the crime.
A statement from the police said they had arrested the victim’s father and recovered the murder weapon, a pistol, from his possession, adding that three teams were formed under the supervision of Saddar Superintendent of Police  Nabeel Khokhar for the task.
Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Mehmood Hamdani told Dawn.com that the “police registered the case as a complaint because the family of the deceased was portraying the incident as suicide. Later, police investigation revealed it was a murder. The police filed the case to avoid any compromise in future.
“Similar cases were registered earlier too, but when a family member becomes the complainant, they reach a compromise after six months or a year. Police registered the case as the complaintant to charge the suspect with solid evidence.”
The police further said that the postmortem analysis had been conducted, evidence was collected from the crime scene and investigations were ongoing from all angles.
 






“Crimes against women and children are intolerable; the accused will be prosecuted with solid evidence and ensured a just punishment,” the CPO said.
 






TikTok is wildly popular in Pakistan, in part because of its accessibility to a population with low literacy levels. On it, women have found both audience and income, rare in a country where fewer than a quarter of the women participate in the formal economy.
Last month, popular social media influencer, Sana Yousuf, was shot dead at her house in Islamabad by a man whose advances she had repeatedly rejected, police said.
Yousaf had racked up more than a million followers on social media. The incident sparked public outrage and widespread media coverage. The case remains under investigation.
Cases of honour killings are prevalent in Pakistan. From January to November last year, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to so-called ‘honour’. In 2023, the country saw a total of 490 ‘honour’ killing incidents taking place, while in 2022, as many as 590 people lost their lives to ‘honour’ killings.
In January, a man who had recently brought his family back to Pakistan from the United States confessed to shooting dead his teenage daughter, motivated by his disappr­oval of her TikTok content.
In December, Amina Bibi, a mother of three, was shot dead by her brother, Zafar Hussain, in the Qasimpur area of Pakpattan. Hussain told the police he thought his sister had a “questionable character”.
In November, a mother of five was brutally killed in Faisalabad by her husband and younger brother, allegedly to protect the family’s ‘honour’. Accused of having an affair, the victim was attacked at home with bricks, leading to fatal injuries. Her body was later dumped in a nullah through a donkey cart.
A man murdered four women in his family in October, including his mother, in a fit of rage over their TikTok videos. He told the police the videos spread “immodesty and shamelessness, tarnishing the family’s reputation”.</p><small>2025-07-09 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09135324d20203a.jpg?r=135337' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923043/european-heatwave-caused-2300-deaths-scientists-estimate' target='_blank'><strong>European heatwave caused 2,300 deaths, scientists estimate</strong></a><br><p>Around 2,300 people died of heat-related causes across 12 European cities during the severe heatwave that ended last week, according to a rapid scientific analysis published on Wednesday.
The study targeted the 10 days, ending July 2, during which large parts of Western Europe were hit by extreme heat, with temperatures breaching 40 degrees Celsius in Spain and wildfires breaking out in France.
Of the 2,300 people estimated to have died during this period, 1,500 deaths were linked to climate change, which made the heatwave more severe, according to the study conducted by scientists at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
“Climate change has made it significantly hotter than it would have been, which in turn makes it a lot more dangerous,” said Dr Ben Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London.
The study covered 12 cities, including Barcelona, Madrid, London and Milan, where the researchers said climate change had increased heatwave temperatures by up to 4°C.
The researchers used established epidemiological models and historical mortality data to estimate the death toll, which reflects deaths where heat was the underlying reason for mortality, including if exposure exacerbated pre-existing health conditions.
The scientists said they used peer-reviewed methods to quickly produce the estimated death toll because most heat-related deaths are not officially reported, and some governments do not release this data.
Last month was the planet’s third-hottest June on record, behind the same month in 2024 and 2023, the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said in a monthly bulletin on Wednesday.
Western Europe experienced its warmest June on record, with much of the region experiencing “very strong heat stress” — defined by conditions that feel like a temperature of 38°C or more, Copernicus said.
Some estimate 50 metric tonnes of trash remain on the Mt Everest due to decades of climbing and lax regulations.
“In a warming world, heatwaves are likely to become more frequent, more intense and impact more people across Europe,” said Samantha Burgess, Copernicus’ strategic lead for climate.
Researchers from European health institutes reported in 2023 that as many as 61,000 people may have died in Europe’s sweltering heatwaves in 2022, according to new research, suggesting countries’ heat preparedness efforts are falling fatally short.
The build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere — which mostly come from the burning of fossil fuels — means the planet’s average temperature has increased over time.
This increase in baseline temperatures means that when a heatwave comes, temperatures can surge to higher peaks.</p><small>2025-07-09 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091404051e77a80.png?r=142113' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923047/2-pilots-killed-as-indian-air-force-jaguar-jet-crashes-in-rajasthan' target='_blank'><strong>2 pilots killed as Indian Air Force Jaguar jet crashes in Rajasthan</strong></a><br><p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) said two of its pilots were killed as a Jaguar fighter jet crashed near a village in Rajasthan’s Churu district on Wednesday.
“An IAF Jaguar Trainer aircraft met with an accident during a routine training mission and crashed near Churu in Rajasthan today. Both pilots sustained fatal injuries in the accident,” the IAF said in a post on X.
 






The statement added that no damage to any civilian property had been reported.
“IAF deeply regrets the loss of lives and stands firmly with the bereaved families in this time of grief,” the statement read, adding that a court of inquiry had been constituted to determine the cause of the accident.
The aircraft was a Jaguar jet, originally a British-French-made aircraft, that crashed in an agricultural field at around 1:25pm, Rajaldesar Station House Officer Kamlesh told Press Trust of India.
Human body parts were found near the crash site, SHO Kamlesh had added.
 
 

An investigation and rescue operations are underway after authorities rushed to the scene, Hindustan Times reported.
The aircraft had taken off from the Suratgarh airbase with two pilots onboard, ANI News reported.
The Indian Express quoted Churu Superintendent of Police Jai Yadav as saying that the incident occurred at around 12:30pm.
Earlier in May, India’s Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan confirmed in May that his country’s fighter jets were shot down by Pakistan during the four-day conflict earlier that month.
In April, the IAF had said it regretted the damage caused to the property near Madhya Pradesh’s Shivpuri district by the “inadvertent drop of a non-explosive aerial store” from an aircraft.
According to Indian media reports at the time, “a heavy metal object fell from the sky from an air force jet on the house of Manoj Sagar […] due to which two outer rooms have been damaged”.
In March of last year, a domestically made light combat IAF jet, called Tejas, crashed in Rajasthan, making it the first such incident since the aircraft was inducted in 2016.

The incident comes after reports of multiple quadcopter and drone attacks in KP and Balochistan over the past year. In March, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, while in May, a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com: “Two quadcopter incidents occurred in the district today. In the first quadcopter attack by militants, one woman was killed while three children were injured, including two of the woman’s children.”
The woman’s body and the injured people were taken to the hospital for medical assistance, he added.
DPO Kulachi said that another quadcopter attack occurred where terrorists attacked the Maryan police station, damaging the station’s solar panels on the rooftop.
He said, “The police personnel remained safe in the attack,” adding that it was the third such militant attack on the same police station.
“A search operation was underway in the area to track down the terrorists,” he added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities recently, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Bannu has seen several militant attacks over the past several months.
On Saturday, one person was killed and three others were injured after armed assailants attacked a jirga in the district.
In March, 16 terrorists were killed while five soldiers were martyred as security forces responded to a terrorist attack on the Bannu Cantonment.
The incident resulted in the deaths of 13 civilians and injured 32 others after “severe destruction” of a mosque and a residential building due to the suicide blasts, causing the perimeter wall to partially collapse.</p><small>2025-07-09 11:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0912200262ab1cb.jpg?r=122201' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923026/trumps-claim-on-averting-india-pakistan-war-gains-new-life' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s claim on averting India-Pakistan war gains new life</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration on Tuesday doubled down on its narrative that US President Donald Trump played a central role in defusing a potentially nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan in May.
In a high-visibility moment at the White House on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu handed Trump a letter nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing, among other things, Trump’s “decisive diplomacy” in resolving disputes.
This symbolic endorsement comes amid growing signs that the Trump administration is carefully shaping its South Asia message — amplifying its version of regional stability while deliberately avoiding any confrontation with India or with Pakistan’s current leadership.
The evolving narrative was further underscored at the State Department’s daily news briefing — the first to publicly address both the ceasefire claim and ex-PM Imran Khan’s continued detention during Trump’s second term in office.
Asked about Indian officials’ repeated denials of Trump’s role in the 2025 Line of Control ceasefire, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided taking a position. “So many comments speak for themselves,” she said.
“That’s one of the good news aspects of our modern world — people can see what’s really occurring. You’re not reliant on a comment to know what has really happened.”
Pressed further, Bruce added, half in jest: “Everyone will have an opinion. That’s an opinion. Some opinions are wrong. Mine rarely are, but other people’s opinions can be wrong.” She laughed and moved on.
The comments came just hours after Trump himself revisited the claim during his joint appearance with Netanyahu. “We stopped a lot of fights. A very, very big one was India and Pakistan. We stopped that over trade,” Trump said. “They were maybe at a nuclear stage. Stopping that was really important.”
He added that the United States had used the threat of suspending trade talks to pressure both governments and that he had personally contacted the leadership in New Delhi and Islamabad. He also referenced a meeting with Pakistan’s army chief as part of the de-escalation effort.
While Islamabad has not only endorsed this version but also submitted its own Nobel nomination for Trump last month, India continues to strongly refute it.
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar reiterated this position after a recent meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, telling reporters that “President Trump had nothing to do with the ceasefire.” Indian officials have repeatedly emphasised that the de-escalation was prompted by internal military-level communications, not foreign mediation.
The Trump administration, however, has chosen not to affirm India’s denial — allowing President Trump’s pro-Pakistan narrative to stand uncontested.
For observers in Islamabad, this is significant. Not only is Trump being publicly credited by Pakistan, but the US government, for now, appears content to let that version circulate internationally — a quiet but unmistakable nod to Pakistan’s strategic utility in Washington’s broader diplomatic framework.
Silence on Imran Khan’s incarceration
When asked directly about Imran’s continued imprisonment — more than a year after his ouster and arrest — the State Department again chose silence over scrutiny.
“For the administration’s opinion regarding Mr. Khan’s situation, I would ask you to check with the White House and my colleague, Karoline Leavitt,” Bruce said, quickly steering the conversation away.
Instead of discussing the democratic process or rule of law — familiar themes in past US commentary on political detentions abroad — Bruce launched into an impassioned defence of President Trump’s global leadership.
“The President has made it clear that he doesn’t expect ever to win something of that sort [the Nobel Peace Prize], and yet the issue for him, the prize, is his success,” she said. “He is now not giving up on the world, and the people of the world are going to decide and make a determination of the greatness of Donald Trump.”
The absence of any reference to Imran’s legal rights or political status indicates a shift in US posture: prioritising stability over values and maintaining silence over expressing concern.
For many Pakistanis, particularly PTI supporters, this shift will be seen as a stark contrast to the more vocal positions taken by many US lawmakers against Imran’s incarceration in the recent past. In April, Republican US Congressman Jack Bergman renewed his call for the release of PTI founder following a recent visit to Islamabad where he met the civilian and military leadership. Special Presidential Envoy for Special Missions of the United States, Richard Grenell, has also consistently voiced support for Imran, calling for his release.
What this means for South Asia
The Trump administration’s emerging South Asia posture is becoming clearer: it is narrative-driven, highly personalised, and largely disengaged from the language of democracy promotion. Pakistan is framed as a cooperative security partner — one that responded positively to Trump’s pressure during the 2025 crisis. India is treated cautiously, without confrontation, but also without the deference New Delhi has come to expect in rejecting any notion of third-party mediation over Kashmir or border issues.
Trump’s references to a possible “nuclear stage” elevate the stakes of the 2025 standoff — and simultaneously bolster his claim to have acted decisively in a high-risk conflict. The claim serves a dual purpose: to enhance his diplomatic résumé internationally and to reinforce his leadership credentials at home.
Meanwhile, the State Department’s posture — ambiguous, amused, and noncommittal — suggests that the Trump administration is comfortable allowing multiple versions of events to exist simultaneously, as long as they don’t disrupt its broader strategic goals.
A Nobel quest and the future of mediation
Tuesday’s remarks make it clear that Trump views himself not only as a participant in global affairs but as a central figure shaping their outcomes. “He deserves every prize,” Bruce said. “He deserved this one for the Abraham Accords.”
Whether the Nobel Committee agrees or not is yet to be seen. But for Pakistan, the symbolism already matters. Trump’s consistent framing of Islamabad as a rational actor that helped de-escalate a major regional conflict — and his apparent disregard for India’s objections — marks a rare public relations victory in a region where international validation is often elusive.
The administration’s silence on Imran, however, sends a different message: that Washington will not risk strategic partnerships or public alignment with current regimes over questions of individual rights, especially not when those questions could complicate a carefully constructed peace narrative.
For now, Trump’s version of the 2025 crisis is gaining traction. Netanyahu’s nomination letter, Pakistan’s endorsement, and the State Department’s studied ambiguity all lend weight to the idea that the India-Pakistan ceasefire was not merely a moment of regional calm — but, in Trump’s telling, a defining chapter in his global peacemaking legacy.</p><small>2025-07-09 10:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091308240364afb.png?r=130930' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923038/aurangzeb-reaffirms-govts-commitment-to-consultative-policy-framework' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb reaffirms govt’s commitment to consultative policy framework</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to maintaining a consultative policy framework as the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) transitioned its leadership.
Aurangzeb met with a delegation of the PBC led by outgoing Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ehsan Malik and incoming CEO Javed Kureishi at the Finance Division, the division said in a press release.
The minister welcomed the PBC’s transition in leadership and extended his full support to the incoming team, reaffirming the government’s commitment to maintaining an inclusive and ongoing consultative process with key stakeholders in the business community.
 






During the meeting, Aurangzeb appreciated the constructive role played by the PBC, particularly acknowledging the value of its policy input, research, and the extensive sectoral data regularly shared with the government.
He underscored the importance of evidence-based policymaking and informed the delegation that the Tax Policy Office had been relocated from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to the Finance Division, intending to institutionalise tax policy formulation and strengthen engagement with forums such as the PBC.
Aurangzeb also emphasised that the government places high value on the perspectives and feedback of the business and industrial community, and in keeping with this approach, the consultative process for the federal budget 2025–26 was initiated earlier than usual this year.
This step was taken to allow greater time for dialogue, reflection and integration of a wide range of recommendations received from chambers, trade bodies, and business forums into the budget-making process, he added.</p><small>2025-07-09 10:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091317309ebaa2b.png?r=134631' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923028/chinese-air-chief-commends-pafs-exemplary-performance-during-pak-india-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Chinese air chief commends PAF’s ‘exemplary performance’ during Pak-India conflict</strong></a><br><p>Chinese air force chief Lieutenant General Wang Gang has lauded the “exemplary performance” of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) during the Pakistan-India conflict in May.
As New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam attack, which Islamabad denied, PAF downed six Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The praise from Lt Gen Gang came as a high-level defence delegation led by him called on PAF’s Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, the military’s media affairs wing said in a press release on Tuesday.
“Lauding the professional acumen and strategic foresight of PAF’s leadership, the visiting dignitary paid rich tribute to the exemplary performance of Pakistan Air Force during the recent conflict with India,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated.
 






Gen Wang, chief of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (Plaaf), praised the “decisive and measured response delivered by PAF pilots under the resolute leadership of the air chief, describing it as a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”.
During their meeting, the two air force heads discussed “matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics and avenues of enhanced bilateral cooperation, particularly in the domain of airpower and operational synergy”.
During the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the PAF used Chinese J-10C jets in its response to India’s attack. However, China’s foreign ministry had said it was “not familiar with the matter”.
On Monday, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir rejected India’s insinuation of direct Chinese support to Pak­­i­stan during the May conflict, calling it a “shoddy attempt” by New Delhi to repudiate Pakistan’s military capabilities.
According to a Reuters report, Indian army’s Deputy Chief Lt Gen Rahul Singh of India’s army had alleged that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict and provided “all possible support”.
During the meeting today, Lt Gen Gang also expressed “deep appreciation for the high state of operational readiness and the cutting-edge capabilities” of the PAF, according to ISPR.
He was “particularly impressed by PAF’s seamless integration of multi-domain operations, terming it a hallmark of modern air warfare and conveyed Plaaf’s keen interest in learning from PAF’s battle-proven experience in multi-domain operations”.
The Plaaf chief was given a comprehensive briefing on PAF’s modern force structure, strategic initiatives and the evolution of its operational doctrine, the ISPR statement added.
 
 

Air Chief Marshal Sidhu also reaffirmed the “strong bond of friendship between the two air forces and reiterated PAF’s commitment to expanding cooperation in training, technology and operational domains”.
He extended a gracious welcome to the distinguished guests, reiterating that Pakistan and China enjoy historic and time-tested ties rooted in mutual trust, strategic convergence, and shared aspirations for regional peace and stability.
“The meeting stands as a testament to the shared resolve of Pakistan and China to advance their time-tested strategic partnership through deepened cooperation and innovation-driven collaboration,” the ISPR highlighted.
Last week, the air chief also met with senior military and political leadership of the United States in the first official visit by a serving PAF air chief in “over a decade”.</p><small>2025-07-09 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0913071430744a4.jpg?r=130737' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923030/armed-attackers-kill-3-in-kps-tank-police' target='_blank'><strong>Armed attackers kill 3 in KP’s Tank: police</strong></a><br><p>Three people, including two brothers, were killed inside their house by armed attackers in the Mulazai area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank district in the early hours of Wednesday, police said.
Public Relations Officer (PRO) to the Tank District Police Officer Ahmad Khan told Dawn.com, “The incident took place in the Mulazai village where armed men entered the victims’ house and opened indiscriminate fire on them. As a result, three people, including two brothers, were killed.”
According to Khan, initial reports suggested that the incident was related to old enmity.
A first information report (FIR) was lodged under sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (punishment of murder) and 324 (attempt to commit murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code against six suspects and further interrogation into the case has begun.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered on the complaint of the deceased father.
It stated that the complainant was asleep in his residence when he heard gunshots being fired. When he came out of his room, he saw “six people firing at his sons”, who then ran away. When he went to the guest room, he found all the victims dead.
The PRO said the dead bodies were shifted to the district headquarters hospital, Tank, for medical and legal procedures.
 
 

He added that the assailants had fled the scene after committing the crime.
On Monday, a woman was arrested in the Kata Kot area of Haripur district for allegedly beating her stepson to death.
In May, a man and his two sons were shot dead in Mardan district by five suspects who fled the scene, while six people, including three women, lost their lives in an exchange of fire over a family feud in Peshawar.</p><small>2025-07-09 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091204514606760.png?r=120547' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923025/apple-eyes-us-formula-1-broadcast-rights-after-f1-the-movie-success' target='_blank'><strong>Apple eyes US Formula 1 broadcast rights after ‘F1: The Movie’ success</strong></a><br><p>Apple is in talks to acquire the US broadcast rights to screen Formula 1 when the contract becomes available next year, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, following the success of Brad Pitt-starrer F1: The Movie.

Conservative influencers from Laura Loomer to Elon Musk have criticised Attorney General Pam Bondi and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Kash Patel for their findings, which came months after Bondi pledged to reveal major revelations about Epstein, including “a lot of names” and “a lot of flight logs”.
“It’s sitting on my desk right now to review,” Bondi told Fox News in February when she was asked if the Justice Department would be releasing Epstein’s client list.
On Tuesday at the White House, Bondi walked that comment back, telling reporters that she was referring to the entire Epstein “file” along with other files pertaining to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. “That’s what I meant by that,” she said.
She added that the many of the videos in the Epstein investigative file “turned out to be child porn”. This material, she added, is “never going to be released. Never going to see the light of day”.
The Justice Department’s memo on Epstein, released on Monday, concluded that after reviewing more than 300 gigabytes of data, there was “no incriminating client list” nor was there any evidence that Epstein may have blackmailed prominent people.
 
 

The memo also confirmed prior findings by the FBI which concluded that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell while awaiting trial, and not as a result of a criminal act such as murder.
A subsequent report by the Justice Department’s inspector general later found that the Bureau of Prisons employees who were tasked with guarding Epstein failed to search his cell or check on him in the hours before his suicide.
Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, a former conservative podcaster, both previously made statements before working at the FBI about a so-called client list and often suggested that the government was hiding information about Epstein from the American public.
Trump defended them in a Truth Social post on Monday amid a backlash by his Make America Great Again (MAGA) base, calling them the “greatest law enforcement professionals”.
 


He expressed annoyance when reporters asked him questions about Epstein on Tuesday at the White House during a cabinet meeting, saying, “Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?”
 


Musk claims former Trump aide in the files
Tech tycoon Elon Musk, now Trump’s estranged former close aide, said on X: “How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?”
When their feud blew up last month, Musk alleged that Trump was named in the Epstein files, but he later deleted his posts.
Musk further claimed Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Trump during his first presidency, was “in the Epstein files”.
He was replying to a post that shared a 2024 report stating that Epstein “spent hours being interviewed on camera” by Bannon.
 


“They arrested (and killed) Peanut, but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list,” Musk said in another post, referring to an Instagram-famous squirrel seized by New York state authorities last year.
“Government is deeply broken,” the Tesla boss added.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said his country hoped the truce would contribute to regional stability, and emphasised Riyadh’s position “in supporting dialogue through diplomatic means as a path to resolving disputes,” the ministry said in a post on X early on Wednesday.
According to the Saudi ministry, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi “expressed his gratitude” to Riyadh for its condemnation of Israel’s attacks on Iran last month.
 






Israel launched its unprecedented bombing campaign on Iran on June 13, targeting military and nuclear facilities as well as residential areas. The strikes killed more than 1,000 people in Iran, including senior military commanders and nuclear scientists, according to Tehran.
Israel, in turn, was hit by waves of drone and missile fire from Iran, which Israeli authorities said left at least 28 people dead.
The United States, which had been in talks with Iran about its nuclear programme since April, joined Tel Aviv’s war and carried out its own strikes on Iran on June 22, targeting several nuclear sites.
The talks between Tehran and Washington have since stalled, but the ceasefire between Iran and Israel has been in place since June 24.
 
 

Iran and Saudi Arabia have often been on opposing sides of regional conflicts, including in Syria and Yemen. The two regional heavyweights broke off diplomatic relations in 2016 before re-establishing them in 2023 under a rapprochement deal brokered by China.
It amounted to a diplomatic achievement for Prince Mohammed, who has taken a more conciliatory approach to regional diplomacy in recent years.
Saudi Arabia condemned the Israeli strikes on Iran last month, calling them “aggressions” and a “clear violation of international laws”.
Riyad also expressed its “great concern” following the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Araghchi held “fruitful conversations” with Prince Mohammed, as well as Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan and Defence Minister Prince Khaled bin Salman about bilateral relations and developments in the region.</p><small>2025-07-09 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/686dae49b169c.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922923/occupants-of-nine-buildings-start-vacating-as-demolition-drive-begins-in-karachis-lyari' target='_blank'><strong>Occupants of nine buildings start vacating as demolition drive begins in Karachi’s Lyari</strong></a><br><p>• Lyari residents protest against ‘building safety’ crackdown
• Governor visits affected people, announces 80-sq-yd plots for displaced families
• Five-member inquiry committee tasked with investigating building collapse holds first meeting
KARACHI: With the provincial government setting up a high-powered committee to investigate the recent collapse of a multi-storey building in Lyari that killed 27 people, authorities have ordered occupants of nine “dilapidated” buildings to vacate their homes as an operation begins to demolish one of the “weakened” structures in the same vicinity.
The developments came in the wake of the tragedy, which also left several families displaced and raised alarm over the state of “ageing and illegally constructed buildings” in the city.
Some occupants of such buildings were seen emptying their homes on Tuesday and transporting their belongings to temporary abodes.
A number of residents also staged a protest demonstration, demanding that the government provide alternative housing before demolishing the properties they had purchased with their hard-earned money.
In the early hours of Tuesday, demolition crews began tearing down one of the nine newly identified structures as part of an emergency safety drive.
Officials said the buildings had been found to be structurally “unsound” and posed a severe risk to occupants and nearby residents.
A spokesperson for the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) confirmed that notices had been issued to the occupants, urging them to vacate immediately in order to avoid further tragedies.
Governor visits displaced families
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori on Tuesday visited the site of the collapsed building.
During the visit, he faced a group of emotional residents and activists demanding accountability and immediate relief.
Public outrage over the tragedy continues and has led to street protests in the affected area.
Mr Tessori, accompanied by senior administration officials, met with the affected families and promised swift support.
He announced that each displaced family would be allotted an 80-square-yard residential plot.
“We stand with the victims during this difficult time. We will ensure no family is left without shelter,” he said, adding that interim housing arrangements would be made until permanent plots are allocated.
Speaking to the media, Governor Tessori vowed to personally look into the matter.
“I will be sending all my recommendations regarding this tragedy to the Sindh government through a formal letter. This is no minor matter. There will be no silence, and those responsible will be held to account,” he stated.
He also urged the provincial government to provide six months’ rent and temporary relocation within the same locality for residents evacuated from the dangerously unsafe buildings.
He further assured that the Governor House would remain actively engaged in relief efforts, offering essential support including ration supplies and employment opportunities for the affected families.
As the government continues to identify more dangerous structures, questions remain about the authorities’ capacity to both enforce regulations and ensure humane treatment of residents displaced by such enforcement.
Five-member committee notified
The Sindh government on Tuesday formed a five-member inquiry committee headed by Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, comprising Special Secretary Ayesha Hameed, SBCA’s Nadeem Ahmed and Asif Ali Langah and the local government department’s Hammadullah Seehar.
“The committee has been directed to conduct a thorough inquiry into the incident, which occurred on 4 July 2025, and submit its findings within 48 hours. The Terms of Reference (ToRs) also mandate the committee to identify those responsible for negligence and propose recommendations to prevent similar incidents in the future,” said a statement detailing the notification.
“Furthermore, the committee is tasked with developing a mechanism for the evacuation of residents from buildings deemed dangerous. It has been authorised to co-opt any relevant officer required during the course of the inquiry.”
The committee held its maiden meeting on Tuesday.

The Golden Visa is a long-term residence visa that enables foreign talent to live, work, or study in the UAE while enjoying a range of exclusive benefits. According to the UAE government’s official portal, eligible categories include investors, entrepreneurs, scientists, outstanding students and graduates, humanitarian pioneers, and frontline heroes.
This week, several Indian media outlets, including The Press Trust of India and The Hindu, reported that the UAE government had initiated a “new nomination-based visa policy”, allowing Indians to “enjoy the UAE’s Golden Visa for life by paying a fee of AED100,000”.
Meanwhile, Times of India reported that the newly launched scheme was in its pilot phase and was currently available to applicants from both India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applications expected in the first three months. Dubai-based Gulf News also reported on Monday that Bangladeshi citizens could apply for the Golden Visa remotely if they meet the requirements.
“The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has denied the accuracy of rumours circulated by some local and international media outlets and websites regarding the United Arab Emirates granting lifetime Golden Visas to certain nationalities,” the WAM report said.
“ICP clarified that the categories, conditions, and regulations of the Golden Visa are clearly defined in accordance with official laws, legislations, and ministerial decisions.”
According to WAM, the ICP emphasised that “all Golden Visa applications are handled exclusively through official government channels within the UAE, and that no internal or external consultancy entity is recognised as an authorised party in the application process”.
The federal authority said it had “recently observed news articles from a consultancy office based in another country, suggesting that lifetime Golden Visas could be obtained for all categories from outside the UAE via consulting or commercial entities under simplified conditions”.
The WAM report further added: “These claims have no legal basis and were made without coordination with the relevant authorities in the UAE. The federal authority reaffirmed its commitment to providing a safe and transparent environment for applicants.”
It also stated that legal action would be taken against entities “spreading such false information in an attempt to illegally collect money from individuals aspiring to live and reside in the UAE, exploiting their hopes for a dignified and secure life.”
The federal authority urged individuals wishing to visit, live, or invest in the UAE not to respond to inaccurate rumours and false news aimed at a quick profit. They should avoid paying any fees or submitting personal documents to any party claiming to provide these services, the report said.
 
 

The Economic Times quoted a top golden visa consultant based in Dubai as rebutting the Golden Visa reports.
“I checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue,” Iqbal Marconi, ex-chief executive officer of ECH Group (which Khaleej Times has described as the largest golden visa facilitator in the region), told Economic Times.
“The only new update they have is that crypto investors won’t be considered for the Golden Visa scheme. I checked with the GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai) also; they too said they don’t have any information on this, “ Marconi said.
He added that a “couple of officials […] in the same line of work” whom he contacted also did not have any information in this regard.</p><small>2025-07-09 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091050333ea7e9c.png?r=105104' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922953/frontline-players-ignored-again-as-pakistan-name-squad-for-bd-t20s' target='_blank'><strong>Frontline players ignored again as Pakistan name squad for BD T20s</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Pakistan selectors on Tuesday anno­unced a 15-member squad for the upcoming three-match T20 International series against Bangladesh, with five frontline players including former captains Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Shah Afr­idi omitted for a second series in a row, while two uncapped pacers were called up.
Vice-captain Shadab Khan and fast bowler Haris Rauf were also ruled out due to fitness issues. Shadab is recovering from shoulder surgery in England, while Haris sustained a hamstring injury during a T20 league match in the United States last week.
Babar, Rizwan, and Shaheen were left out again as the selectors continue to experiment with new faces ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup, scheduled for February-March next year in India and Sri Lanka.
While Babar and Rizwan have faced criticism for their strike rates in the format, Shaheen’s recent dip in form has also been a factor despite the pacer topping the bowling charts of the Pakistan Super League earlier this year. Both Rizwan and Babar last featured in the T20I squad during the South Africa tour last year, whereas Shaheen played on the New Zealand tour after that.
 
 

Fast bowlers Ahmed Daniyal, 28, and Salman Mirza, 31, have been rewarded for their strong performances in the PSL and are set to make their T20I debuts.
The squad also sees the return of all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz, who last played a T20I in January 2024, and left-arm spinner Sufyan Muqeem. Middle-order batter Hussain Talat, who was also picked in last month’s home series against Bangladesh, continues to stay in the national squad having played his last T20I in 2021. However, his selection has raised some eyebrows given a modest record of 394 runs and four wickets in 18 T20Is.
The squad will be led by Salman Ali Agha, who continues as captain, while no vice-captain has been named in the absence of Shadab.
In an unusual development, the squad was announced by Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) Chief Operating Officer Sumair Ahmad Sayed and Media Director Amir Mir — instead of any member of the four-person selection committee.
Although committee member Aaqib Javed was present at the National Cricket Academy adjacent to the Gaddafi Stadium, and both Azhar Ali and Aleem Dar reside in Lahore, none of the selectors attended the press conference.
 


The announcement came abruptly following a previously scheduled presser by the PCB’s domestic cricket department, catching the media off guard. It marked the first time that a national squad was unveiled by PCB’s administrative and media personnel rather than the selectors themselves.
The national team will assemble in Karachi for a training camp starting Wednesday ahead of the Bangladesh tour. The T20I matches are scheduled to be held on July 20, 22 and 24 at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka.
The squad for the white-ball series against the West Indies, scheduled after the Bangladesh tour, will be announced later.
Squad: Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Ahmed Daniyal, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Hassan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Sahibzada Farhan (wicket-keeper), Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Sufyan Muqeem

Earlier in May, IGP Dr Usman Anwar had sought the details of the police officials and officres of Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), who had been holdingdualnationality.
 
 

The IGP had also sought the details of how many police officials of inspectors ranks, inspector legal and senior traffic wardens had been holding dual nationality.
In this regard, a performa, seeking the name of region and unit, names of the country holding dual citizenship, date of holding dual citizenship and name of inspector Establishment Branch, Inspector Legal, inspector /telecommunication, fingerprint bureau & Senior Traffic Warden etc holding dual nationality.
The IGP has directed the police across the province, including IGP National Highway & Motorway Police Islamabad, the commandant national police academy Islamabad, additional inspector generals of police South Punjab, Multan, Investigation branch, Special Branch, CTD, PHP, IAB, EPF, Operations, Crime Control Department (CCD) and Training, Punjab to provide the details of their dual citizenship.
All regional police officers (RPOs), DG anti-corruption Punjab, DG FIA Islamabad, COO Safe Cities Authority, the Chief Traffic Officers, Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Multan and Rawalpindi. All principal Police Training Schools in Punjab and Commandant Ring Road Police Lahore had been directed to provide the names of officers with ranks DSP, ASP and above, postings and dual nationality, if yes then also mention the name of the country.
A senior police officer revealed that 30 to 40 percent of officials/officers’ families had been holding dual nationalities of different countries, including Canada, Turkiye, UK and Malta and this trend is more in Punjab police compared to KPK and other provinces.
While citing one example of a police officer who went abroad for study after getting long leave from the police department but when he returned back to Pakistan, he was holding a dual nationality.
Another police officer said that one should be asked whether the police officers/officials themselves have been holding dual nationality and how many families of police officials/officers have been holding dual nationality.
Once the families of police officers/officials get the dual nationality, it becomes much easier for them to get it after retirement or in case of acquitting the job.

TOBA TEK SINGH: Seized computers and other gadgets being loaded on a trailer. — Dawn

TOBA TEK SINGH: The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) claimed to have arrested 149 persons, including 48 Chinese and nationals of some other countries, for their alleged involvement in an online fraud, in a raid on a factory at Chak 54-RB, Sirohli, Faisalabad, late on Monday night, in Balochni police station limits.
According to sources, the factory where the raid was conducted is allegedly owned by a former chairman of Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco) Board of Directors, Malik Tehseen Awan.
The sources say that the arrested persons, including 48 Chinese nationals, allegedly involved in hacking banks’ internet systems and other cybercrimes, had been operating from the factory.
The says that the factory owner, Mr Awan, managed to escape during the NCCIA team’s raid.

The premises is allegedly owned by Fesco BoD ex-head; 48 Chinese nationals among the suspects

The team seized a large number of laptops and other gadgets from the factory and had to use a trailer to transport the case property to their office.
Despite efforts by this scribe, no contact could be made with Mr Awan for his version.
The NCCIA has registered seven FIRs, from serial  number 142 to 147, under sections 13, 14 and 16 of Peca, read with  sections 109, 419 and 420 of the PPC, on the complaint of seven different  persons against 149 arrested persons.
Mr Awan would allegedly lure  people to do “online work” through these suspects.
The sources say that the network also deprived people of millions of rupees through Ponzi schemes.
The arrested suspects include 44 men and four women from  China, three men and five women from Nigeria, one man and three women from  Philippines, one man and one woman from Sri Lanka, six men from Bangladesh, one  woman from Zimbabwe, two women from Myanmar and 76 men and two women from  Pakistan.
ACTION RECOMMENDED: The Faisalabad DC has recommended departmental action against the medical superintendent (MS) and two female doctors following the death of a child in the Government Teaching Hospital Ghulam Mohammadabad.
The DC has recommended action against the MS and two doctors to the secretary of Punjab Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Department in the light of an inquiry that found them guilty of negligence and providing inadequate treatment to a child who later died in the hospital.
The allegations stem from the tragic death of one-and-a-half-year-old Muhammad Yousuf, a resident of Ghulam Mohammad Abad.
The child was reportedly brought to the hospital after he choked on a syrup bottle cap on Feb 19. However, the doctors on duty allegedly kept referring the child’s family to different wards unnecessarily, before finally directing them to the Allied Hospital. The child passed away allegedly because of the delay in treatment.
The bereaved family protested against the hospital administration for negligence.
The child’s uncle, Nadeem Ahmed, lodged a complaint with Faisalabad commissioner, who then directed the DC to conduct an inquiry into the matter.
The DC, retired Capt Nadim Nasir, recorded statements of the affected family and the witnesses, besides reviewing the hospital’s CCTV cameras’ footage.
The inquiry found MS Dr Asif Shehzad, Postgraduate Resident (PGR) Dr Ahda Payam, and Women Medical Officer Dr Momina Sohail guilty.
The DC has recommended departmental proceedings against the accused under the Peeda Act.

Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi has called the SJC meeting to consider around two dozen pending complaints against superior court judges and a set of recommendations to streamline the process of handling complaints and ensure transparency while probing allegations of misconduct against judges.
The recommendations were prepared by Justice Munib Akhtar, also an SJC member.
The SC, through an announcement on the completion of the first 100 days of CJP Afridi in office, had explained the SJC had examined 46 complaints against constitutional officeholders and 40 of them have been disposed of. In five complaints, comments have been sought while further information was asked for in another case.
In one of the SJC sittings, it was decided regular sessions would be held every month in order to clear the backlog of outstanding complaints against superior court judges on a fast track.
Also, the SJC in its July 12 meeting is expected to resume consideration of a letter by six judges alleging interference by intelligence agencies in judicial affairs and calling for a thorough investigation. The letter was sent by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 25, 2024.
The SJC, at a previous session while considering different options concerning the letter, agreed to expand consultations, noting that the code of conduct of judges also applies to the heads of different institutions.
The letter had earlier prompted the then CJP Qazi Faez Isa to initiate suo motu proceedings after ex-CJP Tassaduq Jillani declined to lead a one-man commission to investigate the alleged meddling in judicial affairs. CJP Afridi, before assuming the top office, had recused himself from hearing the suo motu case, arguing that “inaction by IHC chief justice or judges” should not drag the Supreme Court into imposing its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
“This may affect the functioning of the worthy [IHC] chief justice and judges in their discharge of judicial functions and would amount to interference in the independence of the high courts,” Justice Afridi had suggested at the time.
The weekend meeting of the council will also be attended by senior puisine judge of the Supreme Court Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Sindh High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar.
According to an announcement, the SJC is actively considering amendments to its code of conduct and procedure of enquiry.  The SJC had appointed Justice Munib Akhtar as head of a committee to propose amendments to the code of conduct.

Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan’s Kunar province.
Upon receiving intelligence about a group of Fitna al-Khawarij militants attempting to infiltrate the Pak-Afghan border in Lowi Mamund tehsil’s mountainous areas, security personnel responded swiftly, foiling the attempt and eliminating all eight militants, the sources said.
They said that following the successful action, the security forces have further tightened surveillance and monitoring of the border areas to prevent any future infiltration of Fitna al-Khawarij militants from the Afghan side.
While the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), did not release an official statement about the operation, local residents confirmed the clashes between security forces and militants in the area.
According to the residents, the clashes between the security forces and the militants, which continued for several hours, left one child wounded.
They said that the injured child — identified as Muhammad Khan, son of Abdur Rouf — was first taken to Larkholozo Hospital and later transferred to the District Headquarters Hospital in Khar.
The security forces’ fresh action against militants in Bajaur came about a week after a bomb explosion targeted a government vehicle in the Sadiqabad area of Khar tehsil on July 2, killing five people, including Nawagai Assistant Commissioner Faisal Ismail and Tehsildar Abdul Wakeel Khan, and injuring 17 others, including four policemen.

• Gohar finally meets party founder, asks supporters to prepare for ‘peaceful but powerful’ campaign
• Aleema says Imran’s sons, family will also join movement
ISLAMABAD: As PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Tuesday met party founder Imran Khan in Adiala jail after more than a month of repeated attempts to gain access to the incarcerated former premier, who is said to be kept in solitary confinement, the party founder issued a nationwide protest call.
The meeting between the two party leaders revolved around the protest movement announced by Imran Khan, which will reach its “peak” on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases. According to a statement on his X account in the evening, Imran Khan ruled out any kind of dialogue, saying the time for dialogue had passed.
“For the sake of the country, I have repeatedly talked about negotiations, but now the time for negotiations has passed. After the 26th Constitutional Amendment…the hope we had for justice from the courts has completely disappeared, so now no other method can bring the Pakistani nation out of this swamp of lawlessness except a nationwide protest movement,” the PTI founder said. It is pertinent to note that he does not have access to his social media accounts and someone else posts on his behalf.
“The complete plan of action for the nationwide movement will be presented this week - on August 5, my unjust imprisonment will complete 2 years. This day will be the culmination of our nationwide protest movement,” he said. “Now there will be no negotiations of any kind with anyone! There will be protests only on the streets so that the nation can get rid of the puppet rulers imposed by force,” he added.
 






Speaking to reporters outside the prison, Barrister Gohar confirmed that the PTI founder asked party workers, supporters, and the general public to prepare for a peaceful but powerful protest campaign starting August 5. “This is not just about political revenge anymore—it’s about every citizen’s rights being stolen. The founder has said this movement should now take the shape of a second Pakistan Movement,” Barrister Gohar stated. He revealed that Khan, even while in solitary confinement, remained “mentally sharper and more determined than ever” and “despite being silenced, the founder has given us a message—prepare, mobilise, and raise your voice peacefully but fearlessly”.
The PTI leader also criticised the prison authorities for continued mistreatment and isolation of Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, while also highlighting their prison conditions, disregard of court orders, and systemic efforts to break political resistance through isolation.
Mr Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, who did not meet her brother, also spoke to media persons outside the jail alongside her sisters. She also talked about the protest movement announced by her brother, claiming that the entire family will be a part of the movement. Ms Khan said that Imran’s sons, Qasim and Suleiman, will go to the US to highlight injustices meted out to their father before coming to Pakistan to become part of the movement and Imran Khan had been informed about this. However, Ms Khan did not clarify if the duo will join the movement before Aug 5 or after. She said a plan regarding their visit was being formulated.
‘Solitary confinement’
Ms Khan also painted a grim picture of her brother’s conditions in prison. “He has been kept in complete solitary confinement for months. For the past week, even his newspapers, books, and television have been taken away. What sort of justice is this?” she asked.
She revealed that despite repeated legal requests and court directives, even basic human rights were being denied. “He is not a criminal. He is the former elected prime minister of this country. Yet he is being treated worse than convicted felons,” she claimed.
 
 

Ms Khan said that the PTI founder had told her during a previous brief meeting that his books were lying in the deputy superintendent’s room, inaccessible to him. “What threat do books pose to the state?” she questioned. “His voice is being silenced, his mind is being isolated, and now they want to completely disconnect him from the outside world.” “Even his doctor has not been allowed for 10 months,” he alleged.
Both Ms Khan and Barrister Gohar emphasised that Imran Khan’s health was being deliberately ignored. “For ten months, his personal physician—who has known his medical history for decades—has been denied access. If something happens, who will be responsible?” Ms Khan asked.
She also stated that Bushra Bibi was undergoing similar conditions in her prison cell. “She has been kept in solitary confinement as well. There are no visitors, no sunlight, no communication—just absolute seclusion. Is this how women are treated in custody in Pakistan?”
She said the authorities believe that by isolating the PTI founder, they can dismantle his influence and demoralise his supporters.
“Let me tell you clearly: he cannot be broken.
His spirit is stronger than ever. He told us—whatever happens, his message will reach the people,“ Ms Khan said, referring to Imran Khan’s recent communication from prison.

• Rapid melting of glaciers due to record temperatures causes floods in Hunza, Diamer, Chilas, Nagar
• Karakoram Highway blocked at multiple points; locals evacuated as homes damaged
• Downpour leads to urban flooding in several parts of Punjab
GILGIT / LAHORE: Record-high summer temperatures in Gilgit-Baltistan have accelerated the melting of glaciers, leading to heavy flooding in districts across the region.
The melting of ice, which resulted in glacier lake outburst floods (Glofs), blocked roads, damaged homes and left people stranded across GB on Tuesday.
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), high temperatures were recorded across GB last week.
GBDMA DG Zakir Hussain told Dawn the situation in GB is “unusual” this year.
He said high temperatures have increased the risk of flooding in rivers and streams, particularly in Diamer and Gilgit.
Last week, the maximum temperature in Chilas was 48.5°C, the highest since July 17, 1997, when it was recorded at 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature jumped to 46.1°C, the highest since July 1971.
Currently, the water level in rivers and streams across the region is dangerously high as inflows have increased due to rapidly melting glaciers.
According to the GBDMA, a flash flood blocked the Karakoram Highway (KKH) at Gandlu-Muladad Padi near Chilas on Tuesday.
A flood in Hamari stream damaged the Nagar Khas Valley road, while deluge in Supultar nullah blocked the Hoper Valley road.
The rising water level in rivers blocked the Chipurson Valley road in upper Hunza while Siachen Road in Ghanche was severely affected by river erosion in Thugs and Bangilongba areas.
Flooding in the Botogah nullah in Chilas damaged makeshift bridges, leaving the communities without any route to cross the waterway.
Flooding in Hamari and Supultar nullahs in Nagar damaged agricultural land, irrigation and drinking water supply systems, link roads and public and private infrastructures.
Many areas were without water and electricity supply after damage to the infrastructure.
Local administration said continued land erosion in the Hamorkhay area in Nagar Khas has submerged fields, trees and other infrastructure and was threatening over a dozen households.
Flood also damaged public and private properties in Chilas of Diamer, Chipurson areas.
A Glof from Shishper glacier in Hassanabad nullah, Hunza, has once again threatened KKH and local properties.
GBDMA said four houses were evacuated as a precautionary measure following the Glof event.
The local administration has warned people not to travel to affected areas as the risk of flooding and land erosion is high.
Rescue efforts
Mr Hussain, the head of GBDMA, said the authority has mobilised machinery to reopen roads blocked by flooding.
“Our first responsibility is to save the lives of people,” he said, adding locals in affected areas have been shifted to safe places.
The GBDMA was also restoring irrigation channels as a majority of people in the region depended upon agriculture as their livelihood.
According to Mr Hussain, the agency is now looking to identify the behaviours of glaciers to understand the scientific reasoning for melting.
The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission has been requested to provide equipment for the monitoring of glaciers.
Meanwhile, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered the GBDMA, district administration and all relevant departments to remain alert in view of the floods.
All deputy commissioners have been ordered to take timely steps to prevent damage to life and property.
Urban flooding in Punjab
In Punjab, heavy monsoon rainfall on Tuesday triggered urban flooding in several cities as the province braces for above-average rainfall in the coming days.
In Lahore, rainfall led to waterlogging in Jail Road, Qurtaba Chowk, Liberty Chowk, and Lakshmi Chowk.
According to the Met Department, Jail Road and Qurtaba Chowk received the most rainfall, with 46 and 43 mm, respectively.
The average rainfall in the provincial capital on Tuesday was 40mm.
The deluge overwhelmed drainage systems in several areas, forcing the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) workers to install pumps to drain water from inundated areas.
Wasa Managing Director Ghufran Ahmad has directed round-the-clock drainage of water.
He said all resources must be deployed to protect low-lying neighbourhoods from inundation.
Across Punjab, the rainfall pattern showed sharp variations, with Sheikhupura recording the province’s highest total at 48mm.
The provincial government has put all disaster response agencies on high alert after Lahore and several other districts recorded heavy downpours, with Nishtar Town receiving the highest rainfall at 52mm.
PDMA meeting
In Sialkot, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) DG Irfan Ali Kathia held an emergency meeting on the preparedness of local authorities.
Mr Kathia said the province is expected to receive 40 to 60 per cent above-normal rainfall in the coming days.
The heavy rain is expected to result in flooding, particularly in riverine areas near Head Marala, where water flow was 70,000 cusecs on Tuesday.
Local administrations have established relief camps stocked with food and water supplies, while electricity poles have been reinforced.
In rural areas, special teams have been mobilised to protect livestock and ensure their safety during the monsoon.
Gujranwala Division Commissioner Naveed Haider Shirazi has ordered the immediate evacuation of dilapidated buildings.
“We cannot risk any loss of life due to structural collapses during these rains,” Mr Shirazi warned, noting that 16 million residents in his division were potentially at risk.
The authorities have warned people to avoid unnecessary travel and report flooding immediately.
CM’s directives
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has directed all institutions to remain on alert during the monsoon season.
Officials of Wasa, PDMA, local government, Rescue 1122 and traffic police must remain in the field to oversee relief activities and help citizens.
She further directed the commissioners and deputy commissioners to monitor water drainage from low-lying areas and the traffic police should prepare plans to avoid gridlock.
