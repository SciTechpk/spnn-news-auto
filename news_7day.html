<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/291629349f6b48f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945449/fbr-says-deadline-for-filing-income-tax-returns-will-not-be-extended-beyond-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>FBR says deadline for filing income tax returns will not be extended beyond tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) said on Monday that the deadline for filing income tax returns for the 2025 tax year would not be extended beyond September 30 (Tuesday).
In a statement, the board said: “The FBR has taken notice of unverified reports circulating on various media platforms claiming that the deadline for filing income tax returns for tax year 2025 will be extended.
“Some elements have also attempted to link this perceived extension to the recent floods.”
Millions of people have been affected and hundreds of casualties have been reported across the country during the recent floods and monsoon rainfall.
“It is pointed out that a vast majority of taxpayers reside in areas unaffected by floods and have had ample time to discharge their national obligation of filing returns,” the FBR said.
It also termed reports suggesting that the board’s Integrated Risk Information System (Iris) had slowed as “unfounded”. It added that the system was “fully operational, functioning smoothly, and taxpayers can easily file their returns using the new simplified income tax return form”.
Furthermore, taxpayers were also cautioned about the failure to file returns by the due date, with the FBR saying that it would “result in late-filer status and imposition of penalties under the law”.
It urged all eligible taxpayers to act responsibly and file their income tax returns with “accuracy and honesty” before the deadline of September 30, 2025 to avoid any legal consequences.
“In case of extreme hardship, the taxpayers can avail an extension of return up to fifteen days with payment of due taxes by September 30 subject to approval by the relevant committee as per law,” it added.
Last week, in a dramatic U-turn, the government had scrapped the asset valuation column from the tax return form for 2025 — just a day after issuing a strongly worded clarification — bowing to mounting pressure from various stakeholders.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had formed a high-powered committee led by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to examine the new column in the IRIS tax return system that required the declaration of estimated fair market value of movable and immovable assets.
After consultations with top tax officers, the committee had decided to remove the estimated market value column from the 2025 income tax return form on the directives of the prime minister.</p><small>2025-09-29 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29122613cd006ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944762/who-is-tony-blair-the-man-being-touted-to-run-gaza-post-war' target='_blank'><strong>Who is Tony Blair, the man being touted to run Gaza post war</strong></a><br><p>Tony Blair, the ex-prime minister who led Britain into a war based on what later turned out to be false claims, is now reportedly eyeing a key role in running post-war Gaza.
According to a Financial Times, the former British premier is seeking a senior role in running the war-torn territory under a plan being prepared by US President Donald Trump’s administration. The report by the British daily quoted an anonymous source privy to the details as saying that Blair had been “proposed as the chair of the board of a ‘Gaza International Transitional Authority (Gita)’”.
Meanwhile, a BBC report said this governing authority would have the support of the United Nations and Gulf countries. Blair would lead the body before handing back control to Palestinians, it added, and further quoted his office as saying that he would not support any proposal including the displacement of Gazans.
Earlier, The Telegraph had reported that a plan — which also envisioned the establishment of Gita — prepared by the ex-PM’s Tony Blair Institute (TBI) for Gaza, had Trump’s backing.
These reports emerged after Blair visited the White House in late August to participate in a meeting presided over by Trump. The meeting was called to discuss the ongoing Israeli invasion of Gaza, as well as post-war plans for the Palestinian territory.
If these developments lead to Blair assuming a prominent role in governing the Gaza post war, the question may arise whether he is the right person for the job, particularly in light of his role in the 2003 Iraq war.
Blair in office
Blair won his first term in office in 1997 as his Labour party swept to power after a gap of 18 years. It marked the inception of Blair’s decade-long premiership, during which he would see two more electoral wins.
A BBC report that outlined his tenure in the top office described the Labour party that came into power in 1997 as a “product of a tight-knit group” headed by Blair, his immediate successor in office, Gordon Brown, media chief Alastair Campbell, and British politician Peter Mandelson.
The report further described Blair’s first cabinet as a “mix of old and new Labour figures” in which “the hard left was banished to the wilderness”.
“And it quickly became clear that only Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown really mattered when it came to the big decisions […] Ministers seemed to come and go with dizzying speed, as the cabinet reshuffle became Blair’s signature move.”
Blair’s government gave Britain 10 years of steady economic growth, boosted employment, poured money into schools and hospitals and brought peace to Northern Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement, to put it briefly. In 2004, his government also pressed ahead with plans to open the United Kingdom’s doors to Eastern European migrants.
But there were downsides, too, especially in terms of foreign policy.
Role in Iraq War
One of the most significant factors defining Blair’s time in power was his role in the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. He led Britain into the war — a move that has been singled out as his biggest failure as the premier.
After the 9/11 attacks in 2001 in New York, Blair had expressed support for the US, saying the UK would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Washington. Two years later, the UK would join the US in launching a war in Iraq.
The two main US-British arguments in favour of the war were that then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein possessed deployable weapons of mass destruction and posed an immediate or near-term threat to the region, as well as to the US and the UK.
A BBC report report recalls that in 2003, “Blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for joining the US-led invasion to MPs and the wider public”.
However, the caucus belli began evaporating soon. A Guardian report recounts that just around a month into the war, then-UK spy chief Sir John Scarlett went to Blair’s press secretary Alastair Campbell’s office and asked: “How difficult would it be if it transpired we do not find evidence of Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction programme?”
Campbell’s reply was, “Very, very, very difficult.”
The then-press secretary’s words would come true for Blair in the years to come when a public inquiry into Britain’s role in the Iraq war would release its findings.
Led by John Chilcot, a five-member committee began investigating the matter in 2009 and conclude seven years later that Britain’s decision to go to war in Iraq was a failure born of flawed intelligence, lack of foresight and “wholly inadequate” planning.
 
 

The Chilcot inquiry, as it came to be known, found that Blair’s decision in 2003 had a “far from satisfactory” legal basis and his case for military action was over-hyped.
These findings were released nine years after Blair stepped down as the prime minister in 2007, with his popularity plunging, in which his decision to join the Iraq War seemingly played an instrumental role.
The legacy
Blair, who had told cheering supporters after his landslide victory in 1997: “A new dawn has broken”, went from being the most popular prime minister in British history to one of the least.
When he came to power, his Downing Street residence was “Corporate Headquarters of Cool Britannia”. In 2007, as he prepared to step down, polls showed the British were affluent but disillusioned.
The charismatic politician promising to be “purer than pure” ended up the first British prime minister to be quizzed by police in a criminal inquiry, as detectives probed to see if loans were offered to parties in exchange for state honours.
On taking power, Blair had said: “Mine is the first generation able to contemplate the possibility that we may live our entire lives without going to war or sending our children to war.”
But by the time he left office, from Afghanistan to Iraq, from Kosovo to Sierra Leone, he had sent British troops into battle more than any other preceding British prime minister since World War II.
For novelist Robert Harris, the decade of Blair leading Britain was a tragedy. “Blair was of my generation, and this was our shot, if you like. I won’t say we’ve messed it up, but it perhaps hasn’t lived up to all the expectations of that rosy-fingered dawn of May 1, 1997.”
And after 10 years interviewing and observing Blair, BBC documentary-maker Michael Cockerell had encapsulated the paradoxes of Blair’s emotional relationship with the British people. “It began when the charismatic prime minister swept people off their feet. But the early glow has long since dimmed, and at the end of the affair, both sides are sadder but wiser,” he had said.
Blair as the Middle East envoy
After leaving Downing Street, Blair served as the Middle East envoy for a group of international powers, the Quartet, comprising the US, European Union, Russia and the United Nations. The group’s website says its mandate “is to help mediate Middle East peace negotiations and to support Palestinian economic development and institution building”.
But according to a report by Al Jazeera, given his role in the Iraq war, Blair was not seen as the right person to facilitate peace in the Middle East right from the start.
Francis Beckett, a political writer and co-author of ‘Blair Inc: The Man Behind the Mask’, pointed out to Al Jazeera that “most fatally of all, the difficulty was that when he went to meetings in the Middle East, nobody knew which Tony Blair they were seeing — whether it was Tony Blair the Quartet envoy or Tony Blair the patron of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation or Tony Blair the principle of the consultancy firm Tony Blair Associates”.
Al Jazeera reported that Blair’s dealings after the end of his time as the prime minister included “advising Arab governments and consultancy work for the US investment bank JP Morgan”.
These dealings, “reportedly netted him millions of pounds” and “left him exposed to accusations of greed from many hardened critics, including those from within the party he led from 1994 to 2007”.
Blair’s reported plan for Gaza
Blair quit as the Middle envoy for the Quartet in 2015 and set up a non-profit organisation, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the very next year.
According to The Telegraph, the same organisation has now come up with a proposal to establish “a temporary body to rule Gaza, with no displacement of civilians, and a multinational effort to prevent the resurgence of Hamas”.
The British daily reported, citing sources, that the plan is known as the “day after”, on which Blair has been working since Israel began its genocide in Gaza in October 2023.
The report details that the plan includes the establishment of a Property Rights Preservation Unit, “which would aim to strengthen the rights of Gazans who voluntarily leave the territory by giving them a right to return”.
It also mentions the creation of Gita, which, it says, “would rule the post-war strip for several years before handing it over to the Palestinian Authority, which would be expected to undergo significant reforms beforehand”.
Meanwhile, questions over Blair’s potential role in running Gaza after the war remain.
A recent report by Al Jazeera highlighted: “Palestinian commentators have also said Blair failed them as (Middle East) peace envoy despite the quintessential British role in the conflict stretching over a century.
They have argued that while he oversaw economic projects during his tenure, he did little to halt illegal Israeli settlement expansion and settler violence, or advance Palestinian statehood, with some even accusing him of impeding statehood as a friend of Israel.“</p><small>2025-09-29 11:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2915310799ea149.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945445/multiple-suspects-booked-for-allegedly-vandalising-properties-of-attacking-members-of-ahmadi-community-in-sialkot' target='_blank'><strong>Multiple suspects booked for allegedly vandalising properties of, attacking members of Ahmadi community in Sialkot</strong></a><br><p>Sialkot police registered a first information report (FIR) on Monday against multiple suspects for allegedly vandalising the properties of and attacking the members of the Ahmadi community the previous night.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com,  was registered at Moutra police station on behalf of Sub-Inspector Amir Ali Sindhu.
It invokes Sections 395 (punishment for dacoity), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy a house), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 324 (attempt to commit murder), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of a common object) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
In the FIR, the complainant said he, along with other policemen, was patrolling and checking security arrangements at Bhalowali Chowk on Sunday when they received reports around 8pm of some people having riled others up against the Ahmadi community and gathering them in large numbers at Piro Chak village. There were also reports of them looting and setting properties on fire.
“When I reached the spot, around 200-250 people armed with weapons and sticks were present there,” he said, adding that upon seeing the police, they lunged toward them and snatched weapons from two of the policemen.
According to the FIR, it was not possible for the police to immediately control the mob as law enforcement personnel were few in number. “So, I contacted the control room after which more personnel were sent,” the FIR quoted the complainant as saying.
He added that there was commotion at the site of the incident as residents were “terrorised”.
The complainant said the initial probe revealed that on September 21, a woman from the Ahmadi community had died in the village whose burial was not allowed. Meanwhile, he continued, “hatred on basis of religion and enmity” was promoted against the community, causing the law and order situation to deteriorate.
Five people were injured during this, the complainant said, adding that they were sent to the hospital.
The FIR said further facts of the incidents would become clear after the injured and affected people would be included in the inquiry.
It alleged the suspects of “deliberately promoting enmity against the Ahmadi community”, hurting their sentiments, setting their properties on fire, looting them, opening fire on them with the intention to kill, attacking a police party and snatching weapons from them and spreading fear among the residents of the area where the incident took place.
The complainant asked for an investigating officer to be assigned to probe the incident.
Meanwhile, Sialkot District Police Officer (DPO) Faisal Shehzad told Dawn.com on Sunday night that eight people were injured in the incident, “five of whom are from the Ahmadi community and three from the TLP (Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan)”.
He said among the injured from the Ahmadi community, one person was shot at, adding that condition of all the injured was stable.
The DPO also said the issue began when the burial of an Ahmadi woman was not allowed at a graveyard established in 1945. Later, some members of the Ahmadi community tortured some others. Two cases were registered — one against the members of the Ahmadi community and another against their adversaries, he added.
On Saturday, he continued, some members of the Ahmadi community “beat another person, following which TLP members set two to three of their farm houses and a shop on fire”. The official said they also “tortured” members of the Ahmadi community.
“Anti-riot police were called and situation is now normal,” he said, adding that “a case will be registered against (members of) the TLP”.
Sunday’s incident comes less than a months after 300 people were booked on terrorism charges in two cases for setting two worship places of the Ahmadi community on fire in Faisalabad.
According to the FIRs, TLP ticket-holder Hafiz Rafaqat led the mob, which was armed with rods and bricks. Members of the community who tried to resist were severely beaten, leaving several injured.
Previously in July, 51 people were arrested and 142 booked for attacking police and an Ahmadi place of worship in Daska.
In April, a 46-year-old businessman was lynched when a few hundred supporters of the TLP had stormed a place of worship belonging to the Ahmadi community in Karachi’s Saddar area to prevent it from observing religious rituals.</p><small>2025-09-29 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29123703e38362c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945431/pm-defends-trumps-nobel-prize-nomination-credits-him-for-easing-regional-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>PM defends Trump’s Nobel Prize nomination, credits him for easing regional tensions</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday said his government nominated US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize because “he helped save the region from destruction” during a period of Pakistan-India escalation.
The Pakistani government in June had decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” to end the India-Pakistan escalation in May. The conflict began after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, launched airstrikes in Pakistan, and faced retaliation.
Amid easing tensions following a ceasefire bet­ween India and Pakistan, Presi­dent Donald Trump claimed that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations.
Responding to a reporter’s question about Pakistan nominating Trump for the Nobel Prize during a press conference in London today, the PM said, “Mr Trump eased tension between Pakistan and India and has saved the region from major destruction.”
He emphasised that if Trump had not intervened in the Pakistan-India escalation, “there would be more destruction and loss of lives.”
The premier added that Trump has eased tension between Ethiopia and Egypt, and even in Ukraine.”
‘Washington visit very fruitful’
Speaking about his recent meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly, PM Shehbaz said that his visit to Washington “was very fruitful; it was very successful.”
He said the best thing that happened was that in the UN building, President Trump co-chaired a meeting on Gaza, and he invited Pakistan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia.
“There, a very constructive discussion took place, and as a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire,” he said.
“Since 2023 in Gaza, the market of oppression and tyranny has been heated, and innocent Muslims are being martyred, including children, mothers, sisters, and youngsters. I believe that this much cruelty and intensity has rarely been witnessed in modern times, and for that, alhamdulillah, we have raised a strong voice at the UN and expressed complete solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters.”
Conflict with India
PM Shehbaz said that during his meeting with Trump, he also talked about the escalation with India, and how New Delhi weaponised the Indus Waters Treaty against the people of Pakistan.
“[I talked about] the way our forces defeated India and, by the grace of Almighty Allah, made India learn a lesson which they will remember for a lifetime,” he said.
“I also said that Pakistan won the war, by the grace of God, through our brave armed forces, who fought with great courage and outstanding professional equipment, led by Field Marshal Saeed Asim Munir, who led from the front and whose resolve was unwavering, and the entire nation was behind our own forces.
“And our air forces, led by Air Marshal Zaheer Babar and his brave fighters, made a strong defence. The world came to realise that not only is Pakistan a nuclear power, but purely meant for our defence. And now the purpose: Pakistan is also very accomplished in traditional warfare, conservative warfare.”
2025 floods
The premier said that while the country’s economy had become stabilised on a macro level, the effects of climate change were taking their toll.
He talked about the massive floods in the country that have struck both the rural heartland and industrial centres for the first time in decades, causing billions of dollars in damage while straining food supplies, exports and a fragile economic recovery.
“Unfortunately, due to climate change, which caused the recent floods, there has been much destruction,” he said.
“In 2022, it caused devastation in Sindh; this time Punjab became the target of this flood due to which more than 1,000 people lost their lives, hundreds of thousands of people were injured, thousands of remote areas were submerged, farms were destroyed, and installations suffered immense damage, for which, at this time, we are collecting data to see how much loss has occurred.
“But our spirits are high and we are facing this completely, and Inshallah we will overcome this and move forward,” he said.</p><small>2025-09-29 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/291509257123989.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945439/2-new-poliovirus-cases-in-sindh-take-nationwide-tally-for-this-year-to-29' target='_blank'><strong>2 new poliovirus cases in Sindh take nationwide tally for this year to 29</strong></a><br><p>Two new poliovirus cases have been confirmed in Sindh’s Badin and Thatta districts, taking the nationwide tally to 29 for this year and the total number of cases in the province to nine, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on Monday.
The development comes days after a poliovirus case was confirmed in Sindh’s Hyderabad district.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
The statement issued by the NIH today said: “With these two cases, both girls, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 29, including 18 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, nine from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.”
The NIH handout stated that this month, a sub-national polio vaccination campaign was conducted across 88 districts of the country, including Badin and Thatta. “The campaign successfully reached nearly 21 million children under the age of five,” it said.
It added that the next nationwide polio vaccination campaign would be held from October 13 to 19, aiming to protect around 45.4 million children under the age of five.
“During the campaign, Vitamin A will also be administered alongside the oral polio vaccine (OPV) to boost children’s immunity levels. More than 400,000 dedicated frontline workers will go door-to-door to ensure that every eligible child receives this essential protection,” the NIH said.
The institute said that these campaigns were aimed at “rapidly boosting children’s immunity and strengthening protection as part of Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to eradicate polio”, encouraging parents and caregivers to ensure their children were vaccinated.
“Polio eradication is a shared responsibility. While dedicated frontline polio workers deliver vaccines, parents and caregivers must ensure their children receive all recommended doses, including routine immunisations,” it said.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-09-29 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29113515de712ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945424/musks-x-to-appeal-indian-court-ruling-on-secretive-content-removal-system' target='_blank'><strong>Musk’s X to appeal Indian court ruling on secretive content removal system</strong></a><br><p>Social media platform X said on Monday it plans to appeal an Indian court order that would allow over two million police officers nationwide to issue arbitrary takedown requests via a secretive online portal called the Sahyog.
“We will appeal this order to defend free expression,” X said in a post on the platform, in its first statement since the High Court of Karnataka ruled last week that there was no legal merit to the company’s legal challenge to quash India’s content removal mechanisms.
“The Sahyog enables officers to order content removal based solely on allegations of “illegality,” without judicial review or due process for the speakers, and threatens platforms with criminal liability for non-compliance,” X said on Monday.
 






X has locked horns with New Delhi in the past, equating the government’s mechanisms with censorship. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said the new system tackles a proliferation of unlawful content and ensures accountability online.
X owner Elon Musk, a self-described free-speech absolutist, has clashed with authorities in several countries over compliance and content takedown demands, but the company’s Indian lawsuit targeted the entire basis for tightened internet regulation in the world’s most populous nation.
Modi’s government has ramped up efforts to police the internet since 2023 by allowing many more officials to file takedown orders and submit them directly to tech firms through a website launched in October.</p><small>2025-09-29 10:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29133641154f648.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945437/afghan-political-leaders-women-activists-discuss-regional-peace-stability-at-islamabad-moot' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan political leaders, women activists discuss regional peace, stability at Islamabad moot</strong></a><br><p>Afghan political leaders and women activists on Monday opened a two-day dialogue in Islamabad to explore ways for “shaping a collective, regionally supported vision for Afghanistan’s peaceful future”, according to organisers.
Pakistan and Afghanistan have witnessed an improvement in bilateral relations after taking steps to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee and upgrading diplomatic ranks.
This is the first ever gathering of political opponents of the Afghan Taliban since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, which organisers insist is “not against the Taliban government.”
They argued that the primary aim of the moot was to “promote inclusive and constructive discussions among leaders, including men and women from diverse segments of society in Afghanistan, to develop a shared understanding and identify common principles for Afghanistan’s future stability, inclusivity, and peaceful settlement,” the organisers said in a statement.
The dialogue was previously scheduled on Aug 25-26 but was postponed, apparently over criticism by some known personalities, including Zalmay Khalilzad, the former United States special envoy. Khalilzad had termed the meeting “unwise” due to the participation of some who oppose the Taliban.
“Afghan citizens are entitled to their political views, but Pakistan’s seeming support of them by hosting their conference is hugely unwise and an intended provocation,” he wrote on X.
 






Former Afghan parliamentarian Fawzia Koofi opposed the remarks, saying, “Isn’t it time to let us craft what is good for us?”
The first day of the closed-door meeting was dedicated to Afghan leaders to “engage openly, exchange perspectives and define shared principles for stability, rule of law, and reaffirming the support to women’s rights and inclusion”, according to the organisers.
Dawn.com has seen a list of 37 Afghans invited to the event. They were part of the previous governments of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, including governors, ministers, lawmakers and women activists.
A participant said some of the invitees were not attending the meeting due to visa issues.
“The aim of this timely and important dialogue is to promote an inclusive dialogue among diverse groups of Afghan leaders (women and men) alongside Pakistani counterparts to foster inclusive dialogue, mutual understanding and lasting cooperation,” the organisers said.
Women for Afghanistan (WFA) and the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute (Sassi) University jointly held the first Regional Dialogue titled “Towards Unity and Trust”.
Koofi, who leads WFA, lives in exile and has organised a series of meetings, mainly comprising women activists against the Taliban policies. She is one of the critics of Taliban rule. Dr Maria Sultan, a defence analyst, heads Sassi.
On the second day, on September 30th, a Joint Pak-Afghan Session will hold “focused discussions aimed at building trust, identifying common ground and advancing a people-centric approach to address regional challenges”.
The organisers, while explaining the objectives of the dialogue, say that the event is aimed at strengthening cooperation between Afghan and Pakistani leaders.
The dialogue will also promote sustainable development, stability and peace rooted in shared values and highlight the importance of women’s participation and inclusive governance. The gathering would encourage regional cooperation with a focus on economic development and trust-building, the statement added.
“The dialogue underscores a simple truth: peace between people leads to peace between nations. By prioritising dialogue, inclusivity and cooperation, WFA and SASSI University believe this initiative can pave the way for stronger, more mutually beneficial relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, grounded in unity and trust.“
In addition, the event will be helpful in fostering a deeper understanding between the people of the two nations for a more sustained development and peace in the region.
“The commonality and the importance of the dialogue and the process stems from the need that Afghans must have the space to speak, engage and think together to promote their common values and interests for their country and their people,“ it added.
The dialogue will also serve to identify common grounds for cooperation between Afghan leaders and their Pakistani counterparts on an engagement basis of developing people-centric approaches to find common solutions for regional challenges and to build trust and stability, the statement said.
“We believe that a more people-centric approach focused on economic development and regional cooperation will lead to an enhanced and meaningful relationship between the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.”
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul in July, where an agreement was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek­istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional connectivity. Later that month, Dar said Pakistan received “recent assurances” from Afghan authorities that the neighbouring country’s soil would not be used for terrorism.
Islamabad has repeatedly demanded that Kabul take action against the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). In January, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the only point of contention between the two countries was the presence of the TTP and cross-border attacks.</p><small>2025-09-29 09:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29115047f8c9caa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945428/apex-court-suspends-ihc-order-barring-justice-jahangiri-from-judicial-work' target='_blank'><strong>Apex court suspends IHC order barring Justice Jahangiri from judicial work</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday suspended an order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) barring Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri from carrying out judicial duties in a case pertaining to his law degree allegedly being fake.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the bench ruled that the “operation of the impugned order is suspended”.
The court also issued notices to the respondents in the case, as well as the attorney general of Pakistan, and advocate general Islamabad as the matter relates to the interpretation of provisions of the Constitution“. The hearing was adjourned till tomorrow.
A complaint pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council (SKC) last year in July, while a petition challenging his appointment was filed in the IHC earlier this year. The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
On September 16, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri then challenged the decision in the SC, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside and suspended during the pendency of the petition, and for the division bench to be directed to hold back from proceeding further.
Today, a five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, and including Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan took up Justice Jahangiri’s petition.
Also present at today’s hearing were Justice Jahangiri himself, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kiani, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz.
Also present at the hearing was the Islamabad Council member Aleem Abbasi, who requested the bench to make him, the council and the District Bar Association respondents in the case.
To this, Justice Mandokhel asked if they were a respondent in the IHC case as well, stating that the main petitioner was Justice Jahangiri.
Justice Aminuddin Khan, responding to this, said that the “SC will follow its own standard procedure and fix the application once it has been numbered.”
For his part, Justice Jahangiri’s lawyer, Munir A. Malik, told the court that this was the first instance that “a two-member judge has prevented a judge of its own high court from judicial work”. He argued that order issued against Justice Jahangiri was in violation of the law while the requirements of justice were also not met.
He noted that a writ petition was filed against Justice Jahangiri on July 10, 2024. “More than a year has passed yet the objections raised by the registrar’s office are still pending,” he said.
He told the court that after the writ petition against Justice Jahangiri was filed, there were several incidents of note, including the “transfer of three judges to IHC, which five IHC judges contested, but it was later declared valid”.
He said that the judge who issued the Sept 16 order against his client was the one against whose transfer the plea had been filed in the SC.
He reiterated that the objections raised on the plea filed against Justice Jahangiri still remained and the other parties in the case had not yet been heard. “Sixteen months have passed [since the plea was filed] and the objections still remain,” he said.
He also highlighted a recent order issued by the SC’s Justice Mandokhail, which stated that judges cannot initiate contempt proceedings against their peers and established that only the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has the constitutional authority to probe misconduct allegations against the judges of both the apex and high courts.
Meanwhile, Justice Hassan wondered how the plea against Justice Jahangiri was fixed for hearing when objections were raised by the registrar’s office. He told the lawyers of both sides to prepare arguments in this regard.
The hearing was subsequently adjourned for tomorrow.
Fake degree controversy
The controversy began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s examinations, regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC.
The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016.
It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri.
Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme.
On July 10, 2024, IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.”
As the degree accusations came to light, lawyer Mian Daud filed a writ petition, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer.
At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that Daud was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC.
On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its Unfair Means (UFM) Committee, varsity officials said.
The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree.
Then, on Sept 5 2024, the Sindh High Court (SHC) suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself.
To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person.
On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ  Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the SC.
Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.</p><small>2025-09-29 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29105403b119ea6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945420/asia-cup-naqvi-warns-india-against-dragging-war-into-sports-in-response-to-modi' target='_blank'><strong>Asia Cup: Naqvi warns India against ‘dragging war’ into sports in response to Modi</strong></a><br><p>Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief Mohsin Naqvi on Monday warned India against “dragging war” into sports, saying that doing so only exposed the neighbouring country’s “desperation” in a response aimed at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who politicised India’s Asia Cup final win against Pakistan.
In a post on X on Sunday night, Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on scoring a win in the final against the Green Shirts, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor — an operation that was launched against Pakistan during the four-day military conflict between the two countries in May.
“#OperationSindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he said.
 






In response to Modi’s post, Naqvi said, “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”.
“Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he said.
 






The exchange also follows the Indian cricket team refusing to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries.
“I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said on Sunday night.
PCB donates match fee to May 7 victims
Separately, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Monday that it would donate the team’s match fees to the civilians martyred during the May 7 Indian attack on Pakistan, after India’s SuryaKumar Yadav announced that he would donate his match fee to victims on the Indian side.
In a post on X, the the cricketing board said, “The Pakistan Cricket Team has dedicated its Asia Cup final match fees to the innocent victims martyred in the May 7 attack, in which civilians, including children, lost their lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families.”
 






India’s actions ‘disrespected cricket’: Salman Agha
Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Salman Agha said that India’s actions had “disrespected cricket” while speaking to reporters after the match, accroding to AFP.
“I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing,” Agha said.
“If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket.”
“What they did today, a good team doesn’t do that. Good teams do what we have done. We waited for our medals and took them.
“It’s been seen for the first time. I do not know where it will stop. What has happened in this tournament is bad for cricket,” he said.
Meanwhile, Yadav claimed that India was “denied” the trophy, but then went on to say that the team “took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy”.
“If you tell me about the trophies, my trophies are sitting in my dressing room — all the 14 players and support staff. They are the real trophies for me,” said Yadav.
‘Lack of sportsmanship’
Although the Pakistan-India matches went ahead despite calls from the Indian side to boycott them, all three were marred by controversy and high tensions between the two countries in the wake of their four-day military standoff in May.
India displayed consistent hostility towards the Pakistan team throughout each of their clashes, including refusing to shake hands with the players at the end of the games.
In addition, after the first victory against Pakistan on September 14, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was accused of politicising the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May, for which India blamed Islamabad without evidence.
Naqvi had expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” in a post on X and lodged a complaint with the ICC, which launched a probe into the remarks.
 






Further, during the September 21 match, when the rivals met for the second time, Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the match.
The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which killed more than two dozen people. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention. Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p><small>2025-09-29 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28204723aaf38a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945006/beyond-the-security-paradigm-what-pakistan-must-do-to-truly-leverage-the-defence-pact-with-saudi-arabia' target='_blank'><strong>Beyond the security paradigm: What Pakistan must do to truly leverage the defence pact with Saudi Arabia</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia’s Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA), signed at Al Yamamah Palace on Sept 17, is an inflection point for the bilateral relationship as well as the broader region.
The pact’s core commitment is unambiguous: an attack on one will be treated as an attack on both. That collective-defence clause matters in a region recalibrating its security architecture and hedging against external shocks.
But the real test of this agreement lies in how Islamabad and Riyadh can pivot from security symbolism to a joint economic mission anchored in reform, productivity and strategic integration across the security, industrial, and technological domains.
This requires Pakistan and Saudi Arabia working across multiple pillars to pursue economic, defence, and technological integration between the two economies. The strategy should be anchored in a clear economic agenda aligned with both countries’ need to reorient their economies.
 
 

On the Saudi side, this reorientation requires investments in building a competitive industrial and digital ecosystem, and on the Pakistani side, the goal is to generate economic growth through sectors that expand the country’s ability to sustainably earn foreign exchange.
Given this need, a Pakistani strategy that chases cheap loans, deferred oil payments or one-off discounts from Saudi Arabia in lieu of the SDMA would be futile and disastrous. The Saudis have clearly signalled that the era of handouts is over, and Pakistani policymakers should pay heed to this signalling.
The need of the hour therefore is to pursue a strategy that plugs Pakistan into Saudi Arabia’s investment, technology and supply-chain ambitions. This would require doing the hard work at home to direct Saudi capital into sectors that deliver mutually beneficial outcomes for both nations.
The big picture
Within this context, the defence track can be a bridge to industrial cooperation and economic integration. As Dr Jamal Al Harbi, the Saudi Media Attaché in Islamabad put it in a recent article, the pact “includes defence industry collaboration, with potential for technology transfer and co-production of military equipment, as well as capacity building and training, building on the longstanding tradition of Pakistani military personnel working with Saudi forces.”
This perspective points to a broader state of play between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and if pursued effectively, the SDMA is likely to lead to a strategic embrace that links security with industrial production, technology cooperation, and defence integration.
The first area of focus must be Pakistan’s energy markets, which remain trapped in a cycle of inefficiency, political paralysis, and circular debt. An ambitious deregulation programme to open the entire energy value chain, including oil, gas, refineries, and battery energy storage, would help attract Saudi capital under clear, rules-based frameworks.
For this to work, Islamabad would need to commit to time-bound reforms, ensure predictable contract enforcement, and empower regulators while disempowering the administrative state that insists on running the energy ecosystem, to disastrous effects. This initiative should also look at emerging technologies in energy, including electric vehicles, battery energy storage, and decentralised grids.
Such a programme would provide Riyadh the opportunity to acquire long-duration assets in Pakistan. It would also align with Vision 2030’s ambition to make Saudi Arabia an international investor in energy and industrial platforms, especially in emerging energy solutions.
For Pakistan, it promises stable supplies, reduced fiscal pressure, and a credible pathway for private capital to flow into a critical sector that is in dire need of reforms. In addition, Saudi capital can support Pakistan to build a future ready clean energy ecosystem paired with electric vehicles and large-scale battery energy storage capabilities.
Secondly, as articulated by Dr Al Harbi, the defence pact should evolve into industrial co-production. Aligning with Saudi Arabia’s defence-localisation targets, Pakistan can set up co-production hubs for drones, conventional platforms, secure communications, and cyber capabilities.
 
 

These facilities would need to emphasise local content, testing and qualification labs, and joint research and development. Other partners could also be plugged into this framework — some of this is already being signalled — creating a regional defence industrial ecosystem over the coming years that would allow for diversification of supply-chains and greater interoperability.
For Riyadh, this initiative would help diversify supply chains while advancing sovereign capabilities consistent with Vision 2030. For Pakistan, it provides industrial upgrading, skilled jobs, and technological gains that can spill over into other sectors and bilateral relationships.
The third pillar is investment, particularly through the Public Investment Fund (PIF). In addition to the energy sector, PIF investments can be directed into Pakistan’s emerging critical minerals sectors, including copper, gold, and rare earths, as well as initiatives for defence cooperation. Pakistan is already collaborating with the United States on critical minerals and mining, and bringing in PIF would further diversify interests and investments in Pakistan. As Barrick Mining’s flagship Reko Diq project becomes operational, its success can be leveraged to access PIF investment for processing and value-add capabilities in the mining sector.
For Saudi Arabia, such investments would help secure inputs for electric vehicles, defence systems, and clean-energy supply chains, while creating deal flow for PIF and companies like Ma’aden. For Pakistan, the flow of funds would lead to sustainable exports, adding to overall macroeconomic stability while lowering risk premium for finance and crowding in other investors. In addition, scaling up defence industrial capabilities would add to the country’s overall ability to defend itself and deter its rivals in the region.
The fourth opportunity lies in skills and technology. Both countries need to build their capacities when it comes to artificial intelligence, fintech, cybersecurity, and data processing at scale. This initiative could be led through joint startup accelerators in Riyadh, Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad, along with reciprocal seed funds to support founders building products for the region.
Such an initiative would help support Riyadh’s needs for securing access to a young and cost-effective talent pool that can power Vision 2030’s execution. For Pakistan, it would add further momentum to the country’s emerging information technology sector, creating middle-class jobs that earn foreign exchange while embedding the country’s technology firms in regional innovation.
Opportunities for fintech
The final pillar should seek to build joint capabilities around financial technology and inclusion. Pakistan is one of the largest recipients of remittances from Saudi Arabia, yet much of these flows remain expensive. A dedicated fintech vertical that is designed to cut financial friction within both economies, as well as in the flow of remittances, would be extremely impactful. In a world where Pakistani talent integrates with Saudi Arabia’s technology ecosystem, the increase in financial flows would require even greater investments in financial integration and innovation.
By linking Saudi fintechs and banks directly with Pakistani institutions, and integrating instant payments, shared e-KYC, and robust AML protocols, both countries could benefit.
 
 

Pakistan would see billions of dollars move into the formal economy, stabilising foreign-exchange reserves and improving worker welfare. Saudi Arabia would deepen its fintech ecosystem, while offering faster, more transparent channels for its expatriate community. The additional dividends through the development of credit histories for workers, wage-linked savings, and micro-insurance would create a virtuous cycle of financial inclusion.
All of this, however, will remain aspirational unless anchored in credible execution. What Pakistan needs is the discipline to turn this defence pact into an economic one that advances reform, productivity, and integration into regional value chains. If pursued with clarity, the SMDA could be remembered not just as a security commitment, but as the moment Islamabad and Riyadh truly began to reshape their economies together through integration. But if leveraged to secure access to cheap financial bailouts and discounted oil, the SDMA is likely to lead to disappointing outcomes.

Earlier in September, Pakistan rolled out the HPV vaccine nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. However, vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities.
“Success rate in Punjab has been 72pc,” Punjab’s health minister said during an interview with Geo News show “Geo Pakistan”.
“But we have not ended the campaign; instead, we have extended it for three days.”
He added, “The primary reason is that if we administer this vaccine to our girls now, those aged 9 to 14 will get it for free. But after the campaign ends, people will have to pay money for it, and only 9-year-old girls will be able to get it free of charge.”
Referring to the attacks on women health workers while administering vaccines in Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin district, the minister said he has ensured the suspects were arrested and that security measures have been put in place to protect health workers.
In the latest incident this week, the HPV vaccination team was performing its duty in a non-formal education school in the village of Ratuwal, within the limits of Kathian Sheikhan police station, when a 55-year-old resident of the village entered the school and attempted to attack a female health supervisor.
He said the rate of refusals was greater at the beginning of the campaign, with only 250,000 girls receiving the vaccine on the first day. However, towards the end, the number of refusals dropped to 90,000 from 300,000 after counselling was provided through their teams.
“More than 5.2 million girls have been vaccinated; however, our target was 7.2 million, which we hope to achieve by Wednesday,” the minister said.</p><small>2025-09-29 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68d94c173316e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945229/digitising-balochistans-finance' target='_blank'><strong>Digitising Balochistan’s finance</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan records the weakest socio-eco­nomic indicators in Pakistan. As highlighted in the United Nations Development Programme’s Multidimensional Poverty Index Report, nearly 71 per cent of the province’s population lives in multidimensional poverty, the highest in the country.
Development outcomes in health, education, water, sanitation, and hygiene remain persistently poor, reflecting the province’s chronic underdevelopment and the urgent need for sustained policy attention. Poor management, especially Balochistan’s fiscal mismanagement, has perpetuated governance challenges, with inefficient fund allocation and under-utilisation hindering development despite increased federal transfers under the 7th National Finance Commission Award.
Balochistan has never seen full utilisation of funds in its history, except for the development budget 2024-25 when the province utilised 90pc of its funds. The federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP_ funds have unfortunately followed the same trend, wherein, historically, Balochistan has received approximately 8–10pc of the total federal PSDP allocations, often resulting in prolonged project timelines, slow releases and delayed completions.
Institutional incapacity, corruption and the province’s political economy, characterised by patronage-based politics and clientelism, have always hindered effective planning, timely execution of development initiatives and efficient service delivery.

If properly executed, the province’s digitalisation initiative could lead to increased transparency, data accessibility and resource management

In such a situation, Baloc­histan’s recent attempts at the digitisation of the system can be instrumental in putting the province on a path towards development and good governance.
Across the globe, digitisation of public administration has emerged as a foundation for enhancing efficiency, transparency, accountability and citizen-centric service delivery. Reco­nising this necessity, the Government of Balochistan has introduced the Digital Financial Management Information System, including the Finance GPT and E-Filing System. This initiative marks an attempt to transition towards digital governance along with the intent to reform.
Developed by the finance department under the Public Finance Management reforms, the initiative was formally launched by the Chief Minister of Balochistan Mir Sarfraz Bugti on September 16, 2025. This appears to be a potential positive step towards efficiency and regulation for development.
The initiative consists of e-filing and digital financial management aimed at streamlining financial systems and minimising bureaucratic delays and public oversight. The Finance GPT, obviously inspired by ChatGPT, is a take on the AI tool claimed to have been pioneered by the Balochistan government to understand and accordingly answer questions or prompts by individuals. The provincial public sector data, including human resources, budget, development projects and other related information, has been linked with the tool to provide a window for policymakers, officers and the common masses to seek any information they want.
This effort could be instrumental in minimising red tape bureaucracy and making civil servants accountable to the people. Above all, ease of business could become a reality for attracting investors to take part in Balochistan’s growth and development.
While the e-filing system, supported by the Finance GPT, represents a step toward e-governance, it will require continuous effort and time to fully mature; its potential to restructure governance and improve service delivery may be present, but unless decided effort is poured into the project, it may very well fall through.
However, if properly executed, the programme could display many benefits. By placing information directly in the hands of citizens, the initiative can foster greater public participation in policy formulation, budget processes, and accountability mechanisms. For policymakers, the system could become a powerful tool to collect data, conduct analysis, and make informed and evidence-based decisions in a province that otherwise suffers from a crippling lack of useable data.
In terms of monitoring and supervision, authorities could track human resource availability and performance in real time, identifying gaps and ensuring timely redressal. Furthermore, universities and research institutions could take advantage of this digital system to advance research, policy studies, and development initiatives.
The journey toward e-governance in Balochistan is not and will not be without hurdles. Scaling the system across all departments and down to the grassroots level will require overcoming deep-rooted inefficiencies, lack of capacity among lower-tier officials, resistance from segments of the civil bureaucracy and vested interest groups.
Added to this are intrinsic structural barriers such as the energy crisis and limited internet accessibility in the districts, which can slow down implementation. Addressing these challenges demands strong political will, administrative commitment, institutional strengthening, and continuous capacity building.
If pursued with consistency and determination, these reforms can transform Balochistan into a digitally enabled province where good governance, inclusive growth, and efficient service delivery can become a reality.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, September 29th, 2025</p><small>2025-09-29 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945226/there-goes-the-dollar-dream' target='_blank'><strong>There goes the dollar dream</strong></a><br><p>A steep hike in US visa fees for immigrant workers may affect remittance inflows from America, but with its share at roughly 10 per cent of Pakistan’s total remittances, the overall impact is likely to be limited. The strain will fall harder on families and firms dependent on US earnings, while higher costs may also push Pakistani youth seeking study and work opportunities abroad to explore alternative destinations.
President Donald Trump’s executive order last week imposed a steep $100,000 fee on new H-1B skilled worker visas, up from the earlier range of $1,500 to $5,000, depending on company size. The move has alarmed Pakistani professionals and businesses that rely heavily on US opportunities.
The steep visa fee hike is intended to curb system abuse and safeguard American workers. It is expected to discourage US companies from hiring foreign talent at the current levels, adding fuel to wider debate on remittances and labour market.
 
 

Confusion initially surrounded the scope of the new visa fee. Early interpretations, sparking alarm in the high-tech sector that relies heavily on foreign talent, suggested the $100,000 charge was annual. The White House later clarified it is one-time fee applied only at the submission of a new H-1B petition. The rule does not affect current H-1B holders or applicants who filed before Sept 21.

The new pricey H-1B visa may reshape skilled migration to the US, redirecting Pakistani professionals towards Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australia and even China

The US Department of Labour is reportedly updating prevailing wage rules to restrict H-1B visas to highly qualified foreign workers. At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security has announced that the H-1B lottery will prioritise higher-paid, high skilled applicants over lower-earning candidates, with further reforms to visa regime under review. The H-1B category was originally introduced in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush.
The critics of the ‘liberal’ H-1B regime argue it is being exploited by recruitment firms to import workers at wages below those paid to Americans, undercutting local jobs while gaming the system. Currently, the minimum annual salary for H-1B visa holders is $60,000, while a comparable American tech worker often earns $100,000 or more.
The top five beneficiaries of the H-1B skilled worker visa programme are Indians, Chinese, Filipinos, Canadians and South Koreans. US government data for 2024 shows Indians received 71pc of approved H-1B visas, followed by Chinese nationals with 11.7pc, Filipinos 1.3 pc, Canadians 1.1pc and South Koreans 1pc.
When it comes to employers sponsoring H-1B visas, the picture is more complex and reflects a shifting pattern. For years, Indian technology companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Cognizant, Infosys and Wipro dominated, consistently holding top four spots since 2009. In recent years, US tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon have also emerged as major recruiters of immigrant talent.

Currently, the minimum annual salary for H-1B visa holders is $60,000, while a comparable American tech worker often earns $100,000 or more.

Following President Trumps announcement, media reports said several companies and banks with large immigrant workforces issued memos advising employees not to travel abroad to avoid potential visa complications.
Pakistan may not be among the hardest hit, but has also long benefited from the H-1B visa programme, with its skilled workers employed in the US in fields of information technology, engineering, management, banking, and healthcare. The new steep visa fee could price many Pakistanis out, as US firms weigh costs against hiring locally. This shift may reshape skilled migration to the US, pushing Pakistani professionals to seek alternatives through L-1 or O-1 visas, or redirect them toward Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australia and even China.
The State Bank of Pakistan is reportedly assessing the potential impact on remittances and foreign exchange reserves. Its media department referred the query in this regard to the relevant wing, but a formal response was still awaited at the time of filing this report.
Pakistan’s workers’ remittances hit a record $38.3 billion in FY25, up 26.6pc from the previous year. While the overall figure is unprecedented, the exact contribution from the US for the full year was not readily available.
The United States has long been a significant source of Pakistan’s remittances, with its share in the recent years ranging between 8–11pc, below Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the UK, but steadily rising. In the early 2000s, the US share was considerably lower, closer to 5pc, but it increased significantly by the 2020s as more Pakistanis migrated and options for formal money transfer channels improved. A steep visa fee hike could slow new job placements in the US and eventually weigh on remittance growth from the US, though the effect is likely to be gradual, since most current flows come from established workers.
Senior finance and planning ministry officials and members of the government’s economic team were approached for comment, but no response was received before the filing of this article.
Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, September 29th, 2025</p><small>2025-09-29 06:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68d94c3512ff0.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945228/another-stab-at-circular-debt' target='_blank'><strong>Another stab at circular debt</strong></a><br><p>The government’s Rs1.225 trillion syndicated financing deal with 18 banks — the largest in Pakistan’s history — is being trumpeted as a landmark move to ease the power sector’s crippling circular debt. Tied to an existing surcharge on electricity bills, the cashflow-backed plan is touted as a step towards fiscal stability and energy sector reform. Yet critics and supporters warn that, without deeper structural changes, it could end up as just another costly rerun of past bailouts.
Under the deal, the government will use Rs565 billion in fresh financing to settle its unpaid dues to power producers while restructuring older loans worth Rs660bn, previously contracted at Kibor plus 2.5–4 per cent and parked with Power Holding Limited, a shell subsidiary of the power ministry. The six-year repayment will be made through the existing Rs3.23 per unit debt servicing surcharge on electricity bills. The government has already amended the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority Act through the Finance Bill 2025-26 to scrap a cap that had restricted such surcharges to 10pc of the base tariff.
 
 

The power sector’s circular debt — a recurring cycle of unpaid financial obligations across the energy supply chain — remains one of Pakistan’s most intractable challenges, undermining macroeconomic and fiscal stability. Its ripple effects extend to growth, inflation, the external account, and the financial sector. As of July 2025, the debt stood at Rs1.661tr. It rose by Rs47bn in just one month during July.
According to power minister Awais Khan Leghari, circular debt was reduced from Rs2.393tr last fiscal year by creating Rs780bn in fiscal space: Rs242bn through lower theft, system losses and better recoveries; Rs175bn from falling interest rates; and Rs363bn via revised power purchase agreements with Independent Power Producers, excluding Chinese and government-to-government projects under the Chine-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Officials also claim the latest deal will save consumers Rs377bn in late payment charges.

The earlier the debt is settled, the sooner the surcharge disappears and the quicker electricity prices decline

The fresh attempt to retire the so-called circular debt recalls a similar exercise in 2013, when the government injected Rs480bn to clear the sector’s outstanding dues. Since then, successive efforts to address the problem — largely through repeated tariff hikes or sporadic bailout and subsidy packages — have failed to deliver desired results, primarily because the underlying structural weaknesses and inefficiencies of the power sector have remained unaddressed.
The new financing arrangement is expected to generate significant savings for the government on markup payments, as banks have agreed to take a considerable hit on their earnings by accepting a floating rate set at Kibor minus 90 basis points — roughly 150 bps below the rate at which the loans are currently booked.
In addition, sovereign guarantees on both the restructured loans and the fresh financing have been withdrawn, while an effective cap has been imposed on the interest rate, limiting the government’s mark-up liability strictly to the amount recovered through the Rs3.23 per unit Debt Service Surcharge (DSS). In yet another concession, the banks have also agreed to forgo the usual requirement of a floor on the interest rate, which typically accompanies a cap, thereby offering even more favourable terms to the government.
A key feature of the facility is its structure, which allows the loan to be repaid ahead of the envisaged six-year schedule if interest rates fall further and grid electricity consumption increases. Should the plan unfold as anticipated, Mr Leghari says, consumers could benefit from the removal of the DSS, resulting in as much as a 10pc reduction in electricity tariffs. In essence, the earlier the debt is settled, the sooner the surcharge disappears and the quicker electricity prices decline. On the other hand, if borrowing costs rise and/or power consumption dips from current levels, the existing surcharge on consumer bills would need to be increased to ensure timely repayment of the loans.
Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA) chairman Zafar Masud described the initiative as a potential turning point for both the energy sector and the broader economy. “This deal proves that when interests align, execution becomes far easier. For banks, it means long-outstanding power-sector loans of Rs660bn will finally be repaid through the dedicated DSS stream. For consumers, there is no additional burden, while both old and new debt can be settled within four to six years, depending on the trajectory of interest rates.
“It is also a win for the government, as the sovereign guarantee freed up after the debt settlement can now be redirected towards priority sector financing in agriculture, SMEs, low-cost housing, and impact initiatives in education and health. Moreover, the transaction has enabled the government to secure better terms with power companies, resulting in savings of at least Rs1.1tr in late payment surcharges and penalties, a substantial relief for the public exchequer.”
Despite the positive spin, many fear that circular debt will continue to accumulate, forcing the government into another such exercise — or direct fiscal injections from taxpayers — within a few years. “We have travelled this path before. In 2013, the PML-N government wiped out the outstanding circular debt, but it soon resurfaced because the fundamental problems were left unresolved,” an energy sector expert cautioned.
In recent weeks, both the Washington-based Institute of International Finance (IIF) and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry have warned that such loans and fiscal injections are unsustainable in the absence of far-reaching structural reforms. Without cutting system losses, improving recoveries, and tackling the sector’s deep inefficiencies, they argue, Pakistan will find itself back in the same crisis cycle.
Another risk stems from the power sector’s exposure to exchange rate volatility, as acknowledged by the minister at his Friday press conference. “The power sector will remain exposed to exchange rate volatility for up to eight years because of dollar-indexed investments, especially those tied to Chinese projects. Power plants commissioned after 2015, mostly under CPEC, with a combined generation capacity of over 11,000 MW were financed in dollars and remain highly vulnerable to currency depreciation,” he noted.
The government has, to its credit, initiated some measures aimed at curbing leakages, strengthening governance, enforcing cash flow discipline, and ring-fencing funds to ensure sector debt is serviced. A key step in this regard has been the decision to channel the debt servicing surcharge exclusively towards repayment of sector liabilities, rather than allowing it to vanish into the general revenue pool.
According to the PBA chairman, “This time the reforms go beyond ad hoc bailouts. There is now a growing emphasis on plugging systemic leakages, ensuring timely payments throughout the supply chain, and rethinking the subsidy framework so that support reaches the most vulnerable without disrupting the entire revenue cycle.”
Yet he struck a note of caution: “The key challenge is to stop new flows from building up in the future.”

The five-day vaccination effort in May conducted by Emergency Operation Centre, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, recorded 17,136 children without getting oral polio vaccine (OPV), mostly due to parents’ reluctance due to misconception that the drops were not allowed in Islam or on the pretext that those were designed by western countries to render the recipients infertile and impotent and reduce the population of Muslims.
The first argument has been vehemently rejected by edicts issued by Islamic scholars from reputed universities and religious schools. The second plea advanced for non-vaccination has been rejected by laboratory scientists, saying these drops are safe and have played instrumental role in eradicating the crippling ailment worldwide.
However, the recently-concluded vaccination drive last week, shows that the number of refusals against polio drops has dwindled to 14,712, which the authorities attribute to the hard work of frontline vaccinators with strong backing of district administrations and district health officers.

Only 17,136 children remained unvaccinated in previous campaign

In May, the tally of children staying unvaccinated due to their non-availability during door-to-door visits by health workers was 64,328, which rose by less than 1,000.
 
 

Peshawar as usual remained atop of list of refusal cases by recording 5,977 unvaccinated children in September down from 6,812 recorded in May while Lakki Marwat occupied second spot with 2,128 refusal cases compared to 2,382 recorded by the district in September.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has detected 18 polio cases, the highest number recorded by any province in Pakistan this year so far. The total number of polio cases registered in the country in the ongoing year in 27.
The disease has crippled seven children in Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, four cases have been recorded in Lakki Marwat, Tank and North Waziristan each, three in Bannu, and one each in Torghar, Kohistan Lower and Dera Ismail Khan.
The disease is mostly prevalent in violence-stricken southern districts of the province where the number of refusals and non-available children is more than the rest of the province.
Except Peshawar, the situation in central districts and Malakand is not worrisome as the vaccinators do not have problems in reaching the target population but the southern belt is fraught with issues that have been hampering the smooth-sailing of the drive, making the dream of polio-eradication more difficult.
Officials at EOC say that Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, in his capacity as chairman of Task Force on Polio, is aware of the issues in southern districts and has been holding meetings with district administrations and issuing instructions to them before every drive to ensure that all children below five years receive anti-polio drops in every effort.
The last drive was conducted peacefully as no case of violence was reported but the problem of unvaccinated children remained the major task, they said.
“Our workers are reaching more than 99 per cent target children but less than one per cent children stay unvaccinated due to refusals or non-availability during the campaign. For getting polio eradication certificate, we need to ensure that all children are inoculated in every campaign for three consecutive years,” said officials.
They said that in every campaign, they missed very few children due to which eradication of the crippling disease was not possible.
There are known people, who are opposed to vaccination and they have been denying polio vaccination for years on flimsy grounds.
This vicious cycle continues to thwart the eradication efforts as well as loss of lives of policemen and health workers, who are killed by unidentified armed men during anti-polio campaigns in the province.

According to a statement issued on Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari has summoned the NA session at the Parliament House on Monday (today) at 5 pm. Before the sitting, a meeting of parliamentary leaders summoned by Speaker Ayaz Sadiq will be held at 4pm to finalise the agenda.
Another highlight of the session would be PML-N leader Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry thanking the president for his address to both houses on March 10. The NA meeting comes amid disagreements between the PML-N and PPP on flood relief measures. Parliamentary experts believe that both sides will again exchange barbs regarding the proposed use of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) to help flood victims — a move opposed by some in the government.
 
 

The issue of current tensions in AJK and a protest scheduled for today (Monday) by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee will also likely be discussed in the house.

Govt to table three bills; speaker calls meeting ahead of session to ‘finalise’ agenda

The government is also likely to take credit for its recent foreign policy achievements.
Three bills to be moved
The government is also expected to table three bills. On the first day, state minister for finance and revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani will move a bill for reforms of the regulatory regime applicable to business, trade and investment by removing complex regulatory requirements and to establish the Pakistan Regulatory Registry and Pakistan Business Portal (Asaan Karobar Bill, 2025).
Senator Ahad Cheema will seek amendments to the Civil Servants Act 1973 through the Civil Servants (Amendment) Bill 2025. Housing minister Riaz Hussain Pirzada will table the Pakistan Infrastructure Deve­lopment and Assets Management Authority Bill 2025 for the establishment of the assets management authority.
In a calling attention notice, MNA Riaz Fatyana will invite the attention of the minister-in-charge of the Cabinet Secretariat to the “poor performance” of the NDMA in Kamalia, Pir Mehal, Tandlianwala and Chichawatni in Toba Tek Singh during the recent floods. Likewise, MNA Anjum Aqeel Khan will invite the attention of the interior minister to the delay in payment to persons whose land was acquired by Islamabad CDA in sectors E-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16 and H-16.

The report highlights that just $200 billion a year is invested in conservation, representing under one per cent of the global GDP.
The Third Global Report on “Harnessing Climate and SDG Synergy – Quantifying the Benefits,” by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA), warns that synergistic action is the only viable path forward.
With the annual financing gaps for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate action measured in the trillions of dollars, “synergistic action is not optional but the most efficient and impactful path forward”, the report says.
According to the findings, acting jointly on climate and sustainable development can deliver almost 40pc greater efficiency, freeing up resources and maximising benefits. The report, developed by the independent Expert Group on Climate and SDGs Synergies, states that the extra investment required to achieve the SDGs related to water, food, health and climate change is at least $4tr annually.
At least $500 billion more per year would be needed to tackle climate change. It also cautions that the cost of addressing biodiversity loss could double if action is delayed by a decade.
“Exposure to climate change risks could double between a global warming of 1.5 centigrade and 2 centigrade and double again between 2 centigrade and 3 centigrade, severely impacting multiple sectors,” the report says.  The analysis underscores the deep connection between the two agendas, noting that over 80pc of SDG targets are directly linked to climate change issues.
Estimates suggest that acting on climate and human development together can achieve up to 37pc greater efficiency in government spending compared to pursuing them in isolation.

He said US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law who was a Middle East envoy during his first term, were having talks with Netanyahu in New York ahead of the meeting at the White House.
“Were getting a very good response because Bibi wants to make the deal too,” Trump said in a telephone interview, using Netanyahu’s nickname.
 
 

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump earlier hinted at a breakthrough in the Middle East crisis. “We have a real chance for GREATNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST,” Trump said. “ALL ARE ON BOARD FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL, FIRST TIME EVER. WE WILL GET IT DONE!!!”

US envoy to Israel’s rare visit to Egypt postponed; 21 Palestinians killed as Israeli tanks thrust deeper into Gaza

When international leaders gathered at the United Nations in New York this week, the US unveiled a 21-point Middle East peace plan to end the nearly two-year-long war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.
That plan calls for the return of all prisoners, living and dead, no further Israeli attacks on Qatar and a new dialogue between Israel and Palestinians for peaceful coexistence, a White House official said.
A Hamas representative earlier said the group had not seen the US plan.
Trump on Sunday credited the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt and Jordan, among others, for helping in the process.
He said the deal would not only end the Gaza conflict but would work towards a broader peace in the Middle East. “Everybody’s involved,” he said. “Everybody wants it, and Hamas wants it, and one of the reasons is because everybody’s tired”.
Netanyahu, in an interview on Fox News channel’s “The Sunday Briefing,” said it is possible to have amnesty for Hamas leaders under terms of the agreement. “The details of this have to be worked out,” he said.
Meanwhile, a visit to Egypt by Washington’s top envoy to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has been postponed, a US official said on Sunday.
 
 

Huckabee was scheduled to visit Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials.
Egypt, along with the United States and Qatar, has been mediating between Israel and Hamas in efforts to end the war.
Cairo has criticised Israel’s ongoing air and ground assault in Gaza City, where the United Nations estimated a million people resided before the offensive began. Since the war broke out, Egypt has repeatedly warned that the fighting risks driving hundreds of thousands of Palestinians across its border into the Sinai Peninsula.
Israeli tanks thrust deeper into Gaza
In Gaza Israeli tanks moved deeper into Gaza City’s residential districts on Sunday, as local health authorities said they have been unable to respond to dozens of desperate calls, expressing concern about the fate of residents in the targeted areas.
Witnesses and medics said Israeli tanks had deepened their incursions in the Sabra, Tel Al-Hawa, Sheikh Radwan and Al-Naser neighborhoods, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.
The Civil Emergency Service in Gaza said late on Saturday that Israel had denied 73 requests, sent via international organisations, to rescue injured Palestinians in Gaza City.
Over the past 24 hours, the Israeli air force had struck 140 infrastructures what it described as ‘military targets’ across Gaza.
Medics reported 16 more deaths in strikes on houses in central Gaza, bringing Sunday’s death toll to 21. Israeli forces have already killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in past two years.
Meanwhile, Hamas asked the Israeli military to temporarily halt strikes as it tried to locate the two Israeli prisoners it said it had lost contact with. “The lives of the two prisoners are in real danger, and (Israeli) forces must immediately withdraw to the south of Street 8 and halt aerial operations for 24 hours starting from 18:00 today to allow attempts to rescue the prisoners,” wrote the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades in a statement.
In a previous announcement, the armed group said the loss of contact was due to Israeli military operations in two southern Gaza City neighbourhoods over the previous 48 hours.

As it turned out External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar spoke for India, stressing self-reliance, self-protection and self-confidence as his mantras. Mentioning all three in Sanskrit, Jaishankar insisted on using the name Bharat for India to stay with the fine point about Hindu nationalists.
There was no official explanation given for Modi skipping the UN session this year, but clear evidence does indicate that it had to do with US President Donald Trump openly switching his preference from India to Pakistan as a closer friend in South Asia.
 
 

The standard rule of Modi always meeting the US President during his visits to the UN was in jeopardy. It was not necessarily because Trump may have signalled disinterest in such a meeting, but it was more likely the optics of Pakistan’s prime minister and army chief appearing in cosy frames with the US President that was the last straw to deter the Indian PM from the visit.
Modi had, however, shown his preparedness to go around the cloud of tariffs and verbal invectives hurled at him by Trump. India has kept its trade talks open with the US in the hope that the alternative of New Delhi moving closer to Beijing would dawn on US policy makers as an avoidable risk. But this seems to have been overestimated by India.
The Indian prime minister spared no effort to signal the alternative scenario. His meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the SCO summit in Tianjin was not only warm but also effusive. Apart from the formal expression of gratitude for the hospitality, Modi spoke of their meeting in Kazan, saying: “We had very productive discussions, which gave a positive direction to our relations. After the disengagement at the border, an atmosphere of peace and stability is now in place. Our Special Representatives have also reached an agreement on border management. The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra has resumed. Direct flights are also being resumed between the two countries. Our cooperation is linked to the interests of 2.8 billion people of our two countries. This will also pave the way for the welfare of all humanity. We are committed to advancing our relations based on mutual trust, respect, and sensitivity.”
In his speech at the SCO summit, Modi did mention a thorny issue with China but without naming it.
“We believe that every effort towards connectivity must uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said.
“This is also enshrined in the core principles of the SCO Charter. Connectivity, that by-passes sovereignty, ultimately loses both trust and meaning.” The reference was clearly to the Karakoram Highway and the Shaksgam Valley that Pakistan ceded to China in 1962 and which India disputes.
Signalling a positive framework for working with China, Modi made a similar pitch with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “India and Russia have always stood shoulder-to-shoulder even in the most difficult situations. Our close cooperation is important not only for the people of both countries, but also for global peace, stability, and prosperity.”
He was looking forward to receiving Putin in New Delhi in December. Those are daring words if Trump is the audience. Modi added another challenge to the mix by mentioning India’s engagement with Iran’s Chabahar Port, which the US frowns on.
The twist in the tale, however, is that Pakistan is invested in flourishing ties with all three countries Modi is interested in, namely the US, Russia and China.

In a detailed set of objections to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), Aptma demanded a stringent reality check of the exaggerated demand forecasts based on population and GDP growth, allegedly without taking into account ground realities taking shape in the country and the power sector.
The association said it has “a fundamental issue with the demand-forecasting methodology, which undermines the credibility of the entire plan” and suggested a broader set of priorities for incorporation in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expa­nsion Plan (IGCEP 2025-35) “to realign energy planning with on-the-ground economic real­ities and critical need for affordability and competitiveness in power tariffs”.
 
 

It said the IGCEP employed an overly simplistic and rather incorrect statistical (regression) model that linked grid electricity consumption to GDP growth, population growth and similar macro variables. The underlying assumption is that as the economy and population expand, grid demand will rise proportionally.
However, this approach could not account for substitution effects arising from captive power (gas or furnace-oil generators), rooftop solar (or distributed solar), gas-fired boilers, solar water heaters, electric stoves, and other decentralised energy sources, which increasingly serve as alternatives to grid electricity.
“In omitting these, the model incorrectly absorbs their influence into the residual, attributing too much of the growth in economic activity to increased grid consumption. The result is a systematic overstatement of grid demand growth,” Aptma said.
Such a plan had econometric and statistical implications, it said, adding that the endogeneity problem with the model was that when substitutes are omitted, their effects get absorbed in the error term. Since GDP and population growth also drive adoption of captive and solar among other non-grid sources of energy, the error term becomes correlated with the regressors.
This endogeneity correlation also leads to biased and inconsistent estimates in the statistical sense of the terms, as the elasticity of grid demand with respect to GDP and population growth is exaggerated.
“In Pakistan’s context, where non-grid sources of energy are growing rapidly, the structural bias leads to a systematic overestimation of future grid demand,” it said, adding that this meant the forecast for grid demand was too high because the model ignored alternative energy sources.
“This upward bias encourages excessive generation additions, which in turn produce inflated capacity payments, stranded assets, and heightened financial stress in the system,” the association said, alleging that IGCEP’s demand forecast was upward-biased by design.
Moreover, the econometric issue of endogeneity meant that results were unreliable and, in practice, overestimated.
“This problem has been prevalent throughout the years, and its implications are visible in the massive stranded capacity on the grid and the resulting escalation of power tariffs”, Aptma said, adding that it was not a minor technicality but a fundamental flaw in the power sector’s demand forecast. The same “flawed methodology” is also used to estimate demand for consumer tariff determinations, meaning that those forecasts, too, are systematically flawed and biased.
This becomes even more perilous given the fact that IGCEP itself acknowledged that the energy and power demand forecast was the basis for all planning activities in the power sector. It is one of the decisive inputs for the generation planning (Planning Code (PC-4) of Grid Code 2023).
“This makes the flaw monumental because if the foundation is faulty, the entire edifice of planning collapses. A biased demand forecast, hence, makes the entirety of the subsequent planning exercise unreliable, leading to mis-investment, excess costs, and inflated tariffs,” it asserted.
Aptma observed that unless affordability was made the central organising principle of energy planning, the IGCEP will continue to reinforce the problems feeding to the runaway escalation of capacity payments, which had increased from Rs2 per unit to Rs17.06 per unit in about 10 years and now consume over half of the consumer tariff and cumulatively amount to more than Rs6 trillion over the past decade — exceeding the total fuel cost in the system.
“Such levels are clearly unsustainable in a country already constrained by weak fiscal space, dwindling industrial growth, and limited affordability,” Aptma said.
It demanded that “no new generation addition should be justified without first reducing this burden to below Rs5 per unit. This ceiling must become a binding benchmark in all future planning and approvals” to inject discipline into a planning environment long driven by megawatt targets, donor pressures, and short-term paradigms, often at the expense of consumer capacity to pay.
Aptma also pointed out that the country currently faced demand stagnation, overcapacity, and stranded risk, and the planning should address these challenges. It said the industrial demand in FY2025 declined by around 4pc, and agricultural consumption plunged by more than one-third as farmers turned to diesel and solar alternatives.
This meant the national demand growth was stagnant, yet the IGCEP projected an addition of nearly 20,000 MW in capacity. “This mismatch leads to more idle plants, steep fixed costs, and escalating circular debt,” it said.

• Punjab govt sets Oct 4 deadline to plug Sutlej breaches
• M5 still shut as over 200 villages inundated in south Punjab
• China airlifts tents, blankets for flood-hit families
HYDERABAD/DADU/ LAHO­RE: Kotri Barrage passed the peak of its medium flood on Sat­urday but remained in a medium-flood state through Sunday evening.
On Saturday morning, Kotri recorded 421,075 cusecs upstream and 393,560 cusecs downstream, easing to 412,965 and 386,650 cusecs by noon.
On Sunday, upstream flows were 387,808 cusecs with 362,253 cusecs downstream; some 25,555 cusecs were drawn for the barrage’s four canals. Flood peaks have already moved past Guddu and Sukkur barrages, where flows have normalised.
Meanwhile, high pressure persisted along the Indus at Nasri Bund, Lakhhat Bund, Mid Bangli Bund and Amri Bridge, leading to intensified rescue efforts.
Rescue 1122 Shaheed Benazirabad evacuated dozens of residents from Ali Khan Mari village to safer locations and helped move livestock and belongings.
Officials have termed the situation “alarming” and urged residents in vulnerable areas to remain vigilant and cooperate with rescue teams. Local authorities said they were monitoring embankments and stood ready to take further protective measures.
The Punjab government has set Oct 4 as the deadline to plug all broken embankments along the Sutlej to contain flooding that has submerged more than 200 villages across Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts. The villages of Multan’s tehsil Jalalpur Pirwala, Lodhran and Uch Sharif were submerged after Noraja Bhutta embankment at the Sutlej River broke due to extremely high water flow 15 days ago.
The floodwater passed from these breaches and rose around the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5) from Jhangra in the Bahawalpur district to Jalalpur Pirwala. The floodwater passed through M5 after breaching it at several points and created a 20km to 25km-long inland lake between Gilani Road and the motorway.
 
 

Due to the breaches, the motorway has been closed for traffic from Uch Sharif interchange to Jalalpur Pirwala for the last 15 days. The closure of all traffic between southern and central Punjab has disrupted supply chains and stranded thousands of vehicles and forced travellers onto perilous alternative routes.
The situation remains dire in the eastern areas of Jalalpur Pirwala, where villages, including Noraja Bhutta, Basti Lang, Kotla Chakar, Bahadurpur, Mouza Kanu, Kandeer, Jhaiyu, Deepal, Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur, Belaywala, Dunyapur, Jhangra, Muradpur Soiwala and Sabra are surrounded by eight to 10 feet of stagnant water. The relentless pressure has caused widespread destruction of homes and property.
Meanwhile, as the Punjab government earlier this week launched a survey to assess the losses caused by recent floods, the PPP urged PM Shehbaz to accept its demand for providing immediate relief to the flood-affected people through the Benazir Income Support Programme. The PML-N and the PPP — coalition partners at the Centre and in Punjab — have been at odds over how to help the flood victims, with the former’s government in Punjab insisting on using its own resources, while the latter is adamant about using BISP.
 
 

Punjab Minister for Irrigation Kazim Ali Pirzada said on Sunday that three out of seven breaches at the Noraja Bhutta embankment on the Sutlej River were plugged completely and they were carrying the work to plug two more breaches. He said that the largest breach was 3,300 feet wide, which, according to the latest updates, was reduced to 1,650 feet.
The minister said that the Irrigation Department was utilising all its capabilities and resources to ensure that the remaining breaches should be completely plugged by the evening of Oct 4.
He further stated that the water level in the area is gradually receding. A team of experts will conduct another technical review of the situation on Oct 6 to better plan future measures.
Earlier, Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said that the rehabilitation and relief activities for flood victims have been formally initiated. He said that as the river situation has normalised, affected people have started returning to their homes, while the administration continues to provide dry rations in the affected areas.
China sends relief flights
Two Chinese relief flights carrying 300 tents and 9,000 blankets landed at Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi on Sunday for families displaced by the floods.
Federal Minister Engr Amir Muqam, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik, Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong and officials from the Foreign Office and NDMA received the consignment.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Muqam thanked China for the timely assistance and said that China’s contribution is not only a humanitarian endeavour but also a reaffirmation of the everlasting Pakistan-China friendship.

South Africa were reeling early in their chase of 229 when pacer Diana Baig took two early wickets, leaving them 27-3 inside six overs.
Sune Luus and Anneke Bosch rebuilt the innings and added a 100-run partnership for the fourth wicket.
Chloe Tryon ensured there were no further hiccups for the Proteas Women after losing five wickets with 151 on board, guiding South Africa home with an unbeaten 45. sealing a comfortable win with almost ten overs to spare.
 






Pakistan, batting first, were bowled out for 229 in 46 overs.
Captain Fatima Sana top-scored with a terrific 64 laden with 8 boundaries and a six,
Batters Sidra Amin and Sidra Nawaz also made useful contributions at the top, being involved in crucial partnerships.
However, Pakistan struggled for momentum as wickets fell at regular intervals.
Ayabonga Khaka and Masabata Klass secured two wickets each for South Africa.
“The result will boost South Africa’s confidence heading into their opening clash against England on October 4, while Pakistan will take positives from Fatima Sana’s batting and Diana Baig’s fiery opening spell as they begin their World Cup campaign against Bangladesh on October 3,” The International Cricket Council said.

The Women in Green arrived in the Sri Lankan capital late on Tuesday as the tournament is set to start on September 30 in India’s Guwahati.
The eight-nation showpiece will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from Sept 30 to Nov 2. However, Pakistan — under an International Cricket Council (ICC) hybrid model decided by the ICC due to political strains between New Delhi and Islamabad — will play all their matches of the event in Colombo.
Their first warm-up encounter with Sri Lanka on September 25 was rained off.
Despite losing the recent one-day International (ODI) home series against South Africa, Pakistan were well prepared and had no extra pressure to face arch-rivals India in the forthcoming ICC World Cup, captain Fatima Sana said on Tuesday.
The Fatima-led team won the third and final ODI against South Africa in Lahore last week, but the tourists took the series 2-1.
Pakistan had qualified for the World Cup on the back of an unbeaten run in the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifiers held in Lahore in April of this year.</p><small>2025-09-28 22:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/290215533fb4b13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945354/politics-spill-over-again-in-cricket-as-india-refuse-to-collect-asia-cup-trophy' target='_blank'><strong>Politics spill over again in cricket as India refuse to collect Asia Cup trophy</strong></a><br><p>The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Asian Cricket Council chief Mohsin Naqvi, as politics continued to spill over the pitch.
India had earlier beaten Pakistan by five wickets in the last over after a close contest to win a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, but they caused the post-final formalities to be inordinately delayed due to their refusal to budge from their stance.
There were no customary handshakes between the teams after India refused, with tensions high from their previous two clashes in the competition, which witnessed political posturing and aggressive on-field behaviour.
 
 

The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Naqvi, who is also the Interior Minister, was supposed to present the winners’ trophy, but there were indications that India would resent that when their captain Suryakumar Yadav did not participate in the customary pre-toss photoshoot before the final.
“I have been informed by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said.
When asked about his refusal to collect the trophy at the post-match press conference and their actions leading to the politicisation of the game, the Indian skipper declined to answer the question.
 


The post-final ceremony saw Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha receive the runners-up trophy while Indian players Tilak Varma, Kuldeep Yadav and Abhishek Sharma collect their respective individual awards.
 
 

India’s refusal to collect the trophy from Naqvi marks a historic low in the cricketing relations between the neighbours, with the game having acted as a stage for diplomacy in the past.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a political reference in his post on X congratulating the Indian team. “Operation Sindoor on the game’s field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he wrote.
Suryakumar’s men had earlier capped a remarkable unbeaten run with their third victory against Pakistan at the Asia Cup.
Put into bat, Pakistan could not capitalise on an 84-run opening stand between Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) and were bundled out for 146 with five deliveries still left in their innings.
Pakistan lost their last nine wickets for 33 runs in a spectacular meltdown, with India’s left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (4-30) being the wrecker-in-chief.
The Green Shirts struck back to leave India reeling at 20-3 with their top 3, including captain Suryakumar Yadav, back in the dugout.
India lost their in-form opener Abhishek Sharma, also the tournament’s leading scorer, and the skipper inside the first 10 deliveries of their innings.
Varma and Sanju Samson (24) got to rebuilding the innings.
 
 

Even that recovery would not have been possible but for the reprieve Samson, then on 12, got when Hussain Talat dropped him in the deep.
Abrar Ahmed dismissed Samson to break the 57-run stand, but Shivam Dube (33) combined with Varma to take India closer to the target before falling in the penultimate over.
Needing 10 runs from the last over from Haris Rauf, Varma hit the second ball for a six to effectively seal India’s thrilling victory and triggering wild celebrations in the Indian camp.
“It’s a tough pill to swallow,” Pakistan captain Salman said at the presentation ceremony. “We could not finish well in the batting. Bowling, we gave everything. If we could have finished well, it would have been a different story.
“We could not rotate the strike properly, and we lost too many wickets. That was the reason we could not score what we wanted. We have to sort out our batting very soon. They bowled really well, outstandingly well. They needed 63 off six overs. I thought we had the game. The bowlers bowled really well; we have to give them credit, but the batting was a concern.
“We fought really well. We are proud as a team. So much to look forward to, we will improve and come back stronger.”</p><small>2025-09-28 22:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/282331083a76234.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945278/us-citizen-released-from-kabuls-custody-afghan-foreign-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>US citizen released from Kabul’s custody: Afghan foreign ministry</strong></a><br><p>Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on Sunday told a US delegation in Kabul that American citizen Amir Amiri had been released from prison, the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement.
United States President Donald Trump’s special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler, welcomed the decision to release the American citizen and called it a good moment for him, the statement read.
Muttaqi was quoted as saying, “The Afghan government does not view the issues of its citizens from a political angle and makes it clear that ways can be found to resolve the issues through diplomacy.”
He added that the step taken by his government to release the American citizen was a positive development and thanked the government of Qatar for its role in facilitating the release of the prisoner.
According to the statement, Boehler described the previous round of talks between Kabul and Washington as “constructive” and expressed hope that talks on the remaining issues would continue.
This was the second visit to Kabul by the American delegation.
The Afghan ministry said that during its last visit, the US delegation demanded the release of American prisoners; however, Taliban leaders had called for the release of Afghan national Mohammad Rahim, who is believed to be imprisoned in the Guantanamo Bay detention centre.
The US delegation had agreed in principle to free Rahim, who would be brought to Qatar and remain there. However, the Afghan Foreign Ministry statement did not mention whether Rahim would be released or not.
An elderly British couple detained in Afghanistan for almost eight months were released earlier this month, Taliban authorities said, after pressure built to free the pair due to fears over their health.
Taliban officials have refused to detail why Peter Reynolds, 80, and his wife Barbara, 76, were arrested in February as they were returning to their home.
“We’ve been treated very well. We’re looking forward to seeing our children,” said Barbara, in a red headscarf, standing next to her bearded husband, near a plane on the tarmac of Kabul airport.</p><small>2025-09-28 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/281916018341e81.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945212/child-bride-found-dead-under-suspicious-circumstances-shangla-police-investigating' target='_blank'><strong>Child bride found dead under ‘suspicious circumstances’; Shangla police investigating</strong></a><br><p>A 12-year-old girl, who had been married to her 10-year-old cousin for six months, was found dead under “suspicious circumstances” on Sunday in the Damorai area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district, according to a police official.
Ali Hussain, station house officer (SHO) at Olandar police station, said that the incident occurred within the limits of Olandar police station in Damorai. According to the SHO, the boy was the girl’s mother’s nephew.
“My team and I visited the girl’s home, where her mother was reluctant to hand over the body to police for an autopsy,” SHO Hussain said. “We took the body to the Alpuri district headquarters hospital and conducted an autopsy.
The SHO added that the cause of her death would be determined once the medical report is received.
“We have confirmed that both the deceased and her spouse were underage,” SHO Hussain said. “The deceased was 12 years old and her husband was only 10.
“The marriage was illegal and the girl’s death is also suspicious.”
Police launched an inquiry under Section 176 (inquiry by magistrate into cause of death) of the Criminal Code of Procedure to determine the cause of the girl’s death.
Replying to a question, SHO Hussain said that after consultation with the district public prosecutor, a first information report would be lodged against the Nikah registrar and all witnesses present at the Nikah of both children.
The SHO said that both children’s parents would also be arrested and “justice would be ensured”.
Sahil’s ‘Cruel Numbers’ report reveals that a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country last year.
In the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported. Forty-eight cases of pornography after sexual abuse were also recorded.</p><small>2025-09-28 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/282212390607cba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945260/anchorperson-imtiaz-mir-succumbs-to-injuries-suffered-during-last-weeks-karachi-gun-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Anchorperson Imtiaz Mir succumbs to injuries suffered during last week’s Karachi gun attack</strong></a><br><p>Anchorperson Imtiaz Mir, who was shot and wounded last week in Karachi’s Malir area, succumbed to his injuries on Sunday, according to his family and police.
Mir, an anchorperson for private TV channel Metro 1 News, was headed home in a car driven by his older brother, Mohammed Salih, when six suspects riding two motorcycles began firing on their vehicle in Malir.  Mir and his brother were both injured and admitted to Liaquat National Hospital.
His brother, Riaz Ali, who is the complainant in the case, told Dawn.com on Sunday night that his brother had succumbed during treatment.
Saudabad police Station House Officer (SHO) Ateequr Rehman also confirmed the death of the journalist, as the incident took place in his jurisdiction.
“Police have registered a case against a man and his sons over the attack on the journalist,” the SHO said. “The incident was motivated by a land dispute in the town of Thul in Jacobabad. A hitherto little-known group claimed responsibility for the attack, but it lacked credibility.”
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed his regret over Mir’s death and directed the Sindh inspector general of police to arrest the killers immediately.
“The killers of Imtiaz Mir will be brought to justice,” CM Shah vowed, according to the statement. “The services of the late journalist to the media will be remembered and the government will take this case to its logical conclusion.”
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon issued a statement expressing grief over Mir’s passing, hailing the late journalist as “a hardworking and fearless journalist, who always highlighted public issues”.
“The Sindh government will leave no stone unturned to bring those involved in the attack on Imtiaz Mir to justice,” Memon said. “The Sindh government is committed to protecting the lives and property of journalists.”</p><small>2025-09-28 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2818553915e31e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945208/pm-shehbaz-hopes-for-encouraging-results-of-trumps-moot-with-muslim-leaders-on-gaza-to-come-soon' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz hopes for ‘encouraging’ results of Trump’s moot with Muslim leaders on Gaza to come soon</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed on Sunday the hope for “encouraging” outcomes of US President Donald Trump’s meeting with Muslim leaders in Washington earlier this week where the American head of the state presented his plan to end Israel’s invasion of Gaza.
“We fully participated in the meeting on Gaza, and God willing, its encouraging results will come out soon,” he said, flanked by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar while addressing overseas Pakistanis at the High Commission in London.
According to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan, he also said that Pakistan was also part of Trump-led efforts to bring peace to Palestine and end oppression against the people of Gaza.
The premier also expressed distress over the situation in Gaza, which has been subjected to Israeli onslaught since October 2023, and prayed that the cruelty and barbarity being witnessed there ends soon.
Trump’s meeting with Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York had brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, and Indonesia.
Ahead of formal consultations, Trump told his guests: “We have to get the hostages back … This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world … so it’s an honour to be with you.”
Trump also emphasised the urgency of ending the conflict: “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started.”
 
 

According to reports from Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios, President Trump’s plan envisions an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages, both alive and deceased; phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza
Governance excluding Hamas but incorporating the Palestinian Authority; deployment of Arab and Muslim peacekeepers to secure Gaza and facilitate Israel’s withdrawal; and internationally supported reconstruction and transition programmes funded by regional contributors.
These details were reportedly shared with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though Israel did not draft the plan.
Dar, who also attended the meeting with Trump, also expressed the hope for positive outcomes of the meeting, saying that once these results materialised, “we will share them with the nation”.
He also said that follow-up communications after the meeting were going on until last night.
Earlier during the talk, PM Shehbaz also referred to his engagements in New York, where he led Pakistan’s delegation to the UNGA’s 80th session. He said his speech at the UNGA was a reflection of the sentiments of Pakistanis and that he fought the case of India-occupied Kashmir there.
The PM also touched upon his bilateral meeting with Trump in Washington during the recent US trip, saying that it was a “productive” and “constructive” engagement.
“It was held in a conducive environment,” he said, adding that he hoped it would help further strengthen Pakistan-US ties.</p><small>2025-09-28 14:39</small></div><hr>
