Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.
The van, carrying boys and girls from the private Islamia Public School in Chikar, was returning students to their homes when it met with the accident near a spot known as Tambrial Mor, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mirza Zahid Hussain told Dawn.com.
Chikar, a town and hill station in AJK’s Jhelum Valley district, is situated at an altitude of 5,272 feet above sea level and lies about 46 kilometres from Muzaffarabad, the state capital.
As a winter resort, Chikar’s educational institutions do not observe extended summer vacations, unlike other areas.
“It is assumed that after negotiating a bend, the vehicle went out of the driver’s control and fell down the road, causing injuries to almost everyone on board,” the SSP said.
According to the police official, 16 injured children were admitted to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Chikar, while the driver and 13 children were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital in Hattian Bala.
The van driver, identified as Sajjad Shah, and two of the children were said to be in serious condition. However, the remaining students were out of danger.
A video clip shared by the SSP showed the overturned van resting on a steep, forested slope, surrounded by local residents rushing to help.
“Had it not been for the tall trees that broke the fall, the van could have rolled further down the slope, resulting in heavier losses,” the SSP said.
Last week, six members of a family were killed in AJK’s Neelum valley when their car veered off the road and plummeted hundreds of feet, crashing onto the right bank of the river, officials had said.
In May, an assistant director, three inspectors and a constable of the AJK police lost their lives when their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine in the Poonch division.</p><small>2025-07-08 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/081323329908189.jpg?r=132402' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922803/heavy-rain-expected-countrywide-over-next-two-days-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy rain expected countrywide over next two days: PMD</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday issued an alert for heavy rainfall in several parts of the country, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northeast Punjab, Azad Kashmir and parts of Balochistan, for the next two days.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
At least 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, KP, and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to rain-related incidents in the past two days. An alert by the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) about a possible flood-like situation in various parts of the country has prompted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to order the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to be prepared to deal with potential emergencies.
In its latest weather update issued today, the Met Office said, “Monsoon rains continue to lash Pakistan, with further downpours expected in upper parts till July 10, 2025.
“Rain-wind/thundershower are expected today (July 8) in Punjab, KP, Azad Kashmir, GB, northeastern and southern Balochistan and Islamabad.”
The Met Office added that “heavy rainfall is also likely at isolated places in Kashmir, northeastern Punjab, Potohar region, and northeastern and southern Balochistan”.
 






“The public is urged to exercise caution and stay informed as rain continues in the coming days,” the weather agency advised.
The low-lying areas in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar are expected to be submerged due to heavy rainfall, it warned.
Islamabad and other areas will receive downpours with strong winds and thunderstorms, while Karachi and other areas of Sindh’s coastal belt could receive drizzling or light rainfall, it added.
The advisory warned against flooding in rainwater drains and local streams in Galliyat; Islamabad/Rawalpindi; Kashmir; KP’s Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi and Mardan districts; Punjab’s Dera Ghazi Khan and Murree; and Balochistan’s Barkhan, Kohlu, Musakhail, Dera Bugti, Nasirabad, Sibi, Loralai, Zhob, Kalat, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat districts.
It cautioned that heavy rainfall and downpours could cause landslides, leading to roadblocks and hurdles in traffic flow in the KP districts, Murree, Galliyat and Azad Kashmir.
In 24 hours since 8am yesterday, several cities recorded heavy to moderate rainfall across Pakistan.
In Punjab, Sheikhupura received 48mm of rainfall, Lahore 75mm, Islamabad 37mm (16mm in Saidpur, 12mm in Zero Point, 9mm in Golra), Gujranwala 6mm, Murree 5mm, Faisalabad 4mm, Sialkot 2mm, and 1mm each in Mandi Bahauddin and Hafizabad, along with traces of rainfall in Toba Tek Singh, Bahawalnagar and Kasur.
In KP, Balakot received the highest amount of rainfall (40mm), while Kakul ranked second with 31mm. Malam Jabba recorded 17mm; Bannu 8mm; Lower Dir 4mm; Cherat 2mm; Upper Dir, Bajaur and Ghalanai 1mm each; and traces of rain in Kalam and Peshawar.
In Sindh, Badin received 4mm of rainfall, Mithi 2mm, while Jacobabad, Larkana, Hyderabad and Karachi received traces. Balochistan’s Kalat recorded 17mm and Ziarat 12mm, with light rainfall in Lasbela.
In Azad Kashmir, Bandi Abbaspur received 7mm, Muzaffarabad 13mm (city area 7mm and airport 6mm), and Rawalakot and Kotli witnessed 1mm each.</p><small>2025-07-08 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08162106f042f17.jpg?r=165111' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922833/pm-appoints-qatari-princess-as-brand-ambassador-after-she-scales-nanga-parbat' target='_blank'><strong>PM appoints Qatari princess as brand ambassador after she scales Nanga Parbat</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday appointed Qatari mountaineer and royal family member Sheikha Asma Al Thani as the brand ambassador for Pakistan’s mountains and tourism after she recently successfully summited Nanga Parbat, the ninth-highest mountain on Earth located in Gilgit-Baltistan region.
Known as the “Killer Mountain,” the 8,126-metre-high peak is considered one of the world’s most dangerous climbs due to its severe weather conditions and rough terrain.
In a post on X, the premier felicitated Sheikha Asma on the achievement.
 






“I am pleased to appoint Her Highness Sheikha Asma Al Thani as the Brand Ambassador for Pakistan’s mountains and tourism.
“My heartfelt felicitations to Her Highness on her recent feat of scaling Nanga Parbat. It is truly inspiring,” he wrote.
“Her achievement sends a powerful message of courage and determination, and stands as a testament to the enduring friendship between Pakistan and Qatar,” he added.
In a post on Instagram, Sheikha Asma described the relentless challenges she faced on her route to the summit and the emotional toll of the ascent.

“My ninth 8000er and one of the toughest climbs I’ve faced. This mountain tested me in ways I didn’t expect, from black ice beneath my feet to rockfall every few seconds. A constant reminder of how fragile life truly is,” she wrote.
“But even in that danger, there was growth. There was surrender and there was strength I didn’t know I still had. I climb not just to reach summits but to return to what matters, to strip away the noise and reconnect with myself,” she added.
“This mountain will stay with me forever.”
Sheikha Asma hoisted Qatar’s national flag at the summit and becomes the first Qatari woman to do so. Her earlier summits include Mount Everest, K2 and Makalu.</p><small>2025-07-08 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/081144509b325e1.jpg?r=122350' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922796/woman-arrested-for-allegedly-killing-stepson-in-kps-haripur-police' target='_blank'><strong>Woman arrested for allegedly killing stepson in KP’s Haripur: police</strong></a><br><p>A woman was arrested in the Kata Kot area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur district on Monday for allegedly beating her stepson to death, police said.
In the first information report (FIR), seen by Dawn.com and registered at the Kot Najibullah Police Station, the seven-year-old victim’s father stated he was at work in Taxila when his wife called him after 3pm, informing him that his son “had been struck in the head by some people in the street.”
“When I reached home, I found my son in a bed with his body bearing marks of brutal torture, and he was dead,” the victim’s father stated in the FIR.
He added in the report that when he grilled his wife, she said the boy was making a noise inside the house, so she beat him with a stick.
The complainant further requested the police to take legal action against his wife as she had allegedly tortured his child to death, the FIR said.
 
 

According to Haripur District Police Officer Farhan Khan, the suspect was arrested within an hour of the FIR being registered. He added that an investigation was ongoing and pledged to ensure justice for the victim.
A civil society report published in May, based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country, reported up to 3,364 child abuse cases from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in the year 2024.
On Saturday, KP police arrested a suspect after a 13-year-old maid was allegedly raped and murdered in Abbottabad.
Last month, a teenage mother was allegedly killed by her husband and father in Gulshan-i-Maymar in the name of ‘honour’.</p><small>2025-07-08 11:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/081618516d9032f.jpg?r=161918' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922807/fact-check-viral-video-does-not-show-woman-punjab-assistant-commissioner-slapping-man-over-an-illegal-stall' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video does not show woman Punjab assistant commissioner slapping man over an illegal stall</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple users on social media platforms X and TikTok on July 4 shared a video allegedly showing a woman Punjab assistant commissioner slapping a local man for setting up an illegal roadside stall. However, the video actually shows a woman confronting a scammer and was shared as far back as October 2024.
On July 4, an X user, who appeared to be anti-government based on his past posts, posted a video showing a woman hitting a man while a small crowd of people could be seen gathered around her.
The post was captioned: “Government of Punjab, Pakistan, The assistant commissioner got angry over allegedly setting up a roadside stall illegally. Is an assistant commissioner authorised to slap a citizen like this? Does any law allow such humiliation of a citizen?”
The post was viewed by 674,000 people.
The video with the same claim was also shared here, here, here, here, here, here and here on X, and on TikTok here, here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the matter related to an alleged government official’s overreach of authority.
A keyword search for any news reports to corroborate the development did not yield any results.
A reverse image search yielded to a Facebook post by a page named “Viral Kashmir Bazar”, which featured a longer version of the same video.
The post, dated October 5, 2024, was captioned: “Money scam Zahid Mircha from Sopore has taken money from many innocent people. Please be aware of such individuals.”
Sopore is a city in the Baramulla district of India-occupied Kashmir.
In the video, a woman is seen hitting a man, accusing him of swindling 190,000 Indian rupees from her and her ailing brother. The person recording the video also claimed that the man had scammed several others.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows a woman Punjab assistant commissioner slapping a local for setting up an illegal roadside stall is false. The video was shared as far back as October 2024 and shows a woman hitting a scammer.

This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.</p><small>2025-07-08 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/081431418d33812.jpg?r=143150' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922814/injured-shadab-and-rauf-out-as-pakistan-announces-squad-for-bangladesh-t20is' target='_blank'><strong>Injured Shadab and Rauf out as Pakistan announces squad for Bangladesh T20Is</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday announced the 15-member squad for the three-match T20I series against Bangladesh set to be held later this month.

The move comes as Israel continues its onslaught on Gaza, which has so far killed 57,523 Palestinians. Last year, the UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said he, along with ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, “intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival”, including food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.
“He’s forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,” Netanyahu said at a dinner with Trump at the White House.

Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.
The Republican has complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his mediating role in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.
In 2024, he insisted that he was more deserving of a Nobel than ex-president Barack Obama, and complained how it was unfair that “anybody else” but him would have been honoured with one.
In June, Pakistan had also decided to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war after US mediation.
However, as the US joined Israel’s war with Iran and launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Pakistani lawmakers, activists, authors and ex-diplomats criticised the move. A resolution was also submitted in the Senate by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl to rescind the decision but led to no tangible outcome as Pakistan had not officially submitted the nomination.
A day earlier, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump has delivered “wins for the American people” and referenced
Pakistan’s nomination following the US-brokered ceasefire.
 






During a press briefing, she said, “Pakistan nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his decisive diplomatic intervention to prevent a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.”
 
 

Trump has also demanded credit for “keeping peace” between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.
He campaigned for office as a “peacemaker” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p><small>2025-07-08 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08155404a0b5719.jpg?r=160037' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922828/k-electric-reappoints-moonis-alvi-as-ceo' target='_blank'><strong>K-Electric reappoints Moonis Alvi as CEO</strong></a><br><p>The board of directors of K-Electric (KE) on Tuesday re-appointed Moonis Alvi as the chief executive officer (CEO), read a statement issued by the power company.
“The board of directors, in its meeting held on July 7, 2025, has re-appointed Syed Moonis Abdullah Alvi as Chief Executive Officer of K-Electric with effect from July 30, 2025,” read a press release by KE.
Alvi joined KE in 2008 and has held key roles in the organisation as the chief financial officer, company secretary and head of treasury prior to his appointment as CEO in 2018, KE said.
“He brings to the helm 30 years of diversified financial experience and has led the creation of a future-ready entity by emphasising digitisation, customer centricity and investments across the energy value chain,” the electricity distribution company said.
In 2020, Alvi and other senior officials of KE were booked after yet another unsuspecting citizen lost their life due to electrocution in Karachi.
The government also constituted a special committee to act as one-window operation for K-Electric and sought the removal of the top leadership of the power utility, including Alvi, over its alleged inability to ensure uninterrupted power supply and address disruptions within reasonable time after that year’s  monsoon rains.
Highly placed sources had said the government members on the K-Electric board of directors had pushed for the replacement of Alvi and the head of the distribution department with highly motivated professionals who could respond to difficult situations and ensure efficient service delivery. “The existing team did not take timely action,” an official said.
Last year in September, Alvi finally appeared before the Sindh Assembly’s Special Committee on loadshedding and excessive billing and categorically told the provincial government to get the company’s licence cancelled and supply electricity itself.
Informed sources had said that the KE CEO appeared to be an “opinionated person” and took an “aggressive stance” from the outset of the meeting, denying any prolonged loadshedding and excessive billing in Karachi.
In May, KE came under criticism for extended hours of power cuts in Karachi at a public hearing presided over by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) chairman Waseem Mukhtar.
Alvi had said that power cuts to areas with illegal connections and low recoveries did take place, but no more than three hours.</p><small>2025-07-08 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08152844e80fe36.jpg?r=154501' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922808/quetta-atc-sends-mahrang-other-byc-activists-on-10-day-physical-remand' target='_blank'><strong>Quetta ATC sends Mahrang, other BYC activists on 10-day physical remand</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Tuesday handed Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers of the group into police custody for 10 days, extending their three-month detention.
In March, Mahrang and other BYC members were arrested for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order.
Mahrang’s counsel, Advocate Israr Baloch, told Dawn.com that the BYC organiser and five other activists were presented before Judge Saadat Bazai, who approved the state prosecutor’s request for their 10-day physical remand.
The other activists were Gulzadi, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Ghaffar Baloch and Beberg Baloch. Advocate Shoaib Baloch also appeared in the court as their lawyer.
 
 

The BYC members were presented in the court in “four different” first information reports (FIRs) after the last extension in their MPO detention expired, Israr added.
Advocate Jibran Nasir, who has served as Mahrang’s counsel in a case last month, shared with Dawn.com the FIR numbers provided by Mahrang’s family of the four cases.
According to a BHC judgment from May provided by Nasir, the FIRs included those registered at the Civil Lines police station on March 19 for storming the Civil Hospital and at Brewery police station on March 2 for blocking the Western Bypass Road in Quetta.
Mahrang was taken into custody under MPO for a period of 30 days (first term) on March 22. Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody last month, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
Referring to that, Nasir said in a post on Instagram: “After the state ran out of ways to exploit colonial MPO laws the liberty of the BYC leaders is now being infringed by exploiting the ATC and penal laws.”
“Expect long remands, delayed hearing of bail applications, likely dismissal of bail from ATC and when bail would finally be granted, expect another arrest and transfer to another district jail in another,” the renowned rights lawyer wrote.

BYC member Sammi Deen Baloch, in a post on X, called it a “matter of concern” that activists were being taken to court without evidence.
“Such actions not only cause the state to lose its credibility but also render its own legal and judicial system ineffective and meaningless,” she added.
 






While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang is included on its list of proscribed persons.
Constitutional petitions seeking the release of Mahrang and two other activists were rejected by the Balochistan High Court (BHC) in May.
Subsequently, Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch appealed the Supreme Court in June against the BHC decision.
The petition alleged that her repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a “sympathiser of militants” was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons.
The same month, the Kech chapter of the BYC launched a three-day hunger strike in front of the Turbat Press Club in protest of the leadership’s arrests.</p><small>2025-07-08 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08143048eeff7d3.png?r=143056' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922818/imran-bushra-move-ihc-for-early-hearing-of-plea-seeking-suspension-of-sentence-in-ps190m-graft-case' target='_blank'><strong>Imran, Bushra move IHC for early hearing of plea seeking suspension of sentence in £190m graft case</strong></a><br><p>Former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi on Tuesday filed an application in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) for an early hearing of the plea for the suspension of their conviction in the £190m Al-Qadir Trust case, in which both of them face a 14-year and a seven-year prison term, respectively.
Imran and Bushra were convicted on January 17 in the case which alleges that the couple obtained billions of rupees and land worth hundreds of kanals from Bahria Town Ltd to legalise Rs50 billion identified and returned to the country by the United Kingdom during the previous PTI government.
On January 27, the couple moved IHC against the decision, asking the court to set aside their conviction, emphasising that the ruling lacked credible evidence and suffered from procedural lapses.
In an application filed on behalf of Imran, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, it was requested that an early hearing be fixed without any further delay, as it is a question of “liberty and freedom”.
It was stated that “an application for suspension of sentence was filed but has not been heard in accordance with the Judicial Policy and Court’s routine, depriving the applicant of his constitutional right to a speedy hearing”, referring to an earlier plea that was filed on behalf of Imran against the conviction in the case.
The appeal called the conviction of the jailed leader a result of “political victimisation”.
The appeal noted that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has “repeatedly sought adjournments in the hearings on the suspension “on the pretext of engaging special prosecutors in the instant matter.”
It stated that the petition filed earlier for the suspension of the conviction under Section 426 of the Pakistan Criminal Procedure Code — the hearings for which were held on May 15, May 27, June 5 and June 26 — gave assurances that an actual date for the suspension hearing will be decided but no specific date for adjudication has been given yet.
The plea further added that on the next hearing, the special prosecutor sought more time and assured the lead counsel of an early date, but no such decision has been made yet.
Stressing the urgency of matters, the statement said that there should be no “legal or procedural impediment in fixing the application for suspension” as it involves the fundamental right of liberty of a citizen under Article 9 of the constitution, which entails that no citizen can be tried without due legal process.
The counsel urged that the applicant is being denied his fundamental right under Article 4 of the Constitution — which ensures that every Pakistani citizen must be treated by the law — due to these delays.
It added that the applicant’s case has been deprioritised without any lawful justification, even though it is standard practice to hear bail matters and suspension applications on priority.
In a similar application, filed on behalf of Bushra Bibi,  who is serving a seven-year sentence in the same case, it was stated that the applicant, being a woman, has faced repeated prosecutions with “malicious intent”, citing her involvement in 13 different cases for which he has been acquitted.
They included the Iddat case — filed by her ex-husband, Khawar Fareed Maneka, who alleged that Imran and Bushra contracted marriage during the former first lady’s Iddat period.
 
 

The petition highlighted that the delays violate Article 4 of the Constitution, particularly in light of the applicant’s gender and the protective provisions of the law favouring women in bail matters.
Under Article 9 of the Constitution, the petition stated that, “as a woman, she is entitled to additional protections under Islamic jurisprudence and Pakistani law, which mandate leniency and priority in bail matters for female detainees.”
In December 2023, the National Accou­n­t­a­bility Bureau (NAB) had filed a corruption reference against Imran and seven others, including his wife, in connection with the Al-Qadir University Trust.
The reference filed by NAB alleged that Imran played a “pivotal role in the illicit transfer of funds meant for the state of Pakistan into an account designated for the payment of land by Bahria Town, Karachi”.
It also claimed that despite being given multiple opportunities to justify and provide information, the accused deliberately, with mala fide intention, refused to give information on one pretext or another.</p><small>2025-07-08 10:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/081139202f42649.png?r=120945' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922786/4-dead-two-injured-in-peshawar-house-fire-rescue-officials' target='_blank'><strong>4 dead, two injured in Peshawar house fire: rescue officials</strong></a><br><p>Four people were killed and two others were injured after a fire broke out in a house located in Peshawar’s Kochi Bazar on Tuesday morning, rescue officials said.
Spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Bilal Ahmed Faizi said in a statement, “Six people were rescued from the fire in critical condition and taken to the hospital.
“However, four of them succumbed to their injuries. They have been identified as Rafiq, Shehnaz, Riaz and his wife.”
Faizi added that the firefighters and ambulances reached the site of the incident soon after receiving information and started rescue operations.
“The firefighters initially rescued three people trapped in a house adjacent to a market and transported them to the hospital for medical assistance,” Faizi detailed in the statement.
During the rescue efforts, two firefighters fainted due to the blazing flames. They were taken to the Lady Reading Hospital for treatment, where their condition became stable, he said.
Six fire vehicles and 40 personnel participated in the firefighting efforts, the rescue official continued.
“Firefighters faced extreme difficulty as the house was located in a congested area with narrow alleyways. After hectic efforts, the rescue official confirmed that the flames had been brought under control and the cooling process was underway.”
Fire incidents usually occur due to a combination of human negligence, faulty infrastructure, poor safety standards, and environmental factors. Peshawar has faced frequent residential and commercial fires and periodic industrial infernos.
In October 2024, a fire at a tissue paper factory in the Hayatabad area was doused after more than 26 hours in an operation involving 130 fighters and 31 fire tenders.
The rescue team said the fire erupted as a huge quantity of polythene was stashed inside the factory, which melted due to the fire, and the blaze was difficult to douse.
 
 

In June 2024, a fire broke out in the Nauthia Phattak area of Peshawar, destroying at least 80 shops mostly selling used goods and injuring three people.
The officials said the fire erupted at one of the makeshift structures before engulfing the adjacent shops, which mostly dealt in secondhand clothes, shoes and curtains, and a power transformer.
Rescue 1122 workers and firefighters from Peshawar, Nowshera, Khyber and Charsadda districts controlled the fire in six hours with around 80,000 litres of water and foam.
Around 110 personnel took part in the operation. Rescue officials said the wooden cabins caught fire due to strong winds and fire engulfed three markets before being brought under control.</p><small>2025-07-08 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08130104f63e375.png?r=130120' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922793/pcb-approves-use-of-karachis-national-stadium-as-pakistan-set-to-host-veterans-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>PCB approves use of Karachi’s National Stadium as Pakistan set to host veteran’s T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) approved the use of Karachi’s National Stadium as Pakistan gears up to host the upcoming International Masters Cricket (IMC) Over 40s T20 Cricket World Cup, according to a press release.
The international tournament is scheduled from December 1 to 13, 2025 and is being organised by the Pakistan Veterans Cricket Association (PVCA).
The press release, issued by the PVCA on Monday, said 19 out of 56 matches will be played over 10 days at the National Stadium, which was recently renovated ahead of Pakistan hosting the ICC Champions Trophy in February.
The remaining matches will be held at the Moin Khan Academy, NBP Sports Complex, Karachi Gymkhana, and South End Club.
The approval for the stadium’s use was granted during a meeting on Monday in Karachi between PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and PVCA Chairman Fawad Ijaz Khan.
During the meeting, Khan stated that 14 teams from across the globe will participate in the mega event, including big cricketing nations like Pakistan, Australia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies and England.
Khan thanked the PCB chief and emphasised the significance of this tournament in enhancing Pakistan’s global image, particularly in promoting Karachi’s sporting identity.
He informed the PCB chairman that while the initial offer from PCB was to provide the National Stadium for only four days, PVCA strongly requested full use of the venue to conduct the entire event at the historic ground to ensure it is held securely and befittingly. Naqvi responded positively and approved the full use of the stadium for ten days.
Khan said that the tournament is expected to be exciting among cricket fans, with the anticipated participation of former stars Shahid Khan Afridi, Misbah-ul-Haq, Younis Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal, and Abdul Razzaq.
He stated that the event will celebrate veteran cricketers’ talent and strengthen Pakistan’s standing as a capable host of major international sports events.
With the stadium approval now in place, formal preparations for the tournament are underway.
Khan said the tournament reflects Pakistan’s commitment to promoting sports and uniting cricket enthusiasts. He also added that the collaborative efforts of PVCA and PCB will make the event a memorable and successful experience for players, officials, and spectators.</p><small>2025-07-08 08:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08124311a07c750.png?r=124337' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922789/not-possible-for-govt-to-provide-housing-for-all-residents-of-dilapidated-buildings-sharjeel-memon' target='_blank'><strong>Not possible for govt to provide housing for all residents of dilapidated buildings: Sharjeel Memon</strong></a><br><p>As people continue to be evacuated from nearby structures following a deadly building collapse in Karachi’s congested Lyari neighbourhood that left 27 people dead, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said on Wednesday it would not be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings.
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) saying it had issued multiple prior notices to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.
Speaking to GeoNews, Memon said that there were 740 dilapidated buildings across Sindh, out of which 51 were in “extremely dangerous” condition, out of which 11 buildings had been vacated.
“Orders have been issued to vacate the others in the next 48 hours for residents’ safety,” Memon said.
“However, it won’t be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings,” the minister said, adding that there was no such law obligating the government to do so.
“Nonetheless, the government in the past had provided temporary shelters to flood victims and Covid-19 patients for quarantine,” he added.
“Whatever space is available with the government, we will provide that for housing to the most deserving residents who have no other option available [for housing].”
Memon’s comments come a day after the Sindh government announced the suspension of SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro over the building collapse.
According to Local Government (LG) Minister Saeed Ghani, other SBCA officials who were suspended included the director, deputy director and building inspectors assigned to Lyari. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.
Major opposition parties — the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami — have condemned the PPP’s Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of “criminal negligence” that led to the disaster.
They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.
Previous deadly building collapses
In April, a 10-year-old girl died when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.
In October 2023, five people were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.
The city witnessed two such incidents within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.
Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when 22 people were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments collapsed.
A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed 27 people. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took 33 lives.</p><small>2025-07-08 07:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08122046935e61e.png?r=122148' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922785/pakistan-extends-condolences-to-turkiye-after-12-soldiers-die-of-methane-exposure-in-iraq' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan extends condolences to Turkiye after 12 soldiers die of methane exposure in Iraq</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Tuesday extended condolences to Turkiye after 12 Turkish soldiers died of methane exposure in Iraq during a search mission in the Claw-Lock Operation zone a day earlier, a statement from the Foreign Office said.
The deaths occurred when the Turkish troops were searching for the remains of a soldier who was shot dead by Kurdish fighters in the area in May 2022 and whose body was never recovered, the Turkish defence ministry said. The incident will be examined in detail with the administrative investigation initiated, it added.
“We wish Allah’s mercy upon the martyrs and express deepest condolences to the bereaved families,” the Foreign Office said in a post on X.
 






“Pakistan stands in firm solidarity with brotherly Turkiye in this moment of grief,” the post added.
Paki­stan and Turkiye share strong bilateral relations rooted in a foundation of shared cultural, religious, and historical connections, and mutual respect.
Last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the “heinous” terror attack that killed 13 soldiers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district.
“I pray to Allah for mercy on our Pakistani brothers and sisters who lost their lives in the attack, and wish a speedy recovery to the wounded,” the president had said.
“As always, Turkiye will continue to stand by our longstanding friend Pakistan in its fight against terrorism.”
In Feb 2023, as Turkiye witnessed two powerful earthquakes that killed more than 55,000 residents and wounded over 100,000, Pakistan dispatched relief goods along with rescue workers and doctors to the country.</p><small>2025-07-08 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08100107d93b7bf.png?r=105405' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922778/analysts-say-musks-party-may-be-threat-to-trump-even-without-wins' target='_blank'><strong>Analysts say Musk’s party may be threat to Trump even without wins</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump has shrugged off Elon Musk’s plans for a new political party as “ridiculous” — but the announcement underscored the threat the disaffected former ally poses to US Republicans defending paper-thin congressional majorities.
Musk’s weekend launch of the “America Party” came in the wake of Trump signing into law a sprawling domestic policy bill that the tech mogul has slammed overestimates that it will balloon the deficit.
Musk has been light on policy detail but is expected to target a handful of House and Senate seats in next year’s midterm elections, where the sitting Republican voted for Trump’s bill after preaching fiscal responsibility.
“Elon Musk’s America Party is a wild card that could upend the midterms in 2026, particularly for Republicans,” said political analyst Matt Shoemaker, a former Republican congressional candidate and an ex-intelligence officer.
“With bare majorities in Congress, the Republicans should be worried.”
Musk, the world’s richest person, had teased the idea of a new party for weeks, running an informal social media poll in June that showed 80 per cent support among 5.6 million respondents.
 






Unlike previous third parties, his would have almost limitless resources, and a talisman with a large constituency of young American men who see him as a maverick genius and a superstar.
“Musk’s brand appeals to disaffected independents and younger, tech-savvy voters who might otherwise break for Republicans in swing districts,” Shoemaker told AFP.
‘Balance of power’
With a personal wealth estimated at $405 billion, Musk has already demonstrated that he is willing to spend big on politics, lavishing $277m on Trump’s 2024 campaign.
Yet a more recent foray into Wisconsin politics — he spent $20m only to see his candidate for the state supreme court lose handily — has underlined the limits of wealth and celebrity in politics.
And then there is the political difficulty of building support in the American heartland, among voters who are not part of Musk’s Silicon Valley “tech bro” bubble.
Time magazine’s 2021 Person of the Year was once liked by a broad cross-section of Americans, but he saw his numbers plunge after joining the Trump administration as the president’s costcutter-in-chief.
Musk’s net favourability in the most recent rating published by Nate Silver, one of the most respected US pollsters, is underwater at -18.1, compared with a slightly less subaquatic -6.6 for Trump7.
“While you don’t want to paint with too broad a brush, the Republican base and MAGA movement are fairly inseparable in today’s political climate,” said Flavio Hickel, associate professor of political science at Washington College in Maryland.
“And their support for Trump has been unwavering despite recent controversies. It’s hard to imagine any political project associated with Musk syphoning off votes from individuals who approve of Donald Trump.”
‘Fizzled out’
While multiple Republicans and Democrats have switched to independent, wins for third parties have been rare in modern US history.
The Conservative Party of New York State in the 1970s and the Farmer-Labor Party in the 1930s are the only minor parties to win Senate seats in the last century.
Smaller parties saw more success in the House in the early 20th century but have only won one seat since the 1950s.
AFP spoke to multiple analysts who pointed to the many hurdles thrown in front of third-party candidates trying to get onto the ballot in a system designed to favour the status quo.
These include minimum signature requirements, filing fees and other onerous state-specific regulations on age, residency and citizenship.
“Remember in early 2024 the so-called ‘No Labels’ party that was going to chart a middle course for the 2024 elections?” said veteran political strategist Matt Klink.
“They fizzled out in epic fashion.”
Analysts agree that winning seats in Congress may be a stretch, but say Musk can inflict pain on Trump by syphoning votes from vulnerable sitting Republicans or throwing cash at primary opponents of the president’s preferred candidates.
“Elon’s party won’t win seats, but it could cost Republicans plenty,” said Evan Nierman, the founder and CEO of global crisis PR firm Red Banyan.
“In tight districts, even a few points syphoned off from the right could flip control.”</p><small>2025-07-08 05:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0810445518d27cf.jpg?r=104606' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922773/underage-driver-arrested-for-killing-one-injuring-two-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Underage driver arrested for killing one, injuring two in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Police arrested a 14-year-old boy on Sunday night after he recklessly drove a car, crashing into three motorcycles and killing a young man on the spot in Shahdara Town. Two others sustained injuries, one of them critically.
In a related development, the Lahore investigation SSP suspended an investigator for allegedly misbehaving with the victim’s family when they approached him for the timely postmortem examination of the body.
The accident came to the limelight when footage of the car went viral on social media.
According to police, the underage driver, identified as Hashir Ali — a Grade 7 student — was driving at over 120kph on a road leading to a village in Shahdara when he struck the motorcycles. The deceased was identified as Malik Amin, while his brother Malik Farid was among the injured.

Investigator suspended for ‘misbehaviour with victim’s family’

The injured were rushed to a local hospital where the condition of one of them was stated to be critical due to head injuries.
After receipt of information, SP Bilal Ahmad and other police officials rushed to the site, got the underage driver arrested and seized the car.
The police expanded the scope of investigation, examined the nearby cameras installed privately and those managed by the Safe City Authority besides reaching to the family of the arrested boy.
Sharing details of the initial findings, the SP said Hashir was living with his maternal grandmother after the separation of his parents following domestic issues.
He said Hashir’s mother had contracted a second marriage while his father, who runs a private business, left him to be looked after by his (boy’s) grandmother.
The grandmother of the boy was living in a rented house, Bilal said, adding that on Sunday night Hashir picked up the keys of the car.
The car belonged to the owner of the house Khurram Ijaz who was holding a key position at a pharmaceutical company.
The SP added Khurram Ijaz had gone to the house of his sister in Ravi Road area at the time when Hashir took his car to the road.
He said the teen first hit a cyclist after exiting the parking stand and then ran over three motorbikes.
The boy escaped unhurt in the accident which, however, led to the death of a young man on the spot and injuries to two others.
“We immediately seized the car, arrested the underage driver and lodged a case against him,” the SP said adding that the case was transferred to the investigation wing police for further action.
There were reports that the victim’s family and other local residents lodged a protest outside the Shahdara Town police station alleging that the investigation officer misbehaved with the complainant of the FIR when he demanded autopsy of the body.
Lahore Investigation SSP Mohammad Naveed confirmed to Dawn saying the investigator mishandled the matter when the complainant approached him.
Following the complaint, he said, he ordered immediate suspension of investigation the officer and reassigned the case to the investigation station in-charge for further proceedings.
 
 

UNDERAGE DRIVING: In the past, a fatal accident which claimed lives of six members of a family, including two infants and two women in Defence Phase 7 in Nov 2023, had sparked outrage when a speeding car driven by a teenage boy rammed into their vehicle.
The family was reportedly returning home in two cars after visiting relatives in Shadab Colony on Ferozpur Road. As they reached near a roundabout, the car driven by a teenage boy rammed into their vehicle. The collision was so intense that the vehicle overturned and was badly damaged.
This incident had led to a high-level meeting in the Lahore police where the senior police officers issued an order for action at a large-scale against the rash and reckless driving, particularly by the underage.

• In meeting with Sharjeel, minister praises Sindh govt for effective Muharram security
KARACHI: Acknowledging the growing number of visa rejections faced by Pakistani citizens, particularly the business community, by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has said that he will raise the issue with his UAE counterpart this week and is hopeful that the matter will be resolved.
He expressed these views while talking to representatives of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) here on Monday.
Upon his arrival at the KCCI, the minister was warmly welcomed by the office-bearers and leading members of the city’s business community, who briefed him on several issues, including law and order, street crime, water shortages, smuggling, narcotics and encroachments.
The minister assured them that the government was working hard to address all these issues on a priority basis.
About the visa problems, he said that he will be meeting with the interior minister of the UAE a day after tomorrow and he will enlighten him about the severity of the issue.
Mr Naqvi highlighted the government’s efforts to improve the global ranking of the Pakistani passport. “We are proud of our green passport, and in the future, it will be a source of even greater pride.”
He also praised the performance of the Sindh police, noting that the law and order situation in the city has significantly improved compared to the past, with a noticeable reduction in crime. “If Karachi is healthy, Pakistan will be healthy,” he remarked.
Regarding smuggling, Mr Naqvi said that the government has made considerable progress in curbing illegal trade. “A few years ago, even the dollar was being smuggled from here, but the situation has improved, and further measures are underway,” he said.
However, he clarified that while smuggling had not been completely eradicated, it has been significantly reduced.
He also stressed the importance of the Safe City Project in curbing crimes, calling it a key initiative endorsed by the prime minister.
He mentioned Faisalabad as a successful model where the project has led to a decline in overall crimes and expressed his hope that similar efforts would be intensified in Karachi.
On the issue of verifying potential employees’ criminal backgrounds, the minister said the government will work with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to streamline ID and SIM card verification, enabling businesses to make informed hiring decisions.
Addressing the problem of encroachments, the minister called for strict legislation, including penalties and fines, to effectively deal with the issue.
BMG chairman Zubair Motiwala, vice chairman Anjum Nisar, KCCI President Javed Bilwani and others were present on the occasion.
Earlier, Mr Motiwala termed land grabbing Karachi’s biggest challenge and criticised the revival of questionable police practices.
He appealed for surprise inspections of police stations and stressed police reforms, emphasising merit-based promotions and better salaries.
Commissioning ceremony of new boats
Also on Monday, the interior minister attended the commissioning ceremony of two new RHIB (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats) inducted into the Pakistan Coast Guards (PCG) fleet at Karachi Port.
Upon his arrival, he was warmly received by PCG Director General Major General Jawad Riaz.
The ceremony was attended by senior military and civil officials, members of the international community and notable personalities from various walks of life.
Speaking on the occasion, the interior minister lauded the professionalism and performance of the coast guards, stating that it is the only force in the country that operates simultaneously on both land and sea to prevent smuggling, illegal immigration, and anti-trawling fishing activities.
He noted that the induction of the two new boats will significantly enhance the operational capabilities of the force and contribute to curbing illicit activities.
Visits Sharjeel’s residence
Mr Naqvi visited the residence of Sindh’s Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.
The meeting between the two leaders included a detailed discussion on the country’s important political issues.
The meeting included a detailed discussion on the relations between the federation and the provinces, and joint efforts to ensure national peace and stability.
Both agreed that all political forces must work together to address the challenges facing the country, in the interest of national unity and public welfare.
The interior minister appreciated the security arrangements made by the provincial government and police during Muharram.

Among the dead were at least 27 girls and counsellors who were staying at a youth summer camp on a river when disaster struck over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
Forecasters have warned of more flooding as rain falls on saturated ground, complicating recovery efforts involving helicopters, boats, dogs and some 1,750 personnel.
“There is still a threat of heavy rain with the potential to cause flooding,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday, with the number of victims expected to rise still.
President Donald Trump confirmed he planned to visit Texas on Friday, as the White House slammed critics claiming his cuts to weather agencies had weakened warning systems.
“Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie, and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday.
She said the National Weather Service, which The New York Times reported had several key roles in Texas unfilled before the floods, issued “timely and precise forecasts and warnings.”
 
 

Trump has described the floods that struck in the early hours of Friday as a “100-year catastrophe” that “nobody expected.” The president, who previously said disaster relief should be handled at the state level, has signed a major disaster declaration, activating fresh federal funds and freeing up resources.
‘Tragedy’
At least 104 flood-related deaths were reported across central Texas.
Kerr County, through which the Guadalupe River runs, was the hardest hit, with at least 84 people killed including 28 children, according to the local sheriff’s office.
The toll includes 27 who had been staying at Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian camp that was housing about 750 people when the floodwaters struck.
Camps are a beloved tradition in the long US summer holidays, with children often staying in woods, parks and other rural areas.
Texas Senator Ted Cruz described them as a chance to make “lifetime friends — and then suddenly it turns to tragedy.”
But some residents were questioning the absence of more robust flood-warning systems in this region of south and central Texas — where such deluges are so frequent that it is known colloquially as “Flash Flood Alley.”
Experts stress the NWS sent out timely forecasts, and climate scientist Daniel Swain pinned the problem on a failure of “warning dissemination.” San Antonio mother Nicole Wilson—  who almost sent her daughters to Camp Mystic — launched a petition on Change.org urging Governor Greg Abbott to approve a modern warning network.
“Five minutes of that siren going off could have saved every single one of those children,” she told AFP.
At a candlelight vigil in San Antonio on Monday night, Texans gathered to pray for the victims of the floods and voice lingering fears.
“I was pretty shocked on the gravity of the situation and how big it was, and I wouldn’t necessarily expect that our rivers would rise so quickly,” said Rebeca Gutierrez, 29.
“Hopefully there’s preventative efforts happening in similar areas to make sure nothing to this degree happens.”
Two-story building
In a terrifying display of nature’s power, the rain-swollen waters of the Guadalupe River reached treetops and the roofs of cabins as girls at the camp slept.
Blankets, teddy bears and other belongings were caked in mud. Windows in the cabins were shattered, apparently by the force of the water.
Volunteers were helping search through debris from the river, with some motivated by personal connections to the victims.
“We’re helping the parents of two of the missing children,” Louis Deppe, 62, told AFP. “The last message they got was ‘We’re being washed away,’ and the phone went dead.”
Months’ worth of rain fell in a matter of hours on Thursday night into Friday, and rain has continued in bouts since then.
The Guadalupe surged around 26 feet (eight meters) — more than a two-story building – in just 45 minutes.
Flash floods occur when the ground is unable to absorb torrential rainfall.
Human-driven climate change has made extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and heat waves more frequent and more intense in recent years.</p><small>2025-07-08 04:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08085045e99a6c8.jpg?r=085055' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922697/balochistan-officials-removed-for-misusing-state-resources' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan officials removed for misusing state resources</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The Baloc­h­istan government on Monday dismissed several officials for misusing state resources, including government vehicles, according to Shahid Rind, the spokesman for the provincial government.
Mr Rind said the government took immediate action after an illegal use of a government vehicle was discovered.
Chief Secretary Shakeel Qadir removed the officials and ordered a “transparent investigation… to identify all those involved in this illegal practice and ensure they are held accountable under the law.”
Mr Rind emphasised that the misuse of public resources is unacceptable and that the government is pursuing a zero-tolerance policy on this matter.
“The law is equal for everyone, and any abuse of authority will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he said.
The government is implementing stricter measures to ensure the honest and efficient use of public assets and to keep state machinery dedicated to serving the public, Mr Rind said.
He affirmed that action will be taken against anyone found guilty, in line with the administration’s commitment to transparent governance and accountability.
Law challenged
Separately, former senator Nawabzada Haji Lashkari Khan Raisani on Monday challenged the recently passed Mines and Minerals Act 2025 in the Balochistan High Court, claiming it undermines local rights and was passed by an “illegitimate assembly”.
Mr Raisani filed the constitutional petition, which was submitted on his behalf by Supreme Court Advocate Muha­mmad Riaz Ahmed.
The JUI-F and Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party have already filed separate petitions and the Balochistan National Party-Mengal has announced its intent to do the same.
After filing the petition, Mr Raisani told the media he contested the legitimacy of the assembly that passed the law, calling it a “dummy house” formed through a “hybrid political plan”.
“This Act, morally, has no weight as it has no mandate of the real representatives of the public,” Mr Raisani said.
He claimed the act was being used to grant resource rights to outside interests, endangering the province’s future.
“It is legalised plunder, endangering the rights of future generations,” Mr Raisani said.
He alleged that 17 land allotments comprising millions of acres in areas including Qila Abdullah, Zhob, Chagai and Washuk had already been made to non-local people under the new law.
The senior politician framed the issue as one of existential importance for the region.

• Wants authorities to put an end to such practices
ISLAMABAD: Highlighting the legal and ethical ramifications of media coverage during criminal investigations, the Supreme Court on Monday urged media professionals to exercise responsibility in order to safeguard the rights of both the accused and victims while reporting on criminal proceedings.
“A disproportionate and excessive media spotlight and the manner it is presented is likely to create perceptions of guilt and influence the public as well as those who are associated with the criminal proceedings,” observed Justice Athar Minallah in a 25-page judgement.
Justice Minallah headed a three-judge bench that took up the appeal of accused Shahid Ali against the March 15, 2021, decision of the Sindh High Court which had upheld the death sentence earlier awarded by the trial court.
The case involved the gruesome murder of a seven-year-old boy, Wasim Akram, in Karachi. The boy’s body was discovered in a water tank on March 9, 2014. The appellant, Shahid Ali, was convicted under Section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and sentenced to death by the trial court. However, the Supreme Court acquitted him, extending the benefit of doubt, and directed that he be released forthwith.
The controversy arose when a journalist interviewed the appellant while he was on physical remand and in the custody of the investigating officer (IO). This interview was later aired on a private television channel on March 27, 2014, in its programme Jurm Bolta Hai.
Calling the case a classic example, the judgement pointed out that the accused was in custody under a court-ordered physical remand solely for investigation purposes. He was presumed to be innocent, but the in-charge of the police station and the IO granted a journalist access to interview him in custody.
The statement was recorded on camera and disseminated to the general public via the television broadcast. The judgement expressed concern for the victim’s family, who may also have been adversely affected by this act.
The court found that the police officials had adopted a process they were presumed to know was unlawful and one that could lead to grave violations of the rights of the accused. Their actions created a perception of guilt, despite the fact that the accused was in custody solely for investigation and had not yet been charged, nor had the investigation concluded.

Takes notice of broadcast of interview with accused in custody

The inadmissible purported confession was broadcast to the public, the judgement said, even though the accused had not been produced before a competent magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure
Code (CrPC).
The judgement also criticised the frequent practice of electronic media showing accused persons paraded before cameras or being questioned by reporters while in custody. Such practices gravely violate the rights of the accused and undermine the fairness of criminal trials, the court observed.
The court emphasised that both federal and provincial governments must take immediate and effective measures to ensure such practices come to an end.
The judgement also reminded the media — both print and electronic — of their responsibility to self-regulate their reporting and adopt standard operating procedures aligned with international best practices.
It called on regulatory authorities to propose such SOPs in consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of protecting the rights of the parties involved, particularly during investigations.
The court ordered its office to dispatch copies of the judgement to the interior and information secretaries, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra), and the chief secretaries of the provinces, directing them to take immediate steps to protect the rights of those involved in criminal proceedings and to safeguard the integrity and fairness of investigations and trials.

Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, told the General Assembly that these groups were operating from ungoverned spaces inside Afghanistan.
His warning came amid a surge in terrorist violence in Pakistan in recent weeks. On June 28, a suicide attacker rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a military convoy in North Waziristan, killing 16 soldiers and injuring several civilians. Days later, five senior officials — including an Assistant Commissioner — were killed in Bajaur when a roadside bomb hit their vehicle during a routine visit.
Ambassador Ahmad noted that many of these attacks are carried out with sophisticated weapons and equipment left behind by international forces following their 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.
“These weapons have been used by Afghan-based terrorists to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks against Pakistan, including in the last two weeks,” he said.
Pakistan’s envoy said that the TTP, with an estimated 6,000 fighters, was the largest UN-designated terrorist group operating from Afghan soil, and poses a threat, not just to Pakistan, but to regional and global stability as well. He also identified other groups active in Afghanistan, including IS-Khorasan, Al Qaeda, and various Baloch separatist factions.
“We must ensure that Afghanistan does not become a breeding ground for terrorists that threaten its neighbours and the broader international community,” he said, urging the United Nations and regional powers to act against “spoilers” who could reignite conflict in the region.
 






Secretary-level talks
Meanwhile, Kabul and Islamabad held their first-ever additional secretary-level talks on Monday, in line with the agreement reached during Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Afghanistan in April.
Additional Secretary (Afghanistan & West Asia) Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani represented the Pakistani side while the Afghan side was led by First Political Division DG at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mufti Noor Ahmad Noor. The two sides discussed trade and transit cooperation, security, and connectivity, the FO statement said.
Both sides also termed terrorism a serious threat to regional peace and agreed the region can’t develop without addressing security issues. Emphasising the need for “concrete actions against terrorist groups operating on Afghan soil”, the Pakistani delegation noted that such groups undermine the security and hinder regional development.
The meeting also reviewed measures to boost trade, including the facilitation of Afghan transit trade, the removal of 10 per cent processing fee, provision of an insurance guarantee, reduction in scanning and examination, and operationalisation of the track and trace system.

In a notification, the finance ministry said that an earlier order dated July 10, 2014 which capped earnings through board meetings of corporate entities at Rs1 million per annum, stood “withdrawn ab-initio” — meaning it was never issued.
The order, issued on June 12, 2024 with the approval of the then-federal cabinet, said that “government servants appointed to the board of companies/organisations and who become entitled to [a] fee, shall only be allowed to retain remuneration to a maximum of Rs1m in a financial year”.
Any amount in excess of Rs1m so received was required to be deposited by the officer in the government treasury.
The decision on capping meeting fees was originally announced by then finance minister Ishaq Dar almost a decade ago.
That order remained in the field for a couple of years and then ignored. It was categorically reiterated last year, but has now been ‘withdrawn ab-initio’, meaning that the amounts earned throughout FY2024-25 would become legalised as the earnings of those officers.
The finance ministry issued another notification for continuation of austerity measures, which have now also been extended to federal government’s attached departments, SOEs and statutory bodies including regulatory authorities.
In case of SOEs, “these austerity measures shall be considered a direction of the federal government under Section 35 of the SOEs (Governance & Operations) Act 2023 and under the relevant sections of their respective organic laws in the case of statutory bodies”, the notification said.
The restrictions include a complete ban on purchase of all types of vehicles. The ban also includes creation of new posts, treatment abroad and non-obligatory foreign visits at government expense.
Separately, the ministry also notified an increase of 7pc in net pension of all civil pensioners, including civilians paid from defense estimates, as well as retired armed forces personnel and civil armed forces personnel.

• KP records six deaths in Malakand, Karak, Buner and Manshera
• PM orders authorities to remain on their toes as NEOC forecasts ‘moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall’ till 10th
ISLAMABAD: Amid heavy monsoon rains, the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) on Monday issued an alert for heavy rainfall and a flood-like situation in various parts of the country over the next two days, while 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to extreme weather.
Moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall is expected till July 10, particularly in the catchment areas of all major rivers, which will likely cause flash flooding in various regions of Pakistan, according to the NEOC. The alert also prompted the prime minister to order the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and other authorities to remain on high alert to deal with potential emergency situations, particularly floods.
In Balochistan, at least seven people were killed and many others were injured as a result of the fresh monsoon spell over the past 48 hours, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said. Almost 22 districts of Balochistan have been affected by the rain, and PDMA has already issued an alert of heavy rains and flash floods. The PDMA confirmed seven deaths. It said that 22 houses were damaged while five houses were destroyed.
The areas which were badly affected by the monsoon spell included Awaran, Jhal Magsi, Khuzdar, Musakhail, Qila Saif­ullah, Barkhan, Kohlu, Loralai, and parts of Zhob and Sherani districts. “At least 22 districts of northern, southern and central Balochistan were affected while the monsoon spell is continuing in these districts,” said the PDMA officials.
“Washuk district bordering Iran was badly affected, where standing crops were washed away and many houses were damaged, which rendered a large number of people homeless,” officials confirmed and added that the rain also damaged solar panels in Loralai and Surab.
At least six people including three children drowned in rain-related incidents in different parts of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, police and emergency services reported.
 
 

In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, six persons lost their lives in Malakand, Buner, Manshera and Karak districts.
PM Shehbaz directed the National Disaster Management Authority, rescue agencies, and adm­inistrative authorities to remain on high alert to cope with any potential emergency.
He also expressed concern that the operation of the Tarbela Dam spillways may increase flooding in the lower districts along the Indus River.
Potential riverine flooding
According to NEOC’s forecast, increased water flows are expected in all major rivers, including Kabul, Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab. Currently, low flood levels are being observed at Tarbela, Kalabagh, and Chashma on the Indus River, while Taunsa is also expected to reach the low flood mark. River Chenab is likely to experience low flood levels at Marala and Khanki stations. River Kabul at Nowshera is expected to rise to low flood levels, while Swat and Panjkora Rivers, along with their associated streams and nullahs, may swell due to rainfall in their catchment areas. River Jhelum, along with its tributaries, is expected to experience elevated inflows, resulting in localised flash floods. Inflows at Mangla Dam on River Jhelum are projected to reach the low flood limit.
Hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur districts may once again become active, generating medium to high flows.
In Balochistan, nullahs and seasonal streams in the northeastern districts, including Jhal Magsi, Kachi, Sibi, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, and Musakhail are also likely to experience high flows.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, the Hunza and Shigar rivers may see increased water discharge.
