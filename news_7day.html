<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/6826972743425.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911278/rehabilitating-the-treaty' target='_blank'><strong>Rehabilitating the treaty</strong></a><br><p>INDIA has neither suspended nor abrogated the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). It has held it ‘in abeyance’ which is neither a technical nor a legal term in the treaty. The announcement represents a belligerent political action rather than a legal decision. Pakistan’s response therefore has to be primarily crafted in the political realm. The present status has left the door open for the treaty’s rehabilitation. Can Pakistan provide the Modi government a diplomatic opening, or a fig leaf, to engage in a meaningful process to preserve the treaty?
In the immediate term, India will not get extra water, nor will freshwater flows to Pakistan diminish. The engagement process therefore needs a long view. Since maintaining the treaty offers greater advantages to both nations, how can they look back and draw some lessons for future water relations within and outside the treaty?
India’s April 24 letter to Pakistan argued that fundamental changes in circumstances necessitated reassessment of treaty obligations. These changes include altered population demographics, clean energy development imperatives, and cross-border terrorism allegedly impeding India’s full utilisation of treaty rights. For precisely these reasons, the two countries need the treaty more than ever before. None of the listed issues can be addressed unilaterally by either side.
Regrettably, these issues were never formally raised by India in the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC) meetings. The negotiators from India and Pakistan, predominantly civil engineers, failed to recognise that climate change was altering the Indus basin hydrology, creating challenges beyond the treaty’s original scope. They failed to utilise Article 7 as a framework through which both nations could have collaboratively addressed the issues without treaty renegotiation.
The Indus basin has experienced unprecedented climate impacts including shifting monsoon patterns, extreme precipitation events and accelerated glacial melt. Water availability has begun to decrease, with projections indicating continuing decline. The IWT employed fixed allocation mechanisms not always suited to hydrological variability while PIC meetings remained infrequent and adversarial rather than collaborative.

Negotiators displayed no desire to study and adopt global best practices in transboundary water management.

Article 7 provided the legal foundation for future cooperation and “optimum development” of the rivers, yet it remained largely unutilised. India never requested the creation of specialised working groups under the PIC focused on climate adaptation and extreme weather response, the energy needs of the two sides or changing demographic trends. A joint climate research agenda examining glacial melt, changing precipitation patterns, and climate impact on water flows would have built mutual understanding of shared challenges.
 
 

Likewise, Pakistan never raised the subject of transboundary water terrorism. Not surprisingly, both nations failed to establish real-time coordination mechanisms for flood warnings, drought management and other extreme events. More agile dispute-resolution mechanisms would have prevented the escalation of tensions. The commission never increased the meetings’ frequency beyond the minimum twice yearly for more responsive governance.
The negotiators also did not show any appetite to study and adopt global best practices in transboundary water management. Approximately, 40 per cent of the global population relies on shared water sources, with 70pc of transboundary basin areas governed by treaties. The Ganges Water Treaty between Bangladesh and India, despite its imperfections, offered a regional model with provisions for water-sharing during droughts and a Joint Water Commission mandated to conduct studies on water-sharing, irrigation, and flood control.
The Permanent Joint Technical Commission on the Nile Basin represented another valuable model despite controversies surrounding Ethiopia’s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. This framework enabled upstream and downstream countries to make recommendations for cooperation in energy generation, dam filling, or water allocations during extraordinary droughts.
Water management experts had identified four key mechanisms that transboundary agreements should incorporate: flexible allocation strategies, specific drought and extreme weather provisions, regular review processes and strong institutional frameworks.
Despite past failures, the door remains open for both countries to rehabilitate the treaty. The World Bank, as the third signatory to the IWT, retains significant potential to facilitate this process. Article IX explicitly designates the World Bank as a potential mediator when differences arise, and this mechanism remains available despite the current tensions. Neither party appears to have informed the World Bank of recent developments. Pakistan need not hold back.
The World Bank’s unique position enables it to facilitate technical dialogues separated from political rhetoric. There is a case for the bank to expand beyond its role of appointing neutral experts or arbitrators, and bring together international experts with experience in successful transboundary water cooperation models like the Danube river basin, which transformed from a contested resource into “an emblem of peace and cooperation in Europe”.
Using the trust fund created when the treaty was signed in 1960, the World Bank can help India and Pakistan undertake studies on implementation experiences from agreements like the Mekong River Commission, which has developed sophisticated joint monitoring protocols for changing flow conditions.
 
 

Rather than allowing the treaty to stagnate, India and Pakistan can rehabilitate it through incremental technical cooperation. The World Bank could be requested to facilitate initial technical dialogues on non-controversial aspects of climate impacts, growing regional hydro energy needs, and gradually building momentum for more complex discussions. Article 7 remains the most viable pathway for tackling the issues raised by India without reopening the entire treaty.
There is still an opportunity to establish specialised technical working groups. Protocols for coordinated responses to extreme weather events, following models from other basins, could be developed without altering the treaty’s core structure.
The IWT remains a viable framework for transboundary water cooperation, but its implementation must evolve. By transforming climate challenges into opportunities for technical cooperation, India and Pakistan can ensure water security while potentially rebuilding a foundation for regional stability. The World Bank’s involvement as an honest broker could provide a neutral platform for this technical renaissance, allowing professionals to work beyond political constraints while giving the leadership in both countries space for a face-saving return to cooperative water governance. After all, it is in everyone’s interest to deweaponise regional waters rather than have a dysfunctional treaty parked in indefinite abeyance.

That was not unexpected. With the country living off repeated bailouts from the lender, it is but natural that its economic policies are tightly tied to the programme goal aimed at ensuring debt reduction and sustainability — in times of war and peace both.
Starting Wednesday, the virtual technical-level discussions, which precede formal policy-level talks on the budget from May 19, have revealed tentative fiscal, inflation, growth and other targets that our policymakers will be required to meet next year to stay in the programme.
Media reports say that the Fund expects Pakistan’s moribund economy to expand by 3.6pc next year, with headline consumer inflation averaging at 7.7pc, and total federal and provincial tax and non-tax revenues growing to nearly Rs20tr or 15.2pc of the economy’s size.
The IMF proposals also emphasise austerity by tightening controls on current and development expenditure to reduce the budget deficit from 5.6pc of the economy’s size estimated for the present fiscal year to 5.1pc next year.
 
 

Related to this is the hefty increase suggested in primary surplus from 1pc to 1.6pc of GDP in order to ensure sustainable debt servicing and bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio from 77.6pc to 75.6pc in FY26. The next budget will also map climate relevance in adaptation, mitigation and transition to receive the IMF’s climate-related funding of $1.4bn in the next 28 months.
Data for the current fiscal year shows that Pakistan is on track to meeting budget targets and other time-bound structural benchmarks agreed with the Fund. Cooperation from the provinces has proved critical in pulling off many of these goals. However, a significant increase in the revenue target proposed for next year amid a shortfall in tax revenues this year underlines the need for broadening the tax base by effectively bringing retail, real estate, agriculture and other undertaxed or untaxed areas of the economy into the net. This demands political commitment and substantial efforts by both the federal and provincial governments.
The decision to pull the government out of the wheat market this year despite opposition from the rural elite, and to cut energy subsidies for powerful textile and other manufacturers, shows that the state has what it takes to make tough decisions. The past policy of squeezing the salaried classes and fully documented corporations to collect taxes will not work any longer. Failure to reform the corrupt and inefficient tax system has already taken a huge toll on ordinary people and led to large cuts in spending on the development of infrastructure crucial for future economic growth and stability.

• Reforms expected to boost exports by $5bn in five years
• Simple average tariff to fall from 19pc to 9.5pc
ISLAMABAD: In a major policy shift, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has approved a comprehensive five-year tariff reform plan to be announced in the federal budget 2025-26, aiming to drastically reduce customs duties, additional customs duties, regulatory duties on raw materials and semi-finished goods, and a phased reduction in overall tariff protections for select industries.
The first phase of the reform, set to be launched with the next budget, introduces a simplified customs duty structure with slabs of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 per cent. The existing 16pc slab will be reduced to 15pc, while the 11pc rate will drop to 10pc. The 3pc slab will be abolished, with products either moved to a zero-duty category or the new 5pc slab.
The proposed tariff overhaul, seen by Dawn, is set to eliminate the additional customs duty of 2pc on 4,294 tariff lines in the upcoming budget. The plan also includes a reduction of additional customs duty from 4pc to 2pc on 545 tariff lines, from 6pc to 4pc on 2,227 tariff lines, and from 7pc to 6pc for all products currently subject to a customs duty above 20pc.
The government is set to slash regulatory duties, which currently reach as high as 90pc on various products, bringing them down to a maximum of 30pc. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has also supported the major overhaul of the tariffs to boost industrial production in the country.
A further substantial cut is scheduled for next year’s budget, while the final three years of the plan will see a gradual, nominal reduction in tariffs.
According to estimates, this tariff rationalisation is projected to boost exports by approximately $5 billion by the end of the plan’s implementation, reinforcing Pakistan’s drive towards a more competitive global trade position.
Five-year roadmap
Industries such as auto, iron and steel, textiles, chemicals and plastics — currently shielded by effective tariff rates ranging between 100pc and 150pc — will see those rates reduced to around 50pc to 60pc. The premier said his government’s priority is to shift away from import substitution to an export-led growth strategy.
Under its ambitious reform agenda, the government has set a target to slash the simple average tariff from the current 19pc to 9.5pc within five years. A key adjustment in the plan includes restructuring duty slabs, replacing the existing slabs of 0pc, 3pc, 11pc, 16pc and 20pc with a streamlined system of 0pc, 5pc, 10pc and 15pc. This will not only simplify the tariff structure but also bring certainty, transparency, and uniform cascading margins that are easy to administer and comply with.
By the end of the five-year implementation period, the tar­iff overhaul will establish a uniform maximum duty slab of 15pc, eliminating sector-specific peaks that previo­usly exceeded 20pc — primarily affecting the auto industry.
The additional customs duties currently set at 2pc, 4pc, 6pc and 7pc across various slabs will be gradually phased out to zero within the next three to four years.
Regulatory duties, which presently range from 5pc to 90pc on various products, will also be fully eliminated over five years, easing import costs and improving market accessibility.
Moreover, the 5th Schedule of Customs, which provides industry-specific tariff concessions, will be dissolved, with all products covered under it transitioning to the 1st Schedule in a phased manner.
According to the tariff reform plan, these concessions will either be discontinued or extended universally, ensuring a more equitable trade policy across industries.
Exports-led growth strategy
The government has decided to embark on an outward-looking, export-led growth tariff policy. This major shift in the trade and tariff policy is based on thorough research, evidence from successful economies and Pakistan’s own experience.
The drastic cuts in duties will provide full support to the vulnerable sectors and industries. The cascading principle will be maintained and industries will still enjoy substantially high effective rates of protection.
The current high, complex, and discriminatory tariff structure has favoured only a few big businesses, which over time have become less efficient and unproductive.
The vested interests taking advantage of the myths and disconnects around tariff reforms are raising their voice against the reforms, a senior Customs officer said. “There is no truth to the assertions that tariff rationalisation would affect external balance or revenue generation negatively,” the officer claimed.
Scientific models used in policy analysis suggest that while imports may rise slightly, exports are expected to grow at a faster pace, improving the trade balance. More than 45pc of imports are inelastic — comprising food and energy — and historically, spikes in the import bill have stemmed from global price hikes rather than imports of industrial inputs.
It is expected that this shift from import substitution to an export-led policy will give a much-needed boost to the economy. Lower tariffs will reduce anti-export bias and help businesses, especially small businesses in textile, agriculture and light engineering sectors, to integrate into global value chains, the policy said.

• PTI facing blackout in coverage by official media
ISLAMABAD: The government faced an embarrassing situation in the National Assembly on Thursday when the opposition cleverly blocked the passage of an important money bill in the middle of the process.
It was after facing a 67-32 vote defeat on the motion tabled by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to present the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024 for its passage that opposition members belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) realised that their absence could prevent the government from maintaining quorum for which the presence of 84 members is required in the 336-member house.
As soon as Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah declared the result of the headcount on the motion, the PTI members strategically walked out, leaving behind their colleague Aamir Dogar to point out lack of quorum at a time when the chair had already got approval of two clauses of the three-clause bill through a voice vote.
 
 

The deputy speaker desperately ordered a headcount and then suspended the proceedings till completion of the quorum. The government, however, not only failed to complete the quorum — for which it required the presence of 17 more members — but also could not hold the members already present in the house and thus the number dropped to even less than 67.
When the proceedings resumed after half an hour, the chair found no other option but to announce the adjournment of the sitting till Friday morning (today) without completing the agenda, which included the passage of five bills.
The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024 is already in the field as the government had introduced it last year in the form of an ordinance.
However, since the ordinance is about to lapse after completing its constitutional period, it has now become mandatory for the government to get it passed from the assembly for continuation of its enforcement. The bill, according to the Statement of Objects and Reasons, is aimed at removing some difficulties faced by taxpayers in the implementation of higher tax rates on income from federal government securities as well as rationalising standard tax rate on whole of the business income of banking companies.
Media blackout
The state-run media, as well as the official social media platforms of the National Assembly, continued the policy of censoring the proceedings of the house with opposition members facing a complete blackout.
Earlier, the National Assembly’s proceedings were not broadcast live on its official social media platforms when the house held a discussion on the Pakistan-India conflict, following the Pahalgam attack.
On May 6, when Leader of Opposition Omar Ayub Khan raised the issue of his speech being censored, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq asserted his authority, saying he had the right to expunge anything deemed “against national interest”.
The proceedings were not live-streamed on the NA’s official YouTube and Facebook channels, while PTV aired speeches from the treasury benches only.
At that time, a senior National Assembly Secretariat official had stated that the live-streaming of parliamentary proceedings had been stopped on social media in view of the sensitivity of the situation between Pakistan and India, adding that the live-stream would resume soon.
Though censorship of “objectionable parts” of opposition lawmakers’ speeches has become something of a norm, a complete blackout of proceedings during debate on an important issue was quite unprecedented.
After completion of the debate on India-Pakistan conflict, the live-streaming of the NA proceedings began on its official YouTube and Facebook channels, but now with complete blackout of the opposition members even during the question hour.
There was no word from the government on the issue. However, a senior official of the NA Secretariat told Dawn that the blackout of opposition members was being done on the directives of Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.

The government incre­ased the Inland Freight Equalisation Margin (IFEM) on both petrol and diesel to clear about Rs34 billion loss to the oil industry owing to a tax loophole in the Finance Bill 2024-25.
In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Fina­nce said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had reviewed and adjusted prices for petroleum products in view of the fluctuations in the international market.
The ex-depot price of high-speed diesel was reduced by Rs2 per litre to Rs254.64 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs256.64.
Most of the transport sector runs on high-speed diesel. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
The ex-depot price of petrol was kept unchanged at Rs252.63 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct effect on middle- and lower-income households.
At present, the government charges about Rs96 per litre tax on both petrol and high-speed diesel.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government charges Rs78 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on petrol, diesel and high-octane products that normally impact the masses.
The government also charges about Rs17 per litre customs duty on petrol and high-speed diesel, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Over the last two months, the government has disallowed about Rs18 per litre of potential reduction in petroleum prices to discourage a rise in petroleum consumption. This was done through an increase in the petroleum levy through a special presidential ordinance, to divert funds for higher subsidies on electricity rates and the construction of highways and motorways in Balochistan and Sindh.
At the request of the Petroleum Division, IFEM has now been increased by Rs1.87 per litre to address losses faced by refineries and oil marketing companies (OMCs). The financial impact, estimated at Rs34bn for FY25, stems from the reclassification of petroleum products as “exempt” under the new Finance Act, rendering input sales tax non-refundable for refineries and OMCs.
The Petroleum Division proposed that the Rs34bn shortfall be recovered through IFEM over a 12-month period, with the adjustment automatically ending in the 13th month.
Petrol and HSD remain the government’s top revenue generators, accounting for monthly sales of 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.

• Hamas says Gaza ‘not for sale’
GAZA: Palestinian rescuers reported more than 100 people killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes on blockaded Gaza, where a US-backed organisation said it intends to begin distributing aid by the end of the month.
Aid to Gaza has been cut off since March 2, a tactic Israel has said is intended to force concessions from Hamas, but the group insisted on Thursday that the restoration of humanitarian assistance to the war-ravaged territory was “the minimum requirement” for talks.
It also warned that Gaza was not “for sale” hours after US President Donald Trump, on a visit to the region, again floated taking over the territory and turning it into “a freedom zone”.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said the death toll from Israeli bombardment since dawn on Thursday had risen to 103.
Israel’s aid blockade preceded a resumption of military operations on March 18, ending a ceasefire that had largely halted hostilities since mid-January.
For weeks, UN agencies have warned that supplies of everything from food and clean water to fuel and medicines are reaching new lows.
“Israel’s blockade has transcended military tactics to become a tool of extermination,” Human Rights Watch interim executive director Federico Borello said.
AFPTV footage from the aftermath of a strike on Deir al-Balah in the centre of the territory showed flattened buildings and piles of concrete rubble.
“We pray for this war to end, and we appeal to all international institutions to end the war because enough is enough,” said Gaza resident Maher Ghanem, his arm in a sling.
Gaza not ‘for sale’
Israel says the aid stoppage and military pressure are meant to force Hamas to free the remaining prisoners.
But senior Hamas official Basem Naim said the entry of aid into Gaza was “the minimum requirement for a conducive and constructive negotiation environment”.
“Access to food, water, and medicine is a fundamental human right — not a subject for negotiation,” he added.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US-supported NGO, said it would begin distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza this month after talks with Israeli officials.
But the United Nations on Thursday ruled out involvement with the initiative.
“As we’ve stated repeatedly, this particular distribution plan does not accord with our basic principles, including those of impartiality, neutrality, independence, and we will not be participating in this,” said UN spokesman Farhan Haq.
Trump said he wanted the United States to “get involved” in Gaza.
“I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good… let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” he said on the Qatar leg of a Gulf tour, adding he would be “proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone”.
The comments echoed an idea he floated in February for the United States to “take over” the devastated territory and redevelop it into “the Riviera of the Middle East”.
Hamas official Naim said “Gaza is an integral part of Palestinian land — it is not real estate for sale on the open market”.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas — in remarks addressing a UN commemoration of the “Nakba”, the flight or expulsion of an estimated 700,000 Palestinians during the creation of Israel in 1948 — warned against repeating the displacement of his people in Gaza.
The United Nations estimates that 70 per cent of Gaza is now either an Israeli-declared no-go zone or under evacuation order.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said 2,876 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes on March 18, taking the war’s overall toll to 53,010.
West Bank raids
In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, raids were ongoing and roads blocked after Israel’s military chief vowed to find the perpetrators of an attack that killed a pregnant Israeli woman.
WhatsApp groups for Israeli settlers in the territory were rife with calls for vengeance in retaliation for the attack.
“To make sure this never happens again… we need real revenge!” one user said.
In the northern village of Tammun, Israeli troops killed five Palestinians in a raid the military described as targeting buildings suspected of being used to plan attacks.
The West Bank has seen an upsurge in violence since the beginning of the Gaza war.

• India says water treaty to remain suspended until end to ‘cross-border terrorism’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday urged the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to investigate the ‘nuclear black market’ in India and repeated incidents of theft and illicit trafficking of radioactive material, as it rejected a call by India’s defence minister for the nuclear watchdog to monitor Islamabad’s nuclear programme.
Pointing to multiple incidents of radioactive material theft in India and other security lapses, the Foreign Office said, “Pakistan urges a thorough investigation of these incidents and calls upon India to ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities and arsenal.”
“If anything, the IAEA and the international community should be worried about the repeated theft and illicit trafficking incidents involving nuclear and radioactive material in India,” the statement added.
The Foreign Office was responding to comments made by Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during a speech to Indian soldiers in Srinagar, in which he said, “I believe that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons should be taken under the supervision of the IAEA.”
Mr Singh’s remarks came days after the two nuclear-armed neighbours paused their worst military confrontation in nearly three decades following the Pahalgam attack, a militant assault that New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based groups. Tensions spiked as cross-border exchanges escalated, prompting global concern over a potential nuclear flashpoint.
In a separate statement days after the ceasefire, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.”
In its response, the Foreign Office said Mr Singh’s comments “reveal his profound insecurity and frustration regarding Pakistan’s effective defence and deterrence against Indian aggression through conventional means,” adding that “Pakistan’s conventional capabilities are adequate to deter India, without the self-imposed ‘nuclear blackmail’ that New Delhi suffers.”
The Foreign Office also criticised Mr Singh’s remarks as “ignorant of the mandate and responsibilities” of the IAEA, a Vienna-based UN agency tasked with verifying that nuclear programmes remain peaceful. India’s civilian nuclear facilities are subject to IAEA safeguards under a 2008 agreement, but its strategic programme is not.
Citing recent incidents, the Foreign Office recalled that five individuals were reportedly caught in the Indian city of Dehradun last year with a radioactive device allegedly stolen from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. In another case, a gang was found in possession of Californium — a highly radioactive element valued at over $100 million. Three separate incidents of Californium theft were also reported in 2021.
“These recurring incidents call into question the measures taken by New Delhi for the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive material. These incidents also suggest the existence of a black market for sensitive, dual-use materials inside India,” the Foreign Office said.
While tensions have de-escalated for now, the heated rhetoric and the Indus Waters Treaty suspension have pushed South Asia’s nuclear-armed rivals into another prolonged diplomatic standoff.
Water treaty tensions
In a further sign of deteriorating ties, India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar announced on Thursday that the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty would remain in effect “until cross-border terrorism by Pakistan is credibly and irrevocably stopped”.
 
 

India had announced the treaty’s suspension immediately after the Pahalgam attack on April 22.
Pakistan had then condemned the Indian move, stating: “Pakistan vehemently rejects the Indian announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. The treaty is a binding international agreement brokered by the World Bank and contains no provision for unilateral suspension.”
Water is a “vital national interest of Pakistan, a lifeline for its 240 million people and its availability will be safeguarded at all costs”, the Foreign Office warned at the time.
“Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty, and the usurpation of the rights of lower riparian will be considered an act of war and responded with full force across the complete spectrum of national power,” it added.

• Senate resolution condemns India for unprovoked strikes against Pakistan
• Trump claims hostilities between nuclear neighbours ‘settled’, asks both to focus on trade
ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan and India extended the nascent ceasefire till May 18, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday informed the Senate that Pakistan sought a “composite dialogue” with New Delhi to put all contentious matters to rest.
According to the foreign minister, the ceasefire was extended through military-to-military communication, but a political dialogue will ultimately have to take place to resolve the problems between the two neighbours. “We have told the world that we will hold a composite dialogue,” he informed the Senate.
The FM said Pakistan had never accepted the unilateral revocation of occupied Kashmir’s special status by India in 2019, while also warning that any attempt to block Pakistan’s water through the unlawful suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty would be treated as an act of war.
He said there was no clause in the treaty under which it could be held in abeyance. “It could neither be amended nor terminated unilaterally,” he said, alluding to the Indian move to hold the treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam shooting. The deputy prime minister said India used the Pahalgam incident as a pretext to sabotage the Indus Waters Treaty.
The FM also clarified that Pakistan had not sought the ceasefire in conversations with world leaders during the heightened tensions with India. In fact, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during a telephonic conversation, conveyed that India was willing to halt hostilities, he added.
 
 

The FM also referred to subsequent calls from friendly countries and said Pakistan’s position that it desired peace with dignity and honour was explained to all. “We told our friends that we would not initiate an attack, but we would certainly respond if provoked,” he said, adding that Pakistan’s response was measured, decisive, and in line with international law.
The foreign minister pointed out that the recent conflict began after the Pahalgam incident, which India instantly blamed on Pakistan in the absence of any evidence. “We offered a transparent and neutral investigation into the Pahalgam attack, but India refused,” he regretted.
‘No longer diplomatically irrelevant’
Speaking about the recent conflict, he said Pakistan was “no longer diplomatically irrelevant”. “Pakistan is no longer diplomatically irrelevant; we have proven our strategic and diplomatic significance.”
As she opened the debate on the recent escalation, PPP leader Sena­tor Sherry Rehman said that Pakis­tan established its clear dominance in the tactical field as compared to India’s far more expensive force. “This war was deliberately thrust on us,” she said, adding that Pak­istan demonstrated to the world it was a responsible nuclear power.
Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Shibli Faraz said it was the right time to push the country tow­a­rds normalisation and political stability. “We have seen the performance of the nation when it is united,” he said, urging the government to pursue Pakistan’s foreign policy aggressively. He said that the recent escalation internationali­sed the Kashmir issue once again.
Resolution against India
The house also unanimously adopted a resolution strongly condemning the unprovoked Indian attacks on innocent civilians, including women, children and mosques, while praising the befitting response by the armed forces. The resolution urged the government to proactively engage the international community for the peaceful, just and lasting resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
It stressed the importance of strict adherence to the Indus tre­aty and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering resolve to protect its rightful share of water as a fundamental component of national sec­u­rity, international agreements, eco­nomic stability, and sovereignty.
It reminded India that any violations of the Indus treaty constituted a serious breach of international humanitarian law, and amounted not only to a war crime, but also a crime against humanity, with grave, regional, and global repercussions.
Separately, US President Donald Trump urged the two countries to focus on trade instead of war. He told US troops at a base in Qatar during a Gulf tour that Pakistan and India were happy with that, reported Reuters.
‘Maintain ceasefire’
The State Department on Thursday said the United States had urged India and Pakistan to maintain the current ceasefire.
Asked at a Washington press briefing about the reported extension, State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Piggott said: “What we are happy to see is the ceasefire. That’s where our focus remains — and on the direct talks we want to see.”
Piggott credited both Indian and Pakistani leadership for agreeing to the truce. “The President (Trump) has been clear in praising both prime ministers for choosing the path of peace,” he said.
“For the past couple of days, we’ve been saying that we want to encourage and see direct talks between the parties. We have been clear on that,” Piggott emphasised.

Trump began a visit to the UAE on the latest stage of a tour of wealthy Gulf states after hailing plans by Doha to invest $10 billion in a US military facility during a trip to Qatar.
“I have absolutely no doubt that the relationship will only get bigger and better,” Trump said in a meeting with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
“Your wonderful brother came to Washington a few weeks ago and he told us about your generous statement as to the 1.4 trillion,” Trump said, referring to a UAE pledge to invest $1.4tn in the US over 10 years.
Trump was referring to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Sheikh Mohamed’s brother and the UAE’s national security adviser and chairman of two of Abu Dhabi’s deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds.
“And all I can say is thank you very much,” Trump added.
“We will work very hard to deserve it.”
Sheikh Mohamed told Trump the UAE was “keen to continue and strengthen this friendship for the benefit of the two countries and peoples”, adding to Trump: “Your presence here today, your excellency, the president, confirms that this keenness is mutual.”
Before his departure for the UAE, Trump said in a speech to US troops at the Al Udeid Air Base southwest of Doha that defence purchases signed by Qatar on Wednesday are worth $42bn.
He was met at the airport in Abu Dhabi by Sheikh Mohamed, and the two leaders visited the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, its white minarets and domes, impressive in the late-afternoon light.
“It is so beautiful,” Trump told reporters inside the mosque, which he said had been closed for the day.
“First time they closed it. It’s in honour of the United States. Better than in honour of me. Let’s give it to the country. That’s a great tribute.”
The UAE’s leaders want US help to make their wealthy Gulf nation a global leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
The US has a preliminary agreement with the UAE to allow it to import 500,000 of Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips a year, starting this year, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
The deal would boost the UAE’s construction of data centres vital to developing AI models.
But the agreement has provoked national security concerns among sectors of the US government, and the terms could change, sources said.
At the presidential palace, Trump and Sheikh Mohamed could be seen in TV footage in conversation with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.
Trump said he would probably return to Washington on Friday after a regional trip that began on Tuesday, although he said it was “almost destination unknown — because they’ll be getting calls, ‘could you be here? Could you be there?’”
Trump had hinted that he could stop in Istanbul for talks on Ukraine.
The two countries have finalised a technology framework agreement that was expected to be signed later on Thursday, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The agreement requires commitments on both sides to the security of technology, the source said, without immediately providing details.
Deals, diplomacy
Some big business agreements have been signed during Trump’s four-day swing through the Gulf region, including a deal for Qatar Airways to purchase up to 210 Boeing widebody jets, a $600bn commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in U.S. arms sales to the kingdom.
The trip has also brought a flurry of diplomacy.
Trump said in Qatar that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms.
He also announced on Tuesday that the US would remove longstanding sanctions on Syria and subsequently met with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.
He urged Sharaa to establish ties with Syria’s longtime foe, Israel.
AI is likely to be a focus of the final leg of Trump’s trip.
Former US president Joe Biden’s administration had imposed strict oversight of exports of US AI chips to the Middle East and other regions.
Among the Biden administration’s fears were that the prized semiconductors would be diverted to China and buttress Beijing’s military strength.
Trump has made improving ties with some Gulf countries a key goal of his administration.
If all the proposed chip deals in Gulf states, and the UAE in particular, come together, the region would become a third power centre in global AI competition after the United States and China.
Trump compared his visit to Saudi Arabia with one by his predecessor in 2022, when Biden gave the Saudi crown prince a fist bump.
“I shook more hands, more than any human being is capable of doing,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One.
“He travels all the way to Saudi Arabia, in that case, and he gives him a fist bump. That’s not what they want. They don’t want a fist bump. They want to shake his hand.”</p><small>2025-05-15 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/152142138c4e0ed.png?r=214247' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911216/pakistan-india-ceasefire-extended-until-may-18-says-fm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-India ceasefire extended until May 18, says FM Dar</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday said that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was extended until May 18, adding that the matter will “ultimately go to dialogue” between the civilian leadership of the two nations.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
On Monday, the director general of military operations for both sides held the first round of talks via hotline after the ceasefire.
Speaking in the Senate today, FM Dar said that a military-to-military conversation took place between the two countries today, where they decided to extend the ceasefire until May 18.
“Ultimately, the matter will go to dialogue between the civilian leadership of the countries,” FM Dar said. “Right now, these are military-to-military communications.”
He said that a political dialogue would take place between the two countries and that a “resolution for all the problems will be discussed”.
“We have told the world that we will carry out a composite dialogue,” Dar said.
A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif invited India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution, between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), Dar said that Pakistan did not request a ceasefire during the recent escalation with India.
Instead, it [ceasefire] was initiated following a call from the US Secretary of State, who conveyed that India was willing to halt hostilities, Dar said.
Dar emphasised that Pakistan had exercised restraint and communicated this to all friendly nations even before the outbreak of hostilities.
“We told our friends we would not initiate an attack, but we would certainly respond if provoked,” he said, adding that Pakistan’s response was measured, decisive, and in line with international norms.
Victory not only changed world’s perception but regional equation: PM
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the victory in Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos has not only changed the world’s perception about Pakistan but also the regional equation.
 






Paying tribute to the bravery and proficiency of Pakistan Air Force (PAF) falcons for inflicting a crushing defeat on the enemy during the operation, the premier said the success has also strengthened the belief of our friends and supporters in us.
Addressing the PAF falcons during his visit to Kamra Airbase today, PM Shehbaz said the PAF falcons “blew away the enemy’s pride into dust in a matter of just a few hours”.
He said, “Our daring eagles have taught a lesson to the enemy that if it ever tries to engage in any misadventure again, it will be served a destructive blow.”
The prime minister vowed that the nation will never forget the sacrifices of those martyred during this unprovoked aggression of the enemy.
He said we will uphold the dignity of our martyrs’ sacrifices and will build a prosperous and great country.
Directing his address to India, the premier said while India’s war-fever is over, we are ready to talk with it for peace.
He said let us remind India of the conditions for peace foremost among which is ensuring the right to self-determination for Kashmiri people under UNSC resolutions.
The prime minister said India mocked itself globally by unjustifiably blaming Pakistan for the Pahalgam incident, while there are irrefutable pieces of evidence of India’s involvement in terrorist activities inside Pakistan.
Senate passes resolution paying tribute to armed forces
Separately, the Senate passed a resolution paying tribute to the armed forces for demonstrating “unwavering resolve, unparalleled Professionalism, and steadfast dedication in the successful execution of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos.”
The resolution, presented by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, said the operation was carried out with exceptional restraint and maturity, reflecting the conduct of a responsible nuclear state.
It congratulated the people of Pakistan for rising above all political, ethnic, and ideological divides and differences, demonstrating unity in support of national leadership across the political spectrum and speaking with one voice and one purpose to defend the people, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and dignity of the country.
It honoured the sacrifices of the valiant martyrs who laid down their lives in the defence of the sovereignty and national honour of the country.
It condemned “the brutal and unprovoked Indian attacks on innocent civilians, including women, children and mosques”.
It urged the government to proactively engage the international community for a peaceful, just and lasting resolution of the Indian-held Kashmir, stressing the critical importance of strict adherence to the Indus water treaty.</p><small>2025-05-15 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/152225163466e70.jpg?r=222531' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911225/film-executive-in-cannes-accused-of-sexual-assault-during-event' target='_blank'><strong>Film executive in Cannes accused of sexual assault during event</strong></a><br><p>A vice president of one of the parallel film events at the Cannes Festival was suspended Thursday after being publicly denounced for sexual violence, witnesses and organisers told AFP.
During a roundtable discussion about sexual assault organised by France’s film board (CNC), a woman stood up and publicly denounced an executive from the ACID Cannes film section.
“The young woman acted with great courage and was immediately taken care of by charities present,” Erwan Balanant, a French MP who was in the room, told AFP.
It came as the main Cannes Festival barred a French actor from the premiere Thursday of a film in the running for the Palme d’Or top prize because he has been accused of rape by three former partners.
The ACID Cannes event is not part of the official festival, but runs at the same time and has some organisational links.
It showcases up-and-coming directors and more experimental cinema.
“Today, during a public roundtable, we heard testimony implicating one of our members, currently vice-president of ACID, in serious acts that could amount to sexual violence,” two other co-presidents of the organisation said in a statement to AFP.
They said the man had been suspended as a precautionary measure and that “an internal investigation process has been entrusted to an external body.” The vice president cannot be named for legal reasons.
Cannes has been under pressure from MPs and activists to take a tougher line on sexual violence.</p><small>2025-05-15 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/152135170df25b3.jpg?r=213553' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911223/egypt-sentences-prominent-dissident-to-six-months-in-prison' target='_blank'><strong>Egypt sentences prominent dissident to six months in prison</strong></a><br><p>Egypt has handed opposition figure and former presidential hopeful Hisham Kassem a new six-month prison sentence for defaming a former minister, his lawyer told AFP on Thursday.
Kassem was released in February 2024 after serving a six-month sentence that effectively stopped him from contesting a December 2023 presidential election.
The new sentence was issued in absentia on Wednesday because Kassem is out of the country, his lawyer Nasser Amin told AFP.
Kassem had not been notified of the new charges against him, Amin said, adding: “These measures have been very concerning.” The European Parliament described Kassem’s original prosecution in September 2023 as “politically motivated”.
His latest conviction was on charges of defaming another former labour minister, apparently in the same comments as the first.
Human rights group the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights condemned the ruling, describing it as “continued judicial persecution for political purposes”.
“Retrying Kassem for the same incident and on the same charges… is not only trying the same defendant for the same act twice, but also clearly indicates an explicit desire to punish him for his political statements criticising the regime as well as his political activity,” the group said.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s administration has faced persistent criticism of its human rights record since it came to power in 2014.
Since 2022, the administration has released hundreds of political prisoners, although human rights groups say many more have been detained over the same period.</p><small>2025-05-15 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/151904424217a85.jpg?r=192119' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911219/pm-directs-comprehensive-regulatory-framework-for-agriculture-sector' target='_blank'><strong>PM directs comprehensive regulatory framework for agriculture sector</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the agriculture sector was being developed on modern lines to achieve self-reliance and directed the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework for the sector.
During the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector experienced a significantly declined growth rate of 1.10pc compared to 5.80pc the previous year. The prime minister has previously stated his government’s determination to transform the sector on modern lines to achieve self-sufficiency, emphasising its vast potential for rapid economic development.
Chairing a meeting on agricultural sector reforms today, the prime minister stressed that government’s priority for the promotion of modern technology in the agricultural sector. He also directed the relevant department to present a National Agri-Innovation Plan for the agricultural sector.
The prime minister instructed the formulation of a coordinated strategy to develop the agriculture sector in consultation with provinces and relevant stakeholders. He instructed authorities concerned to formulate a sustainable and long-term policy for agro-industrial development to promote agriculture and forestry and help counter the effects of climate change.
PM Shehbaz directed the provision of agricultural loans to farmers on easy terms and stressed a focus on agricultural research to enhance production. He also called for accelerating ongoing reforms in the certification system for agricultural seed and developing an effective action plan to promote high-quality seeds.
Agriculture sector decline
The deceleration in the agriculture sector can be attributed mainly to negative growth in key crops such as cotton, rice, and maize. Cotton ginning and miscellaneous components showed growth in FY24 due to excellent cotton output but declined in FY25 due to poor cotton production.
Cotton production saw a substantial decline of 30.7pc, with this year’s output recorded at 7.084 million bales, compared to 10.22m bales the previous year. Rice production dropped by 1.4pc, totalling 9.72m tonnes, down from 9.86m tonnes the previous year. Similarly, maize production decreased by 15.4pc, with output falling to 8.24m tonnes from 9.74m tonnes the previous year.
The latest revised estimates indicate a 2.3pc decrease in sugarcane production, totalling 85.62m tonnes, down from 87.64m tonnes last year. The wheat area dropped by 6.8pc from last year, despite having no impact in Q1. Potatoes saw a 14.2pc increase, while other crops grew by 0.73pc.
During a high-level consultative meeting on the agriculture sector in April, the prime minister reaffirmed his government’s commitment to revitalising the country’s agriculture sector by promoting innovation, sustainable development, and the active involvement of young experts and key stakeholders to revive the agricultural economy.
PM Shehbaz called for tapping into the talent of young professionals and researchers while leveraging the wisdom of experienced experts to guide the process. He expressed concern that cotton production had fallen so low that Pakistan had become an importer while neighbouring countries like India and China had progressed in crop yield.
Referring to Pakistan’s 65 per cent rural population, the prime minister stressed the need to provide meaningful opportunities to rural youth, particularly in agri-tech and entrepreneurship. He noted the absence of patronage for local agri-machinery manufacturers and service companies supporting small farmers, urging that these be brought into a systematic framework.
He directed the formation of working committees on five critical sectors. The meeting highlighted the need to increase domestic and foreign investment in the agriculture sector, while also strengthening the role of financial institutions and facilitating agricultural loans.</p><small>2025-05-15 15:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1518194818bf153.jpg?r=182019' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911215/trump-asks-apple-chief-to-expand-production-back-to-us-instead-of-india' target='_blank'><strong>Trump asks Apple chief to expand production back to US instead of India</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook and told him not to expand his production facilities in India, but to do so in America.
“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said during his visit to Qatar.
“I said to him, Tim, you’re my friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India,” he said, referring to Apple’s plan announced in February to invest $500bn in the US over the next four years.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Trump said he informed Cook that he does not want him to build production facilities in India, and that Apple will be “upping their production in the United States”.
The US president claimed that selling American goods in the world’s most populous country is “very difficult” because India has one of the highest tariff barriers in the world.
However, he noted that while the Asian country looks for a deal on import duties, India has offered them a “no-tariff” deal.
 
 

Trump’s remarks came after Tim Cook said earlier this month that the majority of Apple’s products to be sold in the US in the coming months will be sourced from India and Vietnam rather than China, which has been the target of US President Donald Trump’s highest tariffs.
“We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,” Cook said.
The primary production location “for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the US” will be Vietnam in the meantime.
Cook noted that the great bulk of all products sold outside the US will continue to be manufactured in China.
Apple is among the most impacted tech firms in the US, with its shares falling by around 5.1 per cent since the tariffs were announced.
Due to low production costs, the majority of Apple products are now manufactured in China.
The Trump administration has repeatedly stated that it wants Apple to move production to the US.
Earlier this week, the US and China agreed to a sweeping rollback of punitive tariffs for an initial 90-day period, signalling a rare moment of relief in their protracted trade conflict and raising hopes for longer-term economic stability.</p><small>2025-05-15 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/15172049db20b01.png?r=172258' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911211/dg-ispr-warns-of-swift-and-assured-response-in-case-india-breaks-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR warns of ‘swift and assured response’ in case India breaks ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Thursday warned in an interview with British broadcaster Sky News that any Indian ceasefire violation would be met with a “swift and assured response” by Pakistan, cautioning that serious escalation could result in mutual destruction.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan. According to the government, forty civilians — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.
Speaking to Sky News, DG ISPR warned that by rooting for war, India was carving out a “recipe for mutual destruction,” adding that the world now recognised the extent of the nuclear threat.
“Any sane player like the USA understands this absurdity and what the Indians are trying to do here,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told the publications.
 


Talking about India’s actions in Kashmir, he accused the country of trying to “internalise the issue and harassing” Kashmiri people with a heavy troop presence.
“It is a problem that has to be resolved by the people of Kashmir as per the United Nations Security Council resolution,” he said.
He continued: “Anyone who tries to violate our territory and integrity and sovereignty, our response will be brutal.”
DG ISPR warned that a “serious escalation between India and Pakistan would destroy both sides” under the concept of mutually assured destruction — a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.
In a press conference held last week after the ceasefire was brokered, DG ISPR had cautioned that a conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi “can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.”
“In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan,” he added.</p><small>2025-05-15 14:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/15151800e092778.jpg?r=151806' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203/india-has-offered-us-a-trade-deal-with-no-tariffs-trump' target='_blank'><strong>India has offered US a trade deal with no tariffs: Trump</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “no tariffs” for American goods, while expressing his dissatisfaction with Apple’s (AAPL.O) plans to invest in India.
New Delhi is seeking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the 90-day pause announced by Trump on April 9 on tariff hikes for major trading partners.
“It is very hard to sell in India, and they are offering us a deal where basically they are willing to literally charge us no tariffs,” Trump said in a meeting with executives in the Qatari capital Doha.
Reuters has reported that New Delhi has offered to reduce duties to zero on 60 per cent of tariff lines in a first phase of the deal under negotiation with Washington, while offering preferential access to nearly 90pc of the merchandise India imports from the US.
India’s equity benchmarks jumped to a seven-month high after Trump’s comment on the deal with India.
The Indian trade ministry did not reply to a mail seeking comments on the proposed deal.
Trump in Doha said he had confronted Apple’s CEO Tim Cook about shifting production to India, as the American company moves to make most of its iPhones sold in the United States at factories in India by the end of 2026, and is speeding up those plans to navigate potentially higher tariffs in China.
“Tim, we treated you very good, we put up with all the plants you built in China for years … we are not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well, we want you to build here”, Trump recalled himself telling Cook, who was not in the Doha meeting.
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years promoted India as a smartphone manufacturing hub and Apple’s suppliers have ramped up production in the country.
In March, Apple’s main India suppliers Foxconn and Tata shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the US, an all-time high, to bypass Trump’s impending tariffs.
The United States is India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling some $129bn in 2024. The trade balance is currently in favour of India, which runs a $45.7bn surplus with the US.
India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal will lead a trade delegation to the United States starting May 16 to advance trade negotiations, two government officials told Reuters on Tuesday.

US President Donald Trump, on his Gulf tour, met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Wednesday. Despite concerns within sectors of his administration over Syria’s leaders’ former ties to Al Qaeda, Trump said on Tuesday during a speech in Riyadh that he would lift sanctions on Syria in a major policy shift.
“Pakistan has consistently advocated for constructive engagement and dialogue. The easing of sanctions is expected to facilitate economic growth, improve access to essential services, and support the rebuilding efforts of the Syrian authorities,” the FO statement read.
Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment towards Syria’s unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, the statement said, “Pakistan supports a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned resolution.”
“We commend the commitment of all countries, in particular the US, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, working constructively towards a peaceful Syria,” the statement read.
The decision is a major boost for Sharaa, who has been struggling to bring the country under the control of the Damascus government after toppling former President Bashar al-Assad in December.
According to Al Jazeera, the US was one of many countries that sanctioned Syria under the al-Assad regime (1971–2024). It labelled Syria a “State Sponsor of Terrorism” in 1979, triggering arms and financial restrictions.
Sanctions expanded in 2004 and intensified after the 2011 war, targeting regime-linked individuals, freezing assets, banning US investments, and restricting oil imports.
The US also offered a $10 million reward for Syria’s current leader, al-Sharaa, and designated his former group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a “Foreign Terrorist Organisation”.</p><small>2025-05-15 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/15162543b42c813.jpg?r=163912' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911209/swedish-prosecutors-deny-spy-agency-arrests-linked-to-turkish-case' target='_blank'><strong>Swedish prosecutors deny spy agency arrests linked to Turkish case</strong></a><br><p>Swedish prosecutors said on Thursday the intelligence service’s arrests of a Kurdish representative and a Swedish diplomat were not linked to a journalist facing “terror” charges in Turkiye.

The Swedish Security Service (Sapo) confirmed to AFP that two people had recently been arrested for “aggravated unauthorised handling of secret information”.
They had since been released but were still suspects, Sapo said. It declined to disclose any details of the case.
Sveriges Radio said one of the suspects in Sapo’s case was a Swedish citizen who was a leading representative for Kurds in Northern Syria. The other was a diplomat at the foreign ministry.
The broadcaster said it was unclear whether the arrests had been made as a result of a request from Turkey or not.
But on Thursday, the Swedish Prosecution Authority published a statement refuting the media reports.
“This is an individual case that has no links to other ongoing investigations or legal proceedings, in Sweden or in other countries,” public prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said, noting the investigation was in an early stage.
Turkey has accused Medin, who works for Swedish newspaper Dagens ETC, of being a member of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), an allegation he has denied.
Medin was detained at Istanbul airport on March 27 when he flew in to cover mass protests gripping Turkey.
A Turkish court last month handed the 40-year-old an 11-month suspended sentence on charges of insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In order to persuade Turkey to drop its veto when Sweden applied to join NATO, the countries made a deal that included increased collaboration on “terrorism”.
At the weekend, Sapo arrested a second diplomat on suspicions of spying. That diplomat was also released but remains a suspect, although the intelligence agency told AFP that was related to a separate investigation.
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a NATO meeting in Turkey, Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard confirmed there were two investigations ongoing relating to government employees.
“These are serious accusations but I can’t say more than that,” Stenergard said.
Stenergard said she had spoken to her Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan on Wednesday about Medin’s case.</p><small>2025-05-15 11:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/15162039badf1e7.jpg?r=163054' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911206/bullish-momentum-at-psx-as-shares-gain-1400-points-after-sbp-receives-2nd-imf-tranche' target='_blank'><strong>Bullish momentum at PSX as shares gain 1,400 points after SBP receives 2nd IMF tranche</strong></a><br><p>Bulls took control of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday as shares gained over 1,400 points, bringing calm to yesterday’s heightened volatility.
The positive momentum comes just a day after Pakistan received the second tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), worth $1 billion, under its loan programme.
The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of  858.23 points (0.73 per cent) to stand at 119,394.75 points from the previous close of 118,536.52 at 9:40am.
The intraday high was recorded 119,990.30 points at around 3:18pm, 1,453.78 points (1.23pc) higher than yesterday.
Finally, the KSE-100 closed at 119,961.91 points, with a gain of 1,425.39 points (1.20pc) compared to the previous close.

Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the market was positive due to the recent inflows from the IMF.
He also noted there were “expectations of further inflows on the back of the IMF Board approval”, which on May 9 greenlit the $1bn tranche but also allowed an additional arrangement for $1.4bn climate funds under the Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
 
 

Today’s bullish momentum comes as the market continues to recover from the upheaval brought by the intense military row between Pakistan and India last week, after the two agreed to a ceasefire.
Shares in the subsequent session had gained a record 9pc.
Tariq also mentioned lower yields on treasury bill auctions and expectations of resolution of circular debt in the gas and power sectors.
Last month, the energy ministry had informed the National Assembly that the circular debt had declined by Rs9bn during the first six months of the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-05-15 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1513163372a5b9e.jpg?r=145545' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911191/jui-f-leader-targeted-in-south-waziristan-explosion-police' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F leader targeted in South Waziristan explosion: police</strong></a><br><p>A powerful explosion targeted the vehicle of local JUI-F leader Maulana Noorullah on Thursday near a seminary in the lower South Waziristan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, police said.
The explosion hit Maulana Noorullah’s car near Shahzad Madrassah, adjacent to a police station in the district’s Azam Warsak market. According to a police statement, the bomb attack was carried out to target Maulana Noorullah, who remained unharmed.
Police confirmed the incident and said there were no casualties in the explosion. Security forces cordoned off the area and started an investigation.
According to a video later released by the JUI-F, Maulana Noorullah told his supporters that he was accompanied by local party leaders Maulana Ishaq and Maulana Amanullah when the blast occurred.
“We all are safe,” he told his supporters. “We want peace in the country and protection of religious schools, mosques and all Muslims.”
JUI-F leaders have been targeted in different parts of KP and Balochistan over the past several months.
On March 14 this year, a bomb exploded at a mosque in South Waziristan district during Friday prayers, injuring JUI district chief Abdullah Nadeem and three others, police said. Nadeem was seriously wounded, while three others, also belonging to the JUI, sustained minor injuries.
Local JUI-F leaders have also come under attack in Balochistan. On April 25, a local leader of the JUI-F and two women were killed and five others were injured in a roadside explosion near the Kalat district.
The incident occurred in the Kapootu area when a pickup vehicle carrying eight people was hit by an improvised explosive device (IED) planted on the roadside near Killi Kapootu, according to Levies officials.
The vehicle was coming from Kalat when the blast took place. The pickup was driven by JUI-F local leader and union council member Maulana Abdullah Nachari.
In another incident on March 2, two leaders of JUI-F Balochistan were killed in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district in Balochistan.
The JUI-F leaders, Wadera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah were on their way home in the Tarsani area of Zehri when unknown assailants riding motorcycles opened fire on them with automatic weapons.
Both died on the spot after being shot multiple times, while the security guard of one of the leaders received bullet injuries.</p><small>2025-05-15 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/151316324049da7.jpg?r=131953' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911187/over-300-haj-pilgrims-arrive-in-jeddah-as-2nd-phase-of-road-to-makkah-initiative-launched' target='_blank'><strong>Over 300 Haj pilgrims arrive in Jeddah as 2nd phase of Road to Makkah initiative launched</strong></a><br><p>The first of 180 Pakistani Hajj flights scheduled to fly to Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah — part of the Road to Makkah Initiative — arrived at the King Abdul Aziz International Airport from Islamabad carrying 310 Haj pilgrims, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported today.
Launched in 2019 at the Islamabad airport and later extended to Karachi, the Road to Makkah initiative offers an exemption to Haj pilgrims from the immigration process at Saudi airports by clearing them at their respective airports in Pakistan by Saudi immigration officials before boarding their flights.
Marking the second phase of the initiative, the passengers were received at the airport by Minister of Religious Affairs & Interfaith Harmony Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah Khalid Majid, DG Hajj Abdul Wahab Soomro and the senior officers of the Consulate General of Pakistan. The pilgrims were presented bouqets by the receiving party.
This year, an estimated 50,500 Haj pilgrims will travel to Saudi Arabia under the initiative, with 28,000 departing from Islamabad and 22,500 from Karachi throughout 180 flights, out of which 100 will depart from Islamabad and 80 from Karachi.
Housing and other essential facilities have been arranged for all the pilgrims, including service personnel such as medical staff and officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, to facilitate the Haj pilgrims.
In April, a Saudi immigration team arrived in the country to process Pakistani Haj pilgrims at Jinnah International Airport and Islamabad International Airport.
In 2025, Pakistan’s Haj quota was set at 179,210, with half of the quota meant to be managed by private Haj operators. However, only 23,000 people were able to go under private operators.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-05-15 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/151352505a50cf7.jpg?r=135314' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911193/trump-says-us-close-to-a-nuclear-deal-with-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US close to a nuclear deal with Iran</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms.
“We’re in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace,” Trump said on a tour of the Gulf, according to a shared pool report by AFP.
“We’re getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this … there [are] two steps to doing this, there is a very, very nice step and there is the violent step, but I don’t want to do it the second way,” he said.
An Iranian source familiar with the negotiations said there were still gaps to bridge in the talks with the United States.
Fresh talks between Iranian and US negotiators to resolve disputes over Tehran’s nuclear programme ended in Oman on Sunday with further negotiations planned, officials said, as Tehran publicly insisted on continuing its uranium enrichment.
Though Tehran and Washington have both said they prefer diplomacy to resolve the decades-long nuclear dispute, they remain divided on several red lines that negotiators will have to circumvent to reach a new deal and avert future military action.
Iran’s president reacted to Trump’s comments on Tuesday, calling Tehran the “most destructive force” in the Middle East.
“Trump thinks he can sanction and threaten us and then talk of human rights. All the crimes and regional instability are caused by them (the United States),” Masoud Pezeshkian said.
“He wants to create instability inside Iran.”
US officials have publicly stated that Iran should halt uranium enrichment, a stance Iranian officials have called a “red line” asserting they will not give up what they view as their right to enrich uranium on Iranian soil.
However, they have indicated a willingness to reduce the level of enrichment.
Iranian officials have also expressed readiness to reduce the amount of highly enriched uranium in storage — uranium enriched beyond the levels typically needed for civilian purposes, such as nuclear power generation.
However, they have said it would not accept lower stockpiles than the amount agreed in a deal with world powers in 2015 — the deal Trump quit.
The Iranian source said that while Iran is prepared to offer what it considers concessions, the “issue is that America is not willing to lift major sanctions in exchange”.
 
 

Western sanctions have severely impacted the Iranian economy.
Regarding the reduction of enriched uranium in storage, the source noted: “Tehran also wants it removed in several stages, which America doesn’t agree with either.”
There is also disagreement over the destination to which the highly enriched uranium would be sent, the source added.</p><small>2025-05-15 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/151247472a4bb3d.jpg?r=124758' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911148/citizens-may-bear-brunt-of-extra-costs-on-fuel-prices' target='_blank'><strong>Citizens may bear brunt of extra costs on fuel prices</strong></a><br><p>• OMCs, refineries, dealers to benefit from additional Rs75bn
• Petroleum division mulls GST on oil products
ISLAMABAD: For a third time in two months, the government is considering imposing additional costs — this time at the rate of Rs4.12 per litre — on the prices of petroleum products, a move that may deprive consumers of potential relief in prices due to be announced for the next fortnight today (Thursday).
This has been proposed by the petroleum division to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet. The impact of Rs4.12 per unit works out to be around Rs75 billion on an annual basis to be paid to oil marketing companies (OMCs), refineries and retail dealers to meet their demands.
On top of this, the petroleum division has also recommended imposition of general sales tax on petroleum products at the rate of Rs3-5 per litre from July 1, through the finance bill 2025-26.
Without these proposed measures, the prices of petrol and diesel were estimated to decline by about Rs3.5 and Rs7 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight starting May 15, owing to decline in the international market and a slight ease in import premium on petrol. Over the last two months, the government has disallowed about Rs18 per litre potential reduction in petroleum prices to discourage rise in petroleum consumption.
 
 

This was done through increase in petroleum levy, including through a special presidential ordinance, to divert funds for higher subsidy on electricity rates and construction of highways and motorways in Balochistan and Sindh.
According to a summary sent to the ECC, the petroleum division has proposed a Rs1.87 per litre allowance through changes in the pool of inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) to satisfy OMCs and refineries with an estimated financial impact of Rs34bn. In addition, the division has proposed an increase in sale margins to the OMCs at the rate of Rs1.13 and Rs1.12 per litre for petroleum dealers from their existing rates of about Rs8 and Rs8.64 per litre.
On the annual basis, the additional financial impact of the increase in margins is estimated to be more than Rs40bn depending on sales volume.
The division argued that petroleum products (petrol, high speed diesel, kerosene and light diesel oil) had been classified as “exempted” under Finance Act 2024-25. Resultantly, the input sales tax became cost of refineries and OMCs (Rs34bn for FY2024-25) which could not be recovered through the product prices as the petroleum products rates were regulated by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
Strangely, the division claimed that petroleum prices were “being fixed by Ogra under GoP Policy”. It is, however, a matter of record that actually calculations made by Ogra are forwarded by the division to the ministry of finance which itself moves a summary to the prime minister for approval every fortnight.
The major price cuts are then anno­unced by the prime minister himself or his office, otherwise price revisions are announced by the ministry of finance.
 
 

The petroleum division also said a draft proposal to levy 3-5pc sales tax on petrol and HSD was developed in consultation with the oil industry, finance ministry and Federal Board of Revenue which could “not be implemented due to non-agreement with IMF to allow these products be taxed at reduced rates of GST”.
On the other hand, the petrol and diesel price increase due to standard rate of 18pc GST would be around Rs45 per litre, which was not desirable. Any amendment to the sales tax rate will require consultation with IMF and parliament’s approval.
Supply chain
Besides the sales tax issue, OMCs and dealers have requested for enhancement of their margins on petrol and HSD. Ogra has recommended an increase of OMCs and petroleum dealers’ margin by Rs1.13 and Rs1.40/litre, respectively, to ensure sustainability of the supply chain.
However, with partial amendment the summary proposed Rs1.13 per litre additional benefit to OMCs and Rs1.12 per litre to dealers. It said that since petroleum products were exempted from sales tax during current financial year, the refineries and OMCs’ unadjusted sales tax during July 2024-June 2025 on these products may be compensated through IFEM (estimated at Rs34bn).
“For FY2025-26, 3-5pc sales tax on these products may be imposed through Finance Act. However, in case the products remain exempted from sales tax in the FY 2025-26, the unadjusted sales tax may continue to be compensated through IFEM as a fallback option to keep the oil supply chain sustainable,” the petroleum division insisted.

HRW said that “scores of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia die in gruesome yet avoidable workplace-related accidents, including falling from buildings, electrocution, and even decapitation”.
The NGO, which has studied nearly 50 cases of deaths in Saudi Arabia, said Saudi authorities had  “failed to adequately protect workers from preventable deaths, investigate workplace safety incidents, and ensure timely and adequate compensation for families” including through life insurance policies and benefits to survivors.
“The risks of occupational deaths and injuries are further increasing as the Saudi government ramps up construction work for the 2034 World Cup as well as other ‘giga-projects’,” HRW added.
 
 

The Gulf kingdom was handed the right to host the 2034 World Cup at a FIFA Congress last December despite concerns about its human rights record, the risks to migrant labourers and criminalisation of same-sex relationships. It was the only candidate.
The NGO called on FIFA to ensure all work-related deaths in Saudi Arabia are properly investigated and that bereaved families receive compensation.
FIFA has committed to establishing a workers’ welfare system, which it says includes  “dedicated mandatory standards and enforcement mechanisms applicable to all companies and workers involved in… World Cup-related construction and service delivery” in Saudi Arabia.
But HRW said football’s world governing body did not provide  “details on concrete measures to prevent, investigate, and compensate migrant worker deaths such as risk-based heat protection measures or life insurance”.
The NGO claimed  “FIFA is knowingly risking yet another tournament that will unnecessarily come at a grave human cost”, referencing the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
Similar concerns over workers’ welfare dogged Qatar ahead of its hosting of international football’s showpiece tournament.
Amnesty International and other rights groups claimed thousands of migrant workers died in the lead-up to the 2022 tournament, though Doha has said only 37 workers on World Cup projects perished — and only three in work-related accidents.
HRW stated in its report that the majority of migrant worker deaths in Saudi Arabia are attributed to  “natural causes” and are therefore neither investigated nor compensated.
According to figures provided by the NGO, for example, 74 percent of 1,420 Indian migrant worker deaths recorded at the Indian embassy in Riyadh in 2023 were attributed to natural causes.
HRW added  “even work-related death cases categorised as such in a migrant worker’s death certificate are sometimes not compensated as they should be according to Saudi law and international labour standards”.
“In migrant death cases that are compensated, the process is long and burdensome,” the report said, providing an example of one such compensation process that took a decade to be completed.
“My sons are 11 and 13 years old. When my husband died, they were 11 months and two years old. If we had received compensation right after his death, it would have provided so much relief,” the wife of a deceased worker, who was not named, told HRW.
In response to the report, FIFA shared with AFP a letter it sent last month to HRW from its secretary general Mattias Grafstrom.
The letter says Saudi Arabia has  “in the past years been investing heavily in the development of its society and economy”, using international companies.
Grafstrom notes that Saudi Arabia  “has taken significant steps to reform its labour laws since 2018”, including the abolition of parts of the kafala system which ties workers to their employers, and introducing standardised contracts for workers.
The Saudi government, he says, has also committed to working with the United Nations’ International Labour Organization (ILO)  “on the further expansion and effective implementation of these reforms”.
“In line with its human rights commitments, FIFA seeks to play its part in ensuring strong protections for workers employed by third parties in the construction of FIFA World Cup sites,” Grafstrom adds.
AFP has also contacted the Saudi government for comment.

This information was placed before the National Assembly by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday in a written reply to a question asked by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Sehar Kamran.
The official data provided by the minister shows that a total of 5,402 Pakistanis have been deported from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since January 2024. As many as 4,850 Pakistani nationals faced deportation from these countries in the year 2024 whereas 552 have returned to Pakistan this year.
The questioner has sought data of the last three years, but the minister provided details of the period starting from January 2024.

Another 369 individuals caught begging in five other countries; nearly 52pc deportees belong to Sindh; Pakistan has expelled over one million illegal Afghans

 
 

Interestingly, the province-wise break-up of the data shows that most of those deported from these countries belong to Sindh province. A total of 2,795 people from the province are among those deported from these countries on begging charges whereas the number of such people belonging to Punjab stands at 1,437.
According to statistics, as many as 1,002 people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 125 from Balochistan, 33 from Azad Kashmir and 10 from Islamabad are among those deported from the six countries.
After Saudi Arabia, the highest number of 247 Pakistanis has been repatriated from Iraq. The UAE, which raised the issue with the Pakistan government more vigorously and imposed strict restrictions on visas for the Pakistani nationals, has so far deported 58 such individuals during this period.
Afghan Refugees
In response to another question asked by Anjum Aqeel Khan of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the interior minister informed the National Assembly that over one million “illegal Afghans”, including those possessing Afghan Citizen Card (ACC), had been repatriated since November 2023 under the Illegal Foreigner’s Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
“The IFRP has been approved by the federal government. Every sovereign state retains the right to deport illegal foreigners in order to safeguard its borders and national security.
Furthermore, there are no international legal implications for Pakistan, as it is not a signatory to the 1951 UNHCR Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol with respect to Afghan repatriation,“ says the minister in his written reply. He said Pakistan did not intend to extend the duration of ACC holders for further period.
He further said that 1.377 million Afghan refugees, holding POR (Proof of Registration) had been repatriated to Afghanistan through the UNHCR repatriation programme since 2007.
He said there were 813,146 Afghans with ACC and 1.304m POR holders in Pakistan at present.

ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill granted the permission to the prosecution accepting its written application, which was opposed by the lawyer of the former prime minister.
The judge has ordered completion of the tests within 12 days, saying the prosecution may meet the PTI founding chairman in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, during that period.
Earlier, the judge heard the concluding arguments of PTI founder’s lawyer, Barrister Salman Safdar, and the prosecution before reserving the verdict.
Barrister Safdar opposed the prosecution request, questioning the police decision to conduct the polygraph and photogrammetric tests 727 days after the May 9 incidents.
The lawyer argued that bail had already been granted to the former prime minister in 21 cases and the statements on the basis of which the police were seeking these tests had already been declared lawful by the Lahore High Court.
He urged the court to dismiss the petition of the prosecution.
Special Prosecutor Rana Aazar stated that the Supreme Court allowed such tests to fulfill investigative requirements. However, he said, the PTI founding chairman refused to undergo these tests in jail without the presence of his lawyer.
He further stated that conducting the voice match test of the accused was a legal requirement.
He asked the court to grant permission to conduct the polygraph, photogrammetric, and voice match tests.
After hearing both sides, the judge reserved his decision on the plea.
In the application, the police sought permission to conduct photogrammetric and polygraph tests of Imran inside Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, where he is currently imprisoned.
The tests are to be carried out in 12 cases, including those pertaining to Jinnah House and Askari Tower attacks.
 
 

Other cases include attacks on Shadman police station and party offices of the PML-N.
MAY 9 TRIALS: The Lahore High Court registrar has issued an amended schedule of the trials of the May 9 cases being conducted at Kot Lakhpat Jail to meet the timeline of four months set by the Supreme Court to conclude these trials.
Last month, a three-judge bench of the SC headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi directed the anti-terrorism courts (ATCs) to conclude May 9 violence trials within four months.
The hearing of May 9 cases would now be heard in jail four days a week — Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The jail trials were earlier being held three days a week but have been extended to expedite their disposal.
The ATCs in Lahore are hearing the jail trials of 14 cases including attack on the Jinnah House, which also serves as residence of corps commander.
Several PTI leaders including former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former provincial ministers Dr Yasmin Rashid and Mian Mehmoodur Rashid are facing trials at the Kot Lakhpat jail.
