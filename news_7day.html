<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01183932cf62e97.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938949/sco-summit-adopts-statement-condemning-jaffar-khuzdar-pahalgam-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>SCO summit adopts statement condemning Jaffar, Khuzdar, Pahalgam attacks</strong></a><br><p>The leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on Monday adopted a statement condemning terrorism in Pakistan and India amid tense ties between the two nations that have seen allegations against each other for alleged involvement in militant attacks.
The Jaffar Express train was hijacked on March 11 when Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages. Security forces launched a two-day operation, concluding on March 12.
On May 21, at least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
On April 22, assailants conducted an attack in Pahalgam, a tourist hotspot in occupied Kashmir that draws thousands of visitors every summer. Gunmen opened fire on visitors, killing at least 26 people — all men from across India except one from Nepal — and injuring 17 others. It was the region’s deadliest attack on civilians since 2000.
In all three scenarios, both countries accused the other of having a role in the incident. The SCO defence ministers summit in June had failed to reach a consensus on a joint statement due to India’s refusal. According to The Times of India, New Delhi had refused to sign the document after it omitted a reference to the Pahalgam attack.
The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran.
The SCO summit of leaders is currently underway in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin. China’s President Xi Jinping hosted the two-day summit of SCO leaders as well as “SCO plus”, bringing together some 20 heads of state and government, besides leaders of international organisations. It was the largest gathering of the SCO as well as the fifth time hosted by China since the bloc was formed in 2001.
The summit adopted the Tianjin Declaration, which notably said: “Member states strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22 2025.
“Member states also strongly condemned the terrorist attacks on Jaffar Express on March 11 and in Khuzdar on May 21, 2025.”
The SCO leaders expressed their “deepest sympathy and condolences” to the families of the dead and the wounded, saying that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice.
“The member states, while reaffirming their firm commitment to the fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, stress the inadmissibility of attempts to use terrorist, separatist and extremist groups for mercenary purposes. They recognise the leading role of sovereign states and their competent authorities in countering terrorist and extremist threats.”
The leaders further adopted 24 documents to strengthen cooperation in security, economy and cultural exchanges.
They also adopted a 10-year SCO Development Strategy until 2035, which “defines the priority tasks and main directions for deepening multifaceted cooperation in the interests of ensuring peace and stability, development and prosperity in the SCO space”, read the joint statement.
Amid the US tariffs, which have roiled international markets, the SCO leaders expressed support for the multilateral trading system.
They also marked the 80th anniversary of World War II victory and of the founding of the UN, the declaration added.
‘SCO Partner’
The SCO also evolved from the “Shanghai Five” mechanism comprising China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan before Uzbekistan joined as the sixth member. Today, it included 10 member states, two observers and 14 dialogue partners across Asia, Europe and Africa.
The organisation covers approximately 24 per cent of global land area and 42pc of the world’s population, with member states accounting for roughly one-quarter of global GDP and trade increasing nearly 100-fold in two decades.
China’s trade with SCO members, observers and dialogue partners reached a record $890 billion in 2024, or 14.4pc of its total foreign trade.
At the Tianjin summit, the SCO member states decided to combine the statuses of “observer” and “dialogue partner” into a single status of “SCO Partner”.
Laos was accepted as a new “SCO Partner” at the Tianjin summit.
While the previous SCO leaders’ summit was held in Kazakhstan in July 2024, which saw 25 strategic documents — covering energy, security, finance and information security — adopted, China will pass on the SCO chairmanship to Kyrgyzstan and the next summit will be held under the slogan “25 years of the SCO: together towards sustainable peace, development and prosperity”.</p><small>2025-09-01 14:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0119013783e4c23.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938946/trump-says-india-offered-to-reduce-tariffs-on-us-goods-to-nothing' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says India offered to reduce tariffs on US goods to nothing</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that India has offered to reduce its tariffs on US goods to zero amid deteriorating ties between the two countries.
While calling the US’s relationship with India “one-sided”, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “They have now offered to cut their tariffs to nothing, but it’s getting late. They should have done so years ago.”
The Indian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to Trump’s comments, which follow the implementation of total duties as high as 50 per cent on Indian goods.
 


Relations between the two countries have plummeted, with 50pc levies on many Indian imports into the US taking effect last week as punishment for New Delhi’s massive purchases of Russian oil, a part of US efforts to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.
Since his return to the White House this year, Trump has wielded tariffs as a wide-ranging policy tool, with the levies upending global trade.
Amid this dispute, India has grown closer to Beijing and Moscow. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently in Tianjin, China, for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s Council of Heads of State summit, where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The latest tariff salvo from Trump has strained US-India ties, with New Delhi earlier criticising the levies as “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”.
Trade talks between the two countries have stumbled over agriculture and dairy markets.
Trump wants greater US access, while Modi is determined to shield India’s farmers, a huge voter bloc.
The US was India’s top export destination in 2024, with shipments worth $87.3 billion.
But analysts have cautioned that a 50pc duty is akin to a trade embargo and is likely to harm smaller firms.
Exporters of textiles, seafood and jewellery have already reported cancelled US orders and losses to rivals such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, raising fears of heavy job cuts.</p><small>2025-09-01 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01165910c0ec672.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938927/afghan-cricket-board-calls-for-support-from-business-community-for-quake-victims' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan Cricket Board calls for support from business community for quake victims</strong></a><br><p>The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) on Monday called for support from the country’s business community for victims of the earthquake that killed at least 800 people and left more than 2,500 injured.
The quake, which struck at a relatively shallow depth of eight kilometres, was 27km from the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
“The (ACB) calls upon all national businessmen, traders [and] rich countrymen to extend their support to the affected families of Kunar and other eastern provinces in this dire situation, while also recognising its own responsibility in this regard,” the governing body said in a statement on X.
 






“The leadership of the ACB, along with all the players and staff, express its deepest sorrow over the loss of lives and casualties caused by the severe earthquake in the eastern provinces, particularly in Kunar.
“In this time of immense grief, we consider ourselves united with all our people.”
It added that the earthquake had caused many deaths and affected many others, saying it was “truly a great calamity”.
The board said it stood in solidarity with the bereaved families of Kunar and all the eastern provinces and “extends heartfelt condolences and sympathies to them during this difficult time”.
The earthquake struck just before midnight, shaking buildings from capital Kabul to Islamabad. After the initial quake, a series of at least five aftershocks followed throughout the night, with the strongest being one of magnitude 5.2 just after 4am (4:30am PKT).
More than 1.2 million people likely felt strong or very strong shaking, according to the USGS.
Near the epicentre in the east of Afghanistan, around 800 people were killed and 2,500 injured in remote Kunar province alone, chief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. Another 12 people were killed and 255 were injured in neighbouring Nangarhar province, he added.
“Numerous houses were destroyed,” interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP.
The majority of Afghans live in low-rise, mud-brick homes that are vulnerable to collapse.
Minute of silence in Tri-series match
A minute of silence will be held today before the start of the UAE-Afghanistan T20I Tri-series match at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.
“The Emirates Cricket Board joins the Afghanistan Cricket Board in offering sympathies and condolences to the victims of the tragic earthquake,” the Emirati board said in a post on X.
 






Zalmi Foundation pledges Rs10m for quake victims
The chairman of the Zalmi Foundation, Javed Afridi, pledged Rs10m to support those struck by the calamity, saying he was “heartbroken by the devastation of the earthquake in Afghanistan”.
“So many lives lost, families shattered, and loved ones in pain. Our prayers are with our Afghan brothers and sisters in these tough times,” he added.

The quake, which struck at a relatively shallow depth of eight kilometres, was 27 kilometres from the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
Nangarhar and Kunar provinces border Pakistan, with the Torkham crossing, the site of many waves of Afghan returnees deported or forced to leave, often with no work and nowhere to go.
The earthquake struck just before midnight, shaking buildings from capital Kabul to Islamabad in Pakistan. After the initial quake, a series of at least five aftershocks followed throughout the night, with the strongest being one of magnitude 5.2 just after 4am (2330 GMT on Sunday).
More than 1.2 million people likely felt strong or very strong shaking, according to the USGS.
 
 

Near the epicentre in the east of Afghanistan, around 800 people were killed and 2,500 injured in remote Kunar province alone, chief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.
Another 12 people were killed and 255 injured in neighbouring Nangarhar province, he added.
“Numerous houses were destroyed,” interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP.
The majority of Afghans live in low-rise, mud-brick homes that are vulnerable to collapse.
Some of the most severely impacted villages in remote Kunar provinces “remain inaccessible due to road blockages”, the UN migration agency warned in a statement to AFP.
Afghanistan’s government-run Bakhtar News Agency reported citing officials from the Disaster Management Department in Kunar that “the most severely impacted districts include Noor Gul, Chawkay, Watapur, Mano Gai, and Chapa Dara”.
 






Three villages were razed in the province of Kunar, with substantial damage in many others, the health ministry earlier said.
The Taliban authorities and the United Nations mobilised rescue efforts to hard-hit areas. The defence ministry said 40 flight sorties had so far been carried out.
A member of the agricultural department in Kunar’s Nurgal district said people had rushed to clear blocked roads to isolated villages, but that badly affected areas were remote and had limited telecoms networks.
“There is a lot of fear and tension … Children and women were screaming.
We had never experienced anything like this in our lives,” Ijaz Ulhaq Yaad told AFP.
He said that many living in quake-hit villages were among the more than four million Afghans who have returned to the country from Iran and Pakistan in recent years.
“They wanted to build their homes here.”
Images from Reuters Television showed helicopters ferrying out the affected, while residents helped soldiers and medics carry the wounded to ambulances.
Rescuers were scrambling to find survivors in the area bordering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where homes of mud and stone were levelled by the midnight quake that hit at a depth of 10 kilometres.
The disaster will further stretch the resources of the South Asian nation already grappling with humanitarian crises, from a sharp drop in aid to a huge pushback of its citizens from neighbouring countries.
Condolences
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed grief over the incident and extended his condolences.
“I stand in full solidarity with the people of Afghanistan after the devastating earthquake that hit the country earlier today,” he said.
Delegation of the European Union to Afghanistan posted on X: “The EU extends its heartfelt condolences to all affected by the recent devastating earthquake in Afghanistan’s Kunar & Nangarhar provinces. Our humanitarian partners are actively on the ground, providing critical aid to the victims. We stand in full solidarity with Afghans.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also extended condolences over the loss of life.
“Deeply saddened by the devastating earthquake in eastern Afghanistan, which shook Kabul & was also felt in various parts of Pakistan, including Islamabad. With reports confirming hundreds of precious human lives lost & villages destroyed, our hearts go out to the victims and their families. On behalf of the people and Government of Pakistan, I extend my heartfelt condolences & prayers to the bereaved families,” he said on X.
He added, “We stand in solidarity with our Afghan brothers & sisters in this hour of grief, and we are ready to extend all possible support in this regard.”
 






In his condolence message, President Asif Ali Zardari also said that “during this hour of grief and hardship, Pakistan stands firmly in solidarity with the people of Afghanistan.”
The statement issued by the President’s Secretariat said, “He prayed for the swift recovery of the injured and for strength and resilience of the affected communities. He further prayed that the departed souls may rest in eternal peace and that the Almighty may grant courage to the bereaved families to bear this immense loss.”
In his statement, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar offered prayers for those injured and impacted by the quake.
 






Following earlier reports of casualties, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said he was “extremely saddened by the tragic loss of over 300 lives and the many injuries”.
“My deepest condolences go out to the families who have lost their loved ones and heartfelt prayers for full and quick recovery of those injured. This immense sorrow is felt by us all,” he said on X.
 






Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Karim Kundi also expressed grief over the “loss of hundreds of lives and large-scale financial damages caused by a powerful earthquake”.
In his condolence message, Kundi “extended heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved families and prayed for the early recovery of the injured. He said the people of Pakistan stand in solidarity with the Afghan government and people during this difficult time.”
Deadly quakes
Afghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.
In October 2023, western Herat province was devastated by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 1,500 people and damaged or destroyed more than 63,000 homes.
In June 2022, a 5.9-magnitude quake struck the impoverished eastern border province of Paktika, killing more than 1,000 people and leaving tens of thousands homeless.
Ravaged by four decades of war, Afghanistan is already contending with a series of humanitarian crises.
Since the return of the Taliban, foreign aid to Afghanistan has been slashed, undermining the already impoverished nation’s ability to respond to disasters.

• Central bank debt reduced to Rs3.8tr from Rs5.5tr; average domestic debt maturity rises to 3.8 years
• Falling interest rates saved Rs800bn in FY25, easing taxpayer burden
ISLAMABAD: The government on Sunday said it had retired about Rs1.133tr debt to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), taking advantage of the central bank’s record profits driven by the highest interest rates in the country’s history.
“On August 29, 2025, the Debt Management Office (of the Ministry of Finance) executed another monumental repayment of Rs1.133 trillion,” the Ministry of Finance (MoF) said in a statement, adding that this came on top of an earlier Rs500bn repayment on June 30, 2025. The total repayment, therefore, amounted to Rs1.633tr in just 59 days, and Rs2.6tr in about a year.
The government had earlier announced in November last year that it had retired Rs1.867tr against a borrowing of Rs753.2bn for budgetary support in FY2023-24 through earlier repayments and buybacks of its securities from the market.
“The MoF had, in the first half of FY25, retired domestic commercial market debt of Rs1tr — the first such advanced debt retirement operation in Pakistan’s history,” the statement said, adding that “including both the central bank and commercial portions, the total early debt retirement in less than one year now comes to over Rs2.6tr— an unprecedented scale and decisive action in the country’s fiscal history.”
The MoF said the early debt retirement was part of government efforts to strengthen public finances through early repayments and restore fiscal credibility. It marked a decisive shift from past debt-heavy practices, where reliance on borrowing crowded out fiscal space and increased risks.
The ministry said the government had now initiated debt discipline under which 30pc of central bank debt was retired ahead of its maturity in 2029. As a result, government debt to the SBP dropped to Rs3.8tr from Rs5.5tr, thereby reducing risks and improving fiscal space.
Consequently, fiscal resilience had strengthened, the MoF maintained, adding that “the average maturity of domestic debt has risen to 3.8 years from 2.7 years in FY24 — the sharpest single-year improvement in history, and well ahead of IMF targets.”
The statement acknowledged that falling interest rates helped secure about Rs800bn in saving that would have otherwise put an additional tax burden on taxpayers.
Earlier, the government had said the pre-mature debt retirement was possible because of 186pc growth in federal revenues. The unprecedented increase in revenues in FY2024-25 was mainly driven by the surplus profit of the SBP (Rs2.5tr).
The government’s recent Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDMS 2026-28) emphasises increasing net issuances of PIBs, fixed-rate and zero-coupon bonds to help lower refinancing and interest rate risks. The strategy also seeks gradual repayment of securities held by the SBP to reduce refinancing risk in FY2029.
With IMF consent, the plan will be supported by “utilising any windfall from SBP dividends exceeding 1pc of GDP for the retirement of SBP debt,” the MoF said, adding that demand from long-term institutional investors was also expected to support this shift. Longer-dated zero-coupon bonds would suit their liability structures, it said, noting that the recently introduced two-year zero-coupon bond had already attracted strong interest from both commercial banks and insurers. Increased issuance of this instrument was therefore envisaged under the MTDMS.
The MTDMS conceded that the cost of debt in FY2025 remains elevated, particularly for domestic borrowing. The overall weighted average interest rate stands at 11.9pc, driven largely by the significantly higher cost of domestic debt relative to external sources.
While external debt carries a much lower weighted average interest rate of 4.4pc — reflecting the high share of concessional and semi-concessional financing — domestic debt bears an average rate of 15.82pc. As a result, interest payments consumed nearly 6pc of GDP in FY2025.
According to MoF, interest rate risk is high for domestic debt, reflecting a shift to floating-rate domestic debt instruments in response to market demand in recent years, primarily due to a growing reliance on floating-rate instruments in response to market preferences, the ministry said.
This trend was particularly evident in FY2023, when investors showed a strong preference for short- to medium-term floating-rate Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), notably the five-year tenor with semi-annual coupons. “This shift was driven by expectations of continued interest rate hikes and a high policy rate environment, which peaked at 22pc during FY2023,” the ministry added.
Nearly 80pc of domestic debt is subject to an interest rate re-fixing in FY2026, with an average time to re-fixing (ATR) of only 1.2 years. For external debt, ATR is higher at 4.5 years, reflecting a greater share of fixed-rate debt, it added.

PM Shehbaz arrived in China on Saturday to attend the SCO Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit held from August 31 to September 1. Besides Pakistan, the SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”.
“We respect all international and bilateral treaties and expect similar principles to be followed by all SCO members,” PM Shehbaz said at the summit today, in an apparent reference to fellow SCO member India and its unilateral move to hold the IWT in abeyance in April.
“Uninterrupted access to due share of water as per existing treaties among SCO members will strengthen the SCO working smoothly and will support the achievement of broader goals for which the SCO was established,” he stressed at the summit in China’s Tianjin.
 
 

India held the IWT in abeyance following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”.
Earlier this month, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague issued a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
At the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz called for a “comprehensive and structural dialogue to discuss all outstanding disputes”, adding: “I will request your consideration to lead this dialogue under your sagacious leadership so that they can have its dividends as early as possible.”
The prime minister reaffirmed that Pakistan sought a “normal and stable relationship with all its neighbours”. “It seeks dialogue and diplomacy over conflict and confrontation,” he highlighted.
PM Shehbaz noted: “Pakistan has always believed in the power of multilateralism, dialogue and diplomacy, and shunning unilateralism. And yet, to our shock and deep disappointment, the region witnessed extremely disturbing developments during the last few months.
“Pakistan supports and respects the sovereignty and integrity of all SCO members and its neighbours,” he added.
 


“We will continue our efforts, along with all SCO members and the chairman of SCO, to promote progress and prosperity in the entire region and to ensure lasting peace in South Asia,” PM Shehbaz pledged.
“Pakistan has always abided by the UN and SCO charters and will always respect the principles that will hold dear to all of us for our collective good. As a peace-loving nation, Pakistan has always advocated dialogue and diplomacy, consultation over confrontation,” he reiterated.
During his address, the premier also highlighted the severe floods that Pakistan was once again facing.
“My country is once again passing through unprecedented torrential rains, cloudbursts and massive devastation due to consequent flooding in three of our major rivers,” PM Shehbaz said, highlighting huge loss of lives and livestock, as well as severe damage to infrastructure and crops.
 
 

“We deeply appreciate the international community’s, including China’s, solidarity, sympathy and support with us,” he said, hailing the rescue and rebuilding efforts of “my brave and resilient people”.
At the outset of his speech, the prime minister noted that the port city of Tianjin, where the summit is taking place, represented “China’s core values as a connector and bridge of cultures and civilisation”.
He thanked President Xi and his government for the warm hospitality and excellent arrangements for the SCO gathering. The premier also extended his felicitations to Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan on their national days today and yesterday, respectively.
PM Shehbaz further said: “For us, the SCO is a platform that best represents Pakistan’s abiding commitment to regional cooperation and integration. China’s successful tenure as chair of the SCO is reflective of President Xi’s sagacious and visionary leadership.”
He stressed that China’s “global leadership” was exemplified not only through the bloc but also in landmark initiatives, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
‘Irrefutable evidence of foreign hands in terrorism on Pakistani soil’
At the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz also highlighted the issue of terrorism and said Pakistan had “irrefutable evidence of involvement of some foreign hands” in the Jaffar Express hijacking in March.
The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of at least 26 passengers, including 18 security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.
“We have irrefutable evidence of involvement of some foreign hands in the devastating Jaffar Express train hostage incident, as well as countless other terrorist attacks against us in Balochistan and KP provinces of Pakistan,” the premier said at the summit.
“Those who have long used terrorism for advancing their political interests must know that the world no longer buys this fictitious narrative.”
 
 

Days after the hijacking, the military spokesperson had said India was the main sponsor “in this terrorist incident in Balochistan and others before”. In April, the Pakistan Mission to the United Nations had also said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”.
At the SCO summit, the prime minister noted: “The menace of terrorism, separatism, [and] extremism continues to pose a grave threat to Pakistan and endanger peace and security of the entire SCO region and the SCO family.
“We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with the fullest force at our command, including state terrorism in clear and ambiguous terms,” he added.
Recalling the country’s “great sacrifices in combating terrorism not only for its own self but for the region and far beyond”, PM Shehbaz reiterated that Pakistan had lost over 90,000 valuable lives and endured economic losses of over $152 billion.
“A sacrifice which has no parallel in history,” the premier said, adding that there “cannot be a bigger manifestation of our unwavering commitment to defeat terrorism with the cooperation of all SCO members and global powers around the globe”.
Afghanistan and regional connectivity
The prime minister also voiced Pakistan’s desire for a “peaceful and stable” Afghanistan, noting that it was not only in Islamabad’s interest but that of the entire region.
“While we remain engaged in building our ties with the Afghan leadership to leverage them as economic partners and good neighbours, we hope that this cooperation with Afghanistan and our trilateral meetings between China, Pakistan and Afghanistan will have positive results in times to come,” Shehbaz said.
 
 

“As SCO leaders, we have reaffirmed year after year the significance of enhanced regional connectivity. This requires efficient land, air and rail transport corridors to ensure the reliability of supply chains,” he stressed.
The premier asserted that the expansion of CPEC could serve as a “practical demonstration of SCO’s vision for regional connectivity and economic integration”.
‘Heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza’
During his address, PM Shehbaz also condemned Israel’s deadly attacks on Iran in June this year and its “heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza”.
“Israel’s unjustified aggression against our fellow brotherly member country Iran, a fellow SCO state, is condemnable and therefore unacceptable,” the prime minister said.
 
 

“The suffering and starvation unfolding in Gaza is a festering wound on our collective conscience. We reiterate our call for an immediate end to gruesome violence and heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza,” the premier said.
He underscored that Pakistan has consistently supported the UN-mandated two-state solution, which meant the creation of an independent state of Palestine with pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
Meetings with SCO leaders
PM Shehbaz also held meetings with fellow SCO leaders on the summit’s sidelines.
 






Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian condoled the prime minister on the ongoing floods in Pakistan and expressed his country’s support.
 






The two also reviewed the state of cooperation across diverse sectors and expressed satisfaction with the positive momentum in bilateral relations.
 





</p><small>2025-09-01 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01170233714c1c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938743/heads-of-state-at-tianjin-let-the-talks-begin' target='_blank'><strong>Heads of state at Tianjin — let the talks begin</strong></a><br><p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) heads of state summit underway in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin (Aug 31–Sept 1) showcases the group’s ambition to anchor what analysts describe as an ‘alternative model’ of multilateral cooperation within the rules-based World Trade Organisation (WTO) framework at a time of heightened global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.
The bloc has showcased itself at Tianjin as a ‘pillar of multipolarity’ rooted in the ‘Shanghai Spirit’ characterised by “mutual trust, equality, benefit and respect for diversity”.
The timing of the summit is crucial as the world is torn by recent wars, rising US-led trade protectionism and climate emergencies. The meeting is expected to push deeper economic and security cooperation among member states and signal the emergence of an alternative to a global order dominated by the US-led West. The gathering’s significance is underscored by its scale, as leaders from more than 20 countries and 10 international organisations are in Tianjin to attend the largest SCO summit in the alliance’s history.
 
 

Among the headline participants is Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, who has made his first trip abroad since talks with Donald Trump in Alaska earlier last month.
Equally significant is the participation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has returned to China after a seven-year hiatus amid US pressure over oil purchases from Russia and Washington’s new tariffs of 50 per cent on its goods — dubbed as “sanctions” on New Delhi.
Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, who would seek Tehran’s quest to further integrate itself into the alliance after its recent twelve-day war with Israel, is also present. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is another prominent participant, with the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres and the Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations also attending.
 
 

Born in 2001 as a six-member security bloc, the SCO now spans 26 countries — 10 full members, two observers and 14 dialogue partners — across Asia, Europe and Africa, representing 40pc of the world’s population and more than a third of global GDP. Together, India, China and Russia account for nearly $54 trillion in output, almost a third of global GDP, and exports worth $5.1tr, about one-fifth of international trade.
This year’s agenda of the SCO conference ranges from climate resilience and biodiversity protection to digital connectivity, trade facilitation and counterterrorism cooperation. Chinese officials have framed the SCO as a counterweight to what they call “hegemonism and power politics”.

‘In today’s world, outdated mindsets of hegemonism and power politics still have influence, seriously threatening world peace and stability’

At a media briefing a few days before the start of the summit, China’s assistant foreign minister, Liu Bin had, in a veiled reference to Washington, argued that solidarity and cooperation are the antidote to instability, warning that unilateralism threatens global peace. “In today’s world, outdated mindsets of hegemonism and power politics still have influence, with certain countries attempting to prioritise their own interests above others, seriously threatening world peace and stability,” he said.
SCO members support an open, transparent and inclusive multilateral system with the WTO at its core. They stress the need to strengthen stable and diversified supply chains at a moment when unilateralism and protectionism loom large. As Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar during his visit here last month, “The bloc must resist unilateralism and uphold multilateralism to remain credible.”
In fact, this kind of mindset prevalent in the western capitals is bringing SCO countries closer. For example, the fraught bilateral ties between Beijing and New Delhi — badly damaged by the deadly 2020 border clashes between the two sides — show tentative signs of thaw.
The recent decisions, like India’s resumption of tourist visas for Chinese people alongside discussions on restoring direct flights, may seem like modest steps, but they carry a lot of symbolic weight. Trump’s tariff war has nudged New Delhi closer to China, lending a new layer of significance to India’s noticeable presence in Tianjin.
The summit also highlights China’s closest regional partnerships. Pakistan remains pivotal, with both sides reaffirming plans to upgrade the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor into a “growth, livelihood, green and open corridor”.
 
 

At their sixth Strategic Dialogue last month, the two countries had pledged to expand cooperation in industry, agriculture, mining and connectivity from Gwadar Port to the realignment of the Karakoram Highway as they tighten counterterrorism coordination and continue discussions on Afghanistan’s fragile stability.
The SCO summit will likely adopt today a 10-year development strategy spanning security, trade, infrastructure and cultural exchange — clear evidence of its transformation from a security club into a multidimensional platform for governance and multipolar cooperation.
Proposals under discussion include an SCO Development Bank, local currency settlement systems and enhanced energy cooperation, all designed to reduce dependence on Western-dominated financial and energy structures.

Surrounded by mountains, Afghanistan is prone to earthquakes as it sits near the junction of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, a highly active seismic zone.
Many of the recent quakes have had shallow depths, which increased the intensity of shaking on the surface and destruction.
Here is a timeline of major earthquakes that struck the country since the Taliban returned to power in 2021 and before.
August 31, 2025: A 6.0 magnitude earthquake shook eastern Kunar province, killing more than 800 people and injuring more than 2,000 others, and flattening hundreds of houses and buildings.

October 7, 2023: A 6.3 magnitude earthquake and subsequent aftershocks in Herat province killed more than 2,000 people and injured more than 9,000. The earthquake was the country’s deadliest in years.
March 21, 2023: A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the northeastern province of Badakhshan, killing at least 13 people in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
September 5, 2022: At least eight people were killed after tremors hit Kunar province, causing dozens of houses to collapse.

June 22, 2022: A shallow, 6.1-magnitude earthquake in the eastern provinces of Paktika, Paktia, Khost, and Nangarhar killed at least 1,036 people and caused thousands of homes to collapse.
January 17, 2022: A 5.9 magnitude shallow earthquake in the western province of Badghis killed at least 26 people.
Oct 26, 2015: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake, one of the most powerful quakes in the country’s history, killed 399 in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.

Karachi’s population has crossed 20 million people, indicating the economic promise and perilous byproducts of the ambition to cash it. However, in these trials of the city’s resilience lies the immense potential for Karachi to become a model of regenerative urbanism.
Regenerative infrastructure design
Metropolitan cities must actively regenerate ecosystems disturbed through infrastructure design for long-term sustainability. For Karachi, this could mean adapting the urban environment to restore biodiversity, manage heat, and mitigate floods.
Examples include the treatment of industrial runoff and the construction of wetlands in Malir and Korangi, due to their proximity to waterways. Green corridors can be connected to urban public spaces, such as Karachi University, Safari Park, and the Malir River, to form a biodiversity belt. Using permeable paving in all public spaces could help restore aquifers and groundwater.
Greener mobility
A mobility system that prioritises people instead of vehicles is needed. Currently, private vehicles and unregulated transport rule the roads. With a poor ranking on the air quality index and extended summers, sustainable transport options like bicycles are wishful rather than practical.

Building greener, people-centric infrastructure in Karachi is possible through a range of micro and macro projects

We need pedestrian infrastructure in all major markets of the city with strict monitoring to prevent encroachments, already seen in Bohra Bazaar and Burns Road. These are isolated projects with no consideration of parking or walkways from the parking to the markets.
Shaded walkways between amenities and the market should be designed to discourage encroachments, lined with green pockets, water fountains, and mist stations.
 
 

Small solar-charged vehicles, such as e-rickshaws, e-scooters, and mini electric vans, can be used to facilitate such projects. These can also be run in campus zones such as Karachi University, NED University, or congested old town areas.
On-demand, app-based electric shuttles with dynamic routing algorithms, operating in cities like Nairobi or Jakarta, can help achieve last-mile connectivity from metro/Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) stops to homes and offices, especially in low-income neighbourhoods.
Transit-oriented development (TOD) zones surrounding the Green Line BRT and Karachi Circular Railway can include affordable housing and mixed-use buildings by rezoning land within 500-800 meters of major stations, such as Nagan Chowrangi, Orangi, Landhi, and Korangi. Low-income housing units (with social rent schemes) can be integrated into new developments to avoid gentrification.
Green public plazas, rather than concrete/paved spaces, should be used in front of malls, food streets, or even major stations. For example, the paved drop-off in front of Dolmen Mall at Seaview can be converted into a green urban space, or the space around Numaish Station can be transformed into a linear, shaded park plaza that benefits vendors and commuters. These places can also be used to host social events.
For neighbourhoods, tree canopies, solar roofs, misting fans, and designed kiosks are physical interventions that create walkable green loops with community participation, linking key spaces in an area, such as schools, clinics, neighbourhood markets, and bus stops.
 
 

Creation of small-scale economic zones around key industrial hubs (Lyari, SITE, Malir Halt) for micro-enterprise incubation, street markets, and community spaces could also be an option to boost the city’s sustainability initiatives and provide employment at the grassroots.
TOD zones can also act as decentralised utility hubs, including mini solar grids, solid waste sorting centres, and rainwater harvesting systems, which reduce the load on central systems.
Reclaiming public space
Karachi Metropolitan Corporation has restored spaces like Frere Hall, Jahangir Park, and Nishtar Park as inclusive civic hubs. Careful preservation of these spaces always enhances female/family mobility, sensitively addressing the need for safety through monitored access. Street vending should be enabled through designated spots for informal workers, encouraging female hawkers.
Environmental safety through policy and legislation:
Mandatory green walls and roofs in commercial buildings, offering tax benefits for areas with mixed businesses, especially in congested areas like Saddar and II Chundrigarh Road, is another option that can be considered, along with pocket parks in dense neighbourhoods and green sidewalks in residential neighbourhoods. The idea is to cross-subsidise such developments to solve the issue of funding, and including the people will help in maintenance.
While there are many ideas to make Karachi more habitable, the friction between bureaucratic agencies, such as SBCA, KMC, cantonment boards, and federal bodies, paralyses governance through fragmentation. In the short term, profit-driven construction, speculative real estate development, and politically backed land grabbing result in the loss of long-term projects that offer environmental and social benefits.
 
 

The political symbolism is evident in the large appreciation boards placed outside such projects, thanking those who have already been compensated for their work.
Karachi desperately needs transparent budgeting, participatory planning, and gender inclusion, as well as anti-corruption mechanisms and independent watchdogs for environmental compliance laws. Without the above being premeditated within the system, even the best of green design strategies will fail.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to NIH, the latest case was detected in a 20-month-old infant in the southern KP’s Tank district, taking the province’s total tally to 16. Fifteen of them have been detected in southern KP, according to the NIH.
Last week, the KP government launched a polio immunisation campaign, with emphasis on the south of the province, where polio teams faced the most resistance.
The latest case has taken the total cases recorded in 2025 to 24, according to NIH — including 16 from KP, six from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Noting the prevalence of polio in the south of KP, the NIH said, “A comprehensive strategic Roadmap for Polio eradication in Southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been developed and finalised.
“The plan incorporates microplanning innovations, gap analyses, and targeted strategies and interventions to address persistent challenges,” it added.
To deal with growing cases in the region, NIH stated that a campaign will be carried out in the south of the province — set to run from September 15 to 18.
Part of an immunisation campaign announced last week, the three-day drive aims to target Bannu, Bajaur and seven districts of the Dera Ismail Khan division.
In its statement, the NIH appealed to parents to cooperate with polio teams and complete their child’s immunisation course.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-09-01 11:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01145443e11c73e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938911/thousands-protest-in-indonesia-as-military-deployed-in-capital' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands protest in Indonesia as military deployed in capital</strong></a><br><p>Thousands rallied across Indonesia on Monday as the military was deployed in the capital after six people were killed in nationwide protests sparked by anger over lavish perks for lawmakers.
At least 500 protesters gathered outside the nation’s parliament in Jakarta on Monday afternoon as dozens of police officers watched on. Soldiers were present earlier but left after several hours.
Thousands more rallied in Palembang on Sumatra island and hundreds gathered separately in Banjarmasin on Borneo island, Yogyakarta on the main island of Java and Makassar on Sulawesi island, according to AFP journalists around the country.
“Our main goal is to reform the parliament. We hope the parliament will come out and meet us. We want to talk to them directly, they are our representatives,” protester and university student Nafta Keisya Kemalia, 20, told AFP outside parliament.
“Do they want to wait until we have a martial law?”
The deadly protests, which began last week over MP housing allowances nearly 10 times the minimum wage in Jakarta, have forced President Prabowo Subianto and parliament leaders to make a U-turn over the measures.
Demonstrations began peacefully, but turned violent against the nation’s elite paramilitary police unit after footage showed one of its teams running over 21-year-old delivery driver Affan Kurniawan late on Thursday.
Protests have since spread from Jakarta to other major cities, in the worst unrest since Prabowo took power.
 


Police set up checkpoints across the capital today, while officers and the military conducted city-wide patrols and deployed snipers in key locations. While the usually traffic-clogged streets were quieter than usual.
Hundreds of soldiers were camped at the city’s national monument, and some were stationed outside the presidential palace, according to an AFP journalist.
At least one group, the Alliance of Indonesian Women, said late last night that it had cancelled its planned protest because of heightened security.
Schools and universities in Jakarta were holding classes online until at least Tuesday, and civil servants based in the city were asked to work from home.
On Monday, Prabowo paid a visit to the injured police at a hospital where he criticised protesters.
“The law states that if you want to demonstrate, you must ask for permission, and permission must be granted, and it must end at 6pm,” he said.
Looting
Experts said Prabowo’s U-turn in a speech on Sunday and parliament’s gesture to revoke some lawmaker perks may not be enough to dispel the unrest.
“The Indonesian government is a mess. The cabinet and parliament will not listen to the people’s pleas,” 60-year-old snack seller Suwardi, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, told AFP near parliament.
“We have always been lied to. That’s why people are always angry. Because they never met our demands.”
The Indonesian stock index fell more than three per cent at the open on Monday after the weekend unrest rattled markets.
Deep-rooted anger against police drove protests on Friday after footage of the van hitting Affan went viral. Seven officers were detained for investigation.
On Monday, Agus Wijayanto, head of the accountability bureau at the National Police, told reporters an investigation had found criminal acts committed by two officers — the driver of the van and the officer next to him.
They “could be dishonourably discharged”, said Agus, adding their ethics trial would take place on Wednesday.
The crisis has prompted Prabowo to cancel a trip to China this week for a military parade commemorating the end of World War II.
The finance minister’s house was pillaged overnight on Saturday, and several lawmakers have reportedly had their houses ransacked.
At least three people were killed after a fire on Friday started by protesters at a council building in the eastern city of Makassar, while a fourth was killed by a mob in the city in a case of mistaken identity. Another confirmed victim was a student in Yogyakarta, who died in clashes.
In anticipation of further unrest, TikTok on Saturday suspended its live feature for “a few days” in Indonesia, where it has more than 100 million users.</p><small>2025-09-01 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01153137ae8b983.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938916/catastrophic-rains-floods-to-trigger-food-shortages-in-pakistan-warns-un' target='_blank'><strong>Catastrophic rains, floods to trigger food shortages in Pakistan, warns UN</strong></a><br><p>The ongoing torrential rains and surging floods have inundated large swaths of farmlands and destroyed ready-to-reap crops across Pakistan, triggering fears of a food crisis and inflation, the UN and growers warned on Monday.
The raging floods struck the northeastern Punjab, the country’s largest province and food basket, last week, submerging hundreds of villages, schools and health centres, washing away livestock and destroying crops, aside from killing around 50 people and triggering evacuations.
The surging floods have so far affected more than 2 million people, in addition to the evacuation of more than 700,000 people, according to official statistics.
The water is flowing further south to fall into the mighty Indus River and is feared to wreak havoc on Sindh in the coming days.
“This isn’t normal — yet it’s becoming the new normal. Monsoons, driven by climate change, now bring fear and devastation to communities across Pakistan,” Mo Yahya, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator, said in a post on X, after visiting the flood-hit areas.
 






“Flooded rice fields stretch as far as the eye can see. Farmers now face months without crops or income until the next planting season,” he said, while posting a video of flooded farmlands in Hafizabad district.
 






“This is only the beginning — more intense rains are expected in the coming weeks. As the water flows further south, it will threaten more families with displacement and destruction,” Yahya added.
“This is not just another natural disaster; this is climate change.”
Endorsing the warning, Waqar Ahmad, the secretary general of Kisan Board of Pakistan, a nationwide farmers body, said that the catastrophic floods have destroyed the three main crops of rice, sugarcane and sesame (oil-rich seeds) across Punjab.
“Rice crop has particularly taken a toll as the floods have hit the major rice-producing districts,” Rizvi told Anadolu.
According to him, 70 per cent of the standing rice crop has been destroyed by the latest floods.
 
 

He cautioned that if neighbouring India releases another deluge of floodwaters towards Pakistan, the remaining amounts of the standing crops will be badly affected.
Waheed Ahmad, the head of Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exports Association, fears that the latest floods would likely cause food inflation as massive deluges have destroyed huge amounts of crops and vegetables across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He urged the government to lift the levy on vegetable and fruit imports from Afghanistan and Iran to cope with the looming food shortages.</p><small>2025-09-01 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01142031fc11226.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938893/how-climate-change-driven-displacement-is-reshaping-pakistans-cities' target='_blank'><strong>How climate change-driven displacement is reshaping Pakistan’s cities</strong></a><br><p>“We left our village and came to Karachi when the floods destroyed everything. But here, surviving is a constant struggle,” lamented Abrar, 62, seated outside his house in Tent City, Hawkesbay.
His house and that of other flood victims are made of fabric, bamboo and other scraps that the migrants have assembled to create a semblance of shelter. The Tent City was established as part of the state’s response to manage and relocate displaced people across Karachi after catastrophic floods hit Sindh, first in 2010 and then in 2022, when 33 million people lost their homes to the deluge that submerged one-third of the country.
Internal displacement has today become a predominant form of forced migration across the globe. Internally displaced people are particularly vulnerable, and this is contingent on the complex linkages between migration and gender, economic distress, conflict, violence, and climate crisis impacts.
Most of the displaced people across the world are situated in hot regions, such as Pakistan, and, like Abrar, live in poor quality shelters with limited access to health services, which puts them at a high risk of exposure to extreme heat.
Pakistan is now one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, according to the Climate Risk Index 2025. The intersection of climate change and internal displacement presents a complex array of challenges, both immediate and long-term term for cities and for the people who are forced to migrate to them.

At the same time, it also adds to the ongoing infrastructural, economic, and demographic challenges in cities like Karachi, already brimming with a population of over 25 million. These challenges are deeply interwoven across environmental, socio-economic, governance and infrastructure domains.
According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), there have been over 24.3 million internal displacements between 2009 and 2023, due to 107 disaster events — droughts, wildfires, wet mass movements and floods — in Pakistan. Floods alone have accounted for 24.1 million of such displacements.
Both the 2010 and 2022 floods triggered extensive displacements and migrations from rural to urban areas, Karachi being a major recipient here in Sindh. Even though there is no clear-cut data on displacement and the resulting migration induced by heatwaves, urban heat islands are, nevertheless, exacerbating the vulnerability of displaced people as they endeavour to adapt to new urban environments.
The long road from rural to urban
In Sindh, frequent and intense flooding, coupled with the deterioration of the Indus River Delta system, droughts and water scarcity, have triggered large-scale migrations of rural-agrarian populations into cities such as Karachi, Hyderabad, and Jacobabad, where basic services are already stretched.
There are several critical challenges that emerge from these dynamics and are particularly relevant to Sindh and Balochistan. The most fundamental challenge is the absence of robust climate information systems and the dearth of resilient infrastructures, both of which can easily compound displaced people’s vulnerability.
Furthermore, given the weak coordination between national and local governments, the process for receiving, managing and reintegrating or resettling displaced people is often poorly managed or is ad hoc. The absence of a centralised registry, policy and planning framework further exacerbates these challenges.
 
 

One challenge that is often overlooked is the overcrowding of informal settlements, which largely takes place when displaced families end up living in informal or low-income settlements. In Karachi, these are typically situated along the coast, such as Ibrahim Hyderi, Rehri Goth and Lath Basti, or in peri-urban areas such as Sindhabad and Tent City Hawkesbay, where infrastructure services are largely absent.
Hence, there is increased strain on housing, water, sanitation, healthcare and transport. This can generate tensions between new migrants and the older communities that host them. Some of the migrants who arrived in Karachi after the 2022 floods perceived a difference in terms of how they were welcomed and accommodated.

“I feel like the people of Karachi have not accepted us with an open heart this time; not the way they did many of those who arrived after the floods in 2010,” said a resident at the Tent City.
This issue is intensified by the ongoing challenge of tenure security, whereby displaced people risk being evicted when they — unknowingly or otherwise — squat on public land to build shelter. Consequently, they are forced to navigate risks at various scales.
The missing piece of the puzzle
The challenges do not end here. The difficulties mentioned above intersect with existing gaps in data on displaced people migrating to urban centres. Even though migrants are documented in various surveys by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), these documents often fail to capture the scale of migration that has grown due to the impacts of the climate crisis.
For instance, the Labour Force Survey lists the causes of migration as either economic (including job transfer, searching for a job or better agricultural land, business, etc); social (education, health, marriage, who they migrated with, change or residence, etc); security/law & order situation; natural disaster; and ‘other’. However, the climate change-related disaster category is not disaggregated into what types or for how long ago.
Similarly, the Pakistan Social & Living Standard Measurement Survey (PSLM) lists only the proportion of migrant vs non migrant populations across the country, but not the causes of migration. In fact, it defines a migrant as someone who is ‘born in one district and at the time of interview living [sic] in another district’.
The national Census 2023 is less clear: the reasons for migration include job/ business, education, marriage, with family, back to home, and others. Even though, as a census, it is meant to capture such information, there is no coverage given to climate-induced displacement and the resulting migration. Thus, data-wise, it is difficult to gauge the impact of climate change-induced migrations on demographics, labour, and urban indicators.
There are also gaps in the decentralisation of service provision whereby local governments in cities such as Karachi lack the authority, resources, or at times the legal mandate to manage post-disaster migration flows effectively.
This creates a vacuum that philanthropists, NGOs or charitable organisations often fill by deploying their own models of service delivery in certain neighbourhoods, rather than in districts as a whole, simply because they don’t possess the capacity that the state holds.
Post-resettlement challenges
In the broader landscape of city and regional planning across Pakistan, urban planners hardly engage with the increasingly critical issue of integrating climate adaptation, displacement, and migration flows in terms of how these will shape development plans, especially the availability of shelter, jobs, health services and land.
Across Pakistan’s cities, economic marginalisation and livelihood insecurity feed into displaced people’s lives. They are often forced to rely on precarious, low-wage, undocumented jobs that offer no social protection. At most, they take up menial labour tasks, vending, or unskilled construction work.
“Ghurbat bohot hai idhar (there is a lot of poverty here),” explained Abdul, who lives at the Tent City. “Many people beg on the roads; others work as labourers; some women sell bangles. We used to be respectable farmers, but we have been forced to become beggars.”
 
 

Abdul’s story echoed through the weak walls of most of the houses at the settlement, showing how the loss of rural livelihoods — caused by climate change — is rarely offset by comparable opportunities in urban centres.
Moreover, there are significant mental health and social stress-associated challenges that displacement often triggers. These manifest in different ways for men, women, children and the elderly. Even though displaced people who migrate to cities often adapt to their new urban environments, the process also generates adverse experiences, intergenerational trauma, and compounded vulnerabilities — children miss out on education, play spaces, and can be exposed to malnutrition.
On the other hand, displaced women might be more exposed to the effects of extreme heat that could impact nutrition due to the absence of safe and clean water that is essential for hydration, cooking and hygiene. This risk is even more pronounced if they are breastfeeding and responsible for household chores, with exposure to heat sources.
These conditions then give way to long-term health consequences such as chronic kidney diseases, gastrointestinal illnesses and adverse effects on the body’s thermoregulation abilities. Furthermore, floods and extreme heat amplify existing urban inequalities, with migrants being hit the hardest due to the inadequate provision of safe shelter, location in flood-prone or heat-intensified zones, and lack of health services, insurance, credit, or safety nets.
Effective governance of displaced people requires, at the bare minimum, a recognition by the state of the complexities of climate-change-induced displacement, in addition to the problems encountered during phases of post-resettlement to a temporary or even a permanent site.
The case of Sindhabad
The aforementioned issues are on show in Sindhabad, an informal settlement located near the Karachi-Hyderabad Super Highway. It has served as a place of refuge for displaced people who migrated to Karachi during the 2010 and 2022 floods.
Typically, people here live in makeshift shelters and with limited access to water, sanitation, electricity, primary healthcare and education. According to the residents, they convinced PBS representatives who were conducting census surveys around their neighbourhood in 2023 to include their settlement in the assessment.

Today, Sindhabad has a population of 152,381, with an average family size of five persons per household. Given that, on average, families have three children, there are approximately 91,428 children out of school in the locality.
The problems of inaccessible infrastructure are pervasive, which often leads to violent outcomes as residents navigate a precarious route to access water.
“Here, you have to sacrifice your life just to get water,” said Preeti, 45.
“Two years ago, we lost our daughter because she was crossing the highway to get water. A speeding truck hit her and her friend … my daughter died on the spot, and her friend was disabled,“ the grief-stricken mother recalled.
Preeti’s words reveal the brutal reality that displaced people must face at times, compelled to find water as they adapt in perilous environments where essential services are often absent or located far away.
Thinking about effective policy
Despite these glaring ground realities, there is limited solid data available at the urban level on internal displacement and the ensuing migration driven by climate crisis impacts in Pakistan.
Local governments often rely on voluntary registrations, making targeted planning and relief provision difficult across cities. There is limited disaggregation by gender, age, ethnicity or vulnerability levels, and the absence of integrated data systems between agencies such as the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and urban planning departments.
 
 

Even though a positive step has been taken at the national level in terms of establishing a Global Climate-Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC) in Islamabad, which is dedicated to producing research on Pakistan, there is still an urgent need for clear-cut, cohesive interventions for policy action.
Here are some necessary actions, at the bare minimum, to tackle the challenge of climate-change-induced internal displacement and migration for immediate as well as long-term planning for Pakistan’s cities.

Legal and institutional framework: develop a national framework for climate change-driven displacement and migration, and recognise the different kinds of climate migrants. Develop a spatial database of migrant populations disaggregated by socio-demographic indicators, for relief purposes
Urban planning and adaptation: strengthen urban planning with climate adaptation and inclusive zoning, including resumption of work on the Internal Migration Policy and introducing District-level Climate Action Plans
Housing and basic services: invest in climate-resilient housing and services in informal settlements, learning from and enhancing already existing practices and materials
Data and monitoring: improve data collection on internal displacement and establish mandatory climate migration registration in all host cities

Every year, many young Pakistanis leave the country via illegal routes in hopes of better employment opportunities. A 2023 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the European Union (EU) found that 24,000 Pakistanis entered EU countries illegally over the past three years.
The network, called — Pakistan United Nations Network on Migration (UNNM) — was inaugurated at a ceremony in Islamabad and aims to develop a “unified, collaborative approach to migration governance”, the press release said.
The UNNM will focus on “responding to the interconnected challenges of human trafficking and migrant smuggling” within international frameworks such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDGs) and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM).
The GCM is “the first intergovernmental agreement to cover all dimensions of international migration,” according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
In light of the network, Pakistan’s first Migration Multi-Partner Trust Fund programme (MMPTF) was formed, with special emphasis on combating Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants in Pakistan.
The IOM describes Trafficking in Persons as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion.”
While Smuggling of Migrants means “materially profiting by procuring another person’s illegal border crossing”, according to the IOM.
 
 

Established to support the implementation of GCM, the initiative will be run “jointly by IOM and UNODC in collaboration with the Government of Pakistan, the private sector, the media, and civil society,” the press release said.
Speaking at the ceremony, UN Resident Coordinator Mohamed Yahya, who was also the host of the event, said, “The establishment of this network is a testament to our collective resolve to ensure that migration is safe, orderly, and regular.”
Mohamed Yahya was appointed as the network’s chair.
He went on to say that the establishment of a network “provides a crucial platform to shift the narrative on migration, amplify a unified voice, and foster the innovation needed to address complex challenges related to mobility and protecting the rights of all people on the move”.
As per the press release, the MMPTF will employ a “whole of government” and “a whole of society” approach to tackle human trafficking, migrant smuggling, and improve the methods of migration governance.
“Life makes us move. But journeys, either from our home to new destinations or back to our country, should become easier, more dignified,” said Moazzam Ali, a Pakistani migrant who voluntarily returned to Pakistan from Romania.
“The network will leverage partnerships across the UN system to promote policy coherence and integrate migration policies into the broader development goals,” the press release added.
Head of the UN Migration Network Secretariat Jonathan Prentice, who joined the meeting via video, congratulated Pakistan on playing a role in the “global collective to help improve migration governance in the world”.
The ceremony featured a panel discussion as well, titled — ‘Enhancing whole-of-government migration governance in the age of complex mobility dynamics and emerging global challenges’ — with panellists including representatives from governmental departments.</p><small>2025-09-01 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/011108231e00b7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938881/crew-of-5-dead-as-army-helicopter-crashes-in-gbs-chilas-due-to-technical-fault-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Crew of 5 dead as army helicopter crashes in GB’s Chilas due to ‘technical fault’: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A crew of five died on Monday after an army helicopter crashed in Diamer District’s Chilas town in Gilgit-Baltistan after developing a “technical fault”, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
“On 1 Sep 25, at around 1000 hours, an MI-17 helicopter crash landed near Hudor village, approximately 12 kilometres away from Thakdas Cantonment,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in the statement. “The helicopter was on routine training flying when it developed a technical fault and crashed.”
It added that all crew members on board were martyred as a result of the crash.
The crew members were identified as Major Atif, who was the pilot in command, Major Faisal, the co-pilot, flight engineer Naib Subedar Maqbool, and crew chiefs Havaldar Jahangir and Naik Amir, according to the ISPR.
Earlier, Diamer Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed, in a statement, had confirmed the incident, saying that the helicopter was conducting a test landing on a newly proposed helipad when it crashed.
He said that the Diamer police and rescue teams had reached the incident site to start the evacuation.
Separately, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, in a statement, said he had issued directions to impose an emergency at Chilas Hospital and ordered the immediate availability of medical staff.
He also expressed his condolences and paid tribute to the martyred personnel. “The sacrifice of the martyrs of the helicopter crash is a source of pride for the nation,” he said.
Earlier this month, a rescue helicopter crashed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, killing two pilots and three crew members. The helicopter was dispatched with supplies following flash flooding in the region.
In 2024, at least six people died and eight others were critically injured after a helicopter of a petroleum company crashed near the Shewa oil field in North Waziristan.</p><small>2025-09-01 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0110420799f249f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938766/flood-prone-housing-schemes-along-ravi-rife-with-irregularities' target='_blank'><strong>‘Flood-prone’ housing schemes along Ravi rife with irregularities</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The area declared as “prone to floods” by the Punjab irrigation department is rife with violation of rules and regulations, absence of requisite infrastructure as well as weak enforcement led to the massive devastation in private housing schemes along a long stretch of River Ravi in Lahore.
The rules defined for the approval of private housing schemes by various authorities are either not being implemented or enforced when it comes to the area prone to floods.
In recent days, billions of rupees of residents have been lost in various housing schemes and katchi abadis after floodwater entered their houses and business premises. This area comes under the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project being executed along a 46km long stretch of Ravi by the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda).
There is also a disparity in the approval mechanism between different authorities, especially Ruda. The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) follows the Private Housing Scheme Rules 2014 (updated), under which (rule-7) says the land proposed for any housing scheme or land subdivision cannot be approved if it doesn’t fulfill certain requirements. One of them is that the land must be out of the flood-prone area. The tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) also follow the same rules in areas within their jurisdictions.

Disparity muddies the water in different authorities’ approval mechanisms

But on the other hand, Ruda — an authority having territorial jurisdiction carved out in 2020 by the then PTI-led government covering a 46km stretch along the river with 132,000 acres and 960 sq-km land — interprets its Ruda Private Housing Scheme Rules 2021 differently. However, it has the same conditions for the approval of housing schemes as the LDA or TMAs.
 
 

“It is very confusing that Ruda may accord approval to housing schemes in flood-prone zones without an NOC from the irrigation department. But the LDA and TMAs don’t approve schemes if its land exists in flood-prone regions identified by the irrigation department,” wonders an official source in the Punjab government.
The recent flooding in various housing schemes approved by Ruda shows that if its own rules were followed in true letter and spirit, the massive devastation seen in various approved and unapproved housing schemes could have been averted.
“I think Ruda’s focus is on approving and regulating housing schemes instead of on one of its most important jobs i.e. building river training works, embankments, barrages, river channelisation among others. In my opinion, Ruda should have developed the aforementioned infrastructure first and then accorded approval to housing schemes,” deplores an officer, who requested not to be named.
“I am really surprised as to how the housing schemes in Ruda, which already exist in the flood plains as per the irrigation department, can be developed,” he said. He also criticised LDA and TMA for keeping mum on the mushroom growth of housing schemes, mostly illegal, in the flood-prone areas near Ravi before the existence of Ruda. “Why had the LDA and TMAs failed to stop such malpractice?” he questioned.
However, an LDA officer, on the condition of anonymity, claimed the authority had taken stern action against illegal housing schemes. “We took very serious action against various housing schemes in the past. These included declining approval for illegally extending portion of a housing scheme on the Multan Road. Similarly, we carried out several demolition operations in another illegal housing scheme near Chuhng on Multan Road,” he argued.
A spokesperson of Ruda, when contacted, said, “Ruda, having land in Lahore and Sheikhupura, inherited as many as 103 illegal housing schemes and land subdivisions from LDA and the TMAs. Besides these there were some other schemes that already had approval for a phase or the initial piece of land measuring 100, 200, 300 kanals, but hadn’t obtained approval for their extensions. Such societies developed extensions unlawfully that showed weak enforcement by their then regulators”.
When asked about development of housing schemes in the area prone to flooding, he claimed that the ongoing river training works and embankments would completely eliminate the risks of floods. He said the authority also bound developers to ensure construction of flood protection embankments on their before giving them the final approval.
On the question of giving approvals to housing schemes without the NOC from the irrigation department, the spokesman said, “There is no need for an NOC from the irrigation department as the authority gives approval as per its master plan that guarantees safeguards from floods.”
The spokesperson said that despite Ruda inheriting already existing housing schemes, its teams were doing their best to regulate all of them. Several illegally developed schemes have huge populations that could not be relocated due to various legal, administrative and livelihood issues.
When asked why Ruda focused on according approvals instead of focusing on quickly completing river training works to mitigate floods, he said that the river training works had already been completed in a 7km area onward from Ravi Syphon. He claimed, “You can see that wherever we completed our works, the flood didn’t affect anyone”. The fees received from housing scheme developers were being spent on the ongoing development works in Ravi, he added.
To another question, he said enforcement teams had carried out several operations in the Ruda project area against illegal housing schemes. He claimed that when Ruda’s flood adaptation work was completed, the remaining area would be completely safe.
Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Communications Aleem Khan, who has been under fire after his housing scheme — the ParkView Housing society — was flooded from Ravi, released a video on social media on the issue. He said that he acquired the housing scheme through a bank auction in 2010 along with all the NOCs and approvals from relevant government bodies, including LDA as Ruda was established later.
 






He also criticised Ruda for not completing the barrages, embankments and other protective structures in the area. He said that it was Ruda’s responsibility to safeguard the area from floods. He said the authority charged housing societies for building protective structures.
He claimed that despite collecting all the charges, Ruda had not made a single road, embankment, lake or barrage in the area.According to former LDA chief engineer Dr Habib ul Haq Randhawa, who also specialises in environmental sciences, river routes whether old or new should not be blocked through urban development, commercial regeneration or for any purpose whatsoever. During normal flow, he said, a river could be temporarily diverted with the help of embankments.
“But extreme flooding will damage such structures, besides increasing the intensity of the flood. Therefore, we should refrain from all kind of developments in the river-influenced areas which are prone to flooding even only once a decade,” Dr Randhawa said while talking to Dawn.
“In the river routes adjacent to cities, a delicate relationship exists between humans and the ecosystem. Government agencies should only allow sustainable town planning having the least impact on the river ecosystem and its flow,” he said.
He suggested to conduct a comprehensive report delineating each riverbed and flood influence. He said intensive plantation should be done in the vacant riverbeds as it curbed flash flooding from the rivers. “The riverbeds must have margins wide enough to grow and shrink without endangering the population. Native vegetation and classic riparian forests should be grown there. These steps help to reduce the waterflow and flooding,” Mr Randhawa said.

The 13th edition of the women’s showpiece 50-over tournament will begin on Sept 30. Pakistan is set to play its matches in Sri Lanka following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy earlier this year, which resulted in a “hybrid model” being decided upon.
The overall prize money at the eight-team marquee tournament totals $13.88 million — a monumental rise of 297 per cent from $3.5m at the last edition held in New Zealand in 2022, ICC said in a statement.
The total prize pot eclipses that at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup from two years ago in India, which had total prize money of $10 million.
“The announcement aligns with ICC’s strategy to amplify the growth of women’s cricket and a decision to introduce pay parity was announced ahead of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2024,” ICC said.
 






The winners of the 13th edition of the Women’s Cricket World Cup will receive prize money of $4.48 million — a 239pc increase from the $1.32m awarded to Australia in 2022.
“Meanwhile, the runners-up will receive $2.24m, an increase of 273pc in comparison to the $600,000 England won three years ago. The two losing semi-finalists will take home $1.12m (up from $300,000 in 2022) each.
Each group stage participant is guaranteed to earn $250,000 while each group-stage win will get the victors $34,314.
In the second half of the final table, the teams finishing fifth and sixth will take home $700,000 each and those in seventh and eighth place will earn $280,000.
“This announcement marks a defining milestone in the journey of women’s cricket,“ ICC Chairman Jay Shah said.
“This four-fold increase in prize money is a landmark moment for women’s cricket and reflects our clear commitment to its long-term growth.

“Our message is simple, women cricketers must know they will be treated on par with men if they choose this sport professionally.

“The uplift underscores our ambition to deliver a world-class ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup and to inspire the next generation of players and fans.
“Women’s cricket is on a remarkable upward trajectory, and with this step we are confident the momentum will accelerate.
“We call upon all stakeholders, fans, media, partners, and Member Boards, to join us in championing the women’s game and ensuring it receives the recognition and respect it deserves.”</p><small>2025-09-01 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01095053a766292.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938835/floods-will-keep-45-lahore-schools-shut-after-holidays' target='_blank'><strong>Floods will keep 45 Lahore schools shut after holidays</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: While announcing the reopening of all other schools in Lahore on Monday (today) after the summer vacations, the District Education Authority (DEA) Lahore said that 45 schools will remain closed due to flooding or their current use as flood relief camps.
The schools that will remain closed are primarily located in severely flood-impacted areas, including Shahdara, Saggian, Maraka, Chung, Manga, and Bund Road.
The affected institutions include 33 government schools, three schools managed by the Punjab Education Foundation (PEF), one school under the Punjab Education Initiative Management Authority (PEIMA-PSSP), and eight private schools, according to an order issued by the deputy commissioner.
Temporary closure also affects specific institutions, including Government Higher Secondary School Maraka Quarter, Government High School Shahdara Mor Farakh Abad, Government Higher Secondary School Niaz Baig, and Government Central Model School No. 2 Rattigan Road.
Private institutions in the Tehsil Raiwind area, including British Grammar School, The Heaven School System, and Dar-e-Arqam Manga Mandi, will also remain shut.

In the tournament being played as warm-up ahead of the Asia Cup — which starts Sept. 9 — Pakistan have started with thrashings of Afghanistan and UAE thanks to a number of players chipping in with impactful contributions.
After seasoned pacer Haris Rauf and skipper Salman Ali Agha led Pakistan to a 39-run win over Afghanistan in the opener, Saim Ayub and Hasan Nawaz himself scored half centuries each to see the side down UAE by 31 runs.
The UAE fixture saw Pakistan cross the 200-mark as Hasan Nawaz launched a late onslaught after opener Saim Ayub had set the stage. Experienced fast bowler Hasan Ali then wrapped up the proceedings with 3-47 as UAE’s Asif Khan’s blistering 77 off 35 went in vain.
Under white-ball head coach Mike Hesson, Pakistan are building up to next year’s T20 World Cup without now discarded senior pros Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan and Hasan Nawaz said the young team was prepared for the upcoming challenges.
“You see the youngsters in front of you, all of them work very hard, even in the off-season,” he told reporters after the match on Saturday.
“I honestly feel this is Pakistan’s best T20 team … the plan is to win the tri-series and then, god-willing, the Asia Cup as well.”
 






Hasan Nawaz, coming in at number six, smashed 56 off 26 – a knock studded with six sixes and two fours – to boost Pakistan to 207. For the Layyah-born right-hander, his freedom to go big came due to Saim’s knock for 69 off 38 (seven fours and four sixes).
“In the beginning, Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan had already set the tone,” he said.

“So, my mindset was that we should now aim for a bigger target. There wasn’t much time to settle, so the plan was to cross 200. I just played according to that plan.”

Pakistan shuffled their bowling line-up to bring in Hasan Ali and Salman Mirza in place of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris — the latter duo having played against Afghanistan.
Hasan Nawaz said the changes pointed towards a changing culture, where no players are considered second choice.
“I don’t see it as ‘bench strength’ because for me, all our players are equal,” noted the 23-year-old.
“Hasan Ali, for example, is a senior player — you can’t call him ‘bench strength’.
Pakistan’s will face Afghanistan again in their third tri-series match on Thursday. The tournament’s final is set for Sept. 7.

The report, published by the government on Monday, said photo-based age estimation products were broadly accurate, fast and privacy-respecting but noted worsening results for people near the age minimum of 16.
The findings foreshadow a mixed experience once the ban takes effect in December: Caucasians three years over the age cut-off can expect minimal disruption, but non-Caucasians and teenage girls face challenges.
The experience may also be more complicated for social media platforms from Meta’s META.O Instagram to Alphabet’s GOOGL.O YouTube, which, under the law, must show they are taking reasonable steps to block users under 16 or face a fine of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million).
The trial found high accuracy for people over 19, but those up to three years on either side of the cut-off were in a “grey zone where system uncertainty is higher”.
Users aged 16 had an 8.5 per cent chance of being estimated as underage, so they might need to be “diverted to supplementary assurance methods, such as ID-based verification or parental consent”, the report said.
“While systems generally performed well across diverse user groups, some showed reduced accuracy for older adults, non-Caucasian users and female-presenting individuals near policy thresholds,” the report added.
Social media experts said the report raised questions about whether the ban could work in three months.
“It seems like there are a lot of variations in accuracy,” said Justine Humphry, a media researcher at the University of Sydney who specialises in online safety.
“That variation is concerning, with the tight schedule for the introduction of a system that will need to be robust and working by the end of this year,” she added.
Communications minister Anika Wells said the report proved that “while there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to age assurance, this trial shows there are many effective options and importantly that user privacy can be safeguarded”.</p><small>2025-09-01 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01095305b5a7959.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938871/alcaraz-djokovic-stroll-into-us-open-quarter-finals-as-sabalenka-cruises' target='_blank'><strong>Alcaraz, Djokovic stroll into US Open quarter-finals as Sabalenka cruises</strong></a><br><p>Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic motored into the quarter-finals of the US Open on Sunday as reigning women’s champion Aryna Sabalenka kept her title defence firmly on track.
Spanish second seed Alcaraz and tennis icon Djokovic — who are on course to meet in the semi-finals — both recorded straight-sets wins on the Arthur Ashe Stadium main court.
Five-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz overpowered France’s Arthur Rinderknech 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, 6-4 and has not dropped a set to date at the championships.
 






“I think my style of tennis suits pretty well the energy here in New York,” the 22-year-old said.
“The energy is special playing the day session, playing the night session.
It doesn’t matter, people are always there. I love it and I think that’s why I play my best tennis here,” he added.
Alcaraz will face Czech 20th seed Jiri Lehecka in the quarter-finals on Tuesday.
Lehecka reached the last eight of a Grand Slam for only the second time after battling past veteran Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, winning 7-6 (7/4), 6-4, 2-6, 6-2.
Djokovic, 38, continued his latest bid for a record 25th Grand Slam singles title with a brisk 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 defeat of unseeded German Jan-Lennard Struff.
“It definitely helps if you serve well. I think I had a great serving performance last round and also tonight,” said Djokovic.
“That helps make it easier on the court.” Djokovic faces a quarter-final on Tuesday against fourth seed Taylor Fritz, the lone American man left in the draw.
 






Fritz sprinted into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 defeat of the Czech Republic’s Tomas Machac in 1hr 38min.
Fritz is carrying hopes of being the first US men’s Grand Slam champion since Andy Roddick in 2003 following the exits of fellow seeds Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe.
But Fritz will head into his quarter-final against Djokovic with history stacked against him. Djokovic has won all 10 of their past meetings, including a 2023 quarter-final win at the US Open.
“I think the first, almost like seven or eight times I played him, I probably just wasn’t a good enough player to really have that much of a chance,” said Fritz.
“I think only the last couple times we’ve played I think I’ve been this just better player that can, you know, I’d say compete and have chances.”
Sabalenka balance
In the women’s draw, Sabalenka never looked troubled in a 6-1, 6-4 defeat of Moldova-born Spaniard Cristina Bucsa, ranked 95th in the world.
Sabalenka has now reached the quarter-finals or better at 12 straight Grand Slam tournaments, a consistency she attributes to striking a balance in her life on and off the court.
“I’m super proud, I think that’s an incredible achievement,” Sabalenka said.
“I think for me the key was balancing on and off-the-court life. I think I’ve done a great job on balancing really hard work and also great recovery and some fun time outside of tennis court. I think that’s been the key.”
Sabalenka faces a quarter-final against the Czech Republic’s Marketa Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, who upset ninth seed Elena Rybakina 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 in the late game on Arthur Ashe.
In other women’s draw action on Sunday, another Czech, unseeded former French Open and Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova, conjured a remarkable escape to oust Taylor Townsend, saving an incredible eight match points before digging out a 1-6, 7-6 (15/13), 6-3 victory.
 






Krejcikova fought off a match point on her own serve at 5-4 down in the second set, and then somehow survived seven match points in an enthralling tie-breaker to move on.
“What a match,” said Krejcikova, who revealed she had wondered if she would ever play tennis again after missing the opening months of the season with a back injury.

“I was sidelined for six months and didn’t know if I would ever play again.
I’m super happy I can be here.”

Krejcikova will face American fourth seed Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals.
Pegula, beaten in the final last year, advanced to the last eight after breezing past compatriot Ann Li 6-1, 6-2 on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court.</p><small>2025-09-01 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/010926477b814f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938837/pakistan-suspends-mail-to-us-amid-tariff-hike' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan suspends mail to US amid tariff hike</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: More than 25 countries of the world, including Pakistan, have temporarily suspended mail delivery to the United States after the US imposed new taxes and duties.
Because of this situation, the Pakistan Post has also stopped delivering booked mail to the US because it fears it will be returned under the new US rules.
The US government has suspended the previous duty-free facility under an executive order number 14324 on July 25. The US move has severely affected postal communications to the US worldwide because now all types of mail delivery to the US will have to pay duties and taxes under the new system.
 
 

All major countries of the world, including China, the UK, Japan. Austria, Australia, New Zealand, India, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, have temporarily stopped mail delivery to the US because airlines have also shown their inability to deliver mail.
The countries hit by the US move have taken up the matter with the US through the Universal Postal Union, a UN agency, which is taking steps to resolve the dispute.

LAHORE: The overflowing Che­nab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers have displaced more than two million people across 2,200 villages since Aug 23, while Sindh braces for what officials warn could be a “super flood” as mas­sive inflows from Punjab move downstream.
Rescue and relief operations are underway on an unprecedented scale in Punjab, where the Provincial Disa­ster Management Authority (PDMA) has warned that the next 48 hours are critical. In Sindh, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has cautioned that inflows of nearly one million cusecs could threaten barrages and inundate vast swathes of land, endangering more than 200,000 people.
The Punjab PDMA has warned that the next two days are critical, as heavy rainfall in India’s Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh catchment areas is expected to push additional floodwaters into Pakistan.
Officials fear that if India releases an additional 300,000 cusecs into the Sutlej, areas around Lahore and its outskirts could face massive devastation. Already, localities such as Mohlanwal on Multan Road have been inundated, forcing emergency evacuations as water entered residential homes.
Monsoon rains over the past week swelled the three major rivers that cut through Punjab. The flooded rivers have affected mostly rural areas near their banks, but heavy rain also flooded urban areas, including several parts of Lahore. While South Asia’s seasonal monsoon brings rainfall that farmers depend on, climate change is making the phenomenon more erratic, and deadly, across the region.
Landslides and floods triggered by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains have killed more than 850 people nationwide since June.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia confirmed that very high to exceptionally high floods are expected to persist in the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala, while the Chenab at Trimmu and Panjnad is likely to attain exceptionally high flood levels through Sept 3.
Addressing the media, the PDMA chief said the situation regarding the release of water from Indian dams has been sensitive and all relevant departments remained alert.
He said the Indus Water Commission, the NDMA and all departments remained active and they spoke with the Indian Commission regarding the Sutlej water.
The Indian Commission did not give any official update regarding the release of water from the Salal Dam, he said.
The decision to conduct breaches in the flood dykes was taken to save populated areas, he said, adding that the Sutlej River caused more destruction in Kasur.
He said the Punjab Irrigation Department had managed the flow of Sutlej water. There is an expected flow of 253,000 cusecs there, which will further decrease at the Kasur point and there will be more water at Head Islam and Vehari.
 
 

Mr Kathia said that when the water reaches the Panjnad at Ali Pur, there will be a flow of over 900,000 cusecs, and a flow of 1.1 million cusecs is expected to enter Sindh.
Water flow
According to data released by the Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) at 11pm on Sunday, the flow at Marala Headworks on the Chenab River was recorded at 114,550 cusecs (falling trend), while Khanki Headworks was at 154,339 cusecs (steady trend).
The flow at Qadirabad Headworks stood at 154,865 cusecs (steady trend). At the Chiniot Bridge, the flow was 209,457 cusecs (falling trend).
A significant concern was Trimmu Headworks, where the flow was in the “very high flood” category at 479,743 cusecs but was falling.
On the River Ravi, the flow was 479,743 cusecs at Jassar, 69,780 at Shahdara, 179,730 (very high) at Balloki, and 50,158 at Sidhnai.
As for the Sutlej River, the flow at Ganda Singh Wala was in “exceptionally high flood” at 253,068 cusecs. The flow was 134,970 at Sulemanki Headworks and 69,730 cusecs at Islam Headworks.
The key point of observation is the Panjnad Headworks, where the flow was normal at 87,564 cusecs at 11pm but was rising.
Death toll rises to 33
PDMA’s latest Flood Situation Report revealed that 33 people lost their lives and eight others were injured due to high floods in the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers from Aug 23 to 31.
According to the report, 2,066,785 people of 2,222 mouzas were affected and 506 relief camps were established to provide shelter to 10,654 people in the province. As many as 352 medical camps were established, in which 17,853 people were treated.
The rescue teams evacuated 760,424 people and 516,258 animals and transported them to safe locations. Veterinary services are being provided through 331 camps.
Meanwhile, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik said on Sunday that recent rains and flash floods have claimed 850 lives and left more than 1,150 people injured across the country.
Speaking to the media alongside Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, the NDMA chief said that over 600,000 people were relocated to safer areas during the flooding, and thousands of livestock were also rescued across the country.
He said the final monsoon spell is expected in the first 10 days of September, with heavy rainfall likely in eastern Punjab, Azad Kashmir and nearby regions.
Over 2m displaced
Climate Minister Musadik Malik told the briefing that nearly 2m people have been displaced across the country, mostly in Punjab, due to devastating floods, warning that the brunt of the crisis is falling on the country’s poorest families.
“Our first, second and third priority is around the 800,000 poorest people who do not have wealthy relatives to rely on and are in dire need of aid,” Mr Malik told the media.
He urged the nation to stand with the poor. “If there is any NGO in your area or if you personally can help a displaced family, please do so,” he emphasised.
Mr Malik pointed to Punjab’s geography, where five rivers converge, as a challenge, warning that the Panjnad system could face flows as high as 3m cusecs if conditions worsen.
Earlier, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb also confirmed that over 2m people have been affected by floods in Punjab. Of them, nearly 750,000 have been safely evacuated, Ms Aurangzeb said, calling it the “largest evacuation operation in the country’s history”.
UN delegation visits flood-hit Sialkot
Meanwhile, a United Nations delegation led by Resident Coordinator Dr Muhammad Ahmad Yahya visited the flood-affected areas of Sialkot to assess damage and distribute aid.
Accompanied by local officials, including Deputy Commissioner Saba Asghar Ali, Additional Deputy Commissioner General Ayub Bukhari, and Regional Director of Rescue 1122, Syed Kamal Abid, the eight-member delegation embarked on a tour.
They spent two hours visiting the flood-hit areas, including Kot Dasu and Daska, using Rescue 1122 boats. During their visit, they provided rations, ready-to-eat food and drinking water to people impacted by the floodwaters.
“The United Nations stands with the people of Pakistan in this difficult time,” Dr Yahya said.
Sindh braces for ‘super flood’
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said the provincial government had devised a comprehensive plan to deal with the looming “super flood” — a term used when inflows reach 900,000 cusecs or more.
On Sunday, the chief minister visited the Guddu and Sukkur barrages, where he was briefed by the PDMA and other officials regarding flood preparations and relief measures.
He told the media that inflows from Trimmu would reach Sindh in about five days via Panjnad.
He said that in 2010, inflows of 1.1 million cusecs had passed from the Guddu Barrage. “This time, even 900,000 to one million cusecs would be extremely challenging. If inflows remain limited, losses will be manageable, but crops may still not survive,” he said.
Mr Shah said the provincial government’s foremost priority was to protect human lives and livestock, followed by safeguarding the Guddu, Sukkur and Kotri barrages.
“We know exactly which areas will be affected at different water levels — 500,000 to 700,000 cusecs, 700,000 to 900,000, or even beyond. If inflows cross 900,000 cusecs, over 200,000 people may be impacted,” he warned.
He noted that Sindh’s terrain poses greater risks than Punjab’s. “In Punjab, designated breaches allow water to return quickly to the river. But Sindh lies below river level, so once water spreads, it does not recede easily,” he explained.
Also on Sunday, authorities relocated thousands of people from Sindh’s riverine areas to safer locations.
Woman, two daughters killed in KP
Meanwhile, a woman and her two daughters died after the roof of their house caved in due to heavy rains in the Spin Mazak area of Upper South Waziristan’s Sararogha tehsil late on Saturday night.
According to the district administration officials, the incident occurred when the roof of a room collapsed owing to heavy rains. Locals rushed to the scene and managed to recover bodies from debris before shifting them to Wana Hospital.
Deputy Commissioner Upper South Waziristan Asmat Ullah Wazir expressed grief over the loss of lives and directed officials to provide non-food items and other basic relief to the affected family. He said that compensation and further assistance measures were being arranged.
Only last week, torrential rains and flash floods wreaked havoc across the district, sweeping away three key bridges and destroying three houses completely.
In a separate incident, an 18-year-old girl was swept away by floodwaters and lost her life. The deputy commissioner said the district administration in South Waziristan Upper was making all-out efforts to support the affected families.
Abid Baig in Narowal and A.K. Wazir in Upper South Waziristan also contributed to this report. With input from APP and AFP
