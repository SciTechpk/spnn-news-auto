<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041722074cefd9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971036/shc-picks-justice-agha-faisal-for-single-member-judicial-commission-to-probe-cause-of-deadly-gul-plaza-fire' target='_blank'><strong>SHC picks Justice Agha Faisal for single-member judicial commission to probe cause of deadly Gul Plaza fire</strong></a><br><p>Sindh High Court (SHC) Chief Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput on Wednesday nominated Justice Agha Faisal to probe the cause of the Gul Plaza blaze that claimed at least 73 lives.
The development comes days after the Sindh government announced it would approach the SHC chief justice for a judicial inquiry into the tragedy.
A letter from the SHC registrar to the Sindh Home Department’s secretary, available with Dawn, stated that the chief justice had nominated Justice Faisal as the single-member commission to “probe the causes of the fire incident of Gul Plaza shopping centre, Karachi for a period to be fixed and notified by the government of Sindh”.
It stated that the decision was made keeping in view the provisions of Section 3 of the Sindh Tribunals of Inquiry Ordinance, 1969 and considering the Sindh government’s request, along with the terms of reference (ToR) which had been sought on January 30.
On January 29, the provincial government wrote to Justice Rajput, requesting him to nominate a sitting judge to lead an inquiry to ascertain responsibility and examine any failures in regulatory oversight linked to the incident.
The Chief Minister House also urged the registrar to process the request promptly, stating that “an early response is solicited”.
This move came after a cabinet subcommittee of the PPP-led Sindh government reviewed a report submitted by a two-member team. They discussed the circumstances surrounding the fire incident at Gul Plaza and agreed that an independent judicial probe was necessary.
Though the decision followed Sindh’s major opposition parties’ unanimous rejection of the preliminary findings, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon refuted that it was due to “pressure” from the political opponents.

“Highly honored to call on Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, president of the PML-N, and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif,” Mogahadam said in a post on X about the meeting.







He added: “Reiterating the firm commitment of the Islamic Republic of Iran to further enhance Iran-Pakistan relations, I expressed my sincere appreciation for the principled positions and continued support of the government of Pakistan toward Iran in various arenas.”
The envoy said he had met the father-daughter duo to exchange views on the latest regional developments, “particularly in light of recent interventions by the United States and the Israeli regime, including their interventionist positions, threats, and escalatory rhetoric”.
“We also discussed initiatives aimed at further strengthening the bilateral relations between the two brotherly countries of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan,” he said.
Moghadam also acknowledged during the meeting the “tireless endeavors” of Pakistan’s government, particularly Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, in their efforts to further promote comprehensive and all-round cooperation between the two nations.
“While stressing Iran’s full readiness to defend itself against any imminent adventurism, I underlined the steadfast determination of the Islamic Republic of Iran to pursue fair, equitable, and constructive negotiations aimed at resolving outstanding issues through dialogue, mutual respect, and adherence to international norms,” the envoy further stated.
Moghadam added he emphasised that Iran and Pakistan were “like two bodies and one soul, and that both nations have consistently demonstrated their love, commitment, and brotherhood throughout history and the test of time”.
According to the Iranian envoy, Nawaz expressed concern regarding recent developments and imminent threats while referring to the close monitoring and continuous follow-up of developments in Iran and the region.
“He emphasised the importance of constructive negotiations based on mutual respect and equality, within the framework of international law and good faith, in accordance with the United Nations charter,” he said.
“He noted that dialogue and diplomacy, alongside the protection of national sovereignty and the rejection of any threat or use of force, constitute the path toward ensuring peace, stability, and prosperity throughout this already volatile region,” Moghadam said about Nawaz.
Separately, the PML-N also posted about the meeting on X, saying bilateral ties, trade, energy and the regional situation were discussed during the meeting, and the leaders from both sides “reiterated their commitment to strengthen Pak-Iran relations”.
The party’s statement said that Maryam invited Iranian investment in the areas of agriculture, IT and tourism during the exchange and reaffirmed her commitment to advancing economic and social ties between the two countries.
“The Iranian ambassador expressed gratitude toward PM Shehbaz and Foreign Minister Dar for their support,” the statement said.
It quoted Nawaz as saying: “If the door to talks is kept open, even the biggest of issues can be resolved through negotiations. Iran has faced the situation with immense courage.”
The PML-N supremo extended prayers and good wishes toward Iran and its people.
The party’s statement also quoted Amiri as saying that Muslim world “needed a great leader like Nawaz”. According to the statement, he also underlined the importance of Nawaz’s potential role in promoting Pak-Iran ties.</p><small>2026-02-04 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041709515961975.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971035/us-iran-nuclear-talks-to-take-place-in-oman-two-sides-to-seek-de-escalation-regional-official' target='_blank'><strong>US-Iran nuclear talks to take place in Oman, two sides to seek de-escalation: regional official</strong></a><br><p>The US and Iran are due to hold talks in Oman on Friday after Tehran requested a change of venue to limit negotiations to its nuclear programme, a regional official said, with a build-up of US forces in the Middle East raising fears of a confrontation.
Iran wanted the meeting to take place in Oman as a continuation of previous rounds of talks held in the Gulf Arab country on its nuclear programme, asking for a change of location from Turkiye to avoid any expansion of the discussions to issues such as Tehran’s ballistic missiles, the regional official said.
Iran has said it will not make concessions on its formidable ballistic missile programme — one of the biggest in the Middle East — calling that a red line in negotiations.
Tehran, which said it replenished its stockpile of ballistic missiles since coming under attack from Israel last year, had warned that it will unleash its missiles to defend the Islamic Republic if its security is under threat.
The regional official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran had since the beginning stressed that it would only discuss its nuclear programme, while Washington wanted other issues on the agenda.
Oil prices extended gains on Wednesday after the US shot down an Iranian drone and armed Iranian boats approached a US-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, rekindling fears of an escalation between Washington and Tehran.
Iran sought bilateral talks
Trump has warned that “bad things” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes and stirred fears of a wider war.
On Tuesday, the US military shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said.
Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: “We are negotiating with them right now.”
He did not elaborate and declined to say where he expected talks to take place.
A source familiar with the situation said Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.
Ministers from several other countries in the region, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, had also been expected to attend, but the regional source told Reuters that Tehran wanted only bilateral talks with the US.
In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign.
More recently, the US navy built up forces in the region following Iran’s violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest since Iran’s 1979 revolution.
Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran, sending a flotilla to its coast.
The priority of the diplomatic effort is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a regional official told Reuters earlier.
Tanker incident
Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for the resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and an end to its support for regional proxies.
Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.
Since the US strikes in June, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work — which it says is for peaceful, not military purposes — has stopped.
In another incident on Tuesday, this one in the Strait of Hormuz, the US Central Command said Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces had approached a US-flagged tanker at speed and threatened to board and seize it.
Maritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded. Instead, the tanker sped up and continued its voyage.</p><small>2026-02-04 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0416272581ec354.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971002/kazakh-president-calls-pakistan-reliable-partner-as-both-countries-aim-to-increase-bilateral-trade-to-1bn' target='_blank'><strong>Kazakh president calls Pakistan ‘reliable partner’ as both countries aim to increase bilateral trade to $1bn</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday vowed to take bilateral trade volume with Kazakhstan to $1 billion over the next year, while the country’s president called Pakistan a “reliable and important partner in South Asia and beyond”.
The remarks came as the two addressed a joint press conference in Islamabad. Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev is currently on a two-day visit to Pakistan.
A signing ceremony was held at the joint press conference, where the two countries signed 27 agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) in several sectors, including petroleum, mining, and maritime affairs.







At the outset of his address, PM Shehbaz welcomed the delegation from Kazakhstan, noting that it was the “first time in 23 years that a Kazakh president was visiting the country”.
He stated that the two of them had “very useful and productive meetings since the morning, and just now signed 37 MoUs”.
PM Shehbaz expressed the hope that President Tokayev “will make sure that the MoUs are converted into agreements and then [move] to their implementation phase as early as possible”.
The premier also vowed to ensure “speedy” implementation of the MoUs on his part.
“If we are to make these MoUs a reality, our economic, trade, and cultural relations will go notches higher,” the premier maintained.
He commended President Tokayev for being a “very serious-minded politician [and] an accomplished diplomat”.
He also congratulated the Kazakh premier on receiving the Nishan-i-Pakistan, stressing that the honour reflected Pakistan’s “deep appreciation of your visionary leadership and your outstanding contribution towards strengthening the close and friendly ties between our two brotherly countries”.
The premier then shifted his attention to US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, and congratulated President Tokayev on joining the board.
“Let us pray and hope that we will be successful in bringing long-lasting peace in Gaza, its reconstruction, and of course, make the two-state solution a reality as soon as possible,” PM Shehbaz said.
“Kazakhstan is blessed with infinite natural resources, and you are one of the leading countries in the field of mining minerals and [exporting] them along with petroleum products, oil and gas.
“Pakistan is also blessed with infinite natural resources, great human minds and a very hardworking population,” PM Shehbaz said.
However, he noted that Pakistan and Kazakhstan’s “trade volume was just a meagre $250 million during the last year”.
“This does not just reflect the strength of our friendship but also the potential of our two countries,” he added.
He continued: “Let us make the commitment that we will take up our trade volume to $1 billion in the next year”.
He called on the Pakistani and Kazakh business communities to invest in joint ventures, stressing that the current investment portfolio was “negligible” despite great potential on both sides.
PM Shehbaz detailed that the two sides had agreed to the “Belarus-Russia-Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan transport corridor to enhance regional connectivity”.
He assured President Tokayev that Pakistan would offer to Kazakhstan “full access to Pakistan’s transit infrastructure and seaport facilities”.
It is worth mentioning that Kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked country. It borders Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.
On the matter of energy, the premier expressed faith that the collaboration between the two countries in the sector would be a “win-win situation”.
Shehbaz further stressed that Pakistan regarded Kazakhstan as a “strategic and one of the most valued partners in Central Asia”.
“I am absolutely confident that with our collaboration and discussion today, with productive, encouraging outcomes and this signing ceremony, we will not only reinvigorate our relations but also give a huge impetus to our bilateral ties,” the premier said.
Detailing the meeting between the two, PM Shehbaz said that President Tokayev gave a “wonderful roadmap for our future cooperation”.
“This could only come from a visionary leader like you, who has great experience, great expertise and knowledge,” the prime minister added.
He further stressed that as Pakistan and Kazakhstan’s partnership strengthened, “we look forward to exploring new horizons of cooperation in trade, culture, education and many other areas”.
Pakistan ‘reliable, important partner’
President Tokayev, in his address, termed Pakistan a “reliable and important partner in South Asia and beyond”.
“Our people are united by centuries-old ties rooted in the legacy of the great Silk Road, as well as by deep cultural and spiritual affinity,” he said.
“Our nations share common values, traditions, and joint aspirations for the future,” he added. He detailed that the two countries “signed a historical document — a joint declaration — on establishing a strategic partnership between Pakistan and Kazakhstan”.
“By elevating our relations to a new level, we open up immense opportunities to engage across the full spectrum of bilateral and multilateral agendas,” he added.
President Tokayev lauded PM Shehbaz for “his significant, decisive contribution to deepening friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation between our countries“.
He noted that Islamabad’s “regional and global standing continues to grow” under the leadership of PM Shehbaz.
Tokayev lauded Pakistan’s efforts in “strengthening peace and stability in the region,” recalling Pakistan’s election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.
“Today, Pakistan possesses strong economic potential, well-developed industrial capacity and extensive transit and transport capabilities,” he added.
He also commended the “dynamic development of Pakistan’s defence industry”, which he said was “well-recognised globally”.
Speaking about his meeting with the prime minister, he said, “We just held very substantive and productive talks with PM Shehbaz”.
“This afternoon, I will also have the privilege of meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari,” he added.
He said that during his meeting with PM Shehbaz, the pair discussed “trade, transport and logistics, industry, energy, information technology, as well as cultural and humanitarian cooperation”.
“Important intergovernmental documents were adopted, focusing on result-oriented engagement across the full bilateral spectrum,” he added.
He also took note of the two countries’ trade ties, which he said were now “gaining new momentum”.
“Last year, bilateral trade doubled compared to the previous year,” he said, adding that the “roadmap for trade and economic cooperation is being effectively implemented”.
Echoing PM Shehbaz’s commitment to expanding bilateral trade ties, he said, “We agreed to take concrete measures to further increase trade volume with an ambitious yet achievable target of reaching $1bn in the near future, emphasising the importance of creating favourable conditions to intensify cooperation between our business communities.”
He added that the transport and logistics project “aimed at expanding trade” would be prioritised.
The Kazakh president stressed that Pakistan’s role in transit and logistics could “offer us alternative access to international markets”.
He said that the two leaders discussed “the capabilities of Pakistan’s ports of Karachi and Gwadar as priority issues”.
The visiting head of state added that the two also addressed the “development of Trans-Caspian Transport Corridor and transit routes passing through Afghanistan”.
The two sides also agreed to “explore the possibility of resuming direct air connection between the two countries”.
Speaking about the energy sector, President Tokayev said that the two “exchanged views on the prospects of Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India TAPI gas pipeline”.
He further said that the two sides had signed agreements in the agriculture sector. He said that the agreements would pave the way for “expanding trade and establishing joint production facilities”.
Taking note of both countries’ “substantial industrial capabilities”, he invited Pakistani companies to set up production facilities in Kazakhstan.
He added that the two also agreed to “expand mutually beneficial cooperation in the defence industry”.
“Cooperation between our security and law enforcement agencies has been developing dynamically in recent years,” President Tokayev noted.
He also said that the two leaders, during their meeting, “emphasised the strategic importance of AI and digital technologies, especially for economic growth, and we confirmed our readiness to walk jointly in this field”.
Tokayev expressed readiness to “provide favourable conditions for Pakistani investors in Kazakhstan”.
“More than 250 companies from both countries will come together and sign a number of commercial agreements,” he said, referring to the Kazakhstan-Pakistan Business Forum.
He expressed confidence that the event would “unlock untapped potential in trade, economic and investment relations”.
He recalled that in his meeting with the prime minister, the two also discussed the “popularity” of Kazakhstan’s higher education among Pakistani youth.
“Currently, more than 1,000 Pakistanis students are studying in Kazakhstan in various fields,” President Tokayev said.
The two sides agreed to “foster cooperation in science and education,” according to President Tokayev.
PM calls for turning friendly ties into business relations
Later, the two also addressed the Pakistan-Kazakhstan Business Forum. During his speech, PM Shehbaz expressed that the event would “augur wonderfully well for our future”.
“This morning, we had extensive discussions on how to further enhance our trade in agriculture, IT, minerals and connectivity, which is central to this entire discussion,” the premier said
Noting that many Central Asian countries were landlocked, he pledged to provide expertise and an “outlet” through Gwadar and Karachi.
“The NLC (National Logistics Corporation), which is a state-owned company … is fully geared to transport goods from central Asian countries to our ports, and then, of course, from Karachi and Gwadar to Kazakhstan and other central Asian nations,” PM Shehbaz said.
Hailing this as a great opportunity, the premier said that it was “deeply entrusted” to rapidly develop rail and road links through Turkmenistan and Afghanistan to Chaman.
“Pakistan is fully committed to participating and contributing meaningfully in undertaking this project, as it will be a game-changer,” PM Shehbaz asserted. “Not only between our two countries, but this will change the landscape economically for the entire region.”
The premier continued, addressing President Tokayev: “As we discussed this morning, despite our fraternal relations and deep bonds of friendship, our trade volume, as we speak, hovers around $250 million.
“[This] is not a fair reflection of our brotherly relations, and of course, the infinite potential the two countries have in various walks of industry, agriculture, mining, IT, pharmaceutical, engineering, manufacturing and all other important areas of commerce and trade.”
PM Shehbaz said that he and Tokayev agreed to achieve a trade target of $1bn within the next two years, adding that they would do everything “to achieve the target even earlier”.
The premier added that he accepted an invitation from the Kazakh president to visit his country within this year. He added that both nations agreed to form a working group, which would undertake a five-year programme examining ways to increase commerce, trade and bilateral investment.
“My dear brother President Tokayev accepted this proposal immediately, and from our side we have appointed Dr Ahsan Iqbal as head of our Pakistan side,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Serik Zhumangarin would lead the other.
“This will be a very important decision which will lead to a wonderful five-year roadmap, and hopefully, we will sign this document during my visit to your great country,” the premier added.
“This is the time; we should accept this challenge and convert this very friendly relation into very friendly commercial business relations. Time and tide wait for none, so let’s accept the challenge and move forward.”
PM Shehbaz highlighted one of the 37 MoUs signed during Tokayev’s visit, which revolved around developing the Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan railroad, as well as cooperation between ports to connect both regions and “optimise our respective transit potential”.
He also noted that Tokayev’s visit was the first time a Kazakh leader had come to Pakistan in 23 years, the last one being former president Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2003.
Tokayev welcomed
Earlier, PM Shehbaz warmly welcomed President Tokayev at his official residence. President Tokayev was presented with a guard of honour by a smartly turned out contingent of the armed forces following his arrival.







The Kazakh president arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday for a two-day official visit as the two nations seek to further bolster bilateral ties.
The two countries maintain friendly diplomatic relations, with Kazakhstan being Pakistan’s top export destination among Central Asian countries.
Tokayev is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising senior cabinet ministers and other high-ranking officials. A video shared by his office showed the streets in Islamabad adorned with Kazakhstan’s national flag.
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also met with President Tokayev and welcomed him to Pakistan, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.
During the meeting, Dar “underscored Pakistan’s appreciation for the growing momentum of high-level political exchanges.”
The foreign minister “reaffirmed the shared commitment to expand bilateral cooperation across political, economic, & people-to-people domains, and to work together for durable peace, stability, and development in the region,” FO said.







Agreement to deepen trade, connectivity and investment cooperation
Separately, Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan held a comprehensive bilateral meeting with Kazakhstan’s Minister of Trade and Integration Arman Shaqqaliev, at the Ministry of Commerce in Islamabad on Wednesday.
The two sides explored avenues for expanding economic cooperation, connectivity and investment, according to a press release.
“Both sides agreed that improved rail, road and multimodal connectivity is fundamental to strengthening Pakistan–Kazakhstan trade and enabling sustainable, long-term economic engagement,” the statement said.
The Kazakh minister highlighted the strategic importance of developing major infrastructure projects, particularly railway and road corridors. He emphasised Kazakhstan’s vision of becoming a regional hub connecting Central Asia with South Asia, China, Europe and the Global South, including Pakistan’s ports, the statement added.
Meanwhile, Jam Kamal Khan said that improved transit routes would not only benefit Pakistan and Kazakhstan but also open broader opportunities for regional and global trade.
“Both ministers discussed cooperation in priority sectors, including agriculture and food security, pharmaceuticals, textiles, sports goods, leather products, mining and minerals, energy, and infrastructure development,” the statement said.
The meeting also reviewed the need for structured business-to-business (B2B) engagement. It was agreed to work towards finalising a framework document outlining priority sectors, trade targets and a roadmap of activities, including trade missions, exhibitions and exchange of delegations.
“Both ministers reaffirmed their shared commitment to transforming Pakistan–Kazakhstan economic relations from potential to performance,” the statement added.
They expressed confidence that sustained institutional coordination and private-sector engagement would significantly enhance bilateral trade and investment in the coming years.
‘Important and timely opportunity’
In a handout issued earlier on Tuesday, the President’s Secretariat said that President Zardari will confer the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civilian award, on the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan presidents; the latter is expected to visit the country sometime this month.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), President Tokayev is expected to hold meetings with President Zardari and PM Shehbaz, as well as address the Pakistan-Kazakhstan Business Forum.
President Tokayev’s visit will provide Islamabad and Astana “an important and timely opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review” of bilateral relations, the FO had highlighted.
It added that the two sides will discuss new avenues for broadening cooperation, particularly in trade, logistics, regional connectivity and people-to-people contacts, as well as explore collaboration at regional and international forums.
This visit is seen as a win-win situation by both countries. For Pakistan, it will help Islamabad position itself as a land bridge between Central and South Asia and beyond. For Kazakhstan, it will help diversify its international trade amid turbulence in Eurasia in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><small>2026-02-04 12:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041629267a64bc2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971033/trumps-india-pact-to-make-big-dent-in-russian-oil-revenue' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s India pact to make big dent in Russian oil revenue</strong></a><br><p>Russia faces a steep drop in oil income if United States President Donald Trump successfully pressures India to stop importing Russian crude, because losing its top purchaser of seaborne exports would force Moscow to slash prices to find other buyers, analysts and traders said.
Trump on Monday cut US tariffs on Indian goods in a trade deal he said also included provisions for India to halt oil imports from Russia, the world’s second-biggest oil exporter. The US is also putting pressure on Russia to agree to a peace deal in Ukraine.
Trump has over the past year already claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil.
India never halted imports, however, citing its need for energy security and for cheap oil.
The Kremlin says energy cooperation with India, its second-largest oil buyer after China, is strong after Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the country in December 2025.
But Indian refiners are taking a cautious approach to Russian oil purchases, which is already hurting Moscow’s income.
Russian oil imports dropped 22 per cent to 1.38 million barrels per day (bpd) in December from November, their lowest since January 2023, reducing Russia’s share in Indian imports to 27.4pc while Opec’s share rose to 53.2pc, according to Reuters’ calculations.
That follows a peak in India’s Russian oil imports at around 2m bpd in June 2025.
“Any further reduction would already be meaningful, because there is only one relevant alternative buyer — China — which has also its limitations in taking in sanctioned crude,” said David Wech from Vortexa consultancy.
The pressure on Russia is increasing as oil discounts widen and fewer buyers are willing to take the risk, Wech said.
Prices for Russian oil have sunk to record lows, while Russia’s budget shows a deficit due to a shortfall in energy revenues, according to a government official.
Adding to the problems, the number of tankers with Russian oil at anchor has increased as companies struggle to sell oil.
Flows to drop further in April
If India stopped buying Russian oil, Moscow would have to try to re-route it to China at cheaper prices, which would take time, and cut production and exports, said Igor Yushkov, an analyst at Russia’s government-run Financial University.
“Output and export cuts would lead to an oil shortage. Hence, we are not seeing a full US ban on Russian oil imports — they would suffer themselves from higher oil prices,” said Yushkov.
Russian oil exports and production have stayed largely resilient in the face of some 30,000 Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its war in Ukraine since 2014.

 

Moscow has managed to redirect oil flows away from Europe to China, India and Turkiye. Like India, Turkiye has also cut purchases in recent months amid tougher Western sanctions.
Russia’s total oil exports stood at 4.91m bpd in December, with China being the largest buyer of 2.3m bpd of crude, according to the International Energy Agency.
India’s government has given no instructions to refiners to stop buying Russian oil, and they would need a wind-down period to complete purchases already in place for March, sources said.
India will cut Russian imports in April when one of its top refiners, Russian-backed Nayara, carries out a one-month maintenance at its 400,000 bpd plant, a trader in Russian oil said.
Volumes beyond April will be decided by Russia-Ukraine peace talks and the Indian government’s broader stance, traders said.
Trump said India could buy more US and Venezuelan oil to replace Russian purchases.
US crude cannot replace Russian oil on a like-for-like basis due to quality differences, while Venezuela’s exports are small, said Alexandra Hermann, Economist at Oxford Economics.
Crude from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iraq are more likely candidates to substitute Russian oil, said Yushkov. But deep discounts may still make Russian crude difficult to resist for Indian buyers, he added.</p><small>2026-02-04 12:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04142229cbfdaf8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971023/mobile-internet-remains-suspended-in-parts-of-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Mobile internet remains suspended in parts of Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Mobile internet remains suspended in parts of Balochistan for the fifth consecutive day, with provincial authorities also halting train services in the province in the wake of last week’s coordinated terrorist attacks across the province.
“Keeping in mind the worsening law and order situation in the province, mobile internet has been shut down,” said Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat while speaking to Dawn about the situation in Quetta.
However, he added, “Now that the situation is returning to normal, it has been decided to restore mobile internet service from tomorrow at 12am midnight.”
Meanwhile, mobile data services reportedly remained suspended in Nushki and Sibi, as well as in Mastung where services were briefly restored.
Mobile data has been inaccessible for those in Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat for varying periods due to prior security concerns.
Separately, a spokesperson for Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, Muhammad Kashif, told Dawn that train services from Quetta to other parts of the country remain suspended.
He added that “once the security situation improves and we receive clearance, services of the Jaffar Express (Quetta-Peshawar) and the Bolan Mail (Quetta-Karachi) will be restored”.
On Tuesday, security forces continued ‘mop-up actions’ in Nushki district and other parts of the province following the coordinated attacks, with the number of terrorists killed now at 197.
In Nushki, armed men had attacked various government offices on Saturday, including a police station, judicial complex, police lines, Deputy Commissioner (DC) office and a Federal Constabulary (FC) camp in the town, and set some government buildings on fire.
But while the town of Nushki has been cleared and bazaars reopened after three days, search operations by security forces are continuing in the mountainous areas of the district, officials told Dawn.</p><small>2026-02-04 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0410593969ff18d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971005/bulls-sustain-rally-as-kse-100-rises-over-900-points' target='_blank'><strong>Bulls sustain rally as KSE-100 rises over 900 points</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, closed in the green at 187,832.08 points on Wednesday.

Pakistan whitewashed Australia with a 3-0 victory in the series, during which Saim scored 119 run and claimed three wickets.
An announcement by the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Wednesday that Saim moved up one slot to regain the top spot in the monthly rankings, replacing Zimbabwe veteran Sikandar Raza.







The cricket’s governing body said the development “bodes well for Ayub and Pakistan just days out from the start of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup as the Asian side look to claim their second title in the 20-over showcase event and their first since they tasted success in the second edition of the tournament back in 2009”.
Meanwhile, Pakistani spinner Abrar Ahmed also moved up two places to the second spot in the T20 bowler rankings. He grabbed six wickets in the series against Australia and was “now just 28 rating points behind no.1 ranked Varun Chakravarthy of India following six wickets across three matches against the Aussies”, the ICC announcement said.
Fellow spinner Mohammad Nawaz also leaped eight slots to claim the the seventh position on the list following his five-wicket haul in the last match of the series against Australia.
Nawaz also moved up one spot to the fourth position in the T20 all-rounder rankings.
As for the batsmen rankings for the shortest format of the game, Saim moved up eight places to the 27th position and skipper Salman Ali Agha leaped 12 slots to claim the 29th position on the list.</p><small>2026-02-04 11:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041636222ed5635.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971032/musks-mega-merger-of-spacex-and-xai-bets-on-sci-fi-future-of-data-centres-in-space' target='_blank'><strong>Musk’s mega-merger of SpaceX and xAI bets on sci-fi future of data centres in space</strong></a><br><p>Seventy-five years ago, the idea of harnessing the power of the skies was little more than a fantasy spun by futurists like Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov.
Elon Musk’s mega-merger of his companies xAI and SpaceX this week brings this sci-fi dream a step closer.
Nasa engineers and technologists have speculated for nearly two decades about moving energy-hungry computing off the planet.
More recently, the idea has captured the attention of Big Tech, including Alphabet and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. The physics made sense; the solar energy was abundant. Still, the challenges seemed insurmountable.

 

Musk, though, known for betting on seemingly far-out theories and getting them to work, may finally be laying the groundwork to make data centres in space a reality.
He is armed with the world’s busiest satellite launch fleet, an AI startup, and an appetite for infrastructure that stretches from Earth to vacuum.
“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,” Musk said on Monday.
“To harness even a millionth of our Sun’s energy would require over a million times more energy than our civilisation currently uses! The only logical solution therefore is to transport these resource-intensive efforts to a location with vast power and space.”
The merger sharpens investor focus on how he might overcome big hurdles through a tightly woven ecosystem of rockets, satellites and AI systems, to take AI infrastructure beyond Earth.
It comes just as SpaceX is preparing for a potential $1.5 trillion initial public offering (IPO). SpaceX has sought permission to launch up to 1 million solar-powered satellites engineered as orbital data centres, far beyond anything currently deployed or proposed.

 

In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, SpaceX describes a solar-powered, optical-link-driven orbital data-centre system, though it did not say how many Starship launches would be required to scale the space data-centre network to an operational degree.
“Compute in space isn’t sci-fi anymore,” said David Ariosto, author and founder of space intelligence firm The Space Agency.
“And Elon Musk has already proven himself capable across multiple domains.”
Old idea meets new economics
Advocates argue that space-based data centres would be a cheaper alternative to data centres on Earth, thanks to constant solar energy and the ability to dump heat directly into space.
But some experts have warned that big commercial gains are years from reality as the concept faces daunting challenges and is fraught with technical risks: radiation, debris, heat management, latency, and formidable economics that include high maintenance costs.
“There’s some real challenges here, and how do you then make that cost-effective?” said Armand Musey, founder of Summit Ridge Group, who said the financial details of a project such as this was hard to model because the “technical unknowns haven’t been clarified.”
“But never say never,” said Musey, who called Musk’s track record “unbelievable”. “I think a large part of it is, it’s a bet on Elon. His success is really hard for people to ignore.”

 

Even with Musk’s ambitions, data centres in space may not be achievable for another decade, some experts have said.
The underlying physics behind space-based infrastructure is not new.
Harnessing solar power in orbit dates back to Cold War-era research, when the US Department of Energy and Nasa studied space-based solar power concepts in the 1970s, ultimately concluding that launch and materials costs made them impractical.
What makes Musk’s efforts different is that his companies have more direct control over key elements of the system — from the rockets that will carry the hardware, to the links to beam data back to Earth, to a Musk-owned social network to generate demand for cheap AI computing.
“SpaceX has structural advantages that few others can match. It controls the world’s most active launch fleet, has demonstrated mass production of spacecraft through Starlink, and has access to substantial private capital,” said Kathleen Curlee, a research analyst at Georgetown University.
Bombarding chips with radiation
Among the biggest challenges facing space data centres are radiation and cooling.
Data-centre hardware will be bombarded by cosmic rays from the sun. In the past, chips designed for space were specially “hardened” for such radiation but were rarely as fast as today’s flagship AI chips.
Cooling AI chips, which generate immense heat during computations, is the other hurdle. While space is cold, it is also a near vacuum, so heat cannot be carried away the way it is on Earth. Powerful chips must instead move heat into large radiators that shed it as infrared energy, adding significant size, weight, and therefore cost.

 

SpaceX’s filing with the FCC describes cooling via “passive heat dissipation into the vacuum of space” and outlines how satellites that suffer operational failures rapidly de-orbit.
More recently, Alphabet’s Google bombarded one of its AI chips with radiation at a university lab in California to see how it would endure a five- or six-year mission in space for a research effort to network solar-powered satellites into an orbital AI cloud called Project Suncatcher.
“They held up quite well against that,” said Travis Beals, a senior executive at Google and lead of the project, which is set for a prototype launch to space in 2027.

Among the dead was a medic who rushed to help victims of a strike in the southern city of Khan Younis and was then killed by a second attack on the same location, health officials said.
Other strikes hit Gaza City in the north, where health officials said a five-month-old boy was killed. The attacks come three days after Israel reopened Gaza’s main border crossing with Egypt, a major step in the US-backed truce.
The Israeli military claimed it had launched the strikes in response to gunmen opening fire against Israeli troops operating near its armistice line with Hamas. It said an Israeli soldier was severely injured by the fire.
Wednesday’s attacks bring the number of Palestinians killed since the border reopened to 28, according to a tally from Gazan health officials.
On Saturday, before its reopening, Israeli strikes killed more than 30 Palestinians in Gaza. The military said it launched those strikes after gunmen emerged from a tunnel in a Gaza area under Israeli control.
Patient crossings at Rafah halted
Palestinian patients preparing to cross through the newly opened Rafah border crossing to Egypt were told that Israel had postponed the passage of patients through the border.
A few hours later, the patients were told to prepare again to cross the border.
A spokesperson for the Red Crescent said patients had arrived at a hospital in Khan Younis in preparation for crossing Rafah for treatment, only to be informed that Israel had postponed the evacuations.
“They called the patients and said today there is no travel at all, the crossing is closed,” Raja’a Abu Teir, a Palestinian patient who was set to be evacuated, told Reuters at the hospital, where several patients were waiting in ambulances.
An Egyptian security source told Reuters that efforts were being made to reopen the crossing, and that Israel had cited security issues in the Rafah area as the reason for the closure.
The Israeli agency that controls access to Gaza, COGAT, claimed in a statement on Wednesday that Rafah crossing remained open, adding that it had not received the necessary coordination details from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to facilitate the crossing.
The WHO did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.







Reopening the crossing was one of the requirements under the October ceasefire that set out the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas.
Sixteen patients from Gaza and 40 of their escorts crossed into Egypt on Tuesday, Gazan medics told Reuters.
A Hamas police source told Reuters that at least 40 people crossed from Egypt to Gaza late on Tuesday.

 

In January, Trump declared the start of the second phase of the ceasefire, where the sides would negotiate the shattered enclave’s future governance and reconstruction.
Key issues like the withdrawal of Israeli forces from over 50 per cent of Gaza, which they currently occupy, and the disarmament of Hamas remain unresolved, while the fragile ceasefire has been marked by near-daily violence.
Since the start of the ceasefire, Israeli fire has killed at least 530 people, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials. Palestinian fighters have killed four Israeli soldiers in the same period, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health authorities, displaced most of its population, and left much of the strip in ruins.
Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
The Oct 7, 2023 Hamas attack that triggered the offensive killed around 1,200 in Israel, according to Israeli tallies.</p><small>2026-02-04 11:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04151121bc0fbfa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971014/punjab-government-notifies-public-holidays-on-feb-6-7-for-basant' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab government notifies public holidays on Feb 6, 7 for Basant</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government has notified public holidays in the province on February 6 and 7 (Friday and Saturday) for Basant, said a notification.
The notification was issued on Tuesday by the provincial government’s Services and General Administration Department, a copy of which is available with Dawn.
“It is hereby notified for general information that 6th and 7th February, 2026 (Friday and Saturday) shall be observed as public holidays in the province of Punjab,” the notification said.







On Sunday, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had announced a “long weekend” in the province, declaring a Basant holiday.
“Punjab will enjoy a long weekend with Kashmir Day on February 5, a provincial Basant holiday on the 6th, followed by Saturday and Sunday.
“We hope people across Punjab take this time to relax, recharge, and make the most of the break,” she posted on X.







The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has said dry weather with clear skies was expected for the majority of the Basant festival.
“Mainly dry weather with clear skies is expected on 6th and 7th February, while dry weather with few cloudy conditions on 8th February, 2026 in Lahore during the Basant 2026,” the PMD said.
Basant Panchami, with ‘panchami’ meaning the fifth day of the lunar month Magh, is a celebration of future crop prosperity, spring, and good luck.
The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
However, it is set to make a grand return after a hiatus of 18 years, after the Punjab government lifted the ban on kite flying in December and allowed the celebration of Basant with strict regulations.
Under the new Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, the manufacturing of only thread-based kite strings will be allowed and the use of metallic, chemical-coated, or sharp strings is strictly banned.</p><small>2026-02-04 10:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041133157cb09e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971010/police-constable-martyred-by-terrorists-in-kps-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>Police constable martyred by terrorists in KP’s Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>Terrorists martyred a police recruit constable in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, the local police said on Wednesday.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. KP and Balochistan are particularly frequent targets.
The constable was killed in the Darga forest in Nasrkhel, near the Sarai Naurang area of ​​Lakki Marwat.
District Police Spokesperson Qudratullah confirmed the incident, saying that the martyred constable had been undergoing training at Hangu Training School.
“On Tuesday night, terrorists abducted him from his house in Nasrkhel and took him to a forest called Darga and shot and killed him there,” he said.
The funeral prayers of the constable were offered with official honours at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines. Lakki Marwat’s District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan, Superintendent of Police (SP) Investigation Murad Khan, police officers, district administration officers and police personnel attended the prayers in large numbers.
The DPO also paid tribute to the martyr’s sacrifice, saying that the constable had set “a shining example of bravery and sacrifice” by giving his life in the line of duty.
“The entire nation is proud of this brave soldier. These cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken our resolve,” he said.
“The morale of Lakki Marwat police is high and actions against Fitna-al-Khawarij will be further intensified. No sacrifice will be spared to protect the lives and property of the people, and the involved elements will be brought to their logical end soon.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Despite record militant deaths, the country saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
Last month, the KP Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan.
Only days before that, at least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts, officials said.
The previous week, the military’s media wing had said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP. That same day, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu.</p><small>2026-02-04 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04140135f152767.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971016/chaudhry-sugar-mills-case-lhc-directs-nab-to-approach-trial-court-for-closing-inquiry-against-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>Chaudhry Sugar Mills case: LHC directs NAB to approach trial court for closing inquiry against Maryam</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to move the trial court concerned after the anti-graft body decided to close the Chaudhry Sugar Mills inquiry against Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
The case pertains to alleged money laundering and income beyond means via “dubious” business transactions of the Chaudhry Sugar Mills, of which Maryam was a major shareholder.
A three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and including Justices Muhammad Jawad Zafar and Abher Gul Khan, heard CM Maryam’s civil miscellaneous application seeking the refund of Rs70 million deposited as a guarantee in the case.
During the proceedings, the NAB’s prosecutor informed the bench that following the new amendments, the bureau’s chairman had approved the closure of the probe.
Justice Neelum, however, observed that the NAB should have approached the accountability court concerned for closure of the inquiry.
Questioning the investigation process, the chief justice asked the bureau’s counsel to explain the procedure adopted in the case.
In response, the prosecutor stated that the NAB board had decided in a meeting to close the inquiry.
The prosecutor answered the bench in the affirmative when asked whether a new NAB board could reopen the case in the future.
At this, the bench remarked that such a situation would render the NAB board’s decision to close a case meaningless.
Justice Neelum observed, “If the court orders the release of the bail surety amount today and the case is reopened tomorrow, all blame would fall on the court.”
Subsequently, the bench directed the NAB to approach the relevant accountability court within one month for the formal closure of the Chaudhry Sugar Mills inquiry.
A NAB team had arrested Maryam in connection with the case on Aug 8, 2019 when she was present at the Kot Lakhpat jail on her weekly visit to her incarcerated father Nawaz.
On Nov 4, 2019, the LHC released Maryam in the sugar mills case on bail, subject to surrendering her passport to the court. She was also ordered to deposit a surety amount of Rs70m with the registrar judicial of the court.
In October 2022, the LHC directed officials to return the passport to Maryam after the NAB said it did not require the travel document anymore.</p><small>2026-02-04 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041259558396b5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971015/un-security-council-condemns-heinous-and-cowardly-acts-of-terrorism-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>UN Security Council condemns ‘heinous and cowardly acts’ of terrorism in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has strongly condemned the series of terrorist attacks across multiple locations in Balochistan.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the UNSC said the attacks, which occurred on January 31, 2026, were carried out across the province and described them as “heinous and cowardly acts of terrorism”.







The UNSC expressed its “deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the governor and people of Pakistan”. The council also wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured in the attacks.
The statement reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”.
It added that it was crucial to “hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers, and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice,” urging all states to cooperate with the government of Pakistan in accordance with international law and relevant UNSC resolutions.
The UNSC reiterated that “any act of terrorism is criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of motivation, timing, or perpetrator”.
It further stressed that all states must combat terrorism “by all means, in accordance with the UN Charter and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, and international humanitarian law,” in order to address threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.
Earlier on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combating terrorism.
“We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said.
The number of terrorists killed in clearance operations across Balochistan has risen to 197, as security forces continued ‘mop-up’ actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province.
The clearance operations follow several coordinated terrorist attacks staged across the province on Saturday.</p><small>2026-02-04 09:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041324269c40a0a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970999/us-india-discuss-critical-minerals-cooperation-and-strategic-ties-during-washington-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>US, India discuss critical minerals cooperation and strategic ties during Washington meeting</strong></a><br><p>The United States and India have held high-level talks in Washington focused on critical minerals cooperation, trade and strategic ties.
The talks were held late on Tuesday against the backdrop of a recently finalised bilateral trade deal that has drawn attention across the region.
Diplomatic observers in Washington, however, maintain that the agreement is unlikely to affect recently improved bilateral ties between Pakistan and the US, as those are not linked to India.
The observers note that recent developments in the greater Middle East, as well as in South and Central Asia, have further enhanced Pakistan’s relevance as a key regional player in Washington’s strategic calculus.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar during the latter’s three-day official visit to the United States, as both sides moved to deepen economic and strategic coordination in the Indo-Pacific.
According to the US State Department readout, Secretary Rubio and Minister Jaishankar discussed “formalising bilateral cooperation on critical minerals exploration, mining, and processing”, an area of growing importance amid global supply chain realignments and competition over energy transition resources.
The meeting came ahead of the inaugural critical minerals ministerial scheduled for Wednesday and followed the conclusion of a long-pending trade agreement between Washington and New Delhi. Under the deal, the US has agreed to reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent after nearly a year of negotiations.
“Secretary Rubio and Minister Jaishankar welcomed the trade deal reached between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi,” the US statement said, adding that the two leaders “emphasised the importance of our democracies working together to unlock new economic opportunities and advance our shared energy security goals”.
In a post on social media, Secretary Rubio said: “Met Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar to discuss our bilateral cooperation on critical minerals exploration and work together to unlock new economic opportunities between our two countries. We also commended the trade deal between the United States and India.”







Jaishankar, in his own message, said he was “delighted to meet US Secretary Rubio this afternoon”, describing it as “a wide-ranging conversation that covered our bilateral cooperation agenda, regional and global issues”.
“Facets of India — US Strategic Partnership discussed included trade, energy, nuclear, defence, critical minerals and technology,” he said, adding: “Agreed on the early meetings of various mechanisms to advance our shared interests.”







The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment to expanding “bilateral and multilateral cooperation” through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which brings together the United States, India, Japan and Australia.
The US readout said the meeting concluded with both leaders expressing their commitment to strengthening cooperation through the Quad, while acknowledging that “a prosperous Indo-Pacific region remains vital to advancing our shared interests”.
Pakistan, which has been seeking to stabilise its economic relations with Washington while navigating an increasingly polarised regional environment, is also attending the critical minerals meeting.
Pakistani participation in the Washington gathering is seen as part of broader efforts to position the country as a credible destination for strategic mineral investment. Islamabad has previously signed memoranda of understanding worth about $500 million with US partners for cooperation in the development and processing of critical minerals.
India will diversify energy supplies: minister
India will diversify its energy sources as a strategy amid changing global circumstances and ensure energy security for its citizens, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said on Wednesday, days after the US said New Delhi will halt Russian oil purchases.
Trump on Monday announced a trade deal with India that slashed tariffs on Indian goods to 18pc from 50pc in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.
Trump said India would instead buy oil from the US and potentially Venezuela. The Kremlin on Tuesday, however, said it had heard no statements from India about halting purchases of Russian oil.

 

In his first statement to the parliament on the trade deal, Goyal did not refer to shifting energy purchases away from any country.
Indian refiners have not been told by the government to stop buying Russian oil and would need a wind-down period to complete purchases already in process, Reuters reported.
In the US deal, India has successfully protected sensitive sectors such as agriculture and dairy, Goyal added.
Lawmakers from India’s opposition party Congress have questioned the lack of details on the deal and have sought clarifications on the extent of farm access offered to Washington.</p><small>2026-02-04 08:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0413114784488ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969527/the-eternal-ascent-basant-returns-to-the-skies-of-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>The eternal ascent: Basant returns to the skies of Lahore</strong></a><br><p>In the ancient city of Lahore, where the Ravi river whispers secrets to the minarets of the Badshahi Mosque, spring arrives not with a gentle sigh, but with a sudden, jubilant roar.
When the winter’s fog finally yields to the sun’s warm gaze, the skies above the walled city awaken. Kites (‘patangs’) burst upward from rooftops, their paper bodies trembling, their tails slicing the blue sky like calligraphy in motion.
This is Basant: a centuries-old festival marked by marigold blooms and kites, carried by colour and the steady pull of the wind.
Bo Kata! — a festival of freedom and flight
Basant traces its roots to Vasant Panchami, the ancient herald of spring observed on the fifth day of Magh, when the land stirs from winter’s slumber. In the mustard fields of Punjab, ochre blooms unfurl like carpets laid for spring’s arrival. Goddess Saraswati, (the goddess of learning and the arts), clad in saffron-gold, is invoked with music and learning, her veena (an Indian stringed instrument) resonating with the promise of renewal.
In Lahore, however, Basant long outgrew its ritual origins. It became deeply Punjabi, exuberantly urban, and radically inclusive. Hindu, Muslim and Sikh households alike climbed their roofs, dressed in amber and marigold hues, turning the city into a living mosaic where faith receded, and celebration took flight.
Historical chronicles recall Basant at its most magnificent during the Mughal era. Emperors revelled in the spectacle: kites wheeling above the ramparts of Lahore Fort, their strings guided by hands adorned with henna. Amir Khusrau, the Sufi poet whose verses still seem to linger in the city’s breath, sang of Basant as a season of love, colour, and divine intoxication.

Later, in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the festival assumed an even grander, almost theatrical form. For 10 days, Lahore became a city lost in celebration. Marigold garlands draped streets and courtyards; soldiers appeared in turmeric-hued turbans; women swayed on jhulas (swings), the steady beat of the dhol travelled through every lane. Above it all, kite battles drew cheers of “Bo kata!” from rooftop to rooftop.
Yet the true poetry of Basant lies not in its pomp, but in the humble kite itself. A fragile diamond-framed paper and bamboo, it is tethered to earth by a single string, yet it yearns for the heavens. In the hands of a Lahori child or elder, the patang becomes more than play: it is an act of transcendence. As the wind takes hold, the kite escapes the dust and clamour of crowded streets, briefly escaping the confines of class and circumstance, carrying the hopes of those who hold the string below.
For many in Lahore, Basant has always been this quiet rebellion against gravity. In narrow streets where life presses close, the rooftop becomes a stage for liberation. A young man, burdened by tomorrow’s worries, sends his kite aloft and watches it soar, higher, freer, until it seems to touch the very edge of possibility. A woman, her heart full of unspoken longings, lets the wind carry her kite as if it could bear her dreams to distant horizons.
The kite is an escape made visible: fragile yet defiant, tethered yet boundless. It reminds us that even the smallest soul can touch the infinite if given the right wind.
The ghost of Basant lingering in memory for two decades
For nearly two decades, however, the skies remained silent. The ban descended after tragic losses, lives claimed by sharp, glass-coated or metallic strings that sliced through the air, severing throats and injuring bystanders on rooftops and streets below.
The silence was born of necessary grief and reckoning, a painful but essential pause to protect what mattered most.
Families who once gathered with spools of thread in their hands now looked up at an empty blue sky, feeling the absence like a missing heartbeat. Old men sat on charpoys in the evenings, eyes distant, murmuring about days when the sky was alive with colour. Mothers recalled their children’s laughter as they ran across terraces, cheeks flushed with sun and excitement. Young people, who had known Basant only through stories and grainy videos, carried a quiet nostalgia for something they had never truly touched.

The city missed it deeply: the shared joy, the playful rivalries, the way the wind seemed to carry away every worry for a single radiant day. Basant had become a beloved ghost, lingering over rooftops and in memory.
But the longing never died. It lived in whispered conversations, in turmeric-hued kurtas worn on spring days as quiet tribute, in the careful way kite-makers kept their craft alive in the city’s hidden corners. It lived in the hope that one day the skies would fill again — not recklessly, but with wisdom earned from sorrow.
Lahore’s patangs are set to rise once more, responsibly
And now, as February has ascended, the wind is stirring once more. Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025, with its strict mandates for cotton strings only (no metallic or glass coatings), QR-coded registration, maximum nine threads, drone monitoring, and zero tolerance for violations, the patangs will rise again, thoughtfully and safely, over the rooftops of Lahore on February 6, 7, and 8, 2026.
The old songs are being rehearsed, the dhol awaits its beat, and the air will soon carry the sweet scent of marigold sweets and the gentle tug of ordinary thread. What was lost is being remembered with care; what was mourned is being welcomed back, wiser and more precious for the wait.
As one lifelong resident of Anarkali, Anwar Bajwa, shared with quiet emotion:
“Basant was never just a day for me; it was part of who I was, part of every spring morning when the air turned warm and full of promise. As a boy, I would wake before dawn and run to the rooftop with my siblings, thread in hand, my heart racing for the wind to lift our kites. Those patangs were my companions, my secrets, my way of whispering dreams to the sky when words fell short. Every tug on the string felt like my own heartbeat reaching higher.”

 

He added that when the rooftops went silent, “it was like losing a piece of my childhood. The empty sky in spring felt wrong, heavy, and incomplete. Now, hearing that the kites will fly again, safely and responsibly, I feel that old excitement stirring inside me, like time has turned back and I’m that boy once again, waiting for the wind to carry my dreams up where nothing can touch them.”
The skies of old Basant were tapestries of scarlet, emerald, indigo, and amber, woven by thousands of patangs locked in gentle combat. Rooftops brimmed with laughter, the air thick with the scent of marigold-hued sweets. Families gathered, strangers became friends, and for radiant days, Lahore was united in pure, unbridled joy.
The kite, too, carries its own quiet symbolism. A close look reveals intricate designs — stars, eyes, flowers — each patang a small work of art, born in the hands of artisans who know the wind’s secrets.
And beneath it all, the earth itself celebrates: vast fields of mustard-gold sway in the breeze, a living mirror to the crowds above.
The return of flight and soaring spirits
As the season approaches, the memory of those quiet years only deepens the anticipation. The skies have been empty for too long, yet the longing has made every coming flight more sacred.
In every Lahori heart, the kite still waits, patient, hopeful, and soon it will rise once more.
When it does, Lahore will not merely remember joy; it will reclaim it, wiser for the silence, stronger for the lessons etched in loss. Basant returns not as a fleeting spectacle, but as proof that even after the darkest pause, the human spirit, fragile as paper and defiant as wind, can ascend again, tethered only by the thinnest thread of care, soaring toward a boundless sky that belongs, once more, to all of us.

Until last Sunday, the memorial was perched on a mound roughly 40 feet high, and land around it had been cleared and levelled to develop a commercial area for an upcoming housing society.
The Department of Archaeology and Museums (Doam) had prevented the housing authority from relocating the World War I memorial. However, on Tuesday, officials from Doam who visited the site reported that the mound had been flattened and the memorial dismantled. Pictures shared by officials showed a few blocks of the memorial lying in freshly levelled earth.
The monument was erected by the British Empire after 1914 to honour local soldiers who fought in the Great War. It stood as a symbol of recognition on Kuri Road, near Rehara village, but it is now gone.
The developers, Capital Development Authority and private housing scheme, approached Doam six months ago, requesting a no objection certificate (NOC) to relocate the memorial to a roundabout (to be built about 100 meters from its original location), ensuring visibility and accessibility.
“The roundabout may be named after the World War I memorial, thereby perpetuating its legacy and significance,” CDA stated in a letter to Doam.
However, Doam rejected the proposal, asserting that the memorial was built in honour of the men from villages like Rehara, who sacrificed their lives. Moving it would defeat its purpose.

 

Doam emphasised that the memorial must be protected first and added to Islamabad’s list of historical monuments, which requires the necessary documentation from the CDA.
Documents seen by Dawn revealed that Doam had been writing to CDA chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa, as well as the revenue department of the civic agency, since 2020, to obtain records of the war memorial. The archaeology department had also requested records of other historical sites, including the Mughal-era Rehara mosque, located 200 metres from the memorial, so it could also be protected.
“CDA has not once responded to the numerous letters Doam has sent over the last six years,” a senior official from the Ministry of National Heritage and Culture told Dawn.
“Minister for National Heritage and Culture Aurangzeb Khan Khichi faced embarrassment, especially as representatives from Unesco were visiting Pakistan when news of the memorial’s demolition reached him. A full report of the incident has been sent to the minister for further action,” he added.
Mr Khichi did not answer his phone when contacted for comments.

Spot gold gained 2.7 per cent to$5,071.79 per ounce as of 03:53 GMT, after surging 5.9pc on Tuesday, its biggest daily gain since November 2008. Bullion scaled a record high of $5,594.82 last Thursday.
US gold futures for April delivery climbed 3.2pc to $5,092.0 per ounce.
“Gold has climbed back about the key $5,000 level, … (as) geopolitical tensions have lifted the metal’s safe-haven appeal after US forces downed an Iranian drone,” said Jigar Trivedi, a senior research analyst at IndusInd Securities.
The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.
Nuclear talks between the US and Iran are expected to take place in Oman on Friday, Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on Tuesday, citing an Arab source.
Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a spending deal into law that ends a partial US government shutdown, which had delayed key labour data reports that were due for release this week.
Investors expect at least two Fed interest rate cuts in 2026 and await ADP private payroll data later in the day for more cues on the Fed’s policy path. Non-yielding bullion tends to perform better in low-interest-rate environments.
“Going ahead (gold) prices may touch $5,100 in the very near-term … and we are expecting the same $5,600 levels by the end of the first half or April-end while prices will continue to rise thereafter and our year-end target is $6,000/oz,” Trivedi added.
The current wave is expected to be sharp, probably to surge into the $4,950 to $5,198 range, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said on Tuesday.
Spot silver rose 3.2pc to $87.84 an ounce. It touched a record high of $121.64 on Thursday.
Spot platinum added 2.9pc to $2,273.70 per ounce after hitting an all-time high of $2,918.80 on January 26, while palladium gained 3pc to $1,784.67.</p><small>2026-02-04 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04112216dc82892.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971008/human-rights-watch-warns-us-heading-to-authoritarianism' target='_blank'><strong>Human Rights Watch warns US heading to ‘authoritarianism’</strong></a><br><p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) warned on Wednesday that President Donald Trump was turning the United States into an authoritarian state as democracy declines globally to its lowest ebb in four decades.
Trump’s return to the White House has intensified a “downward spiral” on human rights that was already under pressure from Russia and China, the New York‑based advocacy and research group said in its annual report.
“The rules‑based international order is being crushed,” HRW said.
In the United States, the group said, Trump has shown “blatant disregard for human rights and egregious violations.”
In descriptions that would have been unthinkable in the US section of its previous annual reports, the group pointed to the deployment of masked, armed agents — the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency — which has carried out “hundreds of unnecessarily violent and abusive raids.”
“The administration’s racial and ethnic scapegoating, domestic deployment of National Guard forces in pretextual power grabs, repeated acts of retaliation against perceived political enemies and former officials now critical of him, as well as attempts to expand the coercive powers of the executive and neuter democratic checks and balances, underpin a decided shift towards authoritarianism in the US,” the report said.
Human Rights Watch repeated its finding that the United States engaged in enforced disappearances — a crime under international law — by sending 252 Venezuelan migrants to a maximum‑security prison in El Salvador.
In a recent report, HRW documented allegations by the men, who eventually were allowed into Venezuela, of being tortured, including beatings and sexual violence.
‘Less free’ now
Human Rights Watch pointed to metrics by which democracy has declined to the level of 1985 — when the Soviet Union still existed.
“Russia and China are less free today than 20 years ago. And so is the United States,” it said.
Philippe Bolopion, the group’s executive director, called on countries to form alliances based on respect for human rights and to stand together — including against the tariff‑wielding Trump.
“Some countries may be tempted to forge ad hoc alliances on specific issues — one day with China, another with Turkey, another with South Africa,” Bolopion told AFP.
“From our perspective, for such an alliance to be strong and lasting, it must be built on principles and values — democracy, international law, human rights,” he said.
“It can carry weight and provide a degree of security to its members,” he said.
The 529‑page report stands in contrast to the latest human rights report issued by the US State Department, which toned down sections on countries friendly to Trump.
The State Department report said El Salvador in 2024 saw “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” and that President Nayib Bukele’s crackdown on gangs has brought crime to a “historic low.”
The Human Rights Watch report also said that gang violence had “markedly declined” but that in 2025 authorities carried out “widespread abuses, including mass arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture and ill‑treatment of detainees and due process violations.”
HRW again renewed its charge that Israel has carried out “crimes against humanity and acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing” against Palestinians in Gaza.
It said that Israeli authorities in 2025 “escalated their atrocities” which included “killing, maiming, starving and forcibly displacing Palestinians and destroying their homes, schools and infrastructure at a scale unprecedented in the recent history of Israel and Palestine.”
Israel has angrily rejected the Human Rights Watch genocide allegation first issued in December 2024, with the United States backing Israel’s stance.</p><small>2026-02-04 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04112028cf39dda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971007/spin-heavy-pakistan-hit-form-but-india-boycott-risks-early-t20-exit' target='_blank'><strong>Spin-heavy Pakistan hit form, but India boycott risks early T20 exit</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s spin-heavy squad are in winning form ahead of the T20 World Cup, but a controversial decision to forfeit their marquee clash against India could still trigger another early exit.
Pakistan came close to withdrawing from the tournament in solidarity with Bangladesh, who pulled out after refusing to play in India, citing security concerns.
The Pakistan government eventually cleared the team’s participation but it barred them from facing India in Colombo in a blockbuster clash on February 15.
With two points for a win, a forfeit of the match will leave Pakistan with no margin for error if they are to progress as one of the top two from a five-team Group A.
It means they must win their opening game against the Netherlands in Colombo on Saturday and beat the United States three days later to stay in contention.
Their final group game will be against Namibia on February 18.Captain Salman Agha said the move to boycott the India game was out of the team’s hands.
“That is not our decision. We have to follow what our government decides,” he said.
The Pakistan government has not said what their stance might be if the team were to end up facing India again in the semi-finals or final. Agha was not thinking about that.
“Our job is to win, and we are capable of doing that,” he said.Pakistan will be keen to avoid a repeat of the last T20 World Cup in 2024, where a shock super over defeat to co-hosts the United States led to them failing to get out of the group.
The side has since faced criticism for failing to adapt to the modern demands of T20 cricket, with the batting, particularly Babar Azam’s low strike rate, under scrutiny.
The criticism was fuelled by Pakistan’s record last year, where 21 of their 34 T20 international wins came against lower-ranked opponents.
Confidence restored
Against elite teams, the results were sobering: three losses to India in the Asia Cup and a 4-1 series defeat to New Zealand.
However, Agha believes recent performances have restored confidence.Pakistan beat South Africa 2-1, won a home tri-series, and then completed a 3-0 sweep of an under-strength Australia.
“We’ve had good preparation by beating Australia. We have the luxury of quality spinning all-rounders like Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan and Saim Ayub.
“We’re ticking most boxes and believe we can win the World Cup,” Agha said.
The spin department has been strengthened by Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, the latter known for his unusual, slingy action and exaggerated pause at the crease.
The pace attack is led by the experienced Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah.
Faheem Ashraf provides seam-bowling all-round support and newcomer Salman Mirza has been impressive.
Batting remains Pakistan’s most volatile component.
When openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan provide strong starts, the side can post competitive totals, but collapses remain a constant threat.
Head coach Mike Hesson has added another layer of risk by leaving out experienced wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan because of poor form, opting instead for makeshift options in Usman Khan, Khawaja Nafay and Farhan.
For Pakistan, the ingredients for a deep run are present, but with points potentially forfeited, there is little room left for error.</p><small>2026-02-04 06:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04082705d296181.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970927/qadhafis-son-saif-shot-dead-in-libya' target='_blank'><strong>Qadhafi’s son Saif shot dead in Libya</strong></a><br><p>TRIPOLI: Saif al Islam, the most prominent son of the late Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi, was shot dead at his home on Tuesday.
Abdullah Othman Abdul Rahim, a relative, told a TV channel that Saif al Islam was killed in his house by a group of four unidentified men.
“Four armed men stormed the residence of Saif al Islam Qadhafi after disabling surveillance cameras, then executed him,” Abdul Rahim said.
While Saif al Islam was well known in the north African country, especially for his role in shaping policy during his father’s rule, his public profile receded in recent years.
In 2015, a Libyan court passed a death sentence in absentia on Saif al Islam for suppressing peaceful protests during the country’s 2011 revolution that ended his father’s rule.
He was also provisionally charged by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity.
In 2021, Saif al Islam registered as a presidential candidate for a December vote that eventually collapsed amid a political deadlock.
Saif went from being his father’s heir apparent to a decade of captivity and obscurity in a remote hill town before launching a presidential bid that helped derail the attempted election in 2021.
Despite holding no official position, he was once seen as the most powerful figure after his father, who ruled for more than four decades.
He led talks on Libya abandoning its weapons of mass destruction and negotiated compensation for the families of those killed in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Scotland in 1988.

LAW Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar (left) and Leader of Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas speak during Tuesday’s session.—Dawn

• Opposition senators slam ‘denial of Imran’s rights’; Tarar tells opposition to approach court for relief concerning PTI founder’s medical care, jail meetings• Ministers detail measures to curb extremism; seek parliamentary debate on National Action Plan-II
ISLAMABAD: The opposition in the Senate was up in arms on Tuesday over what it termed the “denial of human rights” to former prime minister Imran Khan.
However, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told members that Mr Khan had been taken to Pims for a procedure on his own request, and assured the House that he had no health issues following treatment.
He said the federal government fully respected human rights and it had never issued any directive to deny medical treatment to any prisoner.
The law minister also assured the Senate that if any further medical need arose, all facilities would be provided as per law.
However, he hastened to add that any further relief concerning medical care, meetings or prison conditions must be sought through the high court, which was the competent appellate forum.
Earlier, Leader of Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas complained that Mr Khan’s imprisonment was “cruel and illegal”, and asked why was he deprived of his rights and why his family was not informed about his illness.
“A crime has been committed against him, as it is his fundamental right that he did not get,” Senator Abbas said.
He said there was concern among people all over the country over Mr Khan’s health, and described the ban on meetings with the PTI founder as the worst form of political victimisation and violation of human rights.
He expressed the fear that Mr Khan might lose his eyesight and emphasised that he should be checked by a doctor of his choice, and permitted to meet his family. The opposition leader also suggested that senators should visit him in jail.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said the fact that PTI founder underwent treatment in secret, and this was later revealed by the government, was a serious issue.
“We appealed that Mr Khan should be allowed to meet his personal physicians for a complete investigation. If it was a small procedure, the nation would be satisfied,” he said, adding that this meeting was not allowed.
Following this, Mr Khan’s doctors in a video message called the issue very serious in nature, showing concerns that he could face permanent damage to his eyesight, he added.
They recommended names of two experts who should be given access to Mr Khan for complete investigation, he said.
He said the doctors were not satisfied with the Pims report, and asked that two experts should be given access to Mr Khan immediately.
He also recalled that when PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif was diagnosed with low platelets, then-PM Imran Khan had said that he should get proper treatment and allowed doctors, even his personal physician, to examine him in jail.
“I am not talking about politics right now,” he said, urging the chair to direct Pims to provide them with Mr Khan’s medical report.
Unity in face of extremism
During Tuesday’s proceedings, two key ministers noted that complete national unity was imperative to effectively counter extremism.
During Question Hour, Inform­a­tion Minister Attaullah Tarar des­cribed the recent meeting between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM Sohail Afridi and PM Shehbaz Sharif as a positive development that would help strengthen coordination.
Mr Tarar said that cooperation between the federal government and the province was vital for improving the law & order situation.
He said this cooperation would convey a message of unity and help eliminate terrorism.
He informed the House that a Counter Violent Extremism Cell has been established in the information ministry and a third-party audit system has been put in place to assess the outreach and dissemination of the narrative generated by the cell.
Mr Tarar said that a fully functional digital communication department is working under the cell to counter extremist narratives through digital media.
He said the Paigham-i-Aman Committee, comprising scholars from all schools of thought, minority representatives and senior government officials, was actively working to promote peace and counter extremism in the country.
He said the committee was actively touring the country to promote a counter-narrative against extremism, violence, and terrorism. Giving the composition of the committee, he said the committee comprised several religious scholars and representatives of minority communities.
Spearately, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry also stres­sed the importance of national unity.
Speaking in the House, he noted that past success against terrorism had only been achieved when all political forces stood united behind the security forces, emphasising that similar unity was required once again to defeat extremism and terrorism.
Mr Chaudhry underlined the need for a full parliamentary debate on the 14-point National Action Plan-II (NAP-II), noting that the original NAP had been formulated after the Army Public School tragedy during the PML-N government and later revised during the PTI government with the consensus of all provinces.
He said the government was ready to present a detailed briefing on the implementation of all NAP-II points, including provincial and federal performance, if the House decided to allocate time for an in-depth discussion.
About the government’s broader strategy to counter extremism, he said that both kinetic and non-kinetic measures were being pursued simultaneously.

QUETTA: The number of terrorists killed in clearance operations across Balochistan has risen to 197, as security forces continued ‘mop-up’ actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province.
The clearance operations follow several coordinated terrorist attacks, staged across the province on Saturday.
In Nushki, armed men had attacked various government offices on Saturday, including a police station, judicial complex, police lines, DC office and an FC camp in the town, and set some government buildings on fire.
But while the town of Nushki has been cleared and bazaars reopened after three days, search operations by security forces are continuing in the mountainous areas of the district, officials told Dawn.
District police officials told Dawn that at least four more terrorists had been killed in clearance actions conducted so far.
They also indicated that the counterterrorism department had suffered casualties during the terror attacks over the weekend, but there was no official word on their exact number, or the identities of those martyred.
There were also reports of attacks in Awaran, but no loss of life was immediately reported.
Security forces are also conducting operations in the Washuk area, following attacks there and the burning of a police station and a Nadra office over the weekend.
IGP pays tribute
Separately, Inspector General of Police Mohammad Tahir said Balochistan police had rendered unparalleled sacrifices for the restoration of peace and protection of lives in the province, with many officers and personnel attaining martyrdom while thwarting the designs of terrorists.
Paying tribute to the fallen policemen, the IGP emphasised that lasting peace in Balochistan could only be achieved through close cooperation between the public and security forces, stressing that the police and the people stand united against terrorism.
He made these remarks during visits to various police facilities, including Sariab Police Station, New Sariab Police Station, Police Training College, Smart Police Station, Manzoor Tareen Shaheed and Khaliq Shaheed Police Station, where he reviewed security arrangements and overall performance.
CTD DIG Aitzaz Goraya, Quetta SSP Mohammad Asif Khan and other senior officers accompanied him.
Later, the IGP visited the Anti-Terrorism Force (ATF) headquarters, where he met officers and personnel and was briefed on operational challenges. Praising their high morale, professionalism and dedication to duty, he said the role of Balochistan police in the fight against terrorism has been commendable.
Reaffirming his resolve, IGP Tahir said the Balochistan police remains fully prepared and vigilant to counter all challenges and is utilising all available resources to ensure law and order.
He added that the force has consistently taken timely action against anti-state elements and will continue to safeguard the lives and property of citizens, pledging that no sacrifice would be spared. He said efforts are underway to enhance police capacity and equip the force with modern facilities.
Chinese condemnation
Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said on Tuesday that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism.
He made these remarks during a regular press briefing. “We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said.
“China firmly opposes any form of terrorism and will, as always, firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism, maintaining solidarity and social stability, and protecting the safety of the people,” he added.
On Monday, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan had also condemned the “recent multiple terrorist activities in Balochistan”.
In a post on X, the embassy said “we… deeply mourn for the lives lost, and extend sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured”.
