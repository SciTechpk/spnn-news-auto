• SHC to hear judge’s plea against cancellation of law degree today
ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench (CB) on Monday suspended an Islamabad High Court (IHC) order restraining Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from performing his judicial functions.
Following the decision, the IHC revised its duty roster and restored Justice Jahangiri to judicial work.
Before adjourning further proceedings until today (Tuesday), Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, a member of the five-judge CB, asked counsel on both sides to assist the court on how the IHC took up the matter without first deciding the objections raised by the court office when the petition was filed.
The bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Shahid Bilal Hassan, was hearing an appeal filed by Justice Jahangiri of the IHC, challenging the Sept 16 restraining order.
A two-judge division bench, headed by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, had issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition by Advocate Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution.
The petition questioned the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree from the University of Karachi and sought a writ of quo warranto, asking “by what authority” the judge holds judicial office.
Monday’s hearing in the packed Courtroom No. 4 was also attended by five IHC judges — senior puisne judge Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Raffat Imtiaz.
All entered the Supreme Court premises as ordinary litigants through the general reception area rather than using the entry reserved for judges and lawyers.
The five IHC judges have  already filed petitions challenging the administrative powers being exercised by the IHC chief justice, alleging that such powers have been used to undermine the judicial authority of high court judges.
During the proceedings, Justice Mandokhail recalled that the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) is scheduled to meet on Oct 18 to hear several complaints against superior court judges.
The CB made it clear that it would only examine the Sept 16 restraining order and not the main petition questioning Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
The order was suspended after the bench consulted among themselves after senior counsel Munir A. Malik, appearing for Justice Jahangiri, argued that allowing the IHC order to stand would send a damaging signal against the judiciary.
The original petitioner in the IHC, Mian Dawood, and Additional Attorney General Chaudhry Amir Rehman waived notices when the CB issued them.
When Munir Malik requested the suspension of the IHC’s unilateral order, Justice Aminuddin Khan remarked that the CB would not repeat the same mistake.
The counsel, however, insisted that the principle of comity required that the Sept 16 order be suspended.
After a brief consultation among themselves, the judges suspended the order and adjourned the hearing until Tuesday.
Duty roster revised
Following the CB order, the  IHC revised its duty roster and restored Justice Jahangiri to judicial  functions following the Supreme Court’s suspension of the order that had  earlier barred him from hearing cases. Justice Jahangiri had been  excluded from the sitting roster after being suspended by an IHC  division bench.
Earlier on Monday, Justice Jahangiri, along with  four other IHC judges, appeared before the Supreme Court. Following the  proceedings, the other judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar  Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — resumed their  scheduled benches and continued regular court business, while Justice  Jahangiri remained sidelined until the apex court’s decision.
The  revised duty roster issued for Tuesday formally re-included Justice  Jahangiri, confirming his return to judicial work after days of  suspension.
SHC hearing on petition
Meanwhile, the Sindh High Court (SHC) is set to hear a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri today (Tuesday), challenging the cancellation of his law degree.
Justice Jahangiri has impugned the decisions of KU’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate, which cancelled his degree in August last year.
The IHC judge recently approached the SHC, but at the time of filing, the court’s additional registrar (writ) raised several objections, including questions about the maintainability of the petition and the delay in filing it.
However, the IHC judge submitted that the court would be satisfied about these objections at the time of hearing of his petition.
The petition is fixed before a two-judge regular bench of the SHC comprising Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Justice Mohammad Abdur Rahman.
In his petition, Justice Jahangiri contended that the “illegal and mala fide” cancellation of his LLB degree occurred in the context of his “unflinching judicial independence”.
Justice Jahangiri claimed that when the campaign to have him removed through the SJC failed, “a new strategy” was adopted by misusing official processes and institutions. He said the degree cancellation became the basis for the IHC’s decision to restrain him from judicial duties.
He described the KU Unfair Means Committee’s decision as “shocking and surprising,” noting that the committee revived the issue after 32 years without issuing him a notice or providing reasons.
KBA appeal
Separately, Karachi Bar Association (KBA) President Amir Nawaz filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the SHC’s Sept 25 order, which had dismissed a set of petitions against the cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree over non-prosecution.
Filed through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi, the appeal argued that the SHC had erred by holding that the issue of maintainability had to be decided first before hearing applications for recusal or questions of jurisdiction of the SHC’s constitutional bench.
The petition contended that the SHC’s reasoning was irrational and illegal.

• JKJAAC, ‘peace rally’ participants accuse each other of fomenting violence
• Protest leaders call for another gathering at Lal Chowk today
MUZAFFARABAD: At least one person was killed and over a dozen others were injured — including a policeman — in the Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) capital on Monday, as the region observed a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike amid a communications blackout.
The strike, called by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) over the issue of its unfulfilled charter of demands, saw rival groups stage simultaneous protests, which accused each other of fomenting violence during an otherwise peaceful demonstration.
Mobile and internet services have remained suspended in AJK since Sunday noon, and sources said the curbs could continue until Wednesday.
The casualties occurred around Neelum Bridge after midday, when a ‘peace rally’ led by Muslim Conference leader Raja Saqib Majeed clashed with the JKJAAC protesters who were gathered there.
The strike was announced last week, after JKJAAC-government negotiations remained deadlocked over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
Witness accounts
Witnesses claimed that participants of the peace rally fired upon peaceful JKJAAC demonstrators “without any provocation”.
Ghulam Mustafa, a bystander, said one bullet hit Mohammad Sudheer, 30, who owned a crockery shop at Tahli Mandi Road. “By the time we reached CMH, he had lost consciousness due to excessive bleeding,” he said.
An official at the Combined Military Hospital confirmed that Sudheer died during treatment.
Mohammad Basharat, 50, a shopkeeper in Shokat Lines, was wounded by shrapnel.
He claimed that demonstrators had tried to make space to let Mr Majeed’s convoy pass, but said that members of his posse came out of their vehicles and attacked them.
According to another eyewitness, the peace rally was protected by police and paramilitary troops. Police lobbed tear-gas shell on JAC demonstrators, and fired at them.
People at the hospital showed spent bullet casings, which they said they had collected them from the ground while trying to rescue injured people.
“When the action committee had already given a call for lockdown for Sept 29, why was Mr Majeed allowed to hold a so-called peace march on the same day?” questioned 20-year-old shopkeeper Raja Safeer, who was among those in the emergency ward.
Due to the communications blackout, neither local officials nor Mr Majeed could not be reached for comment.
Incidentally, some local media reports suggested that the peace rally had been fired upon by JAC protesters, but this could not be independently verified.
Another gathering today
Later in the evening, hundreds of people gathered at Muzafarrabad’s Lal Chowk, where JAC leaders including Shaukat Nawaz Mir delivered charged speeches.
Mr Mir alleged that some elements wanted to create a May 9-like situation in AJK for reasons best known to them, and urged the army chief to take stock of the situation.
Mr Mir called on the charged crowd to reassemble at the same spot at 11am today (Tuesday) for the next course of action.
All businesses and shops remained shuttered and street vendors away almost across the AJK, while roads also remained deserted.
Reports also suggested that similar gatherings were staged in Rawalakot and Sudhnoti, while in Bhimber, a rally was led by PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq’s brother, Ehsanul Haq, who is associated with the PTI.

Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chairs a meeting with the visiting IMF review mission at the Finance Division.—APP

ISLAMABAD: An Inter­n­ational Monetary Fund (IMF) mission led by Iva Petrova held a formal kick-off meeting with Pakistan’s economic team, headed by Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb, to review the implementation of the $7bn Extended Financing Facility (EFF) and the $1.1bn Resilience & Sustainability Facility (RSF).
The programme’s performance as of end-June 2025 — the period under review — has been mixed. The start of the next review period, ending December this year, has also been off the mark, particularly in revenue collection. The two sides now have to agree on corrective measures during their dialogue to meet the next biannual targets.
The opening session was attended by key economic stakeholders, including the State Bank of Pakistan governor, finance secretary and chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
 
 

While power sector benchmarks for the end-June 2025 period were comfortably met, revenue collection fell short by about Rs1.2 trillion — almost 1pc of GDP — in the last fiscal year, and the first two months of the current fiscal year have shown similar shortfalls.
The mission will remain in Pakistan for almost two weeks and will also hold forward-looking discussions with the authorities to push for faster implementation of the end-December 2025 targets.
Pakistan is also raising with the IMF a long-delayed implementation of the brownfield petroleum refinery policy, which has stalled about $6bn in fresh investment for refinery upgrades. Officials argue that this demand aligns with the RSF’s objectives because the upgrade would help produce petroleum products meeting European standards with minimal carbon and sulphur emissions.
 
 

The policy was announced about two years ago in consultation with the industry, which was in the process of signing binding contracts. However, under the IMF programme, the authorities committed not to grant any tax exemptions that had already been promised to refineries. As a result, although petroleum products are exempt from sales tax, the required equipment, materials and supplies are subject to sales tax and other duties without input-output adjustments, creating serious cash flow problems for the refineries.
The Petroleum Division has argued that existing refineries produce environmentally harmful by-products both during refining and consumption, posing health risks and worsening climate conditions.
Officials said that while the government has been seeking RSF funding for various projects, it has been losing out domestically due to obsolete refining technology because of what they termed a “technical misunderstanding” between the IMF, the Ministry of Finance and the FBR. “This is a simple distortion that can be addressed through reasonable dialogue,” one official said.
At the same time, while the government has asked the IMF to consider flood losses when assessing programme performance, sources said the review is based on pre-flood targets. Therefore, the authorities remain accountable for the end-June 2025 performance, although relaxations could be considered later based on verifiable estimates of flood damage.
FBR officials believe that their first-quarter revenue shortfall could be offset by higher inflation in the second quarter and improved recoveries from litigation cases that are in their final stages.
The government reportedly utilised one-third of the Rs390bn budget allocation for natural disasters and emergencies in 2025-26 to clear Rs130bn in past dues owed to commercial banks for incentives and fees paid for attracting remittances through banking channels. The authorities will now have to justify these payments from the emergency fund as they seek relaxations from the IMF over flood-related expenses. Moreover, the government has not allocated any funds in the current year’s budget for such incentives, despite estimating that about Rs100bn will be required for this purpose.
The sources said the authorities want the IMF to relax conditions for the primary budget surplus and fiscal deficit to create space for flood-related spending without imposing new taxes or cutting development expenditures.
The authorities have missed FBR revenue targets, as well as taxation targets for the retail sector and provincial cash surpluses for the end-June 2025 period, and could face a tough time during negotiations.
The government has also failed to publish the governance and corruption diagnostic report, which remains pending review and publication. As a result, the associated governance action plan is stalled. Similarly, the state-owned enterprises (SOE) governance-related law has not progressed in line with commitments made to the IMF.
Although the authorities successfully enacted agricultural income tax laws across all provinces on time, their implementation and collection — expected to begin in Sept-Oct — remain uncertain, particularly due to the ongoing floods in Punjab and Sindh. Consequently, the authorities are still unclear about the scale of required support for flood-affected populations, sectors and facilities.
On the positive side, Pakistan has met almost all quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2025. However, it is lagging behind in indicative targets and structural benchmarks, which could affect future programme implementation. Given the biannual reviews of the $7bn EFF and the $1.1bn RSF, the two sides will have to agree on past performance as well as forward-looking implementation plans.
Upon the successful completion of the review, Pakistan will be eligible for the disbursement of about $1bn (760 million Special Drawing Rights) by the end of next month.

Gaza will be a de-radicalised terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.
Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.
If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.
Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all [prisoners], alive and deceased, will be returned.
Once all [prisoners] are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1,700 Gazans who were detained after Oct 7, 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.


As released by the White House


Once all [prisoners] are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.
Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the Jan 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.
Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the Jan. 19, 2025, agreement.
Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.

This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the “Board of Peace,” which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair.
This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump’s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.

A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.
A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.
No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.
Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.
A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.
The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A de-confliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.
Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and time frames linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the United States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.
In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.
An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence to try and change mind-sets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.
While Gaza redevelopment advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.
The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.

In less than two years, Israel’s onslaught on Gaza has killed at least 65,549 people and wounded 167,518, besides displacing millions from their areas. Earlier this month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement.
Trump announced Netanyahu’s agreement to his plan at a press conference in Washington, DC, ahead of which the White House had released Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza.
 






Addressing the press conference, Trump said this was a “big, big day”.

“The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were
with us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a
statement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump stated. “They
back this 100 per cent.

“Things that have been going on for hundreds of years, thousands of years … at minimum, we are very, very close and beyond very close,” Trump said, thanking Netanyahu for his role in the peace process. “We worked well together, and have with many other countries, which is how this situation gets solved.”
Trump said that he was aiming for peace in the Middle East at large, not just the Gaza Strip. He added that he and Netanyahu discussed issues like Iran, the Abraham Accords and ending the Gaza conflict.
“This is part of the bigger picture, which is peace in the Middle East … let’s call it ‘eternal’ peace in the Middle East,” he said.
 
  @dawn.today United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is visiting the White House, is “very close” to agreeing on a deal to end the Gaza conflict. Addressing a press conference, Trump said this was a “big, big day”. “The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were with us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a statement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump stated. “They back this 100 per cent.” The US president also thanked Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan and for “trusting that if we work together, we can bring an end to the death and destruction” in the region.

“After extensive consultation with our friends and partners throughout the region, I am formally releasing our principles for peace,” Trump announced, adding that people “have really liked” them.
“These are done with total consideration and working with the nations we are talking about,” he added. “I want to thank the leaders of many Arab and Muslim nations for their tremendous support in developing the proposal, as well as our allies in Europe.
The US president also thanked Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan and for “trusting that if we work together, we can bring an end to the death and destruction” in the region.
“If accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages immediately, but in no case, more than 72 hours,” Trump said. “The hostages are coming back.”
Trump said this means “an immediate end to the war itself”.
“Under the plan, Arab and Muslim countries have committed … to demilitarise Gaza quickly, decommission the military capabilities of Hamas and all other terror organisations and we are relying on the countries we named and others  to deal with Hamas and I’m hearing Hamas wants to get this done too.”
‘New transitional authority’
Trump added that as part of the agreement, “terror infrastructure”, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, would be dismantled and local police forces would be trained in the Gaza Strip.
“Working with the new transitional authority in Gaza, all parties will agree on a timeline for Israeli forces to withdraw in phases … no more shooting hopefully,” Trump stated.
“Arab and Muslim nations need to be allowed a chance of fulfilling these commitments of dealing with Hamas. They are the one group I have not dealt with,” he added. “If Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible … I have a feeling that we’re going to have a positive answer, but if not, as you know Bibi (Netanyahu) you have my full backing to do what you have to do.
 


The US president emphasised that ultimately, the goal is to eliminate any danger in the reason, which he attributed to Hamas.
“To ensure the success of this effort, my plan calls for the creation of a new international oversight body,” he said, calling it the ‘Board of Peace’ and stating that it would be led by Arab leaders, Israel and Trump himself.
“We’re going to do it right, we’re going to put leaders from other countries on and leaders who are very distinguished,” Trump said. “One of the people who wants to be on the Board is the UK former prime minister Tony Blair.”
Trump said there would be more leaders and that their names would be announced in the coming days.
He added that the World Bank would be charged with training and recruiting a new government made up of Palestinians and “highly qualified experts from around the world”.
“Hamas and other terror organisations will play no role in the governance of Gaza, at all,” he stated. “It’s time to get our hostages back and try to build something very great and very important.”
However, Trump noted that Netanyahu remains opposed to a Palestinian state but said what he is doing today would be good for Israel. He added that the Israeli public wanted an end to the fighting and the return of the hostages.
“Some other countries have foolishly recognised a Palestinian state … but I think they’re very tired of what’s [been] going on for so many decades,” he said. “The people of Israel want it (an end to the fighting).
“I challenge the Palestinians to take charge of their destiny,” Trump added. “If the Palestinian Authority does not complete my reforms … they only have themselves to blame.”
‘Maybe, Iran can join the Abraham Accords’
Trump added that this agreement would bring a sustainable, long-term peace and added that “maybe Iran can even get in there”, in relation to the Abraham Accords.
“They could be a member,” Trump added. “I long ago said that Iran would be a member of the Accords.
“This is the closest we’ve ever come to real peace.”
“The leaders discussed a proposal for ending the war in Gaza, prospects for a more secure Middle East, and the need for greater understanding between their countries,” the White House said before a news conference with Trump and the Israeli prime minister.
Trump added that Netanyahu expressed regret for an Israeli attack in Doha to Qatar’s leader in a three-way call in the Oval Office.
“Bibi was talking to Prime Minister al-Thani of Qatar … they really had a heart-to-heart conversation,” the US president said. “We agreed to launch a formal trilateral mechanism between Israel, Qatar and the United States to begin a dialogue to enhance mutual security, correct misperceptions and avoid future misgivings.”
Trump said it was time for Hamas to accept the terms of the proposal, noting that with their leadership mostly killed during the Gaza conflict, Hamas were “not the same people” the US was dealing with.
“Everybody who wants to see an end to the violence and destruction should be united and calling for Hamas to accept the extremely fair proposal, so that we can end the war and get us back our hostages right now and have everlasting peace,” Trump declared.
A new beginning for Gaza and the region: Netanyahu
Taking the floor, Netanyahu thanked Trump for his hospitality and for his friendship and leadership.
“While you focus at home on making America great again, your leadership abroad is changing the world for the better: ending wars and advancing peace,” the Israeli PM said.
“I believe that today, we are taking a critical step towards both ending the war in Gaza and setting the stage for dramatically advancing peace in the Middle East and I think beyond the Middle East — very important Muslim countries.
“I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims,” Netanyahu said to Trump. “It will bring back to Israel all of our hostages, dismantle Hamas’ military capabilities and its political rule and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.”

Netanyahu added that the plan would not have been achieved without the “courage and sacrifice of our incredibly brave soldiers”, calling the conflict “a war between civilisation and barbarism”.
“We are taking the next step to win the war and expand the peace,” he stated. “Your (Trump’s) plan is consistent with the five principles my government set for the end of the war and the day after Hamas.
“Here’s our plan: all of our hostages, both those who are alive and those who died, will return home immediately. Hamas will be disarmed. Gaza will be demilitarised. Israel will retain security responsibility, including a security perimeter for the foreseeable future. And lastly, Gaza will have a peaceful civilian administration that is run neither by Hamas, or the Palestinian Authority.”
Netanyahu said that if Hamas agrees to the plan, the first step would be a “modest withdrawal” and the release of all hostages within 72 hours.
“The next step will be the establishment of an international body charged with fully disarming Hamas and demilitarising Gaza,” he added, expressing appreciation for Trump leading the body.
“If this international body succeeds, we will have permanently ended the war. Israel will conduct further withdrawals linked to the extent of disarmament and demilitarisation, but will remain within the security perimeter for the foreseeable future.”
However, Netanyahu said that if Hamas rejects or violates the agreement, then Israel “will finish the job by itself”.
“This can be done the easy way … or the hard way, but it will be done. We prefer the easy way, but it has to be done.”
Netanyahu added that after Trump’s statement at the UN General Assembly, he was encouraged against recognising Palestine, stating that it would “reward terrorists, undermine security and endanger Israel’s very existence”.
“I appreciate your (Trump’s) firm position that the PA can have no role in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,” he stated.
Netanyahu said that there needs to be a fundamental change, which would include ending “pay-to-slay”, changing Palestinian textbooks that “teach hatred [of] Jews”, ending “lawfare” at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court and stopping incitement in the media among “many, many other reforms”.
He added that Trump’s proposal presents a “practical and realistic path forward” in which Gaza would be administered by “those committed to genuine peace with Israel”.
“I think this can be not only a new beginning for Gaza [but] a new beginning for the entire region,” the Israeli PM said, adding that the plan could reenergise the Abraham Accords.
PM Shehbaz welcomes Gaza plan
Earlier, PM Shehbaz said in a post on X that he welcomed Trump’s plan to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end.
His statement came as the US president greeted Netanyahu at the White House for talks on the US-led peace plan. Before the meeting, Trump had told reporters he was “very confident” that there would be peace in Gaza.
 






Asked if all parties were on board with his 21-point plan, he repeated, “very confident”.
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz posted on X: “I welcome President Trump’s 20-point [sic] plan to ensure an end to the war in Gaza.
“I am also convinced that durable peace between the Palestinian people and Israel would be essential in bringing political stability and economic growth to the region,” the PM wrote.
He added, “It is also my firm belief that President Trump is fully prepared to assist in whatever way necessary to make this extremely important and urgent understanding to become a reality.”
PM Shehbaz also lauded “Trump’s leadership and [his] special envoy Steve Witkoff for their efforts in bringing an end to the nearly two-year-long conflict”.
“I also strongly believe that the implementation of the two-state proposal is essential to ensure lasting peace in the region,” he added.
Earlier in the day, he also spoke to Pakistani journalists in London, where he spoke about Trump’s meeting with Muslims leaders on Gaza in New York last week.
The meeting on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly had brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, and Indonesia, who discussed Trump’s proposal for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza.
During his interaction with journalists in London today, PM Shehbaz “a very constructive discussion took place” at the meeting. He added, “As a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire.”

According to a Financial Times, the former British premier is seeking a senior role in running the war-torn territory under a plan being prepared by US President Donald Trump’s administration. The report by the British daily quoted an anonymous source privy to the details as saying that Blair had been “proposed as the chair of the board of a ‘Gaza International Transitional Authority (Gita)’”.
Meanwhile, a BBC report said this governing authority would have the support of the United Nations and Gulf countries. Blair would lead the body before handing back control to Palestinians, it added, and further quoted his office as saying that he would not support any proposal including the displacement of Gazans.
Earlier, The Telegraph had reported that a plan — which also envisioned the establishment of Gita — prepared by the ex-PM’s Tony Blair Institute (TBI) for Gaza, had Trump’s backing.
These reports emerged after Blair visited the White House in late August to participate in a meeting presided over by Trump. The meeting was called to discuss the ongoing Israeli invasion of Gaza, as well as post-war plans for the Palestinian territory.
If these developments lead to Blair assuming a prominent role in governing the Gaza post war, the question may arise whether he is the right person for the job, particularly in light of his role in the 2003 Iraq war.
Blair in office
Blair won his first term in office in 1997 as his Labour party swept to power after a gap of 18 years. It marked the inception of Blair’s decade-long premiership, during which he would see two more electoral wins.
A BBC report that outlined his tenure in the top office described the Labour party that came into power in 1997 as a “product of a tight-knit group” headed by Blair, his immediate successor in office, Gordon Brown, media chief Alastair Campbell, and British politician Peter Mandelson.
The report further described Blair’s first cabinet as a “mix of old and new Labour figures” in which “the hard left was banished to the wilderness”.
“And it quickly became clear that only Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown really mattered when it came to the big decisions […] Ministers seemed to come and go with dizzying speed, as the cabinet reshuffle became Blair’s signature move.”
Blair’s government gave Britain 10 years of steady economic growth, boosted employment, poured money into schools and hospitals and brought peace to Northern Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement, to put it briefly. In 2004, his government also pressed ahead with plans to open the United Kingdom’s doors to Eastern European migrants.
But there were downsides, too, especially in terms of foreign policy.
Role in Iraq war
One of the most significant factors defining Blair’s time in power was his role in the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. He led Britain into the war — a move that has been singled out as his biggest failure as the premier.
After the 9/11 attacks in 2001 in New York, Blair had expressed support for the US, saying the UK would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Washington. Two years later, the UK would join the US in launching a war in Iraq.
The two main US-British arguments in favour of the war were that then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein possessed deployable weapons of mass destruction and posed an immediate or near-term threat to the region, as well as to the US and the UK.
A BBC report report recalls that in 2003, “Blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for joining the US-led invasion to MPs and the wider public”.
However, the caucus belli began evaporating soon. A Guardian report recounts that just around a month into the war, then-UK spy chief Sir John Scarlett went to Blair’s press secretary Alastair Campbell’s office and asked: “How difficult would it be if it transpired we do not find evidence of Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction programme?”
Campbell’s reply was, “Very, very, very difficult.”
The then-press secretary’s words would come true for Blair in the years to come when a public inquiry into Britain’s role in the Iraq war would release its findings.
Led by John Chilcot, a five-member committee began investigating the matter in 2009 and conclude seven years later that Britain’s decision to go to war in Iraq was a failure born of flawed intelligence, lack of foresight and “wholly inadequate” planning.
 
 

The Chilcot inquiry, as it came to be known, found that Blair’s decision in 2003 had a “far from satisfactory” legal basis and his case for military action was over-hyped.
These findings were released nine years after Blair stepped down as the prime minister in 2007, with his popularity plunging, in which his decision to join the Iraq War seemingly played an instrumental role.
The legacy
Blair, who had told cheering supporters after his landslide victory in 1997: “A new dawn has broken”, went from being the most popular prime minister in British history to one of the least.
When he came to power, his Downing Street residence was “Corporate Headquarters of Cool Britannia”. In 2007, as he prepared to step down, polls showed the British were affluent but disillusioned.
The charismatic politician promising to be “purer than pure” ended up the first British prime minister to be quizzed by police in a criminal inquiry, as detectives probed to see if loans were offered to parties in exchange for state honours.
On taking power, Blair had said: “Mine is the first generation able to contemplate the possibility that we may live our entire lives without going to war or sending our children to war.”
But by the time he left office, from Afghanistan to Iraq, from Kosovo to Sierra Leone, he had sent British troops into battle more than any other preceding British prime minister since World War II.
For novelist Robert Harris, the decade of Blair leading Britain was a tragedy. “Blair was of my generation, and this was our shot, if you like. I won’t say we’ve messed it up, but it perhaps hasn’t lived up to all the expectations of that rosy-fingered dawn of May 1, 1997.”
And after 10 years interviewing and observing Blair, BBC documentary-maker Michael Cockerell had encapsulated the paradoxes of Blair’s emotional relationship with the British people. “It began when the charismatic prime minister swept people off their feet. But the early glow has long since dimmed, and at the end of the affair, both sides are sadder but wiser,” he had said.
Quartet’s Middle East envoy
After leaving Downing Street, Blair served as the Middle East envoy for a group of international powers, the Quartet, comprising the US, European Union, Russia and the United Nations. The group’s website says its mandate “is to help mediate Middle East peace negotiations and to support Palestinian economic development and institution building”.
But according to a report by Al Jazeera, given his role in the Iraq war, Blair was not seen as the right person to facilitate peace in the Middle East right from the start.
Francis Beckett, a political writer and co-author of ‘Blair Inc: The Man Behind the Mask’, pointed out to Al Jazeera that “most fatally of all, the difficulty was that when he went to meetings in the Middle East, nobody knew which Tony Blair they were seeing — whether it was Tony Blair the Quartet envoy or Tony Blair the patron of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation or Tony Blair the principle of the consultancy firm Tony Blair Associates”.
Al Jazeera reported that Blair’s dealings after the end of his time as the prime minister included “advising Arab governments and consultancy work for the US investment bank JP Morgan”.
These dealings, “reportedly netted him millions of pounds” and “left him exposed to accusations of greed from many hardened critics, including those from within the party he led from 1994 to 2007”.
Blair’s reported plan for Gaza
Blair quit as the Middle envoy for the Quartet in 2015 and set up a non-profit organisation, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the very next year.
According to The Telegraph, the same organisation has now come up with a proposal to establish “a temporary body to rule Gaza, with no displacement of civilians, and a multinational effort to prevent the resurgence of Hamas”.
The British daily reported, citing sources, that the plan is known as the “day after”, on which Blair has been working since Israel began its genocide in Gaza in October 2023.
The report details that the plan includes the establishment of a Property Rights Preservation Unit, “which would aim to strengthen the rights of Gazans who voluntarily leave the territory by giving them a right to return”.
It also mentions the creation of Gita, which, it says, “would rule the post-war strip for several years before handing it over to the Palestinian Authority, which would be expected to undergo significant reforms beforehand”.
Meanwhile, questions over Blair’s potential role in running Gaza after the war remain.
A recent report by Al Jazeera highlighted: “Palestinian commentators have also said Blair failed them as (Middle East) peace envoy despite the quintessential British role in the conflict stretching over a century.
They have argued that while he oversaw economic projects during his tenure, he did little to halt illegal Israeli settlement expansion and settler violence, or advance Palestinian statehood, with some even accusing him of impeding statehood as a friend of Israel.“</p><small>2025-09-29 20:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29231943fdaa0b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945471/us-to-impose-100pc-tariff-on-movies-made-outside-the-country-trump' target='_blank'><strong>US to impose 100pc tariff on movies made outside the country: Trump</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday he would impose a 100 per cent tariff on all films produced overseas that are then sent into the US, repeating a threat made in May that would upend Hollywood’s global business model.
The step signals Trump’s willingness to extend protectionist trade policies into cultural industries, raising uncertainty for studios that depend heavily on cross-border co-productions and international box-office revenue.
“Our movie-making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing candy from a baby,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social.
However, it was not immediately clear what legal authority Trump would use to impose a 100pc tariff on foreign-made films.
The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on how the tariffs would be implemented.
Top US studios Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Skydance and Netflix also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Comcast declined to comment.
“There is too much uncertainty, and this latest move raises more questions than answers,” said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore.
“For now, as things stand, costs are likely to increase, and this will inevitably be passed on to consumers,” he said.
The president had first floated the idea of a movie tariff in May but offered few details, leaving entertainment executives unsure whether it would apply to specific countries or all imports.
 
 

After the announcement in May, a coalition of American film unions and guilds sent a letter to Trump, urging him to support tax incentives for domestic film production in a reconciliation package being drafted in Congress, aiming to help return more movie and television projects to the US.
The US film industry recorded a $15.3 billion trade surplus in 2023, backed by $22.6bn in exports to international markets, according to the Motion Picture Association.
From Australia to Canada
Studio executives told Reuters earlier this year that they were “flummoxed” by how a movie tariff might be enforced, given that modern films often use production, financing, post-production and visual effects spread across multiple countries.
Hollywood has increasingly relied on overseas production hubs such as Canada, the UK and Australia, where tax incentives have attracted big-budget shoots for films ranging from superhero blockbusters to streaming dramas.
At the same time, co-productions with foreign studios have become more common, particularly in Asia and Europe, where local partners provide financing, access to markets, and distribution networks.
Industry executives also warn that a broad tariff could affect the thousands of US workers employed on overseas shoots, from visual effects artists to production crews, whose work is often coordinated across multiple countries.</p><small>2025-09-29 18:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/291936030974223.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945460/taliban-authorities-shut-down-communications-across-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Taliban authorities shut down communications across Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Taliban authorities on Monday imposed a nationwide shutdown of communications, weeks after they began severing fibre optic connections to prevent “vice”.
Connectivity was operating at less than one per cent of its normal levels, according to internet watchdog Netblocks, who called it a “comprehensive, or total blackout”.
 






In the minutes before it happened, a government official told AFP the shutdown would last “until further notice”.
“It is going to be cut, it will happen gradually tonight, there are eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars it will shut down,” he told AFP on condition of anonymity.
“There isn’t any other way or system to communicate… the banking sector, customs, everything across the country will be affected.”
AFP lost contact with its bureau in the capital Kabul around 5:45pm (6:15 pm PKT), including mobile phone service.
Afhanistan’s Taliban authorities began a crackdown on internet access earlier this month, severing connections in multiple provinces.
The move, ordered by Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, effectively shut down high-speed internet in several regions.
Fibre optic internet was completely banned in northern Balkh province on the leader’s orders, provincial spokesman Attaullah Zaid said on September 16.
“This measure was taken to prevent vice, and alternative options will be put in place across the country to meet connectivity needs,” he wrote on social media.
At the time, AFP correspondents reported the same restrictions in the northern provinces of Badakhshan and Takhar, as well as in Kandahar, Helmand, Nangarhar and Uruzgan in the south.
Over the past several weeks, internet connections have been extremely slow or intermitant.
In 2024, Kabul had touted the 9,350-kilometre fibre optic network — largely built by former US-backed governments — as a “priority” to bring the country closer to the rest of the world and lift it out of poverty.
Since regaining power in 2021, the Taliban have instituted numerous restrictions in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic law.</p><small>2025-09-29 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29210907c1e7f5f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945468/pakistani-imprisoned-in-india-repatriated-via-attari-wagah-border' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani imprisoned in India repatriated via Attari-Wagah border</strong></a><br><p>Raqib Bilal, a Pakistani national imprisoned in India, was repatriated via the Attari-Wagah border on Monday, according to the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi.
“Consistent with the vision of the government, [the high commission] will continue to make every effort for the repatriation of all Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails,” the high commission wrote in a post on X.
 






Dawn.com approached Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan for comment and he confirmed the development, stating that a Pakistani national imprisoned in India has been released.
In July, the foreign ministries of Islamabad and New Delhi exchanged lists detailing the number of prisoners held in each other’s countries.
According to a statement from the FO, “The government of Pakistan handed over a list of 246 Indian or believed-to-be-Indian prisoners (53 civilian prisoners and 193 fishermen) to a representative of the Indian High Commission, Islamabad.
“Simultaneously, the government of India shared a list of 463 Pakistani or believed-to-be-Pakistani prisoners (382 civilian prisoners and 81 fishermen) to a diplomat from the High Commission for Pakistan, New Delhi.”
 






As many as 23,456 Pakistanis are currently behind bars overseas, with the largest number of inmates, 12,156, being held in Saudi Arabia, the FO informed the National Assembly in May.</p><small>2025-09-29 16:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/292030439b592b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945463/it-is-punjabs-water-maryam-resurrects-cholistan-canals-issue-amid-rift-with-ppp' target='_blank'><strong>‘It is Punjab’s water’: Maryam resurrects Cholistan canals issue amid rift with PPP</strong></a><br><p>In her latest censure of the PPP, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday resurrected the issue of the contentious Cholistan canals project, saying the water that would have been diverted towards the desert belonged to her province.
“If Punjab wants construct canals for its water, why are you bothered? It is Punjab’s water. It belongs to the people, farmers and fields of Punjab,” she said at the inauguration ceremony of an electric bus service in Faisalabad.
“If I want to create canals, why do you object to it?” she questioned. “I wouldn’t have stolen water. I would have [used] them to create waterways and developed Cholistan,” she continued, taking a fresh jibe at her party’s coalition partner in the Centre.
The now-shelved canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between the Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively.
The project aimed to irrigate a total of 4.8 million acres of barren land by constructing six canals — two each in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab. Five of those canals would have been built on the Indus River, while the sixth would have been constructed along the Sutlej River, supplying approximately 4,120 cusecs of water to irrigate the Cholistan desert in Punjab.
Maryam and Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir had inaugurated the project to irrigate south Punjab’s lands on February 15 amid public uproar and strong reservations in Sindh. What was being hailed as a game-changer for Punjab had triggered an uproar in Sindh, which believed the scheme would have further disturb the ecological balance in the province and deprived it of its mandated water share.
After months of protests from various fragments of society as well as opposition from Sindh, the federal government had announced on April 23 that it was halting the project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the Council of Common Interests — a key body tasked with resolving power-sharing disputes between the federal and provincial governments. The decision came amid uncertainty created by India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.
Then, on April 28, CCI meeting had endorsed the federal government’s move to halt the initiative until “mutual understanding” could be achieved among provinces.
As Maryam resurrected the issue during her speech again, the Punjab CM mentioned flood relief and the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) — the latest cause of dispute between the PPP and PML-N over flood relief.
The PPP and PML-N have lately been arguing over the means for flood relief, with the PPP insisting on the use of BISP and the PML-N disapproving the proposition.
Reiterating her argument that funds given under the BISP were insufficient for flood relief, she, once again rejected the PPP’s proposition to seek international assistance to help people affected by recent floods in Punjab.
“Keep your advice to yourself,” she rebuked, adding the seeking international help was not the only solution.
“Punjab never interferes in your matters, so you don’t interfere in Punjab’s matters,” she said.</p><small>2025-09-29 16:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29173045c71051e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945431/pm-defends-trumps-nobel-prize-nomination-credits-him-for-easing-regional-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>PM defends Trump’s Nobel Prize nomination, credits him for easing regional tensions</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday said his government nominated US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize because “he helped save the region from destruction” during a period of Pakistan-India escalation.
The Pakistani government in June had decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” to end the India-Pakistan escalation in May. The conflict began after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, launched airstrikes in Pakistan, and faced retaliation.
Amid easing tensions following a ceasefire bet­ween India and Pakistan, Presi­dent Donald Trump claimed that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations.
Responding to a reporter’s question about Pakistan nominating Trump for the Nobel Prize during a press conference in London today, the PM said, “Mr Trump eased tension between Pakistan and India and has saved the region from major destruction.”
He emphasised that if Trump had not intervened in the Pakistan-India escalation, “there would be more destruction and loss of lives.”
The premier added that Trump has eased tension between Ethiopia and Egypt, and even in Ukraine.”
‘Washington visit very fruitful’
Speaking about his recent meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly, PM Shehbaz said that his visit to Washington “was very fruitful; it was very successful.”
He said the best thing that happened was that in the UN building, President Trump co-chaired a meeting on Gaza, and he invited Pakistan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia.
“There, a very constructive discussion took place, and as a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire,” he said.
“Since 2023 in Gaza, the market of oppression and tyranny has been heated, and innocent Muslims are being martyred, including children, mothers, sisters, and youngsters. I believe that this much cruelty and intensity has rarely been witnessed in modern times, and for that, alhamdulillah, we have raised a strong voice at the UN and expressed complete solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters.”
Conflict with India
PM Shehbaz said that during his meeting with Trump, he also talked about the escalation with India, and how New Delhi weaponised the Indus Waters Treaty against the people of Pakistan.
“[I talked about] the way our forces defeated India and, by the grace of Almighty Allah, made India learn a lesson which they will remember for a lifetime,” he said.
“I also said that Pakistan won the war, by the grace of God, through our brave armed forces, who fought with great courage and outstanding professional equipment, led by Field Marshal Saeed Asim Munir, who led from the front and whose resolve was unwavering, and the entire nation was behind our own forces.
“And our air forces, led by Air Marshal Zaheer Babar and his brave fighters, made a strong defence. The world came to realise that not only is Pakistan a nuclear power, but purely meant for our defence. And now the purpose: Pakistan is also very accomplished in traditional warfare, conservative warfare.”
2025 floods
The premier said that while the country’s economy had become stabilised on a macro level, the effects of climate change were taking their toll.
He talked about the massive floods in the country that have struck both the rural heartland and industrial centres for the first time in decades, causing billions of dollars in damage while straining food supplies, exports and a fragile economic recovery.
“Unfortunately, due to climate change, which caused the recent floods, there has been much destruction,” he said.
“In 2022, it caused devastation in Sindh; this time Punjab became the target of this flood due to which more than 1,000 people lost their lives, hundreds of thousands of people were injured, thousands of remote areas were submerged, farms were destroyed, and installations suffered immense damage, for which, at this time, we are collecting data to see how much loss has occurred.
“But our spirits are high and we are facing this completely, and Inshallah we will overcome this and move forward,” he said.</p><small>2025-09-29 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29190531dcfe655.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945454/na-passes-resolution-condemning-alleged-verbal-abuse-of-senior-journalist-by-pti-founder' target='_blank'><strong>NA passes resolution condemning alleged verbal abuse of senior journalist by PTI founder</strong></a><br><p>Members of the Parliamentary Reporters Association of Pakistan (PRA) on Monday staged a mass walkout from a session of the National Assembly, over senior journalist Ijaz Ahmed allegedly being subjected to misbehaviour by PTI founder Imran Khan.
According to Ahmed, who spoke to Dawn.com, the walkout was organised by the PRA Pakistan’s Election Committee.
“[The] PTI founder hurled abuse at me for asking questions,” Ahmed said.
National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq directed Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to hold talks with PRA. During the walkout, the speaker noted that the PRA submitted a written complaint over the issue, which Tarar spoke about during his address.
 


Later, the National Assembly released visuals of Ahmed meeting with Speaker Sadiq in his office.
 






“It is your (reporters) right to protest and politics and journalism have a deep relationship,” the minister said, requesting that the reporters listen to what he has to say. “You have a valid complaint.”
“A senior member of the PRA was involved in a verbal altercation at Adiala Jail with a senior leader who hurled foul language at him,” the law minister stated, not mentioning the PTI founder by name.
“It is the job of reporters and journalists to criticise us and show us our reflection in the mirror. We should take this criticism to heart and not silence or attack them.”
Tarar said that Ahmed requested the speaker’s office for permission to speak with Imran at Adiala and requested protection.
“After the discussion and the way he (Ahmed) was abused, there was a social media onslaught targeting him,” Tarar added. “Posts said ‘Look at this man’s face’, ‘don’t forgive him’ and ‘look what he said about our Quaid’.
“This is a distinguished House and I must request that we behave democratically,” he said. “We need to prove through our own attitudes that we listen to other people and that there is room for decency and politics in this House.”
PPP lawmaker Shazia Marri noted in her address that Ahmed is a renowned journalist in Islamabad and has links to Sindh.
“In terms of his reporting, he is a decent journalist,” she said. “We may have differences of opinion, but in terms of his reporting and ethics, he is commendable.”
Marri added that journalists expose problems plaguing the country and face issues while doing so. She also condemned people posting Ahmed’s face on social media and “making him a target of hate”.
“We keep saying that they criticise politicians, but we criticise each other for not protecting journalists. Why do we forget to offer them protection?”
After a recess, Ahmed himself spoke on the floor of the House and said that he had gone to Adiala Jail on the speaker’s request and heard from Khan about his treatment at Adiala Jail.
“We told him that we would speak about this on the floor of the House,” Ahmed said.
“He (Imran) had two demands: the first being that Ahmed speak about how no PTI members were part of an opposition delegation to visit him in jail. The other was that he wanted a resolution passed about this incident.”
Imran also demanded that the Sindh government launch a “high-level investigation” into the murder of anchorperson Imtiaz Mir.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) MNA Syed Aminul Haque, who was a part of the delegation, alleged that Imran hurled threats and foul language at Ahmed.
 


“Immediately afterwards, we saw him being trolled on social and digital media,” Haque said, adding that the MQM condemned the incident. “People were trying to get his address and threaten his family. Journalists have a right to ask questions. People are free not to answer, but to threaten them and be rude is undemocratic.”
A resolution was presented before the House condemning the verbal altercation and stating that not only did Imran use harsh language, but also launched a social media campaign against Ahmed and other senior journalists.
It demanded that Ahmed and other journalists receive immediate protection, legal action be taken against those responsible and also condemned Mir’s murder in Karachi, demanding an investigation into the shooting.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, however, requested that the resolution not be presented because it would “ruin the atmosphere of the House”.
“We pay tribute to the media; they have played a key role in highlighting our struggles and raising their voices for the people,” he said. “I was not able to meet [Imran] Khan sahib, so I wanted to know what happened. I reached to three of their (PRA) people.
“A limited number of people are allowed at Adiala Jail,” he added. “We don’t know the exact words he used. We do not know what happened, we don’t even know what happens during jail trials.”
The resolution was adopted after a vote, however, there was booing and hollering heard in the House.
“If you are saying no, does that mean you are saying that what happened with Ijaz Ahmed was right?” Speaker Sadiq asked after the resolution was passed.
Tarar took the floor once again, stating that he is one of those who has always tried to ensure that there is no pressure on the media.
“We heard what the PTI chairman said and we will not say anything distressing, but a journalist came and spoke in parliament saying that he was called an ‘agent’,” he said. “We need to see how people who raise their voices are treated.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials in May 9 cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act.</p><small>2025-09-29 15:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29184311603042c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945459/england-bowler-chris-woakes-retires-from-international-cricket' target='_blank'><strong>England bowler Chris Woakes retires from international cricket</strong></a><br><p>Paceman Chris Woakes on Monday announced his retirement from international cricket after England indicated he was no longer in their plans.
Woakes’s final match was last month against India at the Oval, where he walked out to bat one-handed with his arm in a sling, having dislocated his shoulder in the field.
He did not face a ball in his short time at the crease as India won by six runs to level the series at 2-2.
That injury ruled him out of consideration for the upcoming Ashes tour to Australia and, at the age of 36, effectively brought down the curtain on his England career.
Woakes, who made his Test debut for England in 2013, took 192 wickets in 62 games and scored more than 2,000 runs at an average of 25.
He also featured in 33 T20 internationals and 122 one-day internationals, playing a key role as England won the 2019 World Cup.
Rob Key, managing director of men’s cricket at the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), said last week that Woakes was unlikely to feature again, and the all-rounder has opted to call time on his international career.
“The moment has come, and I’ve decided that the time is right for me to retire from international cricket,” he wrote in an Instagram post. He also shared the same message on his X account.
 






“Playing for England was something I aspired to do since I was a kid dreaming in the back garden, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have lived out those dreams.
“Representing England, wearing the Three Lions and sharing the field with team-mates over the last 15 years, many of whom have become lifelong friends, are things I’ll look back on with the greatest pride.”
The Warwickshire bowler said he looked forward to continuing to play the county game and exploring opportunities in franchise cricket.
Key paid a warm tribute to Woakes.
“Chris Woakes is one of the finest people to have played the game,” he said. “An extraordinary career carved out alongside two of England’s greatest-ever bowlers (James Anderson and Stuart Broad).
“A man who helped every team he played in, even before he walked onto the field.”
ECB chairman Richard Thompson described Woakes as a “gentleman off the field, with the skills and fierce determination to win on it”.
“The images of Chris walking out to bat with his arm in a sling to try and win a Test match this summer reflected how much he cared about playing for his country and being the best team-mate he could be,” he said.

According to the statement, Etihad flight EY 276 from Abu Dhabi landed in Peshawar today and was welcomed with a traditional water salute by airport authorities, marking the first time the carrier has landed in the city since 2014.
“Etihad Airways will now operate five weekly flights between Abu Dhabi and Peshawar on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday, departing [from] Peshawar as EY 277 at 8am,” the statement read.
“These new connections provide passengers with greater choice, improved convenience, and enhanced global connectivity, reflecting PAA’s commitment to ensuring safe, efficient, and world-class airport operations,” it added.
Etihad is the third international carrier to launch flight operations to Peshawar this year.
In August, Flyadeal, the Saudi low-cost carrier, expanded its operations to Pakistan with inaugural flights landing in Islamabad and Peshawar. The aircraft from Riyadh landed ahead of schedule at 6:08am with 65 passengers on board and was accorded a traditional water salute.
In May, Emirati low-cost airline Flydubai commenced operations at Bacha Khan International Airport, with the arrival of flight FZ-375 from Dubai. The inaugural flight carried 164 passengers and was welcomed with a celebratory water cannon salute. A cake-cutting ceremony followed, attended by senior officials, including the airport manager and representatives from Flydubai.</p><small>2025-09-29 12:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/291629349f6b48f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945449/fbr-says-deadline-for-filing-income-tax-returns-will-not-be-extended-beyond-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>FBR says deadline for filing income tax returns will not be extended beyond tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) said on Monday that the deadline for filing income tax returns for the 2025 tax year would not be extended beyond September 30 (Tuesday).
In a statement, the board said: “The FBR has taken notice of unverified reports circulating on various media platforms claiming that the deadline for filing income tax returns for tax year 2025 will be extended.
“Some elements have also attempted to link this perceived extension to the recent floods.”
Millions of people have been affected and hundreds of casualties have been reported across the country during the recent floods and monsoon rainfall.
“It is pointed out that a vast majority of taxpayers reside in areas unaffected by floods and have had ample time to discharge their national obligation of filing returns,” the FBR said.
It also termed reports suggesting that the board’s Integrated Risk Information System (Iris) had slowed as “unfounded”. It added that the system was “fully operational, functioning smoothly, and taxpayers can easily file their returns using the new simplified income tax return form”.
Furthermore, taxpayers were also cautioned about the failure to file returns by the due date, with the FBR saying that it would “result in late-filer status and imposition of penalties under the law”.
It urged all eligible taxpayers to act responsibly and file their income tax returns with “accuracy and honesty” before the deadline of September 30, 2025 to avoid any legal consequences.
“In case of extreme hardship, the taxpayers can avail an extension of return up to fifteen days with payment of due taxes by September 30 subject to approval by the relevant committee as per law,” it added.
Last week, in a dramatic U-turn, the government had scrapped the asset valuation column from the tax return form for 2025 — just a day after issuing a strongly worded clarification — bowing to mounting pressure from various stakeholders.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had formed a high-powered committee led by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to examine the new column in the IRIS tax return system that required the declaration of estimated fair market value of movable and immovable assets.
After consultations with top tax officers, the committee had decided to remove the estimated market value column from the 2025 income tax return form on the directives of the prime minister.</p><small>2025-09-29 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2915310799ea149.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945445/multiple-suspects-booked-for-allegedly-vandalising-properties-of-attacking-members-of-ahmadi-community-in-sialkot' target='_blank'><strong>Multiple suspects booked for allegedly vandalising properties of, attacking members of Ahmadi community in Sialkot</strong></a><br><p>Sialkot police registered a first information report (FIR) on Monday against multiple suspects for allegedly vandalising the properties of and attacking the members of the Ahmadi community the previous night.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com,  was registered at Moutra police station on behalf of Sub-Inspector Amir Ali Sindhu.
It invokes Sections 395 (punishment for dacoity), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy a house), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 324 (attempt to commit murder), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of a common object) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
In the FIR, the complainant said he, along with other policemen, was patrolling and checking security arrangements at Bhalowali Chowk on Sunday when they received reports around 8pm of some people having riled others up against the Ahmadi community and gathering them in large numbers at Piro Chak village. There were also reports of them looting and setting properties on fire.
“When I reached the spot, around 200-250 people armed with weapons and sticks were present there,” he said, adding that upon seeing the police, they lunged toward them and snatched weapons from two of the policemen.
According to the FIR, it was not possible for the police to immediately control the mob as law enforcement personnel were few in number. “So, I contacted the control room after which more personnel were sent,” the FIR quoted the complainant as saying.
He added that there was commotion at the site of the incident as residents were “terrorised”.
The complainant said the initial probe revealed that on September 21, a woman from the Ahmadi community had died in the village whose burial was not allowed. Meanwhile, he continued, “hatred on basis of religion and enmity” was promoted against the community, causing the law and order situation to deteriorate.
Five people were injured during this, the complainant said, adding that they were sent to the hospital.
The FIR said further facts of the incidents would become clear after the injured and affected people would be included in the inquiry.
It alleged the suspects of “deliberately promoting enmity against the Ahmadi community”, hurting their sentiments, setting their properties on fire, looting them, opening fire on them with the intention to kill, attacking a police party and snatching weapons from them and spreading fear among the residents of the area where the incident took place.
The complainant asked for an investigating officer to be assigned to probe the incident.
Meanwhile, Sialkot District Police Officer (DPO) Faisal Shehzad told Dawn.com on Sunday night that eight people were injured in the incident, “five of whom are from the Ahmadi community and three from the TLP (Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan)”.
He said among the injured from the Ahmadi community, one person was shot at, adding that condition of all the injured was stable.
The DPO also said the issue began when the burial of an Ahmadi woman was not allowed at a graveyard established in 1945. Later, some members of the Ahmadi community tortured some others. Two cases were registered — one against the members of the Ahmadi community and another against their adversaries, he added.
On Saturday, he continued, some members of the Ahmadi community “beat another person, following which TLP members set two to three of their farm houses and a shop on fire”. The official said they also “tortured” members of the Ahmadi community.
“Anti-riot police were called and situation is now normal,” he said, adding that “a case will be registered against (members of) the TLP”.
Sunday’s incident comes less than a months after 300 people were booked on terrorism charges in two cases for setting two worship places of the Ahmadi community on fire in Faisalabad.
According to the FIRs, TLP ticket-holder Hafiz Rafaqat led the mob, which was armed with rods and bricks. Members of the community who tried to resist were severely beaten, leaving several injured.
Previously in July, 51 people were arrested and 142 booked for attacking police and an Ahmadi place of worship in Daska.
In April, a 46-year-old businessman was lynched when a few hundred supporters of the TLP had stormed a place of worship belonging to the Ahmadi community in Karachi’s Saddar area to prevent it from observing religious rituals.</p><small>2025-09-29 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/291509257123989.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945439/2-new-poliovirus-cases-in-sindh-take-nationwide-tally-for-this-year-to-29' target='_blank'><strong>2 new poliovirus cases in Sindh take nationwide tally for this year to 29</strong></a><br><p>Two new poliovirus cases have been confirmed in Sindh’s Badin and Thatta districts, taking the nationwide tally to 29 for this year and the total number of cases in the province to nine, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on Monday.
The development comes days after a poliovirus case was confirmed in Sindh’s Hyderabad district.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
The statement issued by the NIH today said: “With these two cases, both girls, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 29, including 18 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, nine from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.”
The NIH handout stated that this month, a sub-national polio vaccination campaign was conducted across 88 districts of the country, including Badin and Thatta. “The campaign successfully reached nearly 21 million children under the age of five,” it said.
It added that the next nationwide polio vaccination campaign would be held from October 13 to 19, aiming to protect around 45.4 million children under the age of five.
“During the campaign, Vitamin A will also be administered alongside the oral polio vaccine (OPV) to boost children’s immunity levels. More than 400,000 dedicated frontline workers will go door-to-door to ensure that every eligible child receives this essential protection,” the NIH said.
The institute said that these campaigns were aimed at “rapidly boosting children’s immunity and strengthening protection as part of Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to eradicate polio”, encouraging parents and caregivers to ensure their children were vaccinated.
“Polio eradication is a shared responsibility. While dedicated frontline polio workers deliver vaccines, parents and caregivers must ensure their children receive all recommended doses, including routine immunisations,” it said.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-09-29 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29113515de712ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945424/musks-x-to-appeal-indian-court-ruling-on-secretive-content-removal-system' target='_blank'><strong>Musk’s X to appeal Indian court ruling on secretive content removal system</strong></a><br><p>Social media platform X said on Monday it plans to appeal an Indian court order that would allow over two million police officers nationwide to issue arbitrary takedown requests via a secretive online portal called the Sahyog.
“We will appeal this order to defend free expression,” X said in a post on the platform, in its first statement since the High Court of Karnataka ruled last week that there was no legal merit to the company’s legal challenge to quash India’s content removal mechanisms.
“The Sahyog enables officers to order content removal based solely on allegations of “illegality,” without judicial review or due process for the speakers, and threatens platforms with criminal liability for non-compliance,” X said on Monday.
 






X has locked horns with New Delhi in the past, equating the government’s mechanisms with censorship. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said the new system tackles a proliferation of unlawful content and ensures accountability online.
X owner Elon Musk, a self-described free-speech absolutist, has clashed with authorities in several countries over compliance and content takedown demands, but the company’s Indian lawsuit targeted the entire basis for tightened internet regulation in the world’s most populous nation.
Modi’s government has ramped up efforts to police the internet since 2023 by allowing many more officials to file takedown orders and submit them directly to tech firms through a website launched in October.</p><small>2025-09-29 10:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29133641154f648.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945437/afghan-political-leaders-women-activists-discuss-regional-peace-stability-at-islamabad-moot' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan political leaders, women activists discuss regional peace, stability at Islamabad moot</strong></a><br><p>Afghan political leaders and women activists on Monday opened a two-day dialogue in Islamabad to explore ways for “shaping a collective, regionally supported vision for Afghanistan’s peaceful future”, according to organisers.
Pakistan and Afghanistan have witnessed an improvement in bilateral relations after taking steps to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee and upgrading diplomatic ranks.
This is the first ever gathering of political opponents of the Afghan Taliban since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, which organisers insist is “not against the Taliban government.”
They argued that the primary aim of the moot was to “promote inclusive and constructive discussions among leaders, including men and women from diverse segments of society in Afghanistan, to develop a shared understanding and identify common principles for Afghanistan’s future stability, inclusivity, and peaceful settlement,” the organisers said in a statement.
The dialogue was previously scheduled on Aug 25-26 but was postponed, apparently over criticism by some known personalities, including Zalmay Khalilzad, the former United States special envoy. Khalilzad had termed the meeting “unwise” due to the participation of some who oppose the Taliban.
“Afghan citizens are entitled to their political views, but Pakistan’s seeming support of them by hosting their conference is hugely unwise and an intended provocation,” he wrote on X.
 






Former Afghan parliamentarian Fawzia Koofi opposed the remarks, saying, “Isn’t it time to let us craft what is good for us?”
The first day of the closed-door meeting was dedicated to Afghan leaders to “engage openly, exchange perspectives and define shared principles for stability, rule of law, and reaffirming the support to women’s rights and inclusion”, according to the organisers.
Dawn.com has seen a list of 37 Afghans invited to the event. They were part of the previous governments of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, including governors, ministers, lawmakers and women activists.
A participant said some of the invitees were not attending the meeting due to visa issues.
“The aim of this timely and important dialogue is to promote an inclusive dialogue among diverse groups of Afghan leaders (women and men) alongside Pakistani counterparts to foster inclusive dialogue, mutual understanding and lasting cooperation,” the organisers said.
Women for Afghanistan (WFA) and the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute (Sassi) University jointly held the first Regional Dialogue titled “Towards Unity and Trust”.
Koofi, who leads WFA, lives in exile and has organised a series of meetings, mainly comprising women activists against the Taliban policies. She is one of the critics of Taliban rule. Dr Maria Sultan, a defence analyst, heads Sassi.
On the second day, on September 30th, a Joint Pak-Afghan Session will hold “focused discussions aimed at building trust, identifying common ground and advancing a people-centric approach to address regional challenges”.
The organisers, while explaining the objectives of the dialogue, say that the event is aimed at strengthening cooperation between Afghan and Pakistani leaders.
The dialogue will also promote sustainable development, stability and peace rooted in shared values and highlight the importance of women’s participation and inclusive governance. The gathering would encourage regional cooperation with a focus on economic development and trust-building, the statement added.
“The dialogue underscores a simple truth: peace between people leads to peace between nations. By prioritising dialogue, inclusivity and cooperation, WFA and SASSI University believe this initiative can pave the way for stronger, more mutually beneficial relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, grounded in unity and trust.“
In addition, the event will be helpful in fostering a deeper understanding between the people of the two nations for a more sustained development and peace in the region.
“The commonality and the importance of the dialogue and the process stems from the need that Afghans must have the space to speak, engage and think together to promote their common values and interests for their country and their people,“ it added.
The dialogue will also serve to identify common grounds for cooperation between Afghan leaders and their Pakistani counterparts on an engagement basis of developing people-centric approaches to find common solutions for regional challenges and to build trust and stability, the statement said.
“We believe that a more people-centric approach focused on economic development and regional cooperation will lead to an enhanced and meaningful relationship between the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.”
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul in July, where an agreement was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek­istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional connectivity. Later that month, Dar said Pakistan received “recent assurances” from Afghan authorities that the neighbouring country’s soil would not be used for terrorism.
Islamabad has repeatedly demanded that Kabul take action against the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). In January, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the only point of contention between the two countries was the presence of the TTP and cross-border attacks.</p><small>2025-09-29 09:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29115047f8c9caa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945428/apex-court-suspends-ihc-order-barring-justice-jahangiri-from-judicial-work' target='_blank'><strong>Apex court suspends IHC order barring Justice Jahangiri from judicial work</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday suspended an order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) barring Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri from carrying out judicial duties in a case pertaining to his law degree allegedly being fake.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the bench ruled that the “operation of the impugned order is suspended”.
The court also issued notices to the respondents in the case, as well as the attorney general of Pakistan, and advocate general Islamabad as the matter relates to the interpretation of provisions of the Constitution“. The hearing was adjourned till tomorrow.
A complaint pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council (SKC) last year in July, while a petition challenging his appointment was filed in the IHC earlier this year. The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
On September 16, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri then challenged the decision in the SC, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside and suspended during the pendency of the petition, and for the division bench to be directed to hold back from proceeding further.
Today, a five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, and including Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan took up Justice Jahangiri’s petition.
Also present at today’s hearing were Justice Jahangiri himself, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kiani, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz.
Also present at the hearing was the Islamabad Council member Aleem Abbasi, who requested the bench to make him, the council and the District Bar Association respondents in the case.
To this, Justice Mandokhel asked if they were a respondent in the IHC case as well, stating that the main petitioner was Justice Jahangiri.
Justice Aminuddin Khan, responding to this, said that the “SC will follow its own standard procedure and fix the application once it has been numbered.”
For his part, Justice Jahangiri’s lawyer, Munir A. Malik, told the court that this was the first instance that “a two-member judge has prevented a judge of its own high court from judicial work”. He argued that order issued against Justice Jahangiri was in violation of the law while the requirements of justice were also not met.
He noted that a writ petition was filed against Justice Jahangiri on July 10, 2024. “More than a year has passed yet the objections raised by the registrar’s office are still pending,” he said.
He told the court that after the writ petition against Justice Jahangiri was filed, there were several incidents of note, including the “transfer of three judges to IHC, which five IHC judges contested, but it was later declared valid”.
He said that the judge who issued the Sept 16 order against his client was the one against whose transfer the plea had been filed in the SC.
He reiterated that the objections raised on the plea filed against Justice Jahangiri still remained and the other parties in the case had not yet been heard. “Sixteen months have passed [since the plea was filed] and the objections still remain,” he said.
He also highlighted a recent order issued by the SC’s Justice Mandokhail, which stated that judges cannot initiate contempt proceedings against their peers and established that only the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has the constitutional authority to probe misconduct allegations against the judges of both the apex and high courts.
Meanwhile, Justice Hassan wondered how the plea against Justice Jahangiri was fixed for hearing when objections were raised by the registrar’s office. He told the lawyers of both sides to prepare arguments in this regard.
The hearing was subsequently adjourned for tomorrow.
Fake degree controversy
The controversy began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s examinations, regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC.
The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016.
It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri.
Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme.
On July 10, 2024, IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.”
As the degree accusations came to light, lawyer Mian Daud filed a writ petition, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer.
At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that Daud was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC.
On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its Unfair Means (UFM) Committee, varsity officials said.
The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree.
Then, on Sept 5 2024, the Sindh High Court (SHC) suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself.
To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person.
On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ  Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the SC.
Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.</p><small>2025-09-29 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29105403b119ea6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945420/asia-cup-naqvi-warns-india-against-dragging-war-into-sports-in-response-to-modi' target='_blank'><strong>Asia Cup: Naqvi warns India against ‘dragging war’ into sports in response to Modi</strong></a><br><p>Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief Mohsin Naqvi on Monday warned India against “dragging war” into sports, saying that doing so only exposed the neighbouring country’s “desperation” in a response aimed at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who politicised India’s Asia Cup final win against Pakistan.
In a post on X on Sunday night, Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on scoring a win in the final against the Green Shirts, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor — an operation that was launched against Pakistan during the four-day military conflict between the two countries in May.
“#OperationSindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he said.
 






In response to Modi’s post, Naqvi said, “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”.
“Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he said.
 






The exchange also follows the Indian cricket team refusing to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries.
“I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said on Sunday night.
PCB donates match fee to May 7 victims
Separately, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Monday that it would donate the team’s match fees to the civilians martyred during the May 7 Indian attack on Pakistan, after India’s SuryaKumar Yadav announced that he would donate his match fee to victims on the Indian side.
In a post on X, the the cricketing board said, “The Pakistan Cricket Team has dedicated its Asia Cup final match fees to the innocent victims martyred in the May 7 attack, in which civilians, including children, lost their lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families.”
 






India’s actions ‘disrespected cricket’: Salman Agha
Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Salman Agha said that India’s actions had “disrespected cricket” while speaking to reporters after the match, accroding to AFP.
“I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing,” Agha said.
“If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket.”
“What they did today, a good team doesn’t do that. Good teams do what we have done. We waited for our medals and took them.
“It’s been seen for the first time. I do not know where it will stop. What has happened in this tournament is bad for cricket,” he said.
Meanwhile, Yadav claimed that India was “denied” the trophy, but then went on to say that the team “took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy”.
“If you tell me about the trophies, my trophies are sitting in my dressing room — all the 14 players and support staff. They are the real trophies for me,” said Yadav.
‘Lack of sportsmanship’
Although the Pakistan-India matches went ahead despite calls from the Indian side to boycott them, all three were marred by controversy and high tensions between the two countries in the wake of their four-day military standoff in May.
India displayed consistent hostility towards the Pakistan team throughout each of their clashes, including refusing to shake hands with the players at the end of the games.
In addition, after the first victory against Pakistan on September 14, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was accused of politicising the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May, for which India blamed Islamabad without evidence.
Naqvi had expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” in a post on X and lodged a complaint with the ICC, which launched a probe into the remarks.
 






Further, during the September 21 match, when the rivals met for the second time, Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the match.
The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which killed more than two dozen people. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention. Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p><small>2025-09-29 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29114724f2aa0d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945426/hpv-vaccine-campaign-extended-for-3-days-in-punjab-to-maximise-coverage-health-minister' target='_blank'><strong>HPV vaccine campaign extended for 3 days in Punjab to maximise coverage: health minister</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Imran Nazir said on Monday that the province was extending the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaign until Wednesday, hoping to achieve a target of 100 per cent.
Earlier in September, Pakistan rolled out the HPV vaccine nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. However, vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities.
“Success rate in Punjab has been 72pc,” Punjab’s health minister said during an interview with Geo News show “Geo Pakistan”.
“But we have not ended the campaign; instead, we have extended it for three days.”
He added, “The primary reason is that if we administer this vaccine to our girls now, those aged 9 to 14 will get it for free. But after the campaign ends, people will have to pay money for it, and only 9-year-old girls will be able to get it free of charge.”
Referring to the attacks on women health workers while administering vaccines in Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin district, the minister said he has ensured the suspects were arrested and that security measures have been put in place to protect health workers.
In the latest incident this week, the HPV vaccination team was performing its duty in a non-formal education school in the village of Ratuwal, within the limits of Kathian Sheikhan police station, when a 55-year-old resident of the village entered the school and attempted to attack a female health supervisor.
He said the rate of refusals was greater at the beginning of the campaign, with only 250,000 girls receiving the vaccine on the first day. However, towards the end, the number of refusals dropped to 90,000 from 300,000 after counselling was provided through their teams.
“More than 5.2 million girls have been vaccinated; however, our target was 7.2 million, which we hope to achieve by Wednesday,” the minister said.</p><small>2025-09-29 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/290952143fe9d1d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945309/number-of-polio-vaccine-refusal-cases-drops-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Number of polio vaccine refusal cases drops in KP</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The number of children remaining unvaccinated due to parental refusal has come down in the recent immunisation drive compared to the previous campaign, data shows.
The five-day vaccination effort in May conducted by Emergency Operation Centre, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, recorded 17,136 children without getting oral polio vaccine (OPV), mostly due to parents’ reluctance due to misconception that the drops were not allowed in Islam or on the pretext that those were designed by western countries to render the recipients infertile and impotent and reduce the population of Muslims.
The first argument has been vehemently rejected by edicts issued by Islamic scholars from reputed universities and religious schools. The second plea advanced for non-vaccination has been rejected by laboratory scientists, saying these drops are safe and have played instrumental role in eradicating the crippling ailment worldwide.
However, the recently-concluded vaccination drive last week, shows that the number of refusals against polio drops has dwindled to 14,712, which the authorities attribute to the hard work of frontline vaccinators with strong backing of district administrations and district health officers.

Only 17,136 children remained unvaccinated in previous campaign

In May, the tally of children staying unvaccinated due to their non-availability during door-to-door visits by health workers was 64,328, which rose by less than 1,000.
 
 

Peshawar as usual remained atop of list of refusal cases by recording 5,977 unvaccinated children in September down from 6,812 recorded in May while Lakki Marwat occupied second spot with 2,128 refusal cases compared to 2,382 recorded by the district in September.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has detected 18 polio cases, the highest number recorded by any province in Pakistan this year so far. The total number of polio cases registered in the country in the ongoing year in 27.
The disease has crippled seven children in Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, four cases have been recorded in Lakki Marwat, Tank and North Waziristan each, three in Bannu, and one each in Torghar, Kohistan Lower and Dera Ismail Khan.
The disease is mostly prevalent in violence-stricken southern districts of the province where the number of refusals and non-available children is more than the rest of the province.
Except Peshawar, the situation in central districts and Malakand is not worrisome as the vaccinators do not have problems in reaching the target population but the southern belt is fraught with issues that have been hampering the smooth-sailing of the drive, making the dream of polio-eradication more difficult.
Officials at EOC say that Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, in his capacity as chairman of Task Force on Polio, is aware of the issues in southern districts and has been holding meetings with district administrations and issuing instructions to them before every drive to ensure that all children below five years receive anti-polio drops in every effort.
The last drive was conducted peacefully as no case of violence was reported but the problem of unvaccinated children remained the major task, they said.
“Our workers are reaching more than 99 per cent target children but less than one per cent children stay unvaccinated due to refusals or non-availability during the campaign. For getting polio eradication certificate, we need to ensure that all children are inoculated in every campaign for three consecutive years,” said officials.
They said that in every campaign, they missed very few children due to which eradication of the crippling disease was not possible.
There are known people, who are opposed to vaccination and they have been denying polio vaccination for years on flimsy grounds.
This vicious cycle continues to thwart the eradication efforts as well as loss of lives of policemen and health workers, who are killed by unidentified armed men during anti-polio campaigns in the province.

As it turned out External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar spoke for India, stressing self-reliance, self-protection and self-confidence as his mantras. Mentioning all three in Sanskrit, Jaishankar insisted on using the name Bharat for India to stay with the fine point about Hindu nationalists.
There was no official explanation given for Modi skipping the UN session this year, but clear evidence does indicate that it had to do with US President Donald Trump openly switching his preference from India to Pakistan as a closer friend in South Asia.
 
 

The standard rule of Modi always meeting the US President during his visits to the UN was in jeopardy. It was not necessarily because Trump may have signalled disinterest in such a meeting, but it was more likely the optics of Pakistan’s prime minister and army chief appearing in cosy frames with the US President that was the last straw to deter the Indian PM from the visit.
Modi had, however, shown his preparedness to go around the cloud of tariffs and verbal invectives hurled at him by Trump. India has kept its trade talks open with the US in the hope that the alternative of New Delhi moving closer to Beijing would dawn on US policy makers as an avoidable risk. But this seems to have been overestimated by India.
The Indian prime minister spared no effort to signal the alternative scenario. His meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the SCO summit in Tianjin was not only warm but also effusive. Apart from the formal expression of gratitude for the hospitality, Modi spoke of their meeting in Kazan, saying: “We had very productive discussions, which gave a positive direction to our relations. After the disengagement at the border, an atmosphere of peace and stability is now in place. Our Special Representatives have also reached an agreement on border management. The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra has resumed. Direct flights are also being resumed between the two countries. Our cooperation is linked to the interests of 2.8 billion people of our two countries. This will also pave the way for the welfare of all humanity. We are committed to advancing our relations based on mutual trust, respect, and sensitivity.”
In his speech at the SCO summit, Modi did mention a thorny issue with China but without naming it.
“We believe that every effort towards connectivity must uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said.
“This is also enshrined in the core principles of the SCO Charter. Connectivity, that by-passes sovereignty, ultimately loses both trust and meaning.” The reference was clearly to the Karakoram Highway and the Shaksgam Valley that Pakistan ceded to China in 1962 and which India disputes.
Signalling a positive framework for working with China, Modi made a similar pitch with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “India and Russia have always stood shoulder-to-shoulder even in the most difficult situations. Our close cooperation is important not only for the people of both countries, but also for global peace, stability, and prosperity.”
He was looking forward to receiving Putin in New Delhi in December. Those are daring words if Trump is the audience. Modi added another challenge to the mix by mentioning India’s engagement with Iran’s Chabahar Port, which the US frowns on.
The twist in the tale, however, is that Pakistan is invested in flourishing ties with all three countries Modi is interested in, namely the US, Russia and China.

In a detailed set of objections to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), Aptma demanded a stringent reality check of the exaggerated demand forecasts based on population and GDP growth, allegedly without taking into account ground realities taking shape in the country and the power sector.
The association said it has “a fundamental issue with the demand-forecasting methodology, which undermines the credibility of the entire plan” and suggested a broader set of priorities for incorporation in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expa­nsion Plan (IGCEP 2025-35) “to realign energy planning with on-the-ground economic real­ities and critical need for affordability and competitiveness in power tariffs”.
 
 

It said the IGCEP employed an overly simplistic and rather incorrect statistical (regression) model that linked grid electricity consumption to GDP growth, population growth and similar macro variables. The underlying assumption is that as the economy and population expand, grid demand will rise proportionally.
However, this approach could not account for substitution effects arising from captive power (gas or furnace-oil generators), rooftop solar (or distributed solar), gas-fired boilers, solar water heaters, electric stoves, and other decentralised energy sources, which increasingly serve as alternatives to grid electricity.
“In omitting these, the model incorrectly absorbs their influence into the residual, attributing too much of the growth in economic activity to increased grid consumption. The result is a systematic overstatement of grid demand growth,” Aptma said.
Such a plan had econometric and statistical implications, it said, adding that the endogeneity problem with the model was that when substitutes are omitted, their effects get absorbed in the error term. Since GDP and population growth also drive adoption of captive and solar among other non-grid sources of energy, the error term becomes correlated with the regressors.
This endogeneity correlation also leads to biased and inconsistent estimates in the statistical sense of the terms, as the elasticity of grid demand with respect to GDP and population growth is exaggerated.
“In Pakistan’s context, where non-grid sources of energy are growing rapidly, the structural bias leads to a systematic overestimation of future grid demand,” it said, adding that this meant the forecast for grid demand was too high because the model ignored alternative energy sources.
“This upward bias encourages excessive generation additions, which in turn produce inflated capacity payments, stranded assets, and heightened financial stress in the system,” the association said, alleging that IGCEP’s demand forecast was upward-biased by design.
Moreover, the econometric issue of endogeneity meant that results were unreliable and, in practice, overestimated.
“This problem has been prevalent throughout the years, and its implications are visible in the massive stranded capacity on the grid and the resulting escalation of power tariffs”, Aptma said, adding that it was not a minor technicality but a fundamental flaw in the power sector’s demand forecast. The same “flawed methodology” is also used to estimate demand for consumer tariff determinations, meaning that those forecasts, too, are systematically flawed and biased.
This becomes even more perilous given the fact that IGCEP itself acknowledged that the energy and power demand forecast was the basis for all planning activities in the power sector. It is one of the decisive inputs for the generation planning (Planning Code (PC-4) of Grid Code 2023).
“This makes the flaw monumental because if the foundation is faulty, the entire edifice of planning collapses. A biased demand forecast, hence, makes the entirety of the subsequent planning exercise unreliable, leading to mis-investment, excess costs, and inflated tariffs,” it asserted.
Aptma observed that unless affordability was made the central organising principle of energy planning, the IGCEP will continue to reinforce the problems feeding to the runaway escalation of capacity payments, which had increased from Rs2 per unit to Rs17.06 per unit in about 10 years and now consume over half of the consumer tariff and cumulatively amount to more than Rs6 trillion over the past decade — exceeding the total fuel cost in the system.
“Such levels are clearly unsustainable in a country already constrained by weak fiscal space, dwindling industrial growth, and limited affordability,” Aptma said.
It demanded that “no new generation addition should be justified without first reducing this burden to below Rs5 per unit. This ceiling must become a binding benchmark in all future planning and approvals” to inject discipline into a planning environment long driven by megawatt targets, donor pressures, and short-term paradigms, often at the expense of consumer capacity to pay.
Aptma also pointed out that the country currently faced demand stagnation, overcapacity, and stranded risk, and the planning should address these challenges. It said the industrial demand in FY2025 declined by around 4pc, and agricultural consumption plunged by more than one-third as farmers turned to diesel and solar alternatives.
This meant the national demand growth was stagnant, yet the IGCEP projected an addition of nearly 20,000 MW in capacity. “This mismatch leads to more idle plants, steep fixed costs, and escalating circular debt,” it said.

• Punjab govt sets Oct 4 deadline to plug Sutlej breaches
• M5 still shut as over 200 villages inundated in south Punjab
• China airlifts tents, blankets for flood-hit families
HYDERABAD/DADU/ LAHO­RE: Kotri Barrage passed the peak of its medium flood on Sat­urday but remained in a medium-flood state through Sunday evening.
On Saturday morning, Kotri recorded 421,075 cusecs upstream and 393,560 cusecs downstream, easing to 412,965 and 386,650 cusecs by noon.
On Sunday, upstream flows were 387,808 cusecs with 362,253 cusecs downstream; some 25,555 cusecs were drawn for the barrage’s four canals. Flood peaks have already moved past Guddu and Sukkur barrages, where flows have normalised.
Meanwhile, high pressure persisted along the Indus at Nasri Bund, Lakhhat Bund, Mid Bangli Bund and Amri Bridge, leading to intensified rescue efforts.
Rescue 1122 Shaheed Benazirabad evacuated dozens of residents from Ali Khan Mari village to safer locations and helped move livestock and belongings.
Officials have termed the situation “alarming” and urged residents in vulnerable areas to remain vigilant and cooperate with rescue teams. Local authorities said they were monitoring embankments and stood ready to take further protective measures.
The Punjab government has set Oct 4 as the deadline to plug all broken embankments along the Sutlej to contain flooding that has submerged more than 200 villages across Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts. The villages of Multan’s tehsil Jalalpur Pirwala, Lodhran and Uch Sharif were submerged after Noraja Bhutta embankment at the Sutlej River broke due to extremely high water flow 15 days ago.
The floodwater passed from these breaches and rose around the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5) from Jhangra in the Bahawalpur district to Jalalpur Pirwala. The floodwater passed through M5 after breaching it at several points and created a 20km to 25km-long inland lake between Gilani Road and the motorway.
 
 

Due to the breaches, the motorway has been closed for traffic from Uch Sharif interchange to Jalalpur Pirwala for the last 15 days. The closure of all traffic between southern and central Punjab has disrupted supply chains and stranded thousands of vehicles and forced travellers onto perilous alternative routes.
The situation remains dire in the eastern areas of Jalalpur Pirwala, where villages, including Noraja Bhutta, Basti Lang, Kotla Chakar, Bahadurpur, Mouza Kanu, Kandeer, Jhaiyu, Deepal, Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur, Belaywala, Dunyapur, Jhangra, Muradpur Soiwala and Sabra are surrounded by eight to 10 feet of stagnant water. The relentless pressure has caused widespread destruction of homes and property.
Meanwhile, as the Punjab government earlier this week launched a survey to assess the losses caused by recent floods, the PPP urged PM Shehbaz to accept its demand for providing immediate relief to the flood-affected people through the Benazir Income Support Programme. The PML-N and the PPP — coalition partners at the Centre and in Punjab — have been at odds over how to help the flood victims, with the former’s government in Punjab insisting on using its own resources, while the latter is adamant about using BISP.
 
 

Punjab Minister for Irrigation Kazim Ali Pirzada said on Sunday that three out of seven breaches at the Noraja Bhutta embankment on the Sutlej River were plugged completely and they were carrying the work to plug two more breaches. He said that the largest breach was 3,300 feet wide, which, according to the latest updates, was reduced to 1,650 feet.
The minister said that the Irrigation Department was utilising all its capabilities and resources to ensure that the remaining breaches should be completely plugged by the evening of Oct 4.
He further stated that the water level in the area is gradually receding. A team of experts will conduct another technical review of the situation on Oct 6 to better plan future measures.
Earlier, Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said that the rehabilitation and relief activities for flood victims have been formally initiated. He said that as the river situation has normalised, affected people have started returning to their homes, while the administration continues to provide dry rations in the affected areas.
China sends relief flights
Two Chinese relief flights carrying 300 tents and 9,000 blankets landed at Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi on Sunday for families displaced by the floods.
Federal Minister Engr Amir Muqam, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik, Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong and officials from the Foreign Office and NDMA received the consignment.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Muqam thanked China for the timely assistance and said that China’s contribution is not only a humanitarian endeavour but also a reaffirmation of the everlasting Pakistan-China friendship.

India had earlier beaten Pakistan by five wickets in the last over after a close contest to win a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, but they caused the post-final formalities to be inordinately delayed due to their refusal to budge from their stance.
There were no customary handshakes between the teams after India refused, with tensions high from their previous two clashes in the competition, which witnessed political posturing and aggressive on-field behaviour.
 
 

The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Naqvi, who is also the Interior Minister, was supposed to present the winners’ trophy, but there were indications that India would resent that when their captain Suryakumar Yadav did not participate in the customary pre-toss photoshoot before the final.
“I have been informed by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said.
When asked about his refusal to collect the trophy at the post-match press conference and their actions leading to the politicisation of the game, the Indian skipper declined to answer the question.
 


The post-final ceremony saw Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha receive the runners-up trophy while Indian players Tilak Varma, Kuldeep Yadav and Abhishek Sharma collect their respective individual awards.
 
 

India’s refusal to collect the trophy from Naqvi marks a historic low in the cricketing relations between the neighbours, with the game having acted as a stage for diplomacy in the past.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a political reference in his post on X congratulating the Indian team. “Operation Sindoor on the game’s field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he wrote.
Suryakumar’s men had earlier capped a remarkable unbeaten run with their third victory against Pakistan at the Asia Cup.
Put into bat, Pakistan could not capitalise on an 84-run opening stand between Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) and were bundled out for 146 with five deliveries still left in their innings.
Pakistan lost their last nine wickets for 33 runs in a spectacular meltdown, with India’s left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (4-30) being the wrecker-in-chief.
The Green Shirts struck back to leave India reeling at 20-3 with their top 3, including captain Suryakumar Yadav, back in the dugout.
India lost their in-form opener Abhishek Sharma, also the tournament’s leading scorer, and the skipper inside the first 10 deliveries of their innings.
Varma and Sanju Samson (24) got to rebuilding the innings.
 
 

Even that recovery would not have been possible but for the reprieve Samson, then on 12, got when Hussain Talat dropped him in the deep.
Abrar Ahmed dismissed Samson to break the 57-run stand, but Shivam Dube (33) combined with Varma to take India closer to the target before falling in the penultimate over.
Needing 10 runs from the last over from Haris Rauf, Varma hit the second ball for a six to effectively seal India’s thrilling victory and triggering wild celebrations in the Indian camp.
“It’s a tough pill to swallow,” Pakistan captain Salman said at the presentation ceremony. “We could not finish well in the batting. Bowling, we gave everything. If we could have finished well, it would have been a different story.
“We could not rotate the strike properly, and we lost too many wickets. That was the reason we could not score what we wanted. We have to sort out our batting very soon. They bowled really well, outstandingly well. They needed 63 off six overs. I thought we had the game. The bowlers bowled really well; we have to give them credit, but the batting was a concern.
“We fought really well. We are proud as a team. So much to look forward to, we will improve and come back stronger.”</p><small>2025-09-28 22:06</small></div><hr>
