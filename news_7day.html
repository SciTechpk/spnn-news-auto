Now that the Amreekans have put their stamp on where the power lies, by inviting the army chief to the big White House, it appears as if the mainstream political parties have decided the only way forward is to accept the suzerainty of Pindi and live happily ever after. It is the ever-after of arranged marriages, where the assumption is that role-playing and the trappings of family life are the best one can aspire to.
As long as there is a house, disposable income, kids, and social life, an existence can be passed off as happiness. And that is what our parties get — gormint houses and green number plates and protocol. So what if the real power lies elsewhere and so does the money. The house and the car are for free, and there are fewer court cases.
Let’s just celebrate the little things in life. As the famous song goes, ‘Dil hai chota sa, chottee see aasha’.
And if anyone expresses concern over the lunch in the White House and wonders where the prime minister was, simply extol the virtues of a hybrid system. There is no fighting and much cooperation — why should the dil maange more, the people are told.

In Islamabad, everything is possible and all options are being discussed.

And if the subtext of these statements is that the PML-N supremo wasted his life arguing for the opposite, then people are just overthinking. Why would anyone extrapolate this from just a lunch and the cool-headed analysis of the benefits of hybridity?
It seems the prime minister and the Punjab chief minister agree. They are in any case far too busy working and occasionally posing for pictures. Though there must be moments where the prime minister pats himself on the back that the family member in charge of Punjab gets so much attention and criticism. Despite being in the centre, he gets less flak — surrounded as he is by more important people, in Lahore and closer.
But despite this, there have been moments in the past week or so which suggest trouble in paradise. But only in the Pakistani sense where little appears logical. Which in fact is the reason they are taken seriously — for we only take senseless issues seriously and then discuss them even more earnestly. And in this department were the reports about Nawaz Sharif setting off to Adiala to meet the baani as Imran Khan is now called, when he can’t be bothered to attend parliament. And while this ‘piece’ of news was called out rather quickly and clarified, the second one did the rounds for longer.
In this second piece of news, Asif Ali Zardari was about to be thrown out of the presidency. When it was first put out, those in government went into a bit of ‘sakta’ — the predictable response of the politicos when there is a fear that the news may have come from those who cannot be named. I mean, in this marriage of protocol and cars, who is going to deny a piece of gossip or information that might have been whispered by those who allowed you the cars in the first place?
Hence, there was silence as tongues wagged in drawing rooms and posts on social media did the rounds. And when the denial came, it had to come from sources more mustanid than just the PML-N itself. Hence, the interior minister had to enter the fray.
The rumour may have died down but not the questions about why and how it was started. For it wasn’t just reckless journalists who are to blame. And hence the tongues continue to wag. Who wanted to shock (or should it be shake) the PPP a bit? And to what end? And why do experts keep pointing out that the judgment in the reserved seats (which has awarded the PTI allocation to the other parties such as PML-N, PPP and JUI-F) has made PPP less critical to the government?
And why do the same “experts” point out how bad the PML-N is at governance these days and how it has been made irrelevant by the famous lunch? The criticism over the import of sugar is not simply organic? It never is. Where is this analysis and this critique coming from?
Or are these all hints to all the politicos to pull their socks up? In the land called Islamabad, everything is possible and all the options are being discussed. And while we mortals are confused, so might be the politicians. They always should be. The car and the protocol can just never be taken for granted — ask Imran Khan. And Nawaz Sharif. And Asif Ali Zardari.
Which is why the PTI in power is working so hard to keep itself in the good books of the powers that be. So much so that the party has dumped even Imran Khan. He asked them to protest and they drove off to Lahore to have dinner. And the KP chief minister thinks rhetoric can make up for everything — including lack of governance and lack of politics. But then who cares, for the car and the protocol are all that matter. As well as a good dinner in Lahore.
For the bill for the good times he enjoys, as with the prime minister, is being footed by the same people. And it’s not the electorate, be it in Punjab, KP or elsewhere.
Indeed, it is all a bit like the conferences arranged for health practitioners by big pharma. Whatever the rhetoric, these fun events only work to the benefit of the organisers and the attendees. The people are not going to benefit. Not really. There was a word a property tycoon once used but it wouldn’t be appropriate.

Published in Dawn, July 15th, 2025</p><small>2025-07-15 04:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/15085614ca1dc36.png?r=090413' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924301/consolidating-gains' target='_blank'><strong>Consolidating gains</strong></a><br><p>THOUGH IMF Resident Representative for Pakistan Mahir Binici’s words of commendation for the country’s “strong performance so far” under the $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF) ‘vindicate’ the government’s economic and fiscal policies, his compliments should be taken with a pinch of salt.
His praise for the government’s economic performance is primarily based on the relatively stronger implementation of IMF programme goals, which have indeed helped pull the economy back from the brink. But they have also imposed a very heavy cost on growth and ordinary people.
Noting that the successful first review of the EFF encompassing the agreement on the federal budget blueprint was a major milestone, he told a group of researchers and economists in Islamabad recently that the country’s growth prospects in 2025 and beyond would improve.
However, he was quick to punctuate his optimism with “the critical importance of continued structural reforms aimed at strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate and promoting private-sector-led growth to ensure long-term economic sustainability,” besides reforms to tackle climate-related vulnerabilities.
Mr Binici further cautioned that elevated trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation and weakening global cooperation continued to generate uncertainty and weigh in on the global economic outlook, underlining the urgent need for prudent, forward-looking policy actions. In short, the IMF official said only what a financial diplomat should have stated publicly.
The economy has no doubt stabilised in the last year. Headline inflation is down, the fiscal deficit has been reduced, the exchange rate remains stable, and so on. Much credit goes to the IMF programme for this stability. But a lot of this stability and improved fundamentals is owed to lower global oil and commodity prices, and soaring inward remittances — not just the implementation of the IMF plan.
On the flip side, the economy is yet to turn the corner. Growth remains anaemic, with exports and foreign investment stagnant. Productivity and structural reforms are slow to roll out. Tax collection as a percentage of GDP is still one of the lowest in the world despite an increase in revenues. Businesses are resisting even patchy efforts to increase the tax base. It would not be incorrect to say that the economy is still just a shock — like an increase in oil prices or reduction in remittances sent by overseas Pakistanis — away from relapsing into another crisis. If anything, the long-term benefits of the current stability hinge on the depth and continuity of structural reforms beyond the IMF-dictated goals.
The government would be well advised to focus on the part of Mr Binici’s statement where he cautions against complacency and warns of exogenous challenges to the sustainability of gains made so far rather than just using his commendation to validate its sketchy, patchwork reforms.

According to witnesses, unknown armed assailants on a motorcycle opened fire on the car of Malik Muhammad Rehman near Pir Kalay village in Miramshah tehsil, killing him and his driver Hafiz Syed Akbar on the spot.
Sources confirmed that this was not the first attempt on Malik Rehman’s life. He had survived two assassination attempts in the past, they added.
The incident triggered a wave of grief and outrage across the area. Local people say the law and order situation in North Waziristan is deteriorating rapidly.
An elder from the Dawar community, Haji Gul Wali Khan, said: “We are lifting dead bodies daily; why have our lives become so cheap? The government and state institutions must bring perpetrators to justice.”

• Israeli strikes kill another 22 Palestinians in besieged enclave
GAZA CITY: Stuttering Gaza ceasefire talks entered a second week on Monday, with meditators seeking to close the gap between Israel and Hamas, as more than 20 people were killed across the Palestinian territory.
The indirect negotiations in Qatar appear deadlocked after both sides blamed the other for blocking a deal for the release of prisoners and a 60-day ceasefire after 21 months of fighting.
An official with knowledge of the talks said they were “ongoing” in Doha on Monday, telling AFP: “Discussions are currently focused on the proposed maps for the deployment of Israeli forces within Gaza.”
“Mediators are actively exploring innovative mechanisms to bridge the remaining gaps and maintain momentum in the negotiations,” the source added on condition of anonymity.
Hamas accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who wants to see the Palestinian group destroyed as a fighting force — of being the main obstacle.
“Netanyahu is skilled at sabotaging one round of negotiations after another, and is unwilling to reach any agreement,” the group wrote on Telegram.
In Gaza, the civil defence agency said at least 22 people were killed on Monday in the latest Israeli strikes in and around Gaza City and in Khan Yunis in the south.
The Al-Quds Brigades — the armed wing of Islamic Jihad, which has fought alongside Hamas — released footage on Monday that it said showed its fighters firing missiles at an Israeli army command and control centre near Shujaiya.
Talks ‘ongoing’
US President Donald Trump said he was still hopeful of securing a truce deal, telling reporters on Sunday night: “We are talking and hopefully we’re going to get that straightened out over the next week.”
Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, and the leadership of Hamas and Islamic Jihad held a “consultative meeting” in Doha on Sunday evening to “coordinate visions and positions”, a Palestinian source with knowledge of the talks told AFP.
“Egyptian, Qatari and American mediators continue their efforts that make Israel present a modified withdrawal map that would be acceptable,” they added.
On Saturday, the same source said Hamas rejected Israeli proposals to keep troops in more than 40 per cent of Gaza, as well as plans to move Palestinians into an enclave on the border with Egypt.
A senior Israeli political official countered by accusing Hamas of inflexibility and trying to deliberately scupper the talks by “clinging to positions that prevent the mediators from advancing an agreement”.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and Palestinian minister of state for foreign affairs Varsen Aghabekian Shahin headed to Brussels on Monday for talks between the EU and its Mediterranean neighbours.
But the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority denied media reports that any meeting between the two was on the agenda.
Netanyahu has said he would be ready to enter talks for a more lasting ceasefire once a deal for a temporary truce is agreed, but only when Hamas lays down its arms. He is under pressure to quickly wrap up the war, with military casualties rising and with public frustration mounting at both the continued captivity of the prisoners and a perceived lack of progress in the conflict.
Politically, his fragile governing coalition is holding, for now, but Netanyahu is seen as beholden to a minority of far-right ministers in prolonging an increasingly unpopular conflict.
He also faces a backlash over the feasibility, cost and ethics of a plan to build a so-called “humanitarian city” from scratch in southern Gaza to house Palestinians if and when a ceasefire takes hold.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees has described the proposed facility as a “concentration camp” and Israel’s security establishment is reported to be unhappy at the plan.
Israel’s military reprisals since October 2023 have killed 58,386 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in Gaza.

“The legitimacy of a tax system in large depends on whether taxpayers are able to understand not only that they are liable, but also the consequences for not discharging their liability,” observed Justice Ayesha A. Malik while deciding an appeal by the Islamabad Inland Revenue (Legal) commissioner against Pakistan LNG Limited and Serene Air (Pvt) Limited.
Justice Malik was member of a three-judge bench consisting of Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Shahid Waheed, which had taken up for hearing petitions against the April 16, 2024, and June 24, 2024, orders of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The respondent, Pakistan LNG Limited, whose income tax return for the year 2020 was amended in terms of order March 15, 2021 under Section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, raising a demand of Rs2.9 billion for the recovery of tax dues.

Notes authorities’ conduct in the case ‘falls short of the statutory requirement’; judge says tax recovery not a ‘grab and go’ process

On the same date, a notice under Section 137(2) of the ordinance was issued to the taxpayer. The respondent challenged the amended assessment order before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) (CIR Appeals), which was decided on March 9, 2022, and subsequently uploaded on the web portal of the FBR (i.e., IRIS) at 3:28pm.
On the same date, a notice under Section 140 of the ordinance was issued for the immediate recovery in terms thereof. The notice under Section 140 was subsequently quashed by the high court as void and the amount recovered from the bank accounts of the respondent was ordered to be reimbursed.
Likewise, in the case of Serene Air Private Limited for the tax year 2020 proceedings in terms of Section 161 read with Section 205 of the ordinance were decided on March 31, 2022. On the same date, notices under Section 137(2) of the ordinance were issued, raising a demand of Rs1.8 billion for the recovery of withholding tax.
The respondent filed an appeal, which was decided on May 11, 2023. On the same date, notices under Section 140 of the ordinance were issued to the banks for immediate recovery. These too were set aside by the single judge and the amount recovered was ordered to be reimbursed to the respondent.
Both respondents challenged the recovery notices issued under Section 140 of the ordinance, in constitutional petitions before the high court, which were set aside. The Division Bench upheld the decision of the single bench.
In her judgement, Justice Ayesha held that Section 140 does not permit immediate coercive recovery in the absence of a date set in the notice. Section 140 expressly provides that the party holding money on behalf of the taxpayer must be afforded a notice with a due date to discharge its liability.
The notices issued in both petitions blatantly violated the requirements of the law. Accordingly, the Supreme Court found that no case for interference was made out and therefore the appeals were dismissed.
Justice Ayesha Malik observed that the conduct of the commissioner in the present case fell short of the statutory requirement of Section 140, adding that the tax recovery was not meant to be a ‘grab and go’ process. Even coercive recovery measures must follow a proper and fair procedure, she added. Legal certainty requires not just that taxpayers know they owe tax, but that they are clearly informed of when, how, and on what basis recovery will be pursued.

• Extreme rainfall will become ‘more common and stronger’ by end of the century
ISLAMABAD: Calling the 2022 floods “a forewarning of elevated future flood risks”, a study published in a leading scientific journal warns that Pakistan is likely to experience more frequent and severe floods due to extreme rainfall events and human-induced development encro­aching on floodplains.
Published in Nature, the article comprehensively evaluates the complex interplay of pluvial (direct rainfall) and fluvial (riverine) conditions, upstream snow cover dynamics, and anthropogenic changes in the natural landscape that contributed to the unprecedented 2022 flooding.
 
 

The study says the Indus Plain in Pakistan experienced 19 flood disasters between 1950 and 2012, affecting an area of 599,459km², causing 11,239 deaths, and resulting in economic damages exceeding $39 billion.
“A significant proportion of these flood events were predominantly attributed to monsoon rainfall, with around 10 out of 20 occurrences taking place after the 2000s,” it added.
According to the paper, after a multi-year drought, the pre-monsoon rainfall in 2022 was 111 per cent higher than the long-term average of 1951–2021, increasing soil moisture by 30pc in the Indus Basin floodplains.
“Monsoon rains were 547pc above average, with record-breaking cumulative weekly rainfall in July (200mm) on already saturated soils. Upstream drainage catchments (e.g., Chenab, Jhelum, and Ravi) received 33pc and 41pc more rain in pre-monsoon and monsoon periods, respectively,” it said, adding that August 2022’s streamflow at Sukkur Barrage, just upstream of the floodplains in Sindh, was 170pc larger than the historical average, due to the compounding effects of rain-on-snow and warmer temperatures accelerating snowmelt.
It said the 2022 flood was triggered by pre-monsoon rainfall followed by an intensified monsoon system, adding that during the monsoon season (July-Sep), rainfall in Sindh and Balochistan surged to “between 600 and 1800mm, far exceeding historical average”.
 
 

Anthropogenic changes
According to the study, riverine flooding was amplified by anthropogenic changes, extreme streamflow, and antecedent soil moisture conditions.
“The river water level during the 2022 flood surpassed the levels recorded during the historical catastrophic floods of 2010 and 2015 by 2.4m and 2.79m in Aug. For example, Jun 2022 flows at Sukkur Barrage were 32pc lower than the long-term average (1994–2021), while subsequent months saw increases of 26pc, 105pc, and 170pc, respectively.”
The study revealed human activities were land use adjacent to riverine ecosystems, characterised by intensive agricultural practices and high population density along riverbanks.
For instance, Larkana has consistently expanded toward the riverbanks, with cropland extended from about 37,000km² to 47,500km² between 2001 and 2022.
Another factor that contributed to these floods was the accelerated upstream snowmelt and rain-on-snow events.
‘Adding fuel to fire’
According to the authors of the study, Dr Ali Mirchi and Dr Arfan Arshad, flooding risks in Pakistan could “increase dramatically” under a high-emission scenario, with intense rainfall events, especially 5-day extreme rainfall events in southern Pakistan projected to become “more common and stronger by the end of the century up to 58pc”.
“For example, the frequency of rainfall totals of more than 400mm over five days in this region would increase. At the same time, single-day rainfall extremes (RX1day) could rise by 44pc, pushing already vulnerable regions beyond their coping capacity,” they told Dawn via email.
They said Pakistan could focus on adaptation to mitigate these risks, such as restoring natural floodplains, improving drainage, and shifting development away from riverbanks.
“Pakistan cannot solve global warming alone, but local emission reductions combined with smarter land planning can reduce damage and save lives,” they said.
“To reduce the rainfall induced direct flooding from urban runoff, we have to fix and upgrade drainage systems in both cities and rural areas to reduce flooding. These are practical, actions that can be done quickly and can go a long way in preventing the kind of widespread damage we saw during the 2022 floods,” the authors said, while stressing the need to improve early warning systems.

• CM Gandapur terms threat to arrest Imran’s sons ‘petty’
PESHAWAR: A day after the PTI leadership extended their ‘final’ protest for 90 days, the government and the opposition leaders continued to spar on the purported protest plan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur calling the restrictions ‘regrettable’ and Prime Minister’s Political Affairs Adviser Rana Sanaullah dubbing the party a ‘destabilising’ factor for its repeated protests.
The PTI had planned a nationwide protest, which was expected to reach its peak on Aug 5, but the KP chief minister extended the final push for three months — a move that garnered criticism from his colleagues who complained they were blindsided by the CM.
On Monday, the KP CM, however, took the government to task for its crackdown on party workers, restrictions on its right to protest, as well as an alleged plan to arrest the sons of Imran Khan if they arrived in Pakistan to join the protest movement.
He said restrictions on the right to protest were regrettable and the arrests of the party workers and leadership were also unacceptable. He also called out the government for its statement regarding the arrest of Imran Khan’s sons upon their arrival in Pakistan to take part in the protest for the release of their father, saying such threats were petty.
“Imran Khan’s sons will come to Pakistan. Those who are saying that they will be arrested are showing their meanness,” CM Gandapur said, adding that Imran Khan was in prison for the last two years, so it was the right of his sons to meet him. “No FIR has been registered against the sons of Imran Khan, nor have they committed any crime, then how could they be arrested,” he asked. The CM claimed that the government for the sake of political revenge was damaging Pakistan’s reputation globally by announcing its purported plan to arrest the ex-PM’s sons.
 
 

In a comment on the crackdown on the party supporters, CM Gandapur referred to the November 26 violence in which several PTI workers were reportedly killed. “I believe that if someone is coming to shoot me, I will also respond in the same manner. This is not my party’s policy rather it’s my personal statement and it is allowed by our religion and constitution,” he warned.
Amid conflicting reports regarding the fate of the Aug 5 protest and dissent from within the party, the PTI leader insisted that there should be no grouping in the party as he always believed in unity and was never involved in the grouping or leg-pulling inside the party.
Regarding the rumours of a no-confidence motion in the KP Assembly against him, he challenged all political parties and the state institutions that he would quit politics forever if his government was toppled. He also said that all decisions related to the KP Senate elections would be made by Imran Khan, adding that the party leadership should be allowed to meet the incarcerated party founder.
‘Destabilising the country’
Meanwhile, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sana­ullah said that the former ruling party only wanted to “destabilise the country with protests”, Dawn.com reported.
In reference to the Sunday presser, Mr Sanaullah said that CM Gandapur’s words made it clear that the PTI wanted to “destabilise the country, right after Marka-i-Haq“ (the recent Pakistan-India escalation) and the government’s “success in economic revival, which lent Pakistan an opportunity for stability”.
“Besides this, it is unknown what other agenda they have,” he added.
Referring to the planned 90-day and August 5 protests, he said, “If they remain peaceful, then it’s fine (…) it is their democratic right. But if they take the law into their own hands and attempt to destabilise the country (…) then the law will take its due course.”
He added that this destabilisation “has been their (PTI’s) agenda from the beginning”, referring to the party demonstrating outside the International Monetary Fund (IMF) offices against their granting of an emergency loan to Pakistan.
He dismissed the notion that the government, despite being relatively stable now, would consider being more generous in negotiations for Imran’s release, saying that “it had nothing to do with generosity and that the case was proceeding according to the rules of the court.”
He pointed out how it was the PTI’s own stance in previous negotiations that Imran’s release would not be discussed, as the PTI founder himself expressed the desire to be acquitted on his own merit.
According to Mr Sanaullah, the government was ready to hold talks with the PTI on other issues, but he said that according to the party’s recent calls for negotiations, it “does not want dialogue with the government, but with the establishment”.
“They are not willing to sit down with either political parties or politicians to solve issues,” he said. “They are still stuck on their own agenda, seeking the establishment’s help to put them back into power. They are not ready for political dialogue.”
Asked what counter-demands the government might hold in negotiations, he said, “We have only one wish, one effort, one fight: the revival of Pakistan’s economy and its success, such that every citizen’s wellbeing is ensured and it is included on the map of the world as a welfare state.”
“It is in everybody’s mutual interest, the opposition and government, and everybody should agree on a ‘charter of economy’ on certain basic matters,” he said. “We are ready for any understanding or agreement in this regard.”

• Asks why state institutions have failed to ensure peace in KP
CHARSADDA: Expressing his reluctance to join any attempt to bring about a regime change in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Maulana Fazlur Rehman said on Monday that a no-trust vote may not be possible, given how the fragmented nature of the opposition in the provincial assembly.
“The opposition is busy trying to disqualify one another in courts. Even the PML-N has taken us to court,” the JUI-F chief mused during a visit to Charsadda.
He was talking to reporters during a visit to the area where he inquired after the health of party’s district emir and former legislator Maulana Gohar Shah.
“They should reflect on who is benefitting from their actions. One must think a hundred times before aligning with such an opposition,” he said.
The JUI-F chief also downplayed the possibility of bringing a no-confidence motion against the incumbent PTI-led government in the province — something that KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi has hinted at in recent days.
The governor had recently called on the Maulana alongside a PPP delegation — ostensibly to invite him to join efforts to de-seat the PTI-led government in the province — but the JUI-F chief reportedly did not commit to anything.
“It’s difficult to implement any major political strategy with a divided opposition. Who is even ready for a no-confidence motion? The opposition itself is in disarray,” the Maulana said on Monday.
Turning his attention to the PTI, he reiterated his remarks from a few days ago, saying: “In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, there is a need for change, but that change should come from within the PTI”.
“Those in power in KP today use vulgar language,” he noted, adding that despite their differences with the PTI, he would not stoop to respond to the harsh and insolent barbs levelled by his political rivals.
The Maulana said that maintaining composure and a respectful environment was one of his objectives, no matter how many differences he had with political opponents.
Blaming the government and state institutions for the unrest prevailing in tribal areas of KP, the JUI-F chief said: “If they can defeat India in a matter of unrest going on for the past 40 years.”
He accused the government and institutions of blaming the public for their own failures. He said the people of Swat and Waziristan were still refugees in their own homeland.
“The establishment is primarily responsible for the prevailing unrest, not the people. It’s unfortunate that instead of introspection, the blame is placed on the public. Declaring the public as a threat or a ‘shelter’ for unrest is not just misleading but unjust.”
“People of Waziristan are once again being asked to leave their homes, why? Don’t burden us with your failures. Look in the mirror,” he remarked.
 
 

He also called for sincere diplomatic engagement with Afghanistan. “We usually act first and then talk, but the real solution lies in negotiation. All issues can be resolved through dialogue. Pakistan must adopt a path of serious negotiations to improve relations with Afghanistan.”
 
 

The JUI-F chief also offered condolences to the family of the late Maulana Muhammad Tayyab, the party’s patron-in-chief in Charsadda.

The initiative, launched under the auspices of the Law and Justice Commi­ssion of Pakistan (LJCP), will be implemented acr­oss all levels of the judiciary, from magistrate courts to the Supreme Court.
The counsels in such cases would be given up to Rs50,000 in remuneration, which would be provided to them through the Dis­trict Legal Empo­werment Commi­ttees, to ensure equi­table access to justice for all citizens.
The decision was taken during a meeting presided over by the chief justice at the Supreme Court Branch Registry in Quetta. The meeting reviewed institutional linkages between the bar associations of Balo­c­histan and LJCP in strengthening justice delivery.
During the meeting, the CJP shared insights from his visits to some remote districts, where he noticed a gap in coordination bet­ween bar associations and the LJCP. He said that despite the availability of funds, they were not being properly utilised for uplifting the district judiciary.
As the commission has limited outreach capacity, LJCP  has decided to post a senior-level representative in every province who will be stationed at the respective high courts. These representatives will act as front desk to maintain liaison with district bar associations, identify local priority areas, raise awareness, and supervise grassroots-level justice sector initiatives.
 
 

The bars associations may present their development project proposals to District  Development Committees. Moreover, representatives of federal and provincial development departments have also been taken on board to ensure speedy execution and to avoid resource duplication.
Moreover, CJP encouraged the bar representatives to ensure that their members benefit from the Continuing Legal Education programmes offered by the Federal Judicial Academy.
Balochistan High Court Bar Association President Attaullah Khan Langov apprised the meeting about various facilities provided by the provincial government to the bar associations across the province.
It included 100 scooties for women lawyers, digital library at High Court Bar, shuttle services from high court to District Court Quetta, a 100-acre housing scheme for lawyers of high court and grant-in-aid by the federal government to 28 districts bars of Balochistan and the High Court Bar Association.
All federal and provincial stakeholders present at the meeting assured their full cooperation and support in advancing the shared goal of accessible and efficient justice.

Data from the national disaster agency between June 26 and July 14 showed that electrocution was the leading cause of fatalities, followed by flash floods.
In late June, at least 13 tourists were swept to their deaths while sheltering from flash floods on a raised river bank.
In its latest report, the disaster agency said 111 people, including 53 children, have been killed, with the highest number of deaths in the most populous province of Punjab.
Meanwhile, the national meteorological service has issued a warning for further heavy rainfall in the northern and eastern regions of the country, with the potential for urban flooding, landslides, and infrastructure damage due to strong winds.
 
 

Monsoon season brings South Asia 70 to 80 per cent of its annual rainfall, arriving in early June in India and late June in Pakistan, and lasting through until September.
The annual rains are vital for agriculture and food security, and the livelihoods of millions of farmers.
South Asia is getting hotter and in recent years has seen shifting weather patterns, but scientists are unclear on how exactly a warming planet is affecting the highly complex monsoon.
Pakistan is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change, and its 240 million residents are facing extreme weather events with increasing frequency.
In 2022, unprecedented monsoon floods submerged a third of Pakistan and killed 1,700 people, with some areas yet to recover from the damage. In May, at least 32 people were killed in severe storms, including strong hailstorms.

• Commission reserves verdict on plea seeking redistribution of reserved seats in provincial assembly
ISLAMABAD: With Senate elections in Kh­yber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) just a week away, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has written to the province’s governor and chief minister, asking that the provincial assembly be convened immediately so that new members can be sworn in on reserved seats.
Also on Monday, the ECP reserved its verdict in a case related to reallocation of reserved seats in the KP Assembly.
The letter, addressed to the KP governor’s principal secretary, stated that the commission was obligated to conduct Senate elections in the province, which had been set for July 21.
“But the matter of administration of oath is still pending and dela­yed,” it said.
The correspondence no­ted that the KP Asse­mbly speaker was requ­ested to administer the oath to the newly returned candidates, enabling them to complete the electoral college for Senate elections.
In response, the speaker has conveyed that the oath will be administered when the assembly is in session.
“The Commission has also received a copy of the letter of the Leader of the Opposition, attached with the application submitted by Mr Suresh Kumar MPA and others in this Comm­ission, wherein the Spe­aker has stated that neither the Constitution nor the Provincial Asse­mbly of Khy­ber Pakht­unkhwa Proce­dure and Con­duct of Business Rules, 1988, contain any provision empowering the Speaker to summon a session of Assembly on his own,” it said.
Noting that the administration of oaths has already been delayed considerably, it asked the governor to summon the assembly at the earliest.
Through another letter, the KP chief minister has been requested to issue advice to the governor to summon the assembly immediately, so that new members can take oath and the Senate elections can be held.
Verdict reserved
Meanwhile, an ECP bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, reserved its verdict in a case related to the re-allocation of reserved seats in the KP Assembly, after hearing arguments from all parties.
Five political parties — the PML-N, PPP, JUI-F, Awami National Party and PTI-Parliamentarians — and 71 individuals had been issued notices, as the ECP fixed the case for hearing after receiving the order of the Peshawar High Court.
The PHC had on July 8 ordered the ECP to redistribute reserved seats after hearing all parties, while declaring the ECP’s notifications on distribution of reserved seats of KP Assembly null and void. The PHC verdict came on a petition filed by the PML-N.
Later, talking to reporters, JUI-F counsel Senator Kamran Murtaza said the PML-N was demanding a greater share of reserved seats after independent candidate, Tariq Awan, joined the party belatedly.
Mr Murtaza said that an independent lawmaker who joins a political party after the time stipulated in the law has expired, continues to be an independent, and this in no way affects the share of a political party in terms of reserved seats.
The PTI-led government currently holds 92 seats in the KP Assembly, while the opposition, which was only able to win 18 out of the total of 115 general seats, has seen its numbers swell to 53.

• New system will automatically pull data linked to filer’s CNIC, at-source deductions, bank details
• PM seeks early release of income tax refunds for salaried individuals; wants Raast chairman, board to be appointed by September
ISLAMABAD: In a move to simplify tax filing procedures for the salaried class, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has introduced a new interactive return form, which will incorporate an auto-fill system that seamlessly integrates data about purchases, asset details and tax deductions at source etc. — ultimately generating a single-form return upon completion.
The new return form is currently available in English, while the Urdu version is set to come out by the end of this month.
During the first rollout phase, the form will also be available in two regional languages, Sindhi and Pashto. More versions in regional languages — Punjabi and Balochi — are expected to be rolled out subsequently.
Under the Income Tax Ordinance, individual taxpayers are required to file their returns by September 30.
The new return form consists of eight digital windows, each containing one input column. The process is designed to be step-by-step, with each screen containing a single question prompt to guide users through the filing process.
In the first window, entering one’s employer’s name will automatically populate the fields of tax deduction at source.
All deductions of withholding taxes based on the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) numbers will also appear on the form.
Similarly, providing bank account details will prompt the form to display closing balances.
Registered purchases linked to the filer’s CNIC will also appear automatically, streamlining data entry and minimising manual input.
 
 

According to an official annou­ncement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the FBR to launch a digital invoicing in Urdu. He said tax reforms should focus on facilitating citizens.
He asked the FBR to expedite the release of income tax refunds for salaried individuals of those amounting to less than Rs50,000. These refunds are to be issued within one month of return submission. The total disbursement under this directive is estimated at Rs10 billion.
While chairing a meeting to review progress on FBR reforms on Monday, the PM instructed the FBR to establish a helpline aimed at assisting the filing process. The meeting was informed that simplified digital tax returns for salaried individuals would be available from Tuesday, with access for other taxpayers beginning by July 30.
PM Shehbaz said tax returns had been made digital, concise, and linked with a central database for public convenience. He believed the salaried class would benefit the most from the new simplified tax returns system. He noted that implementation of AI-based tax assessment system was a major success, calling for raising awareness to encourage taxpayers to use the new system.
 
 

He also emphasized a third-party validation to ensure transparency in all FBR reforms. The premier directed the officials concerned to provide special facilities to small and medium-sized businesses to join the digital invoicing system.
The meeting was briefed on progress regarding digital invoicing, e-Bilty, simplified tax returns, the AI-based assessment system, the central command and control centre, and the cargo-tracking system. It was shared that FBR’s Command and Control Unit would become operational by September, enabling centralized data access and facilitating efficient decision-making.
Regarding the digital invoicing system, it was noted that all small and large businesses would issue receipts through FBR’s online platform at the point of sale and purchase. Approximately 20,000 businesses are expected to be integrated into the system in the coming months.
Customs automation
The meeting was briefed on the AI-driven assessment system that would allow traders to submit advance goods declarations prior to the arrival of ships, with full exemption from upfront duties and taxes. This measure is expected to increase advance declarations from three per cent to over 95pc, allowing containers to be transported directly from ships to factories.
The meeting was informed that within just one month, 8,000 invoices worth Rs11.6bn were issued. The system includes a taxpayer portal and a monitoring dashboard. Integration with PRAL is free of cost, and traders’ training is being actively facilitated. Once fully implemented, traders will no longer need to file separate sales tax returns, as transactions would be automatically recorded in the system.
Digital economy
The PM said the digitisation of the economy was the government’s top priority as it would bring transparency to the system. He said that digitalising payment systems between the public and the government would enhance transparency and ease of use for citizens.
 
 

He directed that progress towards a digital economy be accelerated and instructed that the processes of digitisation and the shift towards a cashless economy be simplified for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). He also emphasised that all state-owned enterprises should be integrated into the digital framework.
The PM advised the relevant officials to complete the process for the appointments of the board of governors and chairman of Raast by September. He noted that RAAST’s Board of Directors must comprise business experts.
The meeting was informed that the number of users of mobile apps and digital banking services was expected to increase from 95 million to 120m, with the volume of digital payments projected to rise from Rs7.5bn to Rs15bn. A nationwide public awareness campaign on Raast and digital payments would be launched next month.
To align Pakistan’s economy with those of developed nations, a Digital Payments Index will be introduced within one month. Additionally, the Capital Development Authority Board has approved the right of way for digital public infrastructure in Islamabad.
It was also noted that the remittance system was being digitised, ensuring that all funds sent from abroad would be received through the formal banking system. Coordination is ongoing with the governments of all four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir to promote digital payments.

The contracts will enable the DoD to develop agentic AI workflows and use them to address critical national security challenges, the department’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office said.
“The adoption of AI is transforming the [DoD’s] ability to support our warfighters and maintain strategic advantage over our adversaries,” Chief Digital and AI Officer Doug Matty said.
US government agencies have been expanding their use of AI, driven by a White House order in April promoting adoption. President Donald Trump has also moved to soften regulations on technology by revoking a 2023 Biden-era executive order, which sought to reduce AI risks through mandatory data disclosures.
Separately on Monday, xAI announced a suite of its products called “Grok for Government”, making its advanced AI models, including its latest flagship Grok 4, available to federal, local, state and national security customers.
 






 
 

The Pentagon announced last month that OpenAI was awarded a $200m contract, saying the ChatGPT maker would “develop prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains”.
The contracts announced on Monday deepen the ties between companies leading the AI race and US government operations, while addressing concerns around the need for competitive contracts for AI use in federal agencies.
In May, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren had urged DoD to ensure competitive AI contracting at a time when Musk’s Grok chatbot was gaining ground in the federal government.</p><small>2025-07-14 18:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14235155122d185.jpg?r=235342' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924192/date-set-for-crickets-return-at-2028-la-olympics' target='_blank'><strong>Date set for cricket’s return at 2028 LA Olympics</strong></a><br><p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Monday announced the dates for cricket’s return to the Olympic Games in Los Angeles, stating that matches will be played on June 12, 2028.
Cricket is returning to the Olympics for the first time since the Paris Games in 1900 with a proposed six-team Twenty20 format for men and women in Los Angeles. The IOC had said in October 2023 that cricket’s inclusion had the potential to activate and engage new audiences, with the sport’s worldwide fan base estimated at 2.5 billion people.
A press release issued today said the sport’s highly anticipated return was revealed with the official competition schedule.
Cricket “will play out starting July 12, with the 20th and 29th of the same month earmarked for the medal matches”, the press release read.
“There are no cricket matches scheduled on July 14 and 21 at LA28,” it added. “Most of the matchdays will be double headers, with the games starting from 9am and 6:30pm as per local Los Angeles time. It’s the same for the medal matches.”
Six teams will be competing in each of the men’s and women’s tournaments. A total of 90 athlete quotas have been allocated for each gender, allowing every team to name a 15-member squad.
The press release adds that all matches at the Olympics will be held in a temporary, purpose-built venue at the Fairgrounds in Pomona, about 50 kilometres from Los Angeles.
In May, Cricket West Indies (CWI) urged the International Cricket Council (ICC) to give Caribbean nations a chance to qualify for the 2028 Los Angeles Games and avoid the region being “shut out of history”.
“All we are asking is that our individual nations’ exceptional Olympic legacy be considered in the conversation,” CWI chief executive Chris Dehring said. “Our nations have proudly flown their individual flags atop Olympic podiums as perennial gold medallists.
“Now, with cricket’s inclusion, we must ensure that our cricketers are not shut out of history. We are ready to collaborate. We are ready to compete. But above all, we are asking for fairness.”</p><small>2025-07-14 18:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14222522ff25892.jpg?r=232417' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924185/one-dead-3-injured-as-heavy-rain-lashes-hyderabad' target='_blank'><strong>One dead, 3 injured as heavy rain lashes Hyderabad</strong></a><br><p>A man was killed and three others were injured when the roof of a shop collapsed in Hyderabad’s Timber Market area as heavy rain caused urban flooding and brought civic life to a halt in the city on Monday, according to officials.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia’s nearly two billion people.
Market Police Station House Officer Munir Abbasi told Dawn.com, “A person from Moro died and three others were injured when the roof of a shop collapsed in the Timber Market area.”
A dust storm preceded rain in the city, Latifabad and Qasimabad. The Met Office recorded the speed of rainfall at 42 nautical miles per hour with 94 millimetres of rainfall in the city, while 56mm was recorded in Latifabad. However, the waterlogging situation remained equally bad in both areas, regardless of the different volumes of rainfall being recorded.
The inundation of major roads was worsened for the Hyderabad Water and Sewerage Corporation (HW&SC) due to a massive power breakdown.
Rainfall began at around 4:20pm and continued till 6pm with moderate to high speed. People were seen wading through knee-deep rainwater on roads and streets in different areas while civic and district administration officials seemed to be struggling to cope with the situation.
District administration and civic bodies representatives were visiting various pumping stations to deal with the situation and ensure drainage of rainwater from the rain-affected areas, including the market’s roads and localities.
Met Office spokesperson Anjum Nazir Zaighum said that the rain was torrential in nature. There is a forecast of rain across Sindh for the next couple of days as well.
Accumulation of rainwater led to traffic gridlock on main roads, including the Hyderabad-Latifabad flyover, and the underpass connecting the city with Latifabad remained completely closed due to stagnant rainwater there.
Shah Makki Road remained flooded as well. Thus, most vehicular traffic was seen on the Latifabad flyover. A long queue of vehicles could be seen up to Cantonment graveyard road.
The city remained without power as the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) reported damage to its infrastructure. According to a statement from Hesco’s spokesman, four grid stations of the 132kV transmission system of the power utility were badly hit as towers connected with them fell due to rainfall.
It said the grid stations were connected with a 220kV circuit and that out of 152 feeders, only 12 were unaffected by the rain, while the remaining 140 tripped. The spokesman said that 54 were later re-energised, and staff were inspecting others to bring them online again.
A huge tree fell on the transmission line at Fatima Jinnah Road, affecting the power supply. Major pumping stations of HW&SC, including Tulsi Das, which were dependent on Hesco’s system, lost power.
Hyderabad Mayor Kashif Shoro blamed Hesco’s power failure for the delay in the drainage of rainwater, adding that only 30 per cent of sewerage facilities were now energised, but 70pc remained offline.
“I hope all entire rainwater will be drained out by tonight,” he said. He added that some pumping stations had received electricity, but faults were again reported, due to which they were shut down for repair. He said that Tulsi Das, Aga Khan, Poly and LD1 pumping stations were major facilities that deal with the drainage of rainwater.
Sindh CM takes immediate action on flooding
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah closely monitored the situation in Hyderabad following heavy rains that caused flooding in several areas, according to a press release from the CM’s Office.
He contacted the mayor to receive a detailed briefing on drainage efforts and directed urgent measures to expedite water removal. Due to power outages caused by Hesco feeder trips, pumping stations were temporarily shut down, hindering drainage operations.
The chief minister instructed Energy Minister Nasir Shah to coordinate with Hesco to restore electricity to the pumping stations immediately.
CM Murad emphasised the importance of restoring all major roads to ease public difficulties and called for all relevant departments, including district administrations, municipal bodies, the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, traffic police and rescue services, to work in close coordination.
He stressed that public safety remained the government’s top priority and warned that any negligence would not be tolerated.
Additional precautionary steps were ordered, including keeping dewatering pumps and staff on alert in low-lying areas, placing warning boards near electrical hazards, maintaining 24-hour control rooms and ensuring timely public information through media channels.
The chief minister also appealed to citizens to avoid unnecessary travel during the rains and cooperate with authorities to mitigate risks.
“Sindh’s government continues to take all possible measures to minimise disruption caused by the monsoon rains and safeguard the lives and property of its residents,” the press release said.</p><small>2025-07-14 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14214106686e2ae.jpg?r=214510' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924179/england-win-third-test-thriller-against-india-at-lords-to-take-2-1-lead-in-series' target='_blank'><strong>England win third Test thriller against India at Lord’s to take 2-1 lead in series</strong></a><br><p>England beat India by 22 runs to win a thrilling third Test at Lord’s on Monday as they went 2-1 up in a five-match series.
India were on the brink of defeat at 147-9, still needing a further 46 runs to reach a victory target of 193, when last man Mohammed Siraj joined Ravindra Jadeja in the middle.
Nevertheless, the pair batted on until after tea on the final day to give India hope of an improbable win.
But with India in sight of just their fourth win in 20 Tests at Lord’s, Siraj played on to off-spinner Shoaib Bashir — off the field for much of the match with a finger injury — with the ball just dislodging the leg bail to the batsman’s visible despair.
Jadeja was left stranded on 61 not out — the all-rounder’s fourth consecutive fifty this series — after taking India to within sight of what would have been a stunning success before they were all out for 170.
England captain Ben Stokes bowled two lengthy spells today on his way to an innings return of 3-48, with fast bowler Jofra Archer — in his first Test after more than four years of injury-induced exile — taking 3-55.
India were all but beaten at 112-8 when tailender Jasprit Bumrah came out to bat immediately after lunch.
But Jadeja and Bumrah kept England at bay with a stubborn stand of 35 in 22 overs.
Bumrah, defying a run of four successive noughts in Test cricket, defended gamely while making five in 54 balls, only for his innings to end when he top-edged a pull off Stokes to substitute fielder Sam Cook at mid-on.
India were now 147-9 — a position that meant tea was delayed by 30 minutes.
But Jadeja, who overturned an lbw decision given against him on 26, went to fifty when a flashing cut off Stokes flew over the slips for the left-hander’s fourth four in 150 balls faced.
Shortly after tea, Archer struck Siraj a painful blow on the shoulder and it was not long before he fell to Bashir.
This match became a second-innings shoot-out after both teams made 387 in their first innings.
England then posted 192 before India slumped to 58-4 when Stokes bowled nightwatchman Akash Deep with what became the last ball of Sunday’s play.
Bumrah resistance
From 71-4 today, the match swung England’s way once more as India lost three wickets for 11 runs in collapsing to 82-7.
Bumrah, the world’s top-ranked Test bowler, took 5-74 in England’s first innings after being rested from India’s dominant 336-run win in the second Test at Edgbaston.
But in 46 Tests before this match, he averaged a mere 6.77 with the bat.
Nevertheless, Bumrah got off the mark with an impressive pulled four off Archer through a vacant midwicket.
England thought they had dismissed Jadeja for 26 when he was given out on the field lbw to Chris Woakes. But Jadeja’s review indicated that impact had been made marginally outside off stump and the decision was overturned.
Next ball, the left-hander launched Woakes for a huge six over midwicket.
Earlier, Rishabh Pant — who only came into bat today following Deep’s departure — charged down the pitch to drive Archer for a typically aggressive four.
But two balls later, Archer, repeatedly topping the 90mph mark, bowled dangerman Pant for nine with a superb full-length delivery that clipped the top of off stump.
India were looking to KL Rahul to anchor their chase following the opener’s first-innings hundred.
But Rahul had added just six runs to his overnight 33 when he was lbw on review to lively medium-pacer Stokes after getting too far across his stumps.
Archer, who starred in England’s 2019 World Cup final win at Lord’s and made his Test debut at the northwest London ground that same season, then struck again.
The 30-year-old reduced India to 82-7 when he held a sharp one-handed catch to dismiss Washington Sundar for a duck.</p><small>2025-07-14 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14214753178848c.jpg?r=214908' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924180/ex-mill-sugar-price-now-fixed-at-rs165kg-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-mill sugar price now fixed at Rs165/kg: ministry</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of National Food Security and Research on Monday announced that the ex-mill price of sugar has been fixed at Rs165 per kilogramme, marking an increase of Rs25 from the fixed price last June.
An official statement issued by the ministry said that the government and sugar industry had reached an agreement on the new ex-mill price of the commodity.
“All provincial governments will ensure the availability of cheap sugar to the public in light of this decision,” the statement read.
Last week, the federal government approved the import of half a million tonnes of sugar in a bid to maintain affordable prices of the commodity.
“The committee approved the import of up to 500,000 metric tonnes of sugar to ensure a stable supply and maintain affordable prices nationwide,” said a statement posted on X.
In March, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said that retail sugar prices should not exceed Rs164 after the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) warned sugar mills against price manipulation.
Dar said that according to news reports, there was a spike in sugar prices to Rs178-179, which was “obviously not tolerable” to the prime minister.</p><small>2025-07-14 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1417581634716e7.jpg?r=211140' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924163/india-orders-its-airlines-to-check-fuel-switches-on-boeing-jets' target='_blank'><strong>India orders its airlines to check fuel switches on Boeing jets</strong></a><br><p>India on Monday ordered its airlines to examine fuel switches on several Boeing models, while South Korea said it would order a similar measure, as scrutiny intensified of fuel switch locks at the centre of an investigation into a deadly Air India crash involving a Boeing 787.
The moves by India and South Korea came despite the planemaker and the US Federal Aviation Administration telling airlines and regulators in recent days that the fuel switch locks on Boeing jets are safe.
The locks have come under scrutiny following last month’s crash of an Air India jet, which killed 260 people. A preliminary report found that the switches had almost simultaneously flipped from run position to cutoff shortly after takeoff.
The report noted a 2018 advisory from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which recommended, but did not mandate, operators of several Boeing models, including the 787, to inspect the locking feature of fuel cutoff switches to ensure they could not be moved accidentally.
India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation said it had issued an order to investigate locks on several Boeing models, including 787s and 737s, after several Indian and international airlines began making their own inspections of fuel switches.
 
 

The regulator oversees the world’s third-largest and fastest-growing aviation market, and its move raises the stakes for Boeing, whose aircraft are used by three of the country’s four largest airlines.
A spokesperson for the South Korean transport ministry said checks there were in line with the 2018 advisory from the FAA, but did not give a timeline for them.
Boeing referred Reuters’ questions to the FAA, which was not immediately available to comment outside regular hours. The company’s shares were up 1.4 per cent in US premarket trading.
Some other global airlines were weighing their own inspections or had begun their own checks.
In a statement, Japan’s JAL said safety was its top priority, adding, “We are closely monitoring the investigation into the incident and will implement any necessary inspections based on its findings.”
Over the weekend, Air India Group started checking the locking mechanism on the fuel switches of its Boeing 787 and 737 fleets and has discovered no problems yet, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
About half the group’s 787s have been inspected and nearly all its 737s, the source added, speaking on condition of anonymity. Inspections were set to be completed in the next day or two.
On Sunday, citing a document and sources, Reuters reported that the planemaker and the FAA had privately issued notifications to airlines and regulators that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes were safe and checks were not required.
The Air India crash preliminary report said the airline had not carried out the FAA’s suggested inspections, as the FAA’s 2018 advisory was not a mandate.
It also said maintenance records showed that the throttle control module, which includes the fuel switches, was replaced in 2019 and 2023 on the plane involved in the crash.
Air India CEO says investigation into Ahmedabad crash raises new questions
A preliminary investigation into the crash raises additional questions about the incident, and the investigation is far from over, Air India’s CEO said in a memo on Monday.
The preliminary investigation report released by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday depicted confusion in the cockpit shortly before the crash of the Boeing.
In a staff memo reviewed by Reuters, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said the report had “triggered a new round of speculation in the media … Unsurprisingly, it provided both greater clarity and opened additional questions”.
He added: “The preliminary report identified no cause nor made any recommendations, so I urge everyone to avoid drawing premature conclusions as the investigation is far from over.”
The memo said the preliminary report found no mechanical or maintenance faults and that all required maintenance had been carried out.
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner bound for London from the Indian city of Ahmedabad began to lose thrust and sink shortly after takeoff. All but one of the 242 people on board and 19 others on the ground were killed.
According to the AAIB report, in the flight’s final moments, one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel.
“The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” the report said. It added that the plane’s engine two fuel cutoff switches flipped almost simultaneously, but did not say how.
The preliminary report suggested no immediate action for Boeing or General Electric, whose engines were fitted on the aircraft.
Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA), which represents Indian pilots at the Montreal-based International Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations, has rejected any presumption of pilot error and called for a “fair, fact-based inquiry”.
“The pilots had passed their mandatory pre-flight breathalyser and there were no observations pertaining to their medical status,” Campbell said in his memo.
ALPA India, another pilots’ body with 800 members, also accused the probe agency of “secrecy” surrounding the investigation, saying “suitably qualified personnel” were not involved in it.
“We feel that the investigation is being driven in a direction presuming the guilt of pilots and we strongly object to this line of thought,” ALPA India president Sam Thomas said in a statement issued on Saturday.
The Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) said it was “deeply disturbed by speculative narratives … particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide”.
“There is absolutely no basis for such a claim at this stage,” it said in a statement on Sunday, adding, “it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved.”
 
 

“To casually suggest pilot suicide without verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting and a disservice to the dignity of the profession,” it said.
The ICPA was referring to a number of aviation experts suggesting engine fuel control switches can only be moved deliberately and manually.
The commanding pilot of the Air India plane was Sumeet Sabharwal, 56, who had a total flying experience of 15,638 hours and, according to the Indian government, was also an Air India instructor. His co-pilot was Clive Kunder, 32, who had 3,403 hours of total experience.
Air India has come under heightened scrutiny on multiple fronts following the crash.
On July 4, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said it would investigate budget unit Air India Express, after a Reuters report revealed the airline failed to promptly replace engine parts on an Airbus A320 as mandated, and falsified records to indicate compliance.
US FAA, Boeing notify fuel switch locks are safe, document, sources say
The US FAA and Boeing have privately issued notifications that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen by Reuters showed, and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The FAA’s Continued Airworthiness Notification on July 11 came after a preliminary report into the crash, which raised questions over engine fuel cutoff switches.
 
 

The FAA’s notification to Civil Aviation Authorities, seen by Reuters, said: “although the fuel control switch design, including the locking feature, is similar on various Boeing airplane models, the FAA does not consider this issue to be an unsafe condition that would warrant an Airworthiness Directive on any Boeing airplane models, including the Model 787.”
When asked for comment, the FAA said it did not have anything to add beyond the notification.
Boeing also referred to the FAA notification in a Multi-Operator-Message sent to the airlines in the past few days, which said the planemaker is not recommending any action, two of the sources with direct knowledge said.
The preliminary investigation report into the crash referred to a 2018 FAA advisory, which recommended, but did not mandate, operators of several Boeing models, including the 787, to inspect the locking feature of the fuel cutoff switches to ensure it could not be moved accidentally.
The report said Air India had said it had not carried out the FAA’s suggested inspections, as the FAA 2018 advisory was not a mandate. But it also said maintenance records showed that the throttle control module, which includes the fuel switches, was replaced in 2019 and 2023 on the plane involved in the crash.
The report noted “all applicable airworthiness directives and alert service bulletins were complied with on the aircraft as well as engines.”
ALPA India, in a letter posted on X, said the preliminary investigation report referred to the 2018 FAA advisory “concerning the fuel control switch gates, which indicates a potential equipment malfunction”.
 






Two US safety experts said on Saturday they backed ALPA India’s request to be observers in the probe, but said the investigation report did not suggest a bias toward pilot error.
John Cox, a pilot and former ALPA US representative, said AAIB’s report seemed objective and fair.
The Indian aviation regulator ordered Indian airlines to examine fuel switches on Boeing aircraft, including the 787 and 737 models, to check for any malfunctions in their locking mechanism.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation said it had issued the order after several Indian and international airlines began making their own inspections of fuel switches.
Reuters earlier reported that Air India Group had begun inspecting fuel switches on its Boeing 787 and 737 aircraft over the weekend and had discovered no problems yet.</p><small>2025-07-14 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/142053184503b5a.jpg?r=211239' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924158/trump-announces-weapons-for-ukraine-warns-russia-during-talks-with-nato-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Trump announces weapons for Ukraine, warns Russia during talks with Nato chief</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte announced a plan on Monday to rearm Ukraine with missiles and other weaponry in its fight to fend off Russian invaders and warned of severe tariffs if Moscow does not end the war.
The announcement by the two leaders followed weeks of frustration on the part of Trump with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his refusal to make an agreement to end the conflict.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made frequent appeals to Trump and Nato leaders for more weapons.
Under the deal, Trump said the US will supply weapons that will be paid for by Nato countries. Rutte said massive numbers of weapons would be sent, including missiles, as part of a first wave of equipment.
“It’s a full complement with the batteries,” Trump said when asked whether he would send Patriot missiles specifically. “We’re going to have some come very soon, within days … a couple of the countries that have Patriots are going to swap over and will replace the Patriots with the ones they have.”
Trump also warned that he would impose “very severe tariffs” on Russia if no deal is made in 50 days.
“If I was Vladimir Putin today, and you’re speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days … I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously,” Rutte said.
 


Trump has been reluctant to punish Russia, but he came away from a recent phone call with Putin disappointed that the Russian leader appeared prepared to continue the war.
“Putin really surprised a lot of people. He talks nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening,” Trump said on Sunday, as he returned from watching the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey.
The White House has U-turned from an announcement earlier this month that it would pause some arms deliveries to Kyiv, instead announcing a new deal which would involve Nato purchasing some US weapons to send to Ukraine.
Last week, Trump accused Putin of throwing “bullshit” at Washington on Ukraine, openly frustrated with the impasse on peace efforts.
As he began his second stint in office in January, Trump insisted he could work with the Russian leader to end the war in Ukraine swiftly, and held off on hiking sanctions, unlike Kyiv’s European allies.
But Russia has for months refused a ceasefire proposed by the US and Ukraine.
‘Sledgehammer’
Republican senators, meanwhile, are touting a bipartisan bill that would arm Trump with a “sledgehammer” to use against Russia.
The sanctions bill would allow Trump “to go after Putin’s economy, and all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine”, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told broadcaster CBS News.
It “would give President Trump the ability to impose 500pc tariffs on any country that helps Russia”, said Graham, adding that those could include economies that purchase Russian goods such as China, India or Brazil.
“This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war,” Graham said.
 


Graham and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal were also due to meet Rutte today.
Blumenthal told CBS News they would also discuss the legally thorny issue of unlocking frozen Russian assets in Europe and the United States for access by Ukraine.
“The $5 billion that the United States has also could be accessed, and I think it’s time to do it,” said Blumenthal.
Zelensky said the proposed bill “is exactly the kind of leverage that can bring peace closer and make sure diplomacy is not empty”.
The Kremlin has previously said that sending arms to Ukraine would only prolong the conflict.
Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and has shown little appetite for ending the conflict despite pressure from Trump.
Over the summer, Russia has escalated its offensive and advanced the front line, launching some of the largest missile and drone attacks of the war.</p><small>2025-07-14 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14200608c98bf87.jpg?r=204852' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924177/revamped-federal-constabulary-not-a-police-force-state-minister-talal-chaudhry-clarifies' target='_blank'><strong>Revamped Federal Constabulary not a police force, state minister Talal Chaudhry clarifies</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhary on Monday stressed that the revamped Federal Constabulary (FC) was not a police force.
President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday promulgated an ordinance empowering the federal government to transform the FC, a border security force, into the Federal Constabulary to maintain law and order, supplement the law enforcement agencies, and address the diverse security needs in a coordinated manner.
According to the ordinance, the Frontier Consta­bulary was originally established to maintain law and order in frontier and border areas, ensuring the security of these critical regions, and preserving public peace in remote territories. However, the changing dynamics of national security, the increasing frequency of emergencies, natural disasters, civil unrest, and other emerging threats necessitated a more adaptable and versatile force to respond to such challenges.
Before this ordinance, the use of force by the government for VIP security often attracted criticism, but now, under the name of protecting “escort”, the force can be freely used for the personal security of the elite.
Addressing a press conference today in Faisalabad with FC Commandant Riaz Nazir Gara, Chaudhry said: “The Federal Constabulary will be the Federal Constabulary. No one should confuse it with the federal police.”
He said the Frontier Constabulary was being restructured and renamed only to bolster internal and national security. The minister said that the revamping was an institutional necessity to improve coordination, compensation and capability of this force across all provinces and territories.
“It is purely a defence-related issue to strengthen national defence by providing support to the law enforcement agencies,” he added.
He said that the FC had played a pivotal role in maintaining peace and security within the country and along its borders for nearly a century, yet the force was not accorded the recognition and benefits comparable to other security forces in Pakistan.
He lamented that despite limited salaries and fewer privileges, FC personnel had consistently served the nation with unwavering dedication.
“Now, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi have decided to transform FC into a federal force to address the disparity with upgraded structure and scope under the new name of Federal Constabulary,” he added.
He clarified that while the name was being changed, the identity and core function of the FC as a constabulary remained intact. “The restructuring would help ensure that its personnel receive salaries, training and benefits equal to those of other national security forces,” he added.
He said that the FC had a long role in combatting drug trafficking, smuggling and supporting civil law enforcement agencies during sensitive events such as Muharram, elections and anti-polio campaigns.
“Now it will continue to carry out these responsibilities under its new federal framework,” he added.
Chaudhry said that with the reorganisation, the jurisdiction of the Federal Constabulary would be expanded to include all four provinces as well as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu & Kashmir.
He said that recruitment would be opened to all citizens from across the country and the federal government would bear all operational and financial responsibilities, relieving the provinces of any budgetary burden.
The development prompted concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.
The announcement came after the PTI said it would stage nationwide protests starting on August 5, the second anniversary of party founder Imran Khan’s arrest. Several such protests since his August 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.
PTI leader Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.
The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters”, he said.
His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.
“We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.</p><small>2025-07-14 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14163930b797dfa.jpg?r=170111' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924157/gb-bans-new-construction-near-hunza-lakes-eco-senstive-sites-in-baltistan-division' target='_blank'><strong>GB bans new construction near Hunza lakes, eco-senstive sites in Baltistan division</strong></a><br><p>Gilgit-Baltistan has imposed a moratorium on all kinds of construction and expansion of hotels on three famous lakes in Hunza, as well as in ecologically-sensitive areas in the Baltistan division, it emerged on Monday.
Earlier this month, the Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GB-EPA) recommended a five-year ban on the construction and expansion of hotels on three lakes in Hunza.
Last month, the GB administration imposed a fine of Rs1.5 million on a hotel for allegedly dumping sewage waste into Attabad Lake.
The development came a day after a foreign tourist and vlogger named George Buckley posted a video on his Instagram page, claiming that sewage water was being pumped out by the hotel into the Attabad Lake.
A notification by the office of the Hunza Division Deputy Commissioner, dated July 11, available with Dawn.com, said, “Accordingly, issuance of any new no-objection certificates (NOCs) for construction or expansion of
commercial or residential structures is hereby suspended with immediate effect and until further orders, in the following areas.”
The notification specified that no new constructions or extensions would be allowed in the Attabad and Borit lake areas, and a complete ban would be imposed on construction near the Duiker lake owing to “fragile mountain ecology and limited carrying capacity”.
A separate notification by the Baltistan Division Deputy Commissioner ordered to, “Impose a region-wide moratorium on new construction of hotels/motels in ecologically-sensitive areas until full compliance with the Ecologically Sensitive and Critical Areas Rules 2023 is verified.”
Previously, in a July 4th letter addressed to the Baltistan division commissioner, the GB-EPA identified uncontrolled hotel construction activity in central Skardu and surrounding areas, Upper Kachura and Lower Kachura Lake vicinities, Hargeisa Nullah, Bashoo Nullah and Meadows, and Chook or Zookh Nullah near Kachura as areas of concern.
It also identified tourism hotspots in Shigar, Kharmang, and Ghanche districts.
In a letter addressed to the Hunza DC dated July 1, the GB-EPA recommended an “Immediate halt to new hotel constructions in central Hunza lacking proper wastewater systems and a five-year moratorium on all hotel-related construction and expansion in central Hunza, Duikar, Attabad, and Borit Lake[s]”.
The letter also called for a complete ban on construction along the banks of Borit Lake, with strict regulation of boating and its notification as an eco-tourism destination to protect its ecological function.
The recommendations state that environmental problems are becoming critical due to hotels built on the culturally important lakes of Attabad, Duiker, and Borit in central Hunza.
According to the letter, a recent investigation into improper disposal of sewage by hotels had revealed facts of unorganised and shoddy construction and also identified shortcomings such as inadequate wastewater discharge systems and construction defects.
The report said that this unregulated and unsupervised development is compromising public health, freshwater resources, and sustainable development of the tourism sector, and is causing destruction to the ecosystem.
It further stated that the sewage disposal system of hotels is outdated, ineffective and low capacity, resulting in water channels and the Hunza River being directly polluted.
The report has disclosed that when the drinking water was tested in this poor situation, sewage contamination was confirmed, posing the risks of typhoid, dysentery and hepatitis.
According to the report, the widespread use of diesel-powered generators by hotels is also causing air pollution, which is posing a respiratory hazard to tourists. It added that this practice is contrary to the concept of a clean, environmentally friendly place.
The report also shed light on the situation of Duiker Lake. Due to the uncontrolled construction of hotels, the environment at this lake is rapidly deteriorating.
The agency expressed fear that inadequate sewage and poor human waste disposal arrangements are damaging the fragile mountain environment of the area.
 
 

The report recommends a five-year ban on all new construction and hotel expansion around Attabad Lake to help protect water quality, maintain ecological balance, and protect it from natural disasters, especially floods and landslides, as well as ensure the constant availability of clean drinking water.
The agency recommends that boating and tourist activities in the lake should be restricted for this purpose. The report says that the lake is a protected area under Section 172 of the Forest Act 2019. It is an important habitat for migratory and endangered bird species.
“However, boating activities here are creating a disturbing situation for nesting and movement of birds in this place, which is seriously damaging the international importance and ecological functions of the lake,” the letter said.
The GB-EPA called for a transition to eco-friendly, community-based tourism is urgently needed. This model ensures:
“With responsible tourism policies, Hunza can become a global benchmark for sustainable mountain tourism,” the letter said.</p><small>2025-07-14 15:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1412581433d0f05.jpg?r=135720' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924137/at-least-6-die-as-heavy-rains-continue-to-wreak-havoc-across-kp' target='_blank'><strong>At least 6 die as heavy rains continue to wreak havoc across KP</strong></a><br><p>At least six people have died, including four children, while one person was injured over the last 24 hours in rain-related incidents as heavy downpours continue to lash parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Monday.
Last week, PDMA alerted the district administrations across KP to the possibility of floods due to a new spell of torrential rains from July 11 to 17. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province in June and are set to continue.
Pakistan experiences Monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
In Bajaur, a woman died after the boundary wall of her house collapsed due to heavy rain and gusty winds, according to the PDMA report, while in Khyber district, two children were swept away in a flash flood after heavy rains.
Per the report, Rescue 1122 officials found the body of one of the children, adding that efforts were underway to find the other missing child. Another child — who was injured after being struck by lightning  — was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable condition.
In Kohat, a man died after the roof of his house caved in, while two children. aged seven and 12,  died as a result of a wall collapse in Malakand.
 
 

According to the report, a total of three houses were partially damaged due to rain and flash floods. The PDMA has directed the relevant administrations to provide immediate assistance to the bereaved families and remain on high alert in case of an emergency.
According to the KP PDMA spokesperson, the authority was in touch with all district administrations and relief agencies. He added that PDMA’s Emergency Operation Centre was fully functional and urged the public to report any untoward incident on their helpline 1700.
The PDMA, in its countrywide weather advisory, warned that there was a risk of flooding in Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, Muree, Galiat, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Swabi, Nowshera, Mardan, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, DG Khan, North East Punjab, Balochistan and Kashmir as heavy rains continue.
According to the report, there was a risk of landslide due to the rain in KP, Murree, Galiat, Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan, which may disrupt traffic movement.
PDMA advised citizens to exercise caution, as damaged infrastructure could pose a threat to public safety.
Low-lying areas of Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar may face flooding as well, the report said.

The weather in other parts of the country remained hot and humid. The maximum temperature recorded was 43 degrees Celsius in Jacobabad, Rohri, Dadu, Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh and Dalbandin in Balochistan.
Heavy rain predicted till July 17 countrywide: PMD
Meanwhile, heavy rain is predicted till July 17 countrywide, according to a weather advisory issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
According to the Met Office, a low-pressure area is presently located over northwest Madhya Pradesh in India and is likely to affect Pakistan, during the next 24 to 72 hours
“Under the influence of this weather system, strong monsoon currents are expected to penetrate the central and upper parts, while a westerly wave is also present over the upper parts of the country,” the PMD said.
 






Rain-windstorm/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls are expected in Azad Jammu and Kashmir from the night of July 14th to the 17th, while rain-windstorm/thunderstorm is expected in Gilgit-Baltistan as well, with occasional gaps.
In KP, rain-windstorm/thundershower with scattered heavy falls is expected in multiple districts, including Peshawar and Abbottabad.
“Rain-windstorm/thundershower with scattered heavy falls is expected” in Punjab as well as the capital.

Landslides and mudslides may cause road closures in the vulnerable hilly areas of KP, Murree, Galliyat, AJK and GB as well, according to the advisory. Torrential rain may damage standing crops in Punjab, KP and Kashmir
111 monsoon-related deaths since late June: NDMA
The monsoon rains have been linked to more than 110 deaths, including dozens of children, since they arrived in late June, according to data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
Data between June 26 and July 14 showed that electrocution was the leading cause of fatalities, followed by flash floods. In late June, at least 13 tourists were swept to their deaths while sheltering from flash floods on a raised river bank.
In its latest report, the NDMA said 111 people, including 53 children, have been killed, with the highest number of deaths in Punjab.</p><small>2025-07-14 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1418214114a1912.png?r=190755' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924165/trilateral-working-group-in-the-offing-between-pakistan-iran-and-iraq-to-prevent-illegal-migration' target='_blank'><strong>Trilateral working group in the offing between Pakistan, Iran and Iraq to prevent ‘illegal migration’</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Monday announced that he and his counterparts in and Iran and Iraq will form a trilateral working group to prevent illegal migration under the guise of pilgrimage, Radio Pakistan reported.
Earlier this month, the government, during a meeting, decided that under the new measures, the traditional Salar System for zaireen (pilgrims) will be abolished and replaced with a zaireen group organisers model. From 2026 onwards, pilgrims will only be allowed to travel under registered organisers.
Speaking at a trilateral conference of the interior ministers of Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq in Tehran, Naqvi told journalists the conference agreed to take all possible measures to facilitate zaireen travelling to Iran and Iraq.

“We had a great and good discussion,” Naqvi said. “We will have a joint working group between the three countries so we can have better coordination.
“The most important thing to acknowledge is that there are several million people who go to Iraq, and this is a big credit for the Iraqi interior ministry. Every year, they host them without flaw and every year it gets much better.”
According to Radio Pakistan, the working group, comprising representatives from all three countries would be established to streamline and support the process of travel for pilgrimages.
 


During the trilateral conference, Naqvi said that the registration process for zaireen group organisers has already commenced. He said from January 1 next year, Pakistani zaireen will travel to Iraq exclusively under registered group organisers, rather than individually.
“We will not be allowing any Pakistani to leave Iraq without zaireen group organisers,” Naqvi said. “We will be registering people who are allowed to take the groups to Iraq and they are bound to bring back all the people who are going with them.”
According to the interior minister, these groups will be responsible for ensuring the safe return of pilgrims travelling to Iraq.
“Only individuals issued a special visa by the embassy will be permitted to travel independently,” he added.
“The illegal issue that Iraq is facing, people who are overstaying there … who have started working there, we need to stop this. I am totally against all those who are staying illegally.”
Naqvi said Iraq and Iran are fully aligned with Pakistan’s new system and reaffirmed their commitment to jointly curbing irregular travel and overstays. He also assured his counterparts of Islamabad’s full cooperation in matters concerning zaireen.

The commission’s hearing notice states that the session will take place on Tuesday (tomorrow) at 3:30pm (12:30am PKT on Wednesday) and will “examine the government of Pakistan’s persecution of opposition political figures and journalists, and its actions to control media communications and prevent free and fair elections in Pakistan”. The session is open to the public and the media.
“Many date the current phase of repression in Pakistan to 2022, when, with the involvement of the Pakistan military, popular Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted, and soon after, arrested, convicted of corruption and imprisoned,” the notice read.
“Parliamentary elections in February 2024 were, according to the US State Department, marked by ‘undue restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly’, as well as ‘electoral violence, and restrictions on the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms’,” it added.
 






The commission provided a list of witnesses who would provide testimony during Tuesday’s hearing. Besides Bukhari, the list includes Amnesty International’s Advocacy Director for Europe and Central Asia, Ben Linden; Perseus Strategies Managing Director Jared Genser; and Afghanistan Impact Network founder Sadiq Amini.
A press release from the commission’s co-chairman, Republican Congressman Christopher Smith, who will chair the session, said the meeting would “discuss the government of Pakistan’s ongoing political repression, the US response, and offer recommendations for Congress”.
Bukhari announced that he would be testifying before the commission in a post on X dated July 9, expressing gratitude to the commission’s co-chairs, Democratic Congressman James McGovern and Smith, for the opportunity to testify.
“I will be highlighting the arbitrary detention of Imran Khan, his wife, and other political prisoners, as well as the erosion of democracy, the undermining of the rule of law, and escalating crackdowns on freedom of expression in Pakistan,” he wrote.
Genser replied to Bukhari’s post, writing, “I am honoured and grateful to be able to testify alongside you before the [Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission] on Pakistan, human rights and the situation of Imran Khan and all political prisoners being held by the current regime.”
 






Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.
In May, Freedom Network’s annual Freedom of Expression and Media Freedom Report for 2025 said Pakistan’s media is standing at a crossroads amid an existential threat and increased restrictive environment, deteriorating safety and job security, significant challenges to professional integrity of media and its practitioners.
Titled ‘Free speech and public interest journalism under siege’, the report finds that the existential crisis was triggered by amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) in January 2025 that now “makes it easier” for authorities to arrest, fine and imprison journalists and dissidents — both offline and online — besides other challenges.
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the country’s leading human rights watchdog, has also expressed deep concern over the steadily shrinking space for human rights advocacy in the country.
In a statement issued earlier this month, the HRCP said it had faced a series of arbitrary, illegal, and unjustified actions over the past few months, which have impeded the organisation’s ability to carry out its mandate.</p><small>2025-07-14 14:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14184046bedc8df.jpg?r=185938' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924167/avoiding-trade-curbs-vital-for-normalisation-of-ties-india-tells-china' target='_blank'><strong>Avoiding trade curbs vital for normalisation of ties, India tells China</strong></a><br><p>India and China must resolve friction along their border, pull back troops and avoid “restrictive trade measures” to normalise their relationship, India’s foreign minister told his Chinese counterpart in Beijing on Monday.
Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met Wang Yi in Beijing during his first trip to the country since 2020, when a deadly border clash between their troops led to a four-year military standoff and damaged ties until a thaw began in October, when they agreed to step back.
“Good progress” made by the countries in the past nine months for normalisation of relations is a result of the resolution of friction along their border, Jaishankar told Wang.
 






India and China share a 3,800-kilometre border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s. They fought a brief but brutal border war in 1962, and talks over the decades to settle the border dispute have made slow progress.
Last month, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told his Chinese counterpart that the two countries should seek a “permanent solution” to the border dispute, seen as a new push by New Delhi for a conclusive outcome.
“It is now incumbent on us to address other aspects related to the border, including de-escalation,” Jaishankar said, adding that it was also critical that restrictive trade measures and roadblocks be avoided to foster mutually beneficial cooperation.
 
 

The minister was speaking against the backdrop of Beijing’s restrictions in recent months on supplies of critical minerals such as rare earth magnets and machinery for the manufacturing of high-tech goods.
India holds the world’s fifth-largest rare earth reserves, but its domestic output remains underdeveloped.
There was no immediate Chinese readout of the talks between Jaishankar and Wang.
Jaishankar, who is in China to attend the meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, met Chinese Vice President Han Zheng earlier in the day, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.
India and China should steadily advance practical cooperation and respect each other’s concerns, Han told Jaishankar, Xinhua said.</p><small>2025-07-14 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14182343b2bdf3c.png?r=185434' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924164/additional-fbr-powers-have-nothing-to-do-with-income-tax-aurangzeb' target='_blank'><strong>Additional FBR powers have ‘nothing to do with income tax’: Aurangzeb</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday said that the additional powers granted to the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) had nothing to do with income tax.
The expanded enforcement powers for the FBR include the authority to block high-value financial transactions by non-filers — such as vehicle and property purchases, investment in securities and mutual funds, and opening certain prestigious bank accounts — along with powers to seal unregistered business premises, confiscate goods and recover taxes from firms, including those in the public sector. The move has generated criticism from many quarters.
Addressing the matter in a press conference in Karachi today, Aurangzeb said, “I think there is something to understand about what the existing law was at the time. The first thing to understand is that it has no relation to income tax. This whole issue is a sales tax fraud issue.”
The finance minister added that in the original law, Inland Revenue Service officers had the authority to arrest, and it was the opinion of the government that additional safeguards should be developed in this regard.
He described the lengthy process of taking this bill into the standing committees and the “detailed discussions” on each clause in the Senate finance committee, the National Assembly and finally the parliament before its approval, including feedback from the Pakistan Bar Council’s vice chairman.
Aurangzeb requested that people read the new safeguards that were developed, pointing out that of the 10-12 sections, six of them addressed sales tax fraud “because they are more serious offences vis a vis tax fraud versus the other six”.
He also added that the power would only be exercised if the value of the sales tax fraud was over Rs50 million, and that it would be exercised on a commissioner level, with the permissions being acquired from a three-member FBR board.
“This is not something parliament has approved without thinking it through,” he added. “A lot of thought has gone into it.”
 


The finance minister also highlighted two areas in which banks could lend further support and assistance in achieving sustainable growth in the economy, focusing on the areas of privatisation and the restructuring and revival of sick units. He said that there were currently 24 state-owned enterprises that were given to the privatisation commission, adding that “banks can play a very important role in this, and they should”.
He stressed that there were many possible external reasons for an industry to struggle, such as macroeconomic factors, commodity prices, inflation and high interest rates, which impair their ability to pay. Aurangzeb called for banks to join with sponsors to revive the sick units, saying that this would be “a very big pillar of [Minister-in-Charge for Industries and Production] Haroon Akhtar’s industrial policy (…) where banks can play a very major role”.
“I am glad that the banking sector in Pakistan is stepping up and helping the economy to grow as we go forward,” he said.
Aurangzeb added that macroeconomic stability “is not an end in itself”.
 
 

“It was a very big issue that [foreign investors’] dividends were stuck here, their profits were unable to be repatriated, there was difficulty in opening their letters of credit,” he said, expressing appreciation for the acknowledgement of the “substantial improvement” in the last 12-18 months.
“It is very important for a foreign investor that when they bring their capital, they have the assurance that ‘we can take this back at any time (…) without any prohibitions’. So to me, this is basic hygiene,” he said. “If existing investors are not satisfied, then bringing further investment in the future is very difficult. So I think we’ve come a long way from that perspective.”
Aurangzeb also stated that he had invited Faysal Bank President and CEO Yousuf Hussain and Communications Minister Abdul Aleem to Islamabad, partly to see the FBR transformation for themselves, which involved the simplification of processes and automation of procedures, and partly to bring their own outstanding issues for discussion with the whole team.
“It is very important to re-establish the credibility and trust of our tax authority in this country,” he said.
The finance minister also requested that everyone present at the conference look at the new simplified salaried class tax form that had been published on the FBR website and provide feedback as to whether it was “simplified enough”.
“The first form that used to be filled out had about 800 rows, and complicated codes,” he said, adding that now there were eight screens in total.
He added, “We have only started with the salaried class. We will take this to small traders, and then we will take it to SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). So that whatever we can facilitate in simplifying the process, we will.”
Aurangzeb added that, as of his information from two days prior, about Rs75bn in sales tax refunds had been given within this month alone, and that meetings were happening regularly for the purpose of taking the country’s economic stability towards sustainable growth, stressing that his focus was on sustainability.
“What finance minister does not want a big increase in growth?” he said, but warned against repeating “boom and bust cycles” in the country, where a “sugar rush” of chasing consumption-led growth would lead the country “back to square one”.
Addressing a structural solution to economic issues, he said, “My personal opinion is that whatever things we can deregulate, we should,” referring to the success of rice and maize crops.
“Wherever the government gets a credit, that is where there are issues,” he said. “So over a period of time, I think we should leave it to the private sector and demand and supply, and I think that to me is a structural solution.”</p><small>2025-07-14 13:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14165451d673a8f.png?r=165548' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924147/man-accused-of-trying-to-kill-woman-for-refusing-marriage-arrested-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Man accused of trying to kill woman for refusing marriage arrested in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>A man accused of trying to kill a woman by shooting her as she refused to marry him was arrested in Karachi and was found in possession of illegal weapons, the Ittehad Town police said on Monday.
However, the woman remained safe and a case under Sections 324 (attempt to commit intentional murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) was registered at the Ittehad Town police station.
As soon as the case was registered, a police team led by Station House Officer Inspector Rao Shabbir Ahmed, acting on the information of a special informant, successfully arrested the accused. The police team also found him in possession of illegal weapons. A case under Section 23(1)-A of the Arms Act was also registered in this connection.
In 2021, he had allegedly attempted to murder his ex-wife by throwing acid on her. A case was registered under Sections 336-A (hurt caused by corrosive substance) and 336-B (punishment for hurt by corrosive substance) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) at Saeedabad police station.
A firing case, in which the accused along with other unidentified persons attacked someone, was previously registered against him at Ittehad Town police station under Sections 337-H(i) (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent act), 324 (attempt to commit intentional murder), 109 (punishment of abetment), and 34 (common intention).
There has been a recorded rise in the cases of violence against women throughout the country in recent years, with the Sindh High Court noting that the police treat these cases in a non-serious way.
In March, a man was held for killing his wife outside Karachi Malir court. In January, an unidentified young woman was killed in an execution-style shooting in Orangi Town.</p><small>2025-07-14 12:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/141359539a0cb8f.png?r=140042' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924143/pti-protests-aim-to-destabilise-country-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>PTI protests aim to destabilise country: Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Monday criticised the PTI for seeking dialogue with the establishment instead of talking with politicians, suggesting the party only wanted to “destabilise the country with protests”.
His statement came as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, a day prior, called on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI but demanded that they hold themselves accountable. Gandapur and the PTI’s top leadership were on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a movement to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 — marking two years since the ex-premier was imprisoned.
Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, which he claims are politically motivated, his party’s relationship with the government and the establishment has turned sour. The PTI has held several protests over the last year, most of which escalated into violence after facing state repression.
Sanaullah said that Gandapur’s words made it clear that the PTI wanted to “destabilise the country, right after Marka-i-Haq” (referring to the recent Pakistan-India escalation) and the government’s “success in economic revival, which lent Pakistan an opportunity for stability”.
“Besides this, it is unknown what other agenda they have,” he added.
Referring to the planned 90-day and August 5 protests, Sanaullah said, “If they remain peaceful, then it’s fine (…) it is their democratic right. But if they take the law into their own hands and attempt to destabilise the country (…) then the law will take its due course.”
He added that this destabilisation “has been their (PTI’s) agenda from the beginning”, referring to the party demonstrating outside the International Monetary Fund (IMF) offices against their granting of an emergency loan to Pakistan.
He dismissed the notion that the government, despite being relatively stable now, would consider being more generous in negotiations for Imran’s release, saying that “it had nothing to do with generosity and that the case was proceeding according to the rules of the court.”
He pointed out how it was the PTI’s own stance in previous negotiations that Imran’s release would not be discussed, as the PTI founder himself expressed the desire to be acquitted on his own merit.
 
 

According to Sanaullah, the government was ready to hold talks with the PTI on other issues, but he said that according to the party’s recent calls for negotiations, it “does not want dialogue with the government, but with the establishment”.
“They are not willing to sit down with either political parties or politicians to solve issues,” he said. “They are still stuck on their own agenda, seeking the establishment’s help to put them back into power. They are not ready for political dialogue.”
Asked what counter-demands the government might hold in negotiations, he said, “We have only one wish, one effort, one fight: the revival of Pakistan’s economy and its success, such that every citizen’s wellbeing is ensured and it is included on the map of the world as a welfare state.”
Sanaullah added that the government was ready to sit with the PTI and other parties for talks to ensure the stability required for this effort if they were willing to cooperate.
“It is in everybody’s mutual interest, the opposition and government’s, and everybody should agree on a ‘charter of economy’ on certain basic matters,” he said. “We are ready for any understanding or agreement in this regard.”
The previous day, on Geo News’ programme “Naya Pakistan”, Sanaullah had questioned the PTI’s intention of holding negotiations alongside heavy protesting, saying, “If they want to talk, then what is the need for the 90 days, the August 5 [protests] and the march towards Lahore?”
However, he stated that the PTI would be granted legal permission to protest by the local administration if they remained peaceful.
“If they move towards violence, the law will take its course,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-14 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1414385612c7548.jpg?r=143907' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924133/cybercrime-agency-raids-illegal-call-centre-in-islamabad-arrests-five-foreign-nationals' target='_blank'><strong>Cybercrime agency raids illegal call centre in Islamabad, arrests five foreign nationals</strong></a><br><p>The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) conducted a successful raid last night on an illegal call centre in Islamabad and arrested five foreign nationals, according to a press release issued on Monday.
The NCCIA press release stated that more than 60 people were working at the call centre, of which five foreign nationals were arrested during the raid.
“In addition to these arrests, the NCCIA will take further legal action against those who provided facilities and security to these individuals,” the statement said.
A spokesperson reiterated the agency’s resolve to continue its operations against all such illegal activities that amount to a violation of the country’s laws.
A first information report (FIR) was registered on Sunday by complainant Aamir Azeem Abbasi regarding a “task-based scam resulting in financial loss”.
According to the FIR, a reliable source informed that a criminal gang was operating a call centre located in Sardar Plaza, G-10 Markaz, Islamabad.
An inquiry concluded that the call centre activities were carried out “with active connivance of each other by impersonating as representatives of a fake and dubious online earning company.”
The FIR further stated “ulterior motives to extort money, contact persons of different nationalities and lure them into a dubious easy-money-making scheme.”
Equipment used in the execution of the digital scam was found and taken into possession by NCCIA Islamabad.
“The accused persons could not present any lawful justification” and confessed to working as a gang to perform electronic fraud via extortion and impersonation.“
The gang used internet downloaded and AI-generated photos and fake personas to “initiate conversations with isolated or vulnerable individuals through social media such as Facebook, Telegram and WhatsApp through victim hunting.”
The operation, per the FIR, was a multi-tier set-up consisting of scammers that chat with victims initially, Telegram receptionists who receive collated information on the victims to lure them in for more advanced tasks, finance managers, who managed crypto accounts for receiving fraudulent funds generated via local and international scams, and “killers”, who reside in foreign countries like Cambodia and empty victims’ bank accounts under the pretext of online earning.
The FIR concluded that the accused gang extorted “huge amounts of money from local Pakistani as well as international victims by accessing their confidential information and misusing such data for extorting money. This fraudulent money is layered via cryptocurrency wallets.”
The raid follows a similar incident last week where the NCCIA claimed to have arrested 149 persons, including 48 Chinese and nationals of some other countries, for their alleged involvement in online fraud during a raid on a factory in Faisalabad.
Days after the arrest, a Faisalabad special court allowed a five-day physical remand of 87 suspects, including 18 women, allegedly involved in various cybercrimes, and sent 62 others to the district jail on a 14-day judicial remand, on the request of the NCCIA.
Last month, 18 suspects believed to be involved in a high-profile online scam were arrested and produced before a Karachi court. A judicial magistrate remanded them into the custody of the NCCIA for interrogation.
In May, the NCCIA, in coordination with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Dutch police, arrested 21 suspects involved in cybercrime operations and digital fraud worth millions of dollars in Multan and Lahore.</p><small>2025-07-14 09:33</small></div><hr>
