Within five minutes of the Pahalgam attack, Indian media started pointing fingers at Pakistan alleging it had enabled the terrorist attack. Two weeks later, India attacked without providing a shred of evidence of Pakistan’s alleged involvement. The purpose of this article is to urge Indian policymakers to avoid prolonging their actions as the political, social and economic costs for their own country are substantial, and instead, examine their policy stance dispassionately.
India ranks fifth among global economies and has an impressive record of rapid economic growth, which has lifted several hundred million out of poverty. It is one of the world’s leading exporters of IT and IT-enabled services, and aspires to become a developed economy by 2047, with the size of its economy projected to range between $23-35 trillion. This requires an uninterrupted and continuously upward moving growth curve. India is also working hard to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council and is among a group of developing countries leading the movement towards a multipolar world with the expanding role of BRICS.
Given this wide range of ambitions, any attempt to disrupt regional peace through kinetic or non-kinetic actions will derail it from its chosen path. Peaceful and cordial relations with neighbouring countries, on the other hand, would enhance the prospects of attaining these ambitions.
 
 

There have been past instances, such as in the 2001-02 stand-off, when Indian policymakers made sensible decisions and withdrew from the path of prolonged confrontation. The Indian troops were mobilised in large numbers in 2001-02 along the Pakistan border and as Zahid Hussain recently noted “there was an imminent threat of a full-fledged war between the two countries, but sanity prevailed. Not only was war prevented, but a more substantive peace process between India and Pakistan was also witnessed”.
The economic costs of military adventures, along with at least six other channels, can adversely affect the trajectory of India’s path towards prosperity and influence as a regional power. Elevated risk perception, trade routes and supply chain disruptions and uncertainty about the future would activate the channels highlighted below.

Any attempt by India to disrupt regional peace will derail it from its chosen path.

Cost of military adventures: Foreign affairs forums on the economic impacts of a full-scale India-Pakistan war estimate the daily cost of mobilising operations could reach $670 million with broader economic losses potentially reaching $17.8 billion, which is equivalent to a 20 per cent GDP contraction over four weeks of conflict. According to Antonis Bhardwaj, a short-term conventional India-Pakistan war could cost between INR14.6bn and INR50bn a day in direct military expenses. A prolonged conflict, accounting for broader macroeconomic impacts could lead to economic losses exceeding $17.8bn daily.
Global capability centres: 1,800 offshore corporate offices owned by hundreds of foreign-based MNCs operate in India; they generated earnings of $65bn in 2024. During the last few years, over 150 GCCs have provided back-office, legal, accounting, engineering, design, product development, consulting and architect services, and they act as R&D centres. Many other corporations are thinking of following suit. The principals of existing and planned centres may have second thoughts if political tensions or cross-border incursions continue from time to time.
Tourism: India receives 10m tourists every year recording a growth rate of 20pc, contributing $30bn in foreign exchange earnings. The tourist industry has a high multiplier effect on local economies and is a source of significant employment in hospitality, transport, entertainment, handicraft and many other ancillary services. Empirical evidence shows that there is a drop in tourist visits even if there is a semblance of disturbance or violence or threat in the host country. Thus this 20pc annual growth in tourism may be lost.
Financial markets: External capital flows, FDI, foreign portfolio investment, external commercial borrowings, nonresident Indian deposits and workers’ remittances have contributed to the build-up of large foreign exchange reserves and financed the large excess of capital flows over and above those required to finance the current account deficit. Foreign investors own about $800bn worth of Indian stocks — roughly 16pc of India’s market cap. Foreign funds are not insensitive to the larger political and economic ecosystem. Financial markets would experience capital flight. Moody’s analytics estimates that potential foreign investment outflows of $10-15bn would take place within the first month of conflict.
Defence spending: India has allocated $78.7bn in the FY25 budget for defence. Many voices are pleading to further increase the allocations to modernise and upgrade equipment. An increased threat perception of incursions, war or skirmishes across the LOC or international borders may, in fact, result in larger budgetary allocations for defence. In a country where 800m people still receive subsidised food ration it would be unfortunate if the resources are diverted from welfare to military goods.
Foreign direct investment: India is one of the major recipients of FDI with a cumulative amount of $1.05tr. These flows have increased 20 times from FY01 to FY24 from $237m in 1990 to $71bn 2024. The RBI Bulletin has observed that India is poised to benefit from supply chain realignments, diversified FDI sources and engagement with global investors seeking resilience and scale, given its already established trade linkages. These linkages and realignments would be at risk of rupture if confidence in the economy falters as a result of worsening cross-border skirmishes.
Indus Waters Treaty: The IWT’s unilateral abeyance is hardly justifiable on moral and legal grounds. Given the growing hazards of climate change the two countries along with China and Bangladesh should negotiate an arrangement where food security, water availability and the energy needs of the lower riparian countries are ensured. A potential humanitarian crisis — for which India would be blamed — should be avoided.
Many neutral observers have opined that given Pakistan’s struggle to put the economy on track, its fight against TTP and BLA terrorism and its banning of the Lashkar-i-Taiba and other extremist groups and prosecution of their leaders, it is highly implausible that it would indulge in proxy wars.

One imagines viewers needing a cup of tea and a lie-down afterwards, if only to reorient with reality.
Consider, for example, the breathless ‘coverage’ that has been aired by several Indian news channels regarding their military’s campaign against Pakistan. During Thursday night’s transmissions, one claimed that Islamabad had fallen, another that Peshawar had been bombed; one that Lahore was in the crosshairs of Indian tanks, and another that the Karachi port was in flames. One promised that an F-16 had been shot down, while another that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had surrendered. But it was the gaggle of ‘experts’ on a live Times Now broadcast, excitedly proclaiming that a ground invasion of Pakistan was underway, that truly captured the absurdity of it all.
Truth is the first casualty of war, but it is nonetheless jarring to witness its assassination on such an industrial scale. That the fog of war obscures the truth is understandable, but for newsrooms to actively add to the fog rather than try to pierce it, less so. That said, the media on this side of the border is also not above blame. A few television channels and the so-called experts featured on them have been acting irresponsibly. They must avoid unconfirmed or unverified reports and concentrate more on sensible reporting.
 
 

But at least Pakistani media is publicly censured when it is unable to do justice to its duty. Many will openly state that they do not trust it to report truthfully and reliably and will be more open to what independent sources and foreign media have to say. One wonders if there is a similar level of self-awareness next door, where major news networks seem engaged in a race to outdo each other in patriotic theatre, unmoored from any discernible restraint.
Reports that social media platforms like X and Meta have been ‘legally’ coerced into blocking thousands of accounts to protect New Delhi’s narratives should invite global concern over the health of the world’s so-called ‘largest democracy’. More so because the ‘information’ being fed to the Indian people is patently false, dangerously misleading, and designed to whip up base sentiments. Media irresponsibility can lead to the creation of unrealistic expectations in the minds of ordinary people, and these expectations, when unmet, often turn into pressure on leaders to ‘do more’ against the perceived enemy. This is how skirmishes escalate into battles, and battles into full-blown wars. It bears repeating that in times of crisis, it is the journalists’ job to inform, not inflame. The dereliction of this duty has dangerous real-world consequences. Media on both sides of the border would do well to heed this warning.

• Worried residents of India-held Kashmir flee Uri; Omar Abdullah reports hearing heavy artillery fire in occupied Jammu
MUZAFFARABAD: Amid rising tensions between the two nuclear armed neighbours, intense exchanges continued along the Line of Control on Thursday night and into Friday, with the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) PM describing the Indian bombardment as “some of the heaviest shelling in recent times”.
Both Pakistan and India have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, and on Friday conflicting reports emerged of blackouts and intense shelling being heard in India-held Kashmir as well.
The occupied territory’s chief minister, Omar Abdullah, posted on X on Friday night, saying he could hear “intermittent sounds of blasts, probably heavy artillery”, adding that there was a blackout in held Jammu as well.
While he did not mention Pakistan or accuse it of carrying out the attacks, he called on people to stay off the streets and ignore rumours and unverified information.
On the Pakistan side, locals said the Indian aggression, which resumed after sundown on Friday, claimed the lives of six civilians — including a 40-day-old infant — and left more than 30 others injured, officials confirmed.
 
 

“This was the heaviest artillery shelling in recent times, affecting even those areas that had largely remained untou­ched in previous ceasefire violations,” said AJK Prime Minis­ter Chaudhry Anwarul Haq at a press conference in his office on Friday afternoon.
“However, the resilience shown by our people and the befitting response by our armed forces to the enemy’s aggression is truly commendable,” he added.
Earlier in the day, officials from Poonch, Muzaffarabad and Mirpur divisions shared details of the widespread damage and casualties as the shelling intensified past midnight.
In Kotehri Najam Khan village of Bagh district, 22-year-old Usama Ishrat — who had married just 10 days earlier — lost his life when an artillery shell, reportedly fired from the Uri sector, pierced the tin roof of his house at around 3:50am.
His sisters, Anoob Shahzadi, 19, and Kashaf Ishrat, 17, along with a neighbour, Basharat Hussain, 52, sustained injuries.
In the Haveli district, several people were injured by shelling between midnight and 2am on Friday.
Kotli district suffered some of the heaviest losses.
In Gora village of Khuiratta tehsil, a shell that struck a house claimed the lives of 20-year-old Samra Asif and her 40-day-old daughter Ziman Fatima.
In Balyal Bharot village, 58-year-old Raja Shahpal, and in Bandli village, 32-year-old Usman Khalid were slain after being hit by shell fragments inside their homes. Locals said Mr Khalid had returned from Libya barely a week ago for a vacation.
Apart from the casualties, numerous homes and public-sector buildings — including healthcare facilities — were also damaged in the cross-LoC shelling.
All educational institutions in the region remained closed on Friday. The prime minister said a review of school reopening and board examinations would be undertaken on Monday.
“People are not willing to leave their homes, which reflects their extraordinary courage,” the premier said. “We had to forcibly evacuate them for their own safety.”
Meanwhile, on Friday, the government announced the suspension of weekend holidays in all departments classified as essential services under the AJK Essential Services (Maintenance) Act, 2016.
According to a statement by the State Disaster Management Authority, at least 17 lives have been lost 53 people injured in AJK since Tuesday night due to missile attacks and shelling along the LoC.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the LoC, artillery fire destroyed or damaged dozens of homes in Uri, forcing many to flee to safer areas in towns like Baramulla.
Sajjad Shafi, a local lawmaker, told AFP that about 10 per cent of Uri’s  population — some 22,000 people — fled since the latest fighting  began.
On Friday, many more were fleeing in buses and trucks provided by the government or driving off in their own cars.
“How can we stay here?” Rubina Begum said outside her destroyed home.  “The government should lodge us somewhere safe”.

The Indian media, it would appear, isn’t happy to just kill the truth. Over the last few days, hysterical war-crazed news anchors, buoyed by trolls and pundits on social media, have made every effort to crush the truth, stomp on it, tear it up, chop it into fine pieces, set it on fire and throw away the ashes in the Indian Ocean.
When Greek dramatic Aeschylus (525/524 bc — 456/455 bc) coined the phrase, he may have been referring to the propaganda spread by states through scrolls and word of mouth. That was a simpler time — states could get away with untruths and falsehoods, with the other side none the wiser.
It takes a different kind of arrogance, however, to try to pull this off in the 21st century, when the information ecosystem is no longer inhibited by geographical limitations or even the imperative of a closed media landscape.
Into the metaverse
Over the last 24 hours, in particular, the kind of disinformation coming out of the Indian information ecosystem has been particularly bewildering — ranging from the incredulous to batshit crazy. To put this in context, here’s what the Indian media would have you believe was going on in Pakistan on the night of Thursday and Friday:

The Karachi Port had been destroyed by the Indian Navy (It wasn’t, we
know. We had shrimp karahi and grilled Red Snapper at a restaurant
adjacent to it.)

 



The Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir was arrested following a
coup (No one in Pakistan knows this but the Indian media is super confident.)

 



The Indian Army had attacked and laid claim to Islamabad and Shehbaz Sharif had been shifted to a safe house (could they also please let us know where this ‘safe house’ is?)

 



An F-16 or a JF-17 Pakistani fighter jet had been shot down (This one was confusing to the Indians too because they couldn’t decide which one they wanted to have shot down.)

 



A Pakistan Air Force pilot had been captured (They really can’t get over Abhinandan, can they?)

 



Lahore was overrun by Indian forces (What even is this obsession with Lahore? They’ll just misdirect you back to India)

 


It would be almost comical if it wasn’t so morose. Since the Indian military carried out airstrikes in Pakistan on Wednesday, over 31 civilians have been slain on this side of the border, while dozens have been injured. There are reports of casualties on the other side too. And while civilians pay the ultimate cost, the Indian media has continued to beat the war drums, cheering the BJP government’s unhinged rhetoric with some even calling for the complete annihilation of Pakistan — a country of 250 million people.
One can only imagine how dim-witted you have to be to cheer a war between two nuclear-armed countries. And yet, the Indian media seems to have no qualms about the impending doom should this escalate any further.
Let saner heads prevail
In a parallel universe, where sanity isn’t lost to jingoism and anchors aren’t screeching war cries, the media on both sides of the border would attempt to act as a communication bridge and simmer down tensions in a what is already a volatile situation.
Good journalism relies on facts, not fiction. Good journalism questions authorities’ actions, instead of inciting them to commit more acts of violence. Good journalism seeks to investigate rather than gulp down the state narrative. Most of all, good journalism calls for speaking the truth and trying to get the other side’s version, particularly in times of conflict where there is a huge cost to pay for the minutest misunderstanding.
Misreporting can also create panic among the people and pile on the pressure for action, giving rival actors little time to process and strategise before they make a move, leading to even graver consequences. Moreover, it is equally important to keep your own people adequately informed so they can make decisions for their own safety.
According to handbook on Conflict-Sensitive Reporting published by the German-based Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, in times of conflict, the media must play its role for consensus-building, correcting misconceptions and humanising the other side, among other functions.
Granted, there will always be the fog of war. A lack of credible, verifiable information, combined with misinformation are a part of conflict. It is difficult to know what is happening in real time, and even for a long time afterwards — but the Indian media went far beyond that to report entirely made-up events.
At the same time, the Indian media has never exactly been known for its predilection for the truth. In fact, quite the contrary — in 2016, the EU Disinfo Lab’s excellent report, titled India Chronicles, uncovered a rather sophisticated disinformation campaign involving “resurrected dead media, dead think-tanks and NGOs” to serve Indian interests.
But what we have witnessed over the last couple of days is one for the history books. It’s not just the self-proclaimed pundits on social media peddling the state’s narrative and dehumanising people on this side of the border; it’s not even the mainstream media’s blatant disregard for facts and accuracy when pushing the BJP government’s vitriol; what is most incredible is that many seemingly progressive voices seemed only too eager to jump the bandwagon and push the same falsehoods, sprinkled with cries of war and revenge.
All of this begs the question: was this all about ratings? Perhaps, but it is more likely a  sloppy, panicked attempt to save face, even if temporarily, in front of his nation amid international confirmation of IAF jets being shot down. It was, after all, incredibly humiliating for India to lose multiple jets, especially the much-vaunted Rafale — the purchase of which was at the heart of a corruption scandal in India — in a single ‘surprise’ operation. Coincidentally, the media blitz began just before a Reuters story of US officials confirming it.
Perhaps this was part of the psychological operations against their own people to create the impression of a victorious India for the time being. What no one seemed to care about was a potential backlash from the masses who have been cheering them on once the truth does come out or even the dent in the credibility and moral legitimacy of the Indian media in the eyes of international observers.
As I write this, there are reports that the Indian government has banned The Wire, one of the few publications questioning the popular narrative. In a sea of yes-men, The Wire stood out, refusing to lap up the hateful rhetoric and trying to tell the full story. It’s about time more Indian journalists realise that becoming the BJP’s propaganda arm and spewing hate for those across the border will only take them so far — without credibility and the courage to speak to the truth, a journalist is but a pen-pusher.</p><small>2025-05-10 03:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/681e98f417cff.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909898/tensions-hit-cricket-leagues-on-both-sides-of-the-border' target='_blank'><strong>Tensions hit cricket leagues on both sides of the border</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Hours after deciding to shift the HBL Pakistan Super (PSL) to the United Arab Emirates, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) postponed the remaining tournament, in the wake of rising military tensions with neighbouring India.
The move came on the same day that the Indian cricket board announced the postponement of its own Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament for at least one week.
“The last 24 hours have seen a worsening of the situation on the LoC, increased incursion of 78 drones, and the firing of surface to surface missiles from India,” the PCB said in a press release issued on Friday, adding that the decision was taken “pursuant to advice received” from PM Shehbaz Sharif.
“The PCB and its players stand resolutely in solidarity with the families of the martyrs and our security personnel defending the nation,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Secretary Devajit Saikia said they had decided to suspend the rem­ainder of the ongoing IPL 2025 with immediate effect for a week.

PSL ‘postponed’ hours after decision to shift tournament to UAE

Asked if players and support staff from abroad had been given the option  to return home in case they felt uncomfortable, Saikia told  Reuters: “That’s not our domain. It’s for the individual franchises to  decide what they want to do with their foreign recruits.”
The tenth edition of the PSL involved 37 foreign players including from England, Australia, New Zealand, the West Indies and South Africa.
Most foreign players wanted to leave Pakistan after a drone fell adjacent to Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, where Thursday’s match was cancelled.
The top-notch players included former Australian opener David Warner, former West Indian skipper Jason Holder and New Zealand’s current white-ball captain Michael Bracewell.
There were eight matches remaining in the PSL, including play-offs and the final, scheduled for May 18.
The PCB also said the safety of players was paramount.
“We, at the PCB, also have sincere regard for the mental well-being of participating players and the sentiments of our foreign players, and we respect the concerns of their families who want to see them back home.”
Earlier, a statement from PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi said that the board had decided to shift the remaining matches to the UAE so that the domestic as well as foreign cricketers could be saved from “the possible reckless targeting by India”.
However, the decision to postpone the league came hours later, on Friday.
Cricket Australia was said to be closely observing the tense situation, with more than two dozen players and coaches involved in the IPL and the PSL.
“We continue to closely monitor the situation in Pakistan and India, including obtaining regular advice and updates from the Australian Government, the PCB, BCCI and local government authorities, and maintaining communication with our players and support staff currently in the region,” CA said in a statement on Friday morning.

• India abstains from vote during Executive Board meeting
• PM Shehbaz lauds economic team, slams New Delhi’s false narrative
WASHINGTON: Despite Indian attempts to derail Pakistan’s loan programme, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday approved two major financing arrangements for the country — a $1 billion disbursement under the ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and a new Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) aimed at supporting climate-related initiatives.
The approval unlocks a total of $2.1bn for Pakistan, including the $1.4bn under the RSF programme, which spans 28 months and is designed to bolster the country’s resilience to climate-induced shocks.
In March, the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan on this new climate financing arrangement, alongside the first review of the 37-month, $7bn EFF programme that was approved in September 2024 — Pakistan’s 24th IMF-supported programme to date.
 
 

According to the IMF, this assistance is intended to help Pakistan build resilience and enable sustainable growth.
During Friday’s IMF Exe­cutive Board meeting, India abstained from the vote. Ahead of the decision, Indian officials had raised objections, alleging misuse of global funds by Pakistan — claims that Islam­abad has consistently rejected as politically motivated.
India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated on Thursday that New Delhi had instructed its representative at the IMF to raise concerns over Pakistan’s eligibility for international financing. He also called on international institutions, including the World Bank and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to reassess Pakistan’s status.
Progress in restoring stability
Following the board discussion, Deputy Managing Director Nigel Clarke said in a statement that Pakistan had made important progress in restoring macroeconomic stability despite a challenging environment.
“Since the approval of the EFF, the economy continues to recover, with inflation sharply lower and external buffers notably stronger. Risks to the outlook remain elevated, however, particularly from global economic policy uncertainty, rising geopolitical tensions, and persistent domestic vulnerabilities.”
He said the steadfast implementation of the FY2025 budget and the passage of key fiscal reforms, notably the Agricultural Income Tax, underpinned the process of rebuilding policy making credibility.
“Continuing to mobilise greater revenue from undertaxed sectors and the noncompliant will make the tax system more equitable and efficient. This, combined with federal and provincial spending discipline, will strengthen sustainability, build resilience, and reduce the public sector’s crowding out of private credit.”
According to the IMF official’s statement, the timely implementation of power tariff adjustments had helped reduce the stock and flow of circular debt. “Meanwhile, cost-side reforms are showing early signs of success but need to be accelerated to safeguard the energy sector’s viability and improve Pakistan’s competitiveness.”
He also credited the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) tight monetary policy stance as being pivotal in reducing inflation to historic lows. “Monetary policy should remain appropriately tight and data-dependent to ensure inflation is anchored within the SBP’s target range. A more flexible exchange rate will facilitate the adjustment to external and domestic shocks, aiding the rebuilding of reserves.”
He also called for prompt action to address undercapitalised financial institutions and extolled vigilance over the financial sector are necessary for financial stability.
“Accelerating structural reforms will unlock Pakistan’s competitiveness, creating conditions to attract high-impact private investment. Reform priorities include reducing trade and investment barriers, advancing SOE reforms, and decisively strengthening governance and anti-corruption institutions.
On the new RSF, Mr Clarke said it would help reduce Pakistan’s vulnerability to extreme weather events, and enhance macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability.
“The reforms under the RSF aim to build resilience to natural disasters by strengthening public investment processes, supporting efficient use of scarce water resources, strengthening coordination of natural disaster response and financing, improving the information on climate-related risks, and supporting Pakistan in meeting its international commitments.”
PM lauds economic team
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the IMF approval of the $1bn tranche for Pakistan, slamming India for what he described as failed underhanded tactics to sabotage the programme, APP reported.
In a statement issued by the PM Office, Shehbaz Sharif lauded Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal and the entire economic team for their role in securing the crucial IMF support.
India’s desperate moves to sabotage the IMF programme have failed, he said, adding that international financial institutions have rejected India’s false narrative. The prime minister emphasised that the approved IMF tranche would help stabilise the country’s economy and guide it towards long-term recovery.

• Saudi minister arrives in Islamabad with message of concern, calls for de-escalation
ISLAMABAD: South Asia — home to nearly one-fifth of the world’s population — can ill-afford the irresponsible actions like the ones being carried out by India, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said on Friday.
At the weekly press briefing, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: “It is most unfortunate that India’s reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict.”
His remarks came ahead of a meeting between Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir and PM Shehbaz Sharif and other top state functionaries. The Saudi official had travelled to Pakistan on Friday after completing an official visit to India.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Riyadh’s emissary “expressed heartfelt condolences over the loss of precious civilian lives”.
 
 

He said the kingdom was deeply concerned about the current situation in South Asia, and reiterated his country’s call for de-escalation, as well as peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes between Pakistan and India, in accordance with international law and the UN Security Council’s relevant resolutions, the PMO said.
While discussing the prevailing situation in South Asia, the PM strongly condemned India’s missile and drone strikes against Pakistan that had resulted in the martyrdom of scores of innocent civilians, including women and children, as well as damage to civilian infrastructures.
He stressed that India’s unprovoked and unjustified acts of aggression had violated Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and seriously endangered regional peace and stability.
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar received Adel Al-Jubeir at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and exchanged views on the evolving regional situation.
FO briefing
Earlier, at the weekly briefing, the FO spokesperson said that in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has “once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace.”
“India’s jingoism and war hysteria should be a source of serious concern for the world,” he added.
The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan rejected any attempt to link it to the attack in Pahalgam.
He noted that a number of countries and international organisations had called on both countries to exercise restraint over the past two weeks, and it was “highly deplorable that India did not pay heed to these calls”.
“The international community should hold India accountable for its irresponsible, unlawful and belligerent conduct,” he said.
“The assertion that Pakistan escalated the situation through the Pahalgam attack of April 22 is totally absurd. To date, India has not been able to produce any credible and verifiable evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the attack.
“To the contrary, the acts of aggression committed by its armed forces had the approval and support of its entire government,” he said. “Thus, it is India that has escalated the situation by violating Pakistan’s sovereignty and killing civilians.”
He said that “the Pakistani forces did not attack Pahalgam, but the Indian forces did attack multiple locations in Pakistan,” adding that Pakistan reserves the right to take all measures in its self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.
The spokesperson noted that on April 26, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for a “neutral and transparent” investigation into the Pahalgam attack, yet “India chose the path of belligerence and aggression.”
The FO spokesperson also said Indian claims of targeting terrorists or terrorist infrastructure “are blatantly false [and] it is a matter of record that Indian strikes resulted in the martyrdom of civilians, including women and children.”
Mr Khan said “the current Indian dispensation is bent upon weaponising water; holding in abeyance of IWT is unilateral and illegal.
“Pakistan is an agrarian economy. Millions of people are dependent on the water being regulated by the treaty. The Indian decision is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and the economy.
“For Pakistan, the Indian announcement is of no legal consequence. The treaty remains enforced and fully binding on the parties,” he said.

This came after reports suggested that the accounts had been hacked and spread false information, claiming that the port had suffered significant damage due to a strike by India, resulting in substantial losses for the facility.
“Our IT team has recovered the social media accounts in 30 minutes,” a KPT official said, adding that a media team was also invited in the evening to witness smooth cargo handling operations while no infrastructure was damaged.
KPT handled 168,082 tonnes of cargo, comprising 108,856 tonnes of import and 59,226 tonnes of export.
A total of eight ships took berths while three ships sailed out. Around nine ships carrying containers, general cargo, and ammonium nitrate will arrive in the next two days.

This cut comes in addition to a 29-paisa per unit fuel cost adjustment for ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) and a Rs3.64 per unit reduction for K-Electric consumers for the month of May.
As a result, consumers of Discos will receive a total of Rs1.84 per unit cheaper electricity in May and then Rs1.55 per unit in June and July. Similarly, K-Electric consumers will enjoy about Rs5.19 per unit cheaper rates in May and then Rs1.55 per unit in June and July.
The regulator said it allowed Rs1.55 per unit negative adjustment on account of the quarterly tariff adjustment for the January-March quarter of the current fiscal year.
The notification said Nepra “has decided to allow negative quarterly adjustments of Rs52.6bn pertaining to the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25, in a period of three months, i.e. May 2025 to July 2025, at a uniform rate of negative Rs1.5538 per kWh, to be applicable to all consumer categories, except lifeline consumers and prepaid consumers”.
Under government policy, the same quarterly adjustments will also apply to K-Electric consumers, with the same applicability period. In case any bills for the applicable period of the said adjustment are issued before this notification, the adjustment will be applied in the subsequent month.
Separately, Nepra notified consumers of Discos of a 29-paisa per unit negative fuel cost adjustment in May bills on account of consumption in February.
Similarly, Nepra also notified Rs3.64 per unit negative fuel cost adjustment in May billing against electricity consumed in February. As demanded by K-Electric, Nepra passed on only a partial reduction in fuel cost adjustment, instead of Rs6.62 per unit cheaper fuel cost than charged to consumers in February.
In its notification, Nepra also directed distribution companies to address technical losses and constraints, particularly in light of increasing integration of distributed solar generation and misaligned time-of-use (ToU) tariff structures.
Discos have also been directed to undertake a comprehensive study within four months to thoroughly examine the impact of existing ToU tariff timings and proposed measures for aligning demand with evolving load patterns and a comprehensive assessment of the financial and technical impacts of distributed solar photovoltaic integration on distribution utility operations and infrastructure.

As the founding father of Hindutva, Savarkar’s ideas have long informed Modi’s actions.
And those ideas are pretty basic. “India should follow the German example to solve the Muslim problem,” Savarkar said in 1938, “…Germany has every right to resort to Nazism and Italy to fascism — and events have justified those -isms.”
 
 

Given such events reduced Europe to the bloodlands of World War II, Modi now wishes the same for South Asia: Pakistan and India have been closest to war in half a century; fighter jets tango overhead; and a new generation wakes up to the sirens their grandparents once had to.
At the brink of war, again
But we’re here now, and it mostly has to do with Delhi’s own neuroses: the rabid base, the status anxiety, and an occupation that refuses to resolve itself. Modi’s annexation drive in Kashmir was demographic change 101; the “Muslim problem”, to quote Savarkar, would be resolved, even if India had to shred its own supreme law to do it.
But no one asked Kashmir’s sons and daughters. The Pahalgam attack wasn’t a cause; it was a reply — one that came on the heels of mass murder and repression.
Even here, however, Pakistan’s response was to condemn it, call for a neutral probe, and talk up peace. India’s response was to try and choke the water supply to an entire civilian population, fire missiles at a three-year-old girl, and name its operation after the hair choices of married Hindu women.
Because Modi takes the same policy decision each time there’s a Kashmir crisis: to externalise it to Pakistan, and then scream revenge. For Uri in 2016, for Pulwama in 2019, for Pahalgam today. The evidence provided — for an accusation that could lead to nuclear war and the end of the world: none yet.
Instead, the prime minister has again rushed to the border on fumes: at the close of India’s saffron decade, Modi has fed off his manic base, and his base has fed off him — peace is political suicide. Every election demands a war, and every corpse is campaign fodder.
 
 

More the pity for his Western allies, long banking on India as the region’s net security provider. But while the ’20s may vary from century to century, a Nazi is still a Nazi.
And no Nazi ever stopped his ingress without a punch to the face: courtesy the excellent Pakistan Air Force doing its job, and only its job (other services take a hint), five planes were shot out of the sky in the middle of their bombing run. CNN, Reuters, and French intelligence would also confirm the first-ever demise of a prize Rafale, India’s shiny new toy.
Memes against drones
Hence, also, the second problem: in the same way that Modi’s revenge in 2019 climaxed with wing commander Abhinandan getting checked for microchips on his return from Wagah, the 2025 remix saw Pakistani pilots use Chinese tech to down million-dollar death machines. As Western defence contractors looked on aghast, the global war economy changed overnight.
Of course, much of this is the world the West has made for us: amid the rivers of blood in Gaza, amid the collapse of the post-1945 world order, amid free reign to genocidairres in Tel Aviv and to brutes in Moscow. Asked about the Pak-India conflict, vice president JD Vance shrugged, “None of our business”.
So be it: Pakistan would have to stand up to bullies on its own. Now it has — Modi’s war kicked off with the IAF losing five warplanes, all to self-defence. Before Pakistan could even mention retaliating, Operation Sindoor had become Operation Duckshoot.
None of this was meant to happen: the lotus boys have been trying for escalation for some time now — a goofy theory they’ve borrowed from fellow dimestore Nazis in Israel. Borders, balance, proportion, none of it means anything. All international law is to be discarded, while targets are to be inflicted with shock-and-awe violence.
 


Just that it hasn’t worked there, and it especially isn’t working here. As one US defence czar put it, “Anyone who thinks they can control escalation through the use of nuclear weapons is literally playing with fire.”
But the lesson of Modi’s entire public life has been that playing with fire benefits his politics — from the inferno of Gujarat in 2002 to Muslim massacres in Delhi in 2020. Where this throughline stops is Pakistan: at the Muslims that got away, and learned to shoot back.
Repelled at the outset, Delhi has tried sating its far-right hordes in other ways. It switched to suicide drones swarming Pakistan’s cities. It tried to change the subject online, by unleashing its IT zombies. (The usual Hindutva triple feature followed: fake news, rape threats, and pornography.)
Yet headlines across the world carried on: this jet, that jet, Dassault stocks versus Chengdu’s. Even The Economist, an otherwise reliable Pakistan-basher, pointed to the conflict’s core cause: “India needs to end its self-defeating repression of the part of Kashmir it controls.”
 
 

India’s legacy media didn’t fare much better. After destroying Karachi port — if entirely on the Internet — war hawk Barkha Dutt took cover in a blacked out hotel, where she told us the “moonless night did not even allow for a sliver of light” — nor, perhaps, a sliver of integrity. By the time morning broke, the only thing India had managed to end was Fawad Khan’s Instagram.
If there was a story in all this, it was, as always, Pakistanis themselves. Facing neo-fascists next door and indifference abroad, they responded with memes and jokes. When force was called for, they mostly urged it in defensive terms. They called out their own state for its censorship, for its unrepresentativeness, for its tone-deaf ministers, yet rallied behind the white and green. They mourned seven-year-old Irtiza Abbas Turi, while refusing to mirror Hindutva’s poisonous demonisation of children. And they refused to part with their humanity, wishing for peace from start to end.
They still do.</p><small>2025-05-09 23:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09120137e70089c.jpg?r=120156' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691/imf-approves-disbursement-of-1bn-to-pakistan-under-7bn-deal' target='_blank'><strong>IMF approves disbursement of $1bn to Pakistan under $7bn deal</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday approved the immediate disbursement of about $1 billion to Pakistan under the ongoing Extended Fund Faci­li­ty (EFF) and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
In a statement issued today, the IMF said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform program supported by the EFF Arrangement.
“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52 billion). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1 billion),” it said.
It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.
“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP. Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”
Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the approval and “the failure of India’s high-handed tactics” against Pakistan.
“The country’s economic situation has improved and the country is moving towards development. India is plotting a conspiracy to divert attention from our country’s development through unilateral aggression.
 
 

“International institutions have responsibly rejected India’s false propaganda. Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” it quoted the prime minister as saying.
The premier said the programme would help stabilise the economy and put it on the path towards long-term recovery, adding that the government was working on priority areas such as tax reform, improved energy sector performance and private sector development.
“The improved economic indicators in the last 14 months are a reflection of the government’s positive policies.
“Pakistan’s economic stability strategy, effective performance and sustainable planning are committed to this,” the statement said.
The approval of the IMF’s executive board has led to an immediate disbursement of $1bn, bringing total disbursements under the loan programme to about $2bn. On successful completion of seven half-yearly reviews, Pakistan is entitled to seven equal instalments of about $1bn (SDR 760 million) under the loan programme.
Pakis­tan and the IMF had reached a three-year, $7bn aid package deal in July, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
The two sides had reached a staff-level agreement on March 25 on the first biannual review of the 39-month $7bn loan programme, agreeing on a series of reforms including the introduction of a carbon levy, timely revisions to electricity tariffs, increased water pricing and liberalisation of the automobile sector.
The staff-level agreem­ent also entailed a new 28-month RSF arrangement, providing total acc­ess to around $1.3bn (1bn special drawing rights, or SDRs).
This takes the combined size of the IMF support to about $8.3bn. The additional RSF fina­n­cing, unlike the bailout package’s biannual review and disbursement schedule, is subject to disbursement on completion of specific projects and policy actions to build climate resilience.
The board approval would be soon followed by another IMF mission visiting Pakistan to finalise the 2025-26 budget to be presented in the National Assembly in the first week of June.
The implementation of major reforms — including the carbon levy, water pricing and automobile protectionism — would begin gradually from July 1.
The overall ongoing fiscal consolidation will continue in the coming budget through a reduction in energy subsidies and tight development spending.</p><small>2025-05-09 20:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09162358958e49b.jpg?r=172304' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746/unfortunate-that-indias-reckless-conduct-brought-two-nuclear-armed-states-closer-to-major-conflict-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Unfortunate that India’s reckless conduct brought two nuclear-armed states closer to major conflict: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Friday said it was unfortunate that “India’s reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict” as military tensions between Pakistan and India escalate.
The statement comes amid the ongoing escalation between Pakistan and India, which started after New Delhi launched attacks in several Pakistani cities. Islamabad promptly responded to the attacks.
The escalation began following the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, killing 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
While addressing his weekly press briefing in Islamabad today, FO Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: “Indian actions are a flagrant violation of the UN charter, international law, and established norms governing interstate relations.
 






“It is most unfortunate that India’s reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict,” he said.
“India’s jingoism and war hysteria should be a source of serious concern for the world,” he added.
The spokesperson noted that South Asia is home to one-fifth of the world’s population, who can “ill-afford the irresponsible actions like the ones being carried out by India.”
He said that in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has “once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace.”
The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan rejected any attempt to link it to the attack in Pahalgam.
He noted that a number of countries and international organisations had called on both countries to exercise restraint over the past two weeks, and it was “highly deplorable that India did not pay heed to these calls”.
“The international community should hold India accountable for its irresponsible, unlawful and belligerent conduct,” he said.
He rebutted referenced remarks made yesterday by India’s Foreign Secretary Shri Vikram Misri during a press briefing.
“The assertion that Pakistan escalated the situation through the Pahalgam attack of April 22 is totally absurd. To date, India has not been able to produce any credible and verifiable evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the attack.
“To the contrary, the acts of aggression committed by its armed forces had the approval and support of its entire government,” he said. “Thus, it is India that has escalated the situation by violating Pakistan’s sovereignty and killing civilians.”
He continued that “the Pakistani forces did not attack Pahalgam, but the Indian forces did attack multiple locations in Pakistan,” adding that Pakistan reserves the right to take all measures in its self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.
Earlier in the day, state-run PTV said that Pakistan has taken down a total of 77 Indian drones so far.
The spokesperson noted that on April 26, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for a “neutral and transparent” investigation into the Pahalgam attack, yet “India chose the path of belligerence and aggression.”
“We are amazed to see the importance that the Indian government attaches to the anonymous and dubious social media posts, upon which it has built the case for The Resistance Front’s involvement in the Pahalgam Attack. Can any country in the world be allowed to attack another country on the basis of a few social media posts? India is attempting to act as a judge, jury and executioner.”
He added that “while India portrays itself as a victim of terror, it conveniently ignores its own role in planning, sponsoring and abetting terrorism in Pakistan.”
The FO spokesperson said Indian claims of targeting terrorists or terrorist infrastructure “are blatantly false [and] it is a matter of record that Indian strikes resulted in the martyrdom of civilians, including women and children.”
 
 

He noted that Pakistan was “well within its rights” to demand that India be held accountable for its “crimes”, referring to Indian strikes on mosques in Pakistan. As many as three civilians were kil­led when four Indian missiles struck Jamia Masjid Ummul Qura and an ad­­joining house in Muridke, some 40 kilometres from Lahore.
Khan said that “the current Indian dispensation is bent upon weaponising water; holding in abeyance of IWT is unilateral and illegal.
“Pakistan is an agrarian economy. Millions of people are dependent on the water being regulated by the treaty. The Indian decision is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and the economy.
“For Pakistan, the Indian announcement is of no legal consequence. The treaty remains enforced and fully binding on the parties,” he said.
He further said that the Indian allegation of Pakistan’s refusal to enter into government-to-government negotiations is incorrect. “Pakistan has been continuously engaged with India on the subject.”
“We particularly regret the Indian foreign secretary’s indecent and undiplomatic remarks that Pakistan has been in the habit of lying since its creation in 1947. We expected better from a diplomat of his status,” he said.
“It is most unfortunate that nowadays, India’s ruling dispensation is trying to rewrite history, making a number of absurd claims. India’s founding fathers must be turning in their graves.
“In fact, India remains a permanent factor of instability in the region owing to its hegemonic ambitions. It has constantly been working to destabilise its smaller neighbours and has stonewalled all efforts to promote regional cooperation.”</p><small>2025-05-09 19:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/091957189625492.jpg?r=195813' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909763/govts-priority-in-upcoming-budget-is-to-provide-relief-to-common-man-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Govt’s priority in upcoming budget is to provide relief to common man: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that the government’s priority in the upcoming budget was to provide relief to the common man, stating that all-out resources will be utilised to reduce the financial difficulties of the poor and the middle class.
Chairing a meeting on the preparation of the federal budget 2025-26, the premier directed that the upcoming budget should be prepared with a focus on sustainable export-driven growth and considering the projects to promote industries and increase production
“The budget should also focus extensively on the creation of jobs, agriculture, information technology, small and medium enterprises, and the housing sector,” he added.
The prime minister said that the government and private sector must work together for development and prosperity.
Calling the public-private partnerships and youth vocational training among the government’s priorities, the premier noted that positive results were emerging from the power sector reforms, as the reduction in electricity prices for industries would help promote industry and production.
He said that automation and digitisation were being promoted to bring transparency to the government system and facilitate the business community and investors, adding that the government would continue the process of rightsizing to reduce the size of the federal government in the next fiscal year.
During the briefing, it was revealed that consultations with the private sector on budget preparation had been in process for the past three months, besides consultative sessions with stakeholders from various sectors.
The meeting was informed that the five-year trade policy framework for 2025-30 and the e-commerce 2.0 framework would be completed soon, and a plan for tariff rationalisation was also being prepared.
The delegation of businessmen and experts expressed confidence in the government’s economic policies and presented their suggestions, which the prime minister welcomed, directing the inclusion of feasible proposals in the budget.
The meeting was attended by federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muhammad Aurangzeb, Jam Kamal Khan, Shaza Fatima, Sardar Awais Ahmad Leghari, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, Special Assistant to PM Haroon Akhtar, and relevant senior government officials.</p><small>2025-05-09 15:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09185948d2228db.jpg?r=190456' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909757/thousands-rally-in-bangladesh-seeking-ban-on-former-pms-party' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands rally in Bangladesh seeking ban on former PM’s party</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of people rallied on Friday outside the residence of Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus, demanding that he ban the political party of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Yunus, 84, has led an interim government since Hasina was overthrown by student-led mass protests in August 2024 and fled into exile as crowds stormed her palace.
Friday’s rally came after the sudden departure of Abdul Hamid, a former leader of Hasina’s Awami League party, from Bangladesh early on Thursday.
A crowd, mainly made up of young people, had started gathering outside Yunus’ residence on Thursday night.
Hasnat Abdullah, the chief organiser of the newly formed National Citizen’s Party, said the demonstration would continue until their demands were met.
“Sheikh Hasina robbed the people of Bangladesh of their democratic rights.
She manipulated the system to prevent any real opposition from participating in the election,” Kamrul said.
“We saw Abdul Hamid leave the country safely. The actions of certain advisers are highly suspicious. The delay in justice appears to be part of a broader plan to bring back the fallen dictator and her party,” he added.
Hasina remains in self-imposed exile in India and has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.
According to the United Nations, up to 1,400 protesters died in July when Hasina’s government launched a brutal crackdown on the opposition, for which she and Hamid are being investigated.
At least three police officers responsible for overseeing airport arrivals and departures have been dismissed for negligence, according to officials, after Hamid’s departure.
While citizens are generally barred from assembling outside the chief adviser’s residence, the student demonstrators were allowed through. The government said on Friday it was seriously considering the demand raised by various quarters to ban the Awami League.
“The government has begun communicating with different political parties to reach a final decision on the matter. It has reviewed UN-documented evidence of atrocities committed by the Awami League and its affiliates,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-05-09 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09180548cd67464.jpg?r=180606' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909752/karachi-to-host-35th-national-games-in-december-murad-shah' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to host 35th National Games in December: Murad Shah</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah announced on Friday that Karachi would host the 35th National Games from December 6 to 13 after it was  postponed from its initial dates in May.
The games were set to be held from May 1-9 in Karachi but were postponed in April due to “unavoidable circumstances,” according to an official letter issued by the Sindh Olympic Association.
Murad held a meeting today at CM House with a high-level delegation of the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) to finalise preparations for the games.
He welcomed the opportunity to host National Games, pledging full cooperation to ensure the games are organised in accordance with international standards.
He directed all relevant departments to provide essential facilities to athletes, including training, medical care, transportation, and modern infrastructure.
CM Murad announced the construction of a new swimming pool and  acquisition of modern electronic timing and scoring systems. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was also signed between the POA, the Government of Sindh, and the Sindh Olympic Association to establish a coordinated framework for organising the games.
“This initiative will be a milestone for athlete welfare and institutional coordination,” the CM said. He emphasised the importance of nurturing young talent and promoting broader interest in sports across the province.
POA President Arif Saeed briefed the chief minister on the history of the National Games and lauded the government’s commitment to their development. He noted that the upcoming event has already sparked fresh enthusiasm among athletes nationwide.
Both the Government and the POA reaffirmed their dedication to enhancing athlete performance and making the 35th National Games a landmark event in Pakistan’s sporting history.
The POA delegation was led by its President, Arif Saeed, and included Senior Vice President Ms. Fatima Lakhani, Secretary General Khalid Mehmood, and Sindh Secretary Ahmed Ali Rajput. Also present were Principal Secretary to CM Agha Wasif and Sports Secretary Aleem Lashari. Secretary Abdul Aleem Lashari gave a detailed briefing on the ongoing preparations, logistics, and planning for the upcoming games.</p><small>2025-05-09 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0916190450c5004.jpg?r=161926' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909732/workers-remittances-clock-in-32bn-for-april' target='_blank'><strong>Workers remittances clock in $3.2bn for April</strong></a><br><p>Remittances from overseas Pakistani workers clocked in at $3.2 billion for the month of April, up 13 per cent year-on-year, according to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data released on Friday.
Topline Securities, a brokerage firm in Karachi, noted, “Worker remittances clocked in at US$3.2bn, up 13pc YoY in Apr-2025.
“This takes 10MFY25 remittances to US$31bn, up 31pc YoY,” it added.
 


According to the firm, inflows during April were mainly sourced from Saudi Arabia ($725m), UAE ($658m), UK ($535m), and US ($302m).
Earlier, the government had set a target of $35bn in remittances for the current fiscal year (FY25), but financial experts believe the inflow would exceed the estimate. “The inflows could reach up to $36bn in FY25,” said a currency dealer in the banking market.
A study published by the Asian Development Bank found that Pakistani migrants tend to remit more when economic conditions are improving back home and when there is a positive association between remittances and domestic economic activity.

Dressed in relatively simple white and gold vestments, Leo, who was born in Chicago but spent two decades as a missionary in Peru, said a few words in English before continuing his homily in fluent Italian. He painted the spiritual picture of the Church he would like to see under his papacy.
“God has …. entrusted this treasure to me so that, with his help, I may be its faithful administrator for the sake of the entire mystical Body of the Church,” he said.
“He has done so in order that she may be ever more fully a city set on a hill, an ark of salvation sailing through the waters of history and a beacon that illumines the dark nights of this world,” he added, according to the official translation.
The 1.4 billion-member Church, was great not because of “the magnificence of her structures or the grandeur of her buildings … but rather through the holiness of her members.”
Swift Appointment
Leo, aged 69, was elected at the end of a swift two-day conclave that was wrapped up on Thursday evening when white smoke billowed from the chimney of the chapel.
Before his election, US cardinals had largely been written off as papal contenders because of a widespread assumption that the global Church could not be run by a superpower pope.
However, he also holds Peruvian citizenship, meaning that he has deep knowledge of both the West and less developed nations.
After the Mass, Leo will have lunch with the cardinals who elected him and they will then be free to leave the Vatican and return to their homes around the world.
The successor to Pope Francis, who died last month at the age of 88, inherits a number of major challenges, ranging from a budget shortfall to divisions over whether the Church should be more welcoming towards the LGBT community and divorcees, and should let women play a greater role in its affairs.
US President Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Leo. However, the new pope has a history of criticizing Trump and Vice President JD Vance’s policies, according to posts on the X account of Robert Prevost.
The new pope worked for decades in the north of Peru, first as a missionary and later as Bishop of Chiclayo from 2015 to 2023. Catholics took to the streets of the small city in northwestern Peru, and church bells rang out to celebrate the election of a man who they embraced as one of their own.
One of the clues to what kind of a Church leader Leo would be was in his choice of name, something that pontiffs often use to send a signal about the priorities of their new papacy.
The last pope with this name was Leo XIII, who led the Church from 1878-1903. He was known for his devoted focus on social justice issues and is often credited with laying the foundation for modern Catholic social teaching.
Prevost became a cardinal only in 2023. He has given a few media interviews and is known to have a shy personality.
Francis brought him to Rome two years ago to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops across the globe, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world’s bishops.</p><small>2025-05-09 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0911072972b8454.jpg?r=110740' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909677/psx-gallops-to-recovery-after-day-of-historic-losses' target='_blank'><strong>PSX gallops to recovery after day of historic losses</strong></a><br><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recovered nearly 4,000 points on Friday after the index suffered its largest-ever plunge a day earlier, causing losses to the tune of Rs820 billion loss to equity investors following Indian drone attacks in major cities across the country.
The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 799.65, or 0.77 per cent, to stand at 104,326.46 from the previous close of 103,526.81 at 11:06am.
At 4:31pm, the index recovered 3647.82, or 3.52pc, to stand at 107,174.63 from the last close.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, said that after falling sharply by 6pc yesterday, the stocks had recovered.
“So far, there has been no news of any major escalation which helped restore confidence,” he said.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted, “Stocks on the PSX remained volatile today, opening higher as participants increasingly factored in that an all-out war with India is unlikely.
“Some investors have begun accumulating stocks trading at highly attractive valuations following the sharp drawdown over the past week,” he added.
“Technical analysts also noted this morning that the market had entered oversold territory,” Farooq said.
On yesterday’s decline, he stated it was primarily “driven by individuals unwinding leveraged positions and redemptions from mutual funds”.
“Such corrections and short-term volatility are a normal feature of equity markets,” he said, adding that they continued to “advise that only long-term investors participate in the market, maintaining discipline during periods of uncertainty and gradually building their portfolios over time”.
“Market attention now remains on developments in Pakistan-India tensions and the IMF board meeting scheduled for today, where Pakistan’s next tranche will be considered,” he said.
Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, noted that the primary reason behind the recovery was investor optimism regarding the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting today.
“Most likely, the Executive Board will approve the tranche today,” she said.
The Fund is set to meet today to approve the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing Extended Fund Faci­li­ty and allow an additional arrangement for the $1.3bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
Furthermore, she highlighted that the market now provided “attractive valuations” due to yesterday’s market dip.
“Lastly, fears of a major escalation have been placated due to no major development on that front,” she added.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said that the “panic triggered by yesterday’s drone attacks from the Indian side is subsiding, as the Pakistan Armed Forces demonstrated ability to intercept the threats has reassured investors”.
“The recent market correction following the onset of the escalation has presented investors with a valuable opportunity to build their portfolios at more attractive valuations,” he added.
The market capital had lost Rs1.3 trillion in value in the previous three sessions as jittery investors preferred to exit the market amid growing uncertainty about the economic outlook as geopolitical tensions turned into a military standoff after India hit three cities with missiles in the wee hours of Wednesday, martyring over 31 innocent civilians. Pakistan’s armed forces responded with the downing of five Indian fighter planes.
The market crash followed alarming geopolitical developments after ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry announced that Pakistani forces had neutralised 25 drones sent by India since last night. He also confirmed that four army personnel were injured after one drone managed to partially strike a military target, despite the majority being intercepted.

An IPL match on Thursday was abandoned midway after fighting began in India’s border regions, but the cricket board attributed the disruption to a power failure at the stadium in the hill city of Dharamsala.
“Further updates regarding the new schedule and venues of the tournament will be announced in due course after a comprehensive assessment of the situation in consultation with relevant authorities and stakeholders,” said the statement from BCCI Honorary Secretary Devajit Saikia, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
“The decision was taken by the IPL Governing Council after due consultation with all key stakeholders following the representations from most of the franchisees, who conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans; while the BCCI reposes full faith in the strength and preparedness of our armed forces, the Board considered it prudent to act in the collective interest of all stakeholders.
“At this critical juncture, the BCCI stands firmly with the nation. We express our solidarity with the Government of India, the Armed Forces and the people of our country,” the statement said.
“While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country. The BCCI remains firmly committed to support all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions in the best interest of the nation,” the statement added.
Earlier today, the Press Trust  of India reported that “a cloud of uncertainty had loomed over the future of the ongoing edition since the cancellation of Thursday’s match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala midway following air raid alerts in neighbouring cities of Jammu and Pathankot.”
“It does not look nice that cricket goes on while the country is at war,” a BCCI official told PTI, confirming the suspension of the league, which was to wind up on May 25 in Kolkata.
 






The world’s richest cricket tournament began its current season on March 22, and the final fixture was scheduled to be played on May 25, with matches being spread over 13 venues across the country.
According to ESPN Cricinfo, IPL 2025 was 58 games old, including the abandonment in Dharamsala. There were 12 games left to play in the group stage, scheduled for Lucknow (2), Hyderabad, Ahmedabad (3), Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru (2), Mumbai, Jaipur, followed by the playoffs, to be played in Hyderabad and Kolkata.
Pakistan and India have been locked in conflict since Wednesday, when India targeted multiple locations in Pakistan, claiming they were “terrorist infrastructure” in response to a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir last month.
New Delhi named two Pakistani nationals as suspects and accused Islamabad of being involved in the attack, a charge Pakistan denied. Subsequently, Islamabad sought an independent probe.</p><small>2025-05-09 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09140807a811eff.jpg?r=140948' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909714/global-militaries-to-study-india-pakistan-fighter-jet-battle' target='_blank'><strong>Global militaries to study India-Pakistan fighter jet battle</strong></a><br><p>A dogfight between Chinese-made Pakistani jets and French-made Indian Rafale fighters will be closely scrutinised by militaries seeking insights that could offer an edge in future conflicts.
A Chinese-made Pakistani fighter plane shot down at least two Indian military aircraft on Wednesday, two US officials told Reuters, marking a potential major milestone for Beijing’s advanced fighter jet.
The aerial clash is a rare opportunity for militaries to study the performance of pilots, fighter jets and air-to-air missiles in active combat, and use that knowledge to prepare their own air forces for battle.
Experts said the live use of advanced weapons would be analysed across the world, including in China and the United States which are both preparing for a potential conflict over Taiwan or in the wider Indo-Pacific region.
 
 

One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters there was high confidence that Pakistan had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets.
Social media posts focused on the performance of China’s PL-15 air-to-air missile against the Meteor, a radar-guided air-to-air missile produced by European group MBDA. There has been no official confirmation these weapons were used.
“Air warfare communities in China, the US, and a number of European countries will be extremely interested to try and get as much ground truth as they can on tactics, techniques, procedures, what kit was used, what worked and what didn’t,” said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
“You have arguably China’s most capable weapon against the West’s most capable weapon, if indeed it was being carried; we don’t know that,” Barrie said. The French and Americans would likely be hoping for similar intelligence from India, Barrie said.
“The PL-15 is a big problem. It is something that the US military pays a lot of attention to,” a defense industry executive said.
Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation declined comment and the MBDA consortium could not immediately be reached for comment on a French public holiday.
Scant details
Western analysts and industry sources said crucial details remained unclear including whether the Meteor was carried and the type and amount of training the pilots had received. Arms firms would also be anxious to separate technical performance from operational factors, analysts said.
“There will be audits of what works and what doesn’t work, but I think the other overlay is the proverbial fog of war,” said Byron Callan, a Washington-based defense expert and managing partner of Capital Alpha Partners.
US arms companies are getting constant feedback about how their products are working in the war in Ukraine, he said.
“So I absolutely expect the same to be the case with India’s European suppliers, and Pakistan and China are probably sharing the same feedback. If the PL-15 is working as advertised or better than expected, the Chinese would like to hear that.”
A defense industry source from a Western country operating the Meteor said an online picture of a seeker appeared to feature the component of a missile that had missed its target.
There are conflicting reports on whether Pakistan has the domestic version of the PL-15 from the PLAAF, China’s air force, or the lower-range export version publicly unveiled in 2021.
Barrie, who has written extensively on the missile, said he believed that Pakistan most likely has the export version.
A Western industry source dismissed claims that the rocket-powered PL-15 had longer range than the air-breathing Meteor but acknowledged that its capability “may be greater than was thought.” The Meteor’s range has not been officially published. “At the moment it’s not possible to judge anything. We know so little,” the industry source said.
The PL-15’s range and performance have been a focus of Western interest for years. Its emergence was seen as one of many signals that China had moved well beyond reliance on Soviet-era derivative technology.
The United States is developing the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile via Lockheed Martin partly in response to the PL-15 and its beyond-visual-range performance — part of a broader reset of Western priorities toward China.
European nations are exploring a mid-life upgrade for Meteor, which specialist publication Janes says could involve propulsion and guidance, but analysts say progress has been slow.
US President Donald Trump in March awarded Boeing the contract to build the US Air Force’s most sophisticated fighter jet yet, which would likely include stealth, advanced sensors and cutting-edge engines.</p><small>2025-05-09 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/090954328cd0e05.jpg?r=095623' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909577/state-dept-supports-pakistans-call-for-neutral-probe-into-pahalgam' target='_blank'><strong>State Dept ‘supports’ Pakistan’s call for neutral probe into Pahalgam</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: The US has called upon both Pakistan and India to hold “direct talks” to bring down tensions and said it will support any effort, including a neutral probe, to ensure the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack are brought to justice.
In a press briefing on Thursday, Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, said the US was aware of Pakistan’s offer for a neutral investigation into the attack.
“Pakistan wants an independent investigation … and [the US] want the perpetrators to be held accountable, and we are supportive of any efforts to that end,” she added.
When asked if the two neighbours have offered any commitments,
Ms Bruce said Secretary Rubio had been clear on two things: “that this should not escalate” and “communication was fundamentally key”.
When the spokesperson was asked if the US shared India’s view that Pakistan was supporting terrorist groups, she refrained from affirming the accusation.
She said the Pahalgam attack was “awful”, but the “back and forth and continuation” of attacks should stop.
Ms Bruce added that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan over the past few weeks were “not surprising but very, very disappointing”.
She said both sides should remain engaged in conversation and the US would remain involved in this process.
Mr Rubio also spoke with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. They discussed regional security matters, economic engagement, and efforts to de-escalate tensions between India and Pakistan, Ms Bruce added.
She acknowledged the situation was “very delicate and dangerous” and said any discussion about ongoing negotiations shouldn’t be made public.
“That’s certainly our policy. We think it’s important to not put details in the midst of the worldwide media when the work is being done in private between leaders.”
When asked whether India provided the US with any intelligence to back up its claims against Pakistan, Ms Bruce refused to give details.
“We, though, will not engage in the nature of discussing what the conversations have been or what we have conveyed,” she added.
She urged both India and Pakistan to “work towards a responsible solution”.
US consulate advisory
The US Consulate General in Lahore has directed its staff to shelter in place after Indian drones were shot down in the city. The consulate said it has also received initial reports that authorities may be eva­cuating some areas adjacent to Lah­ore’s main airport, a statement said.
Published in Dawn, May 9th, 2025</p><small>2025-05-09 04:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09094152acdeed8.jpg?r=094224' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909562/apex-court-debates-seniority-criteria-in-judges-dispute-case' target='_blank'><strong>Apex court debates seniority criteria in judges’ dispute case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The proper mechanism for determining the seniority of judges remained under discussion before the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court on Thursday, as it heard an inter-se seniority dispute between judges of the Islamabad High Court.
Heading the five-judge CB, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar questioned whether the authority to determine the seniority of superior court judges should lie with the President or the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP).
He also recalled how, under civil service procedures, when officers were transferred from the surplus pool to a different department, their seniority started from the bottom in the new department. He wondered whether there was any rule or convention for finalising the seniority of judges or whether it should be compared with civil service rules.
The bench was hearing a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.

Justice Mazhar questions who should determine seniority — president or CJP?

Senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, representing the petitioners, argued that the consultation process for transfer of the three judges to the IHC was neither purposive, meaningful, nor consensus-oriented on all relevant aspects. Consequently, he said, the transfers should be struck down.
During the hearing, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan recalled earlier transfers to the IHC, noting that one such transferred judge was even appointed as chief justice of the IHC. He also asked the counsel whether the judges in those instances had taken a fresh oath upon transfer.
The counsel replied that these transfers occurred after the IHC was re-established under the 18th Amendment, following its abolition by the 2009 SC judgement and subsequent re-establishment through the Islamabad High Court Act, 2010.
The counsel contended that, during the consultation process, the consultees — namely the CJP and the chief justices of the high courts concerned — were not presented with any information or data explaining why Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar was selected or shortlisted for transfer to the IHC out of a pool of 33 Lahore High Court judges, particularly when he was ranked 16th in seniority.
“You are suggesting as if there was no evidence that any option was afforded to other judges of the LHC to opt for transfer to the IHC,” remarked Justice Salahuddin Panhwar.
The counsel said Justice Dogar’s appo­intment was not random but premeditated, intended to place him ahead of the senior puisne judge of the IHC in seniority.
“You seem more aggrieved by the transfer of Justice Sarfraz Dogar,” Justice Panhwar observed.
When Justice Mazhar noted that one of the summaries had mentioned that the transferred judges would retain their seniority in the high court to which they were transferred, the counsel clarified that this communication was directed to the prime minister, not the CJP.
The counsel argued that following recent developments in the rules governing the appointment of judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), the top five judges of a high court now have a legitimate expectancy to become the chief justice. If a seventh-ranked judge is elevated over them, a writ of quo warranto may be filed in the Supreme Court to challenge the appointment.
He contended that the consultees never discussed critical issues such as emoluments or the selection procedure. He cited the example of Justice Muhammad Asif of the Balochistan High Court, who was serving as an additional judge at the time of his transfer. In his case, consent for the transfer was taken from the acting chief justice (ACJ).
When the counsel cited the Al-Jihad Trust case — in which it was held that an ACJ can only perform routine tasks for a limited period and cannot recommend a judge for elevation — Justice Mazhar noted that it made sense, as, at the time, consultations were carried out between the CJP and the President in the absence of the JCP. Now, however, the JCP exists, and every member has an equal vote.
The issue of seniority is critical, the counsel emphasised, because it is not merely about personal satisfaction. He pointed out that there is no law currently in place to fix the seniority of judges.
The hearing was adjourned to Wednesday (May 14).

ISLAMABAD: At least three people lost their lives and seven, including four soldiers, sustained injuries as Pakistan intercepted and destroyed as many as 25 Indian drones that had intruded into its airspace across the country, possibly to target military installations.
According to the military, the locations where these drones were neutralised included Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur, Umerkot and Karachi in Sindh.
Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military’s chief spokesperson, confirmed that one civilian lost their life while another sustained injuries in Miano.
Moreover, as per police, one person each was slain in Attock and Rawalpindi.
“One drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,” said the army spokesperson. “Four men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to an equipment has occurred,” he said.
The rest of the drones apparently missed their potential targets and caused damages in densely populated areas.
 
 

Three drones were shot down in Walton and Burki, near Lahore. Officials said two drones crashed in Walton, while another crashed in Burki soon after security forces intercepted them. According to a witness, they heard multiple explosions in the old Walton airport area, leading to widespread confusion among locals.
In Rawalpindi, one person — a resident of Lahore — lost his life and two were inj­ured after a drone crashed near the Pindi Cricket Stadium on the Murree Road.
A police officer said that the stadium’s food street was not fully open and there were not many people around ; otherwise, there could have been more casualties.
Another drone damaged a house after it crashed on its rooftop in the Westridge locality of the garrison city. However, no casualties were reported.
In Attock, a farmer was killed near Jabbi Kasran — a town in Fateh Jang tehsil — after an Indian drone was downed. The injured person was taken to hospital, but could not survive.
In Gujranwala, three drones were destroyed in different locations of the district. The locals found wreckage of the drones in the Tokrian village of Wahndo and Solakhanabad village on the outskirts of the city. Another drone was found in a field near Aimanabad’s Agu Bhandar village of Gujranwala.
In Gujrat, parts of an Indian drone were found in Peer Jhand village in the jurisdiction of the Dinga police station. According to eyewitnesses, some parts of the drone fell in the field while some crashed on a house, falling through its roof into a room on the ground floor. However, everyone remained safe.
In Bahawalpur, an Ind­ian drone was destroyed in the Cholistan desert. According to the announcement, the Indian drone hit the area of Chapoowala in the desert in the limits of tehsil Yazman.
In Karachi, two drones fell on the outskirts of the Malir district, partially damaging the roof of a house. The first drone fell on a house in the Sharafi Goth slum, said area police SHO Sadaruddin Mirani. It damaged the roof partially, but no one was hurt. He said the incident occu­rred at around 10:30am.
The officer said that the drone was two and a half feet long.
Soon after, another dr­­o­ne fell near the residential neighbourhood of Gulshan-i-Hadeed.
Malir SP Mansoor Gulzar Bozdar told Dawn the drone fell in a hilly area near Link Road. He said it did not cause any damage to life or property.
In Umerkot, an Indian drone also crashed near the village of Sufi Akbar, close to the Chhor cantonment. Fortunately, no casualties or injuries were reported.
‘Serious, serious provocation’
India also admitted that it targetted military installations.
A statement by India’s Press Information Bureau said army installations were targeted “at a number of locations across Pakistan”. However, the attacks mostly took place in areas heavily populated by civilians.
As he shared details about the operation that downed drones, Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that the Pakistan Army used “their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully” to shoot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones.
Referring to Pakistan’s response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said, “After the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.”
“This cowardly attack is a sign of India’s worry and panic,” it added.
“The debris of these Israeli-made Harop drones is being collected from various locations across Pakistan,” the military’s media wing said. It asserted that the Pakistan Army was “giving a befitting reply to the enemy and crushing all its nefarious designs”.
During the press briefing, the military’s media spokesman also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones. He added that the debris and downed drones were being collected from multiple locations.
“As we speak, the process of India sending across these Harop drones, this naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,” Lt-Gen Chaudhry continued.
“This is a serious, serious provocation,” the ISPR chief added.
According to BBC News, Lt-Gen Chaudhry said the Indian government needs to transition from “cinema” into the “real world we live in” and called the strikes a “phantom defence”.

Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Sialkot airports were the most affected, as air traffic was halted for several hours amid rising tensions between Pakistan and India. How­ever, flight operations at the four airports later resumed on Thursday after temporary suspensions.
The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) initially said that flight operations at Karachi’s Jinnah Inter­nat­ional Airport would remain suspen­ded until midnight, but they resu­med earlier than scheduled. Flight operations at Islamabad, Lah­ore and Sialkot airports resumed by evening.
Earlier in the day, the PAA had temporarily suspended operations at Karachi, Lahore and Sialkot airports until Thursday noon, citing operational reasons. Islamabad International Airport also briefly suspended flights during the day.
Later, the PAA extended the closure at Lahore, Islamabad and Sialkot until 6pm before confirming their reopening.
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) confirmed that the country’s ongoing security situation severely disrupted air operations nationwide.
“In the interest of air safety, some routes have been restricted as a precaution, affecting several flights,” a PIA spokesperson said. “The temporary closure of air routes has been undertaken to protect the assets of domestic carriers and ensure passenger safety.”
The airline urged passengers to remain patient and cooperate with airline staff, adding that its call centre was actively contacting affected travellers.
For passengers of diverted flights, PIA said it had made arrangements for meals and accommodation. Passengers were advised to check flight status via the PIA website or helpline before heading to the airport.
Passengers stranded
Passengers said that they faced immense difficulties due to last-minute cancellations. “I was scheduled to fly to Washington via Doha in the early hours of Thursday from Lahore airport, but the airline rescheduled the flight for later that morning.
Ghazala Bibi, another traveller, said her flight to Dubai from Sialkot was cancelled at the last minute due to the airport’s suddenclosure.
Passengers arriving from abroad also faced immense difficulties due to diversions. Domestic air travellers encountered similar issues, with flight operations disrupted for a third consecutive day due to intermittent airport closures.
“Domestic flights have been badly affected over the past three days,” an official said.
The Haj flight operation, which began recently, has also been almost suspended amid the escalating situation between the two countries.
While a tour operator told Dawn that most international airlines had suspended flights to and from Pakistan until May 10, the PAA said it was continuously issuing revised notices to airmen or Notams to update the status of airport operations and the opening of airspace.

• 200 ongoing uplift projects likely to be closed
• Ahsan says proper allocations cannot be made for key schemes                        
ISLAMABAD: The federal government will present the next fiscal year’s budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.
This was announced at a press conference by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who disclosed that an indicative budget ceiling (IBC) of Rs921bn for the next year provided by the Ministry of Finance was over three times lower than Rs2.9 trillion demanded by the Planning Commission based on requirements of various ministries for development projects.
The figure is also around 16pc lower than the current year’s revised allocation of Rs1.1tr, slashed on the instructions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from Rs1.4tr approved by the parliament as part of the federal budget 2024-25.
The minister said he would contest the IBC provided by the finance ministry and request the prime minister for higher allocations of at least Rs1.6tr to provide the rupee cover for foreign-funded projects.
The minister also launched the Planning Ministry’s Monthly Development Update for May 2025 during the press conference, a new initiative on the pattern of finance ministry’s monthly economic outlook.
Responding to a question, Mr Iqbal said authorisation for the disbursement had been issued for about Rs900bn out of Rs1.1tr PSDP for the current year.
He hoped the authorisation would increase during May and June. However, he hastened to add that the finance division had its own constraints, as resources were needed to increase the development budget, which required an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio.
He said the Annual Plan Coordination Com­mittee would meet on May 23 to finalise the next year’s development programme in consultations with provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Meanwhile, the National Economic Council (NEC) is expected to meet on May 26 or 27 to approve the development programme and macroeconomic targets for the next fiscal year. The federal budget would be presented on June 2, he said.
For the next fiscal year’s development budget, the minister bemoaned that Rs2.9tr was requested from the Ministry of Finance, which provided an IBC of only Rs 921bn, about Rs178bn lower than the current year.
“This is a cause of concern for us,” he said. “This will affect even the inflow of foreign exchange. We will need Rs700bn to provide rupee cover to foreign-funded projects during the next development budget. If we do not have enough rupee cover, we cannot utilise all the allocated foreign exchange component.”
Mr Iqbal said that with such a meagre IBC, proper allocations could not be made to the important projects, which would result in delays and cost escalations of such schemes. He said that the number of provincial projects in the PSDP would be reduced, while about 200 slow-moving projects would be closed.
Irregularities in key projects
He said the cost of Diamer-Bhasha Dam has escalated from Rs480bn to Rs1.5tr due to delays. Likewise, the cost of the Dasu Hydropower Project has increased from Rs500bn to Rs1.7tr.
The minister said there were several lapses in the implementation of the Dasu Hydropower Project. No project director or CFO was hired for such a huge project, and it was operated by Wapda’s own people.
He said that even the contracts for the construction of roads in the project area were allotted in dollars. “There are irregularities in the Dasu project and we want that responsibility to be fixed,” he emphasised, regretting that the financial viability of these projects had diminished due to rising costs.
Similarly, the minister said that there were shocking irregularities in the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project. The plan was started in such a hurry that the contractor was mobilised prior to the consultant, which the minister said was a serious irregularity.
“Interestingly, once in a meeting I asked the CFO of Neelum-Jhelum regarding his qualification, and I was stunned to know that he had a Master’s in Geography,” he said.
Mr Iqbal said the report of the International Marine Corps regarding the failure in the Ne­­e­lum-Jhelum Hydropower Project was awaited.
In reply to a question as to why a civilian could not be appointed as Wapda chairman, the minister said: “In my opinion, a civilian should be appointed as Wapda chairman and he should be a hydrology expert of international repute. I will recommend this to the prime minister.”
He reiterated that funding priorities under the next PSDP would align with the government’s Uraan Pakistan programme, aimed at job creation and economic uplift. “Projects approved under Uraan are expected to generate 120,000 direct and indirect jobs,” he said.

In a press conference, Ishaq Dar said India “deliberately fired” projectiles, three of which were dropped in Amritsar, the capital of Indian Punjab, located around 54km from Lahore.
He added that a fourth projectile entered Pakistani airspace, which was shot down by the air defense system in Dinga, Gujrat, around 87km from the nearest point on the India-Pakistan border.
Mr Dar’s remarks were in response to claims by New Delhi that it neutralised attempts by Pakistan to hit multiple “military targets” using “drones and missiles” on the night of Wednesday and Thursday.
Mr Dar added that India’s “deliberate” attack was a “malicious strategy” to “falsely implicate Pakistan” for targeting civilians and incite Indian Sikhs.
Sitting beside Mr Dar, the armed forces spokesperson also accused India of launching a false flag operation. 
ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the projectiles, which he claimed were launched by India the previous night. 
He claimed India fired four projectiles from Adampur, a town in Jalan­dhar district of Indian Punjab. Three projectiles were “intently targeted” at Amritsar while one was taken down over Dinga, Lt-Gen Chaudhry added.
He said India’s claim that Pakistan attacked 15 locations was a “fantastic and cooked-up story”.
Every projectile leaves a digital signature, Lt-Gen Chaudhry said, asking India to share details about the origin of the projectiles it claimed were launched by Pakistan. 
The military spokesperson also lambasted the Indian media for falsely accusing Pakistan of launching attacks.
“When Pakistan strikes, we won’t need the Indian media to report it. The whole world will come to know. Its reverberations will be felt everywhere.”
