The premier said this while addressing political leaders in Quetta.
PM Shehbaz began his address by stating it was unfortunate that Balochistan had been grappling with terrorism, and added that the role of the armed forces in combating terrorism could not be appreciated enough.
“Be it the soldiers and officials of the army, Rangers personnel and officials, or those of Levies, and the common man, their sacrifices will be remembered in history,” PM Shehbaz said.
He said the fight against terrorism was ongoing and Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan — were being provided support from our “neighbouring countries, which is unfortunate”.
“But, we are firm in our resolve to eradicate terrorism,” he said, lauding CDF for leading this fight.
In this connection, he also mentioned the CDF’s role during the military conflict with India in May last year, adding that India had been “taught a lesson which it will never forget”.
Speaking about Balochistan’s share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, the premier recalled that in 2010, the then-Balochistan chief minister, Nawab Aslam Raisani, had refused to cooperate unless the province received a 100 per cent increase in its resources.
“Balochistan is a beautiful part of Pakistan, and their demand was valid to an extent,” the premier said, adding that it was “obvious that more resources would be needed considering the vast distances within the province”.
He recalled that to “fulfil their demand, Punjab took the lead”.
“It was our duty to our Baloch brothers and sisters, and the resources in the NFC award are being disbursed in the same way till this day,” he said.
“Punjab cut Rs11bn a year from its share and sent it to Balochistan,” he added.
He continued: “Today, 16 years have passed since the NFC award, and nearly Rs200bn have been given from Punjab’s own share.”
“Because when it comes to family, you sit and make decisions like brothers,” PM Shehbaz said, stressing that “distances between provinces must be bridged”.
He further said that the government was building five Danish Schools in Balochistan at the same time,“ hoping that the move will lead to a decline in terrorist elements taking root in the province.
“This is our duty: to work with provinces — especially those that are very distant and experiencing challenges — this is the journey of brotherhood and cooperation which we all have to take,” the premier reiterated.
“There are no two ways to go about it,” PM Shehbaz stressed.
He also maintained that “nobody could match the steps taken by my brother Nawaz Sharif, for the progress and prosperity of Balochistan“.
The PM expressed willingness to work with the chief minister of Balochistan, the governor.
“We have to work together where there are challenges and come to the table to find solutions, ” the prime minister said.

A TTAP delegation had departed from Islamabad to Lahore earlier today as part of the opposition’s “street movement” to hold political and social gatherings in the provincial capital.
A post shared by the TTAP on X at around 11am said that the delegation, headed by the alliance’s head Mahmood Khan Achakzai, had left for Lahore.







At 3:34pm, the TTAP claimed “dozens” of workers of the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) — a part of the alliance — were arrested in Lahore, including Senior Vice President Syed Hussain Kazmi.
The son of MWM chief Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, who serves as the TTAP vice chairman, was also taken into custody, the TTAP claimed on X.
“Right after the arrest, police officials expressed ignorance and took the stance that he was not in their custody,”  the statement added.
However, a Gujranwala police official denied the arrest. He told Dawn that Abbas’s son was “stopped for questioning when a car of a PTI rally hit a police constable”, but was then allowed to go ahead.



The PTI, in a statement condemning the “fascism and oppression by the Punjab police”, also claimed that “multiple members of delegations present peacefully along the route of the caravan” were being taken into custody.
“Peaceful citizens and party workers, who are unarmed and pose no threat of any kind, are being subjected to extremely brutal behaviour by the fascist police acting on political orders,” it alleged.
The party further said that the vehicles of its MPAs Malik Fahad, Raja Tanvir and Sardar Muhammad Ali were vandalised at Kharian.
An earlier post on the TTAP’s account said “unidentified people” had broken the glasses of the convoy’s vehicles in Gujrat.







“Our ticket holders, organisational officials and workers were arrested at the location of Gujar Khan,” the PTI statement further said.
Shortly before noon, the TTAP alleged that the Punjab police had arrested “several” PTI workers and had taken action against its camp in Rawalpindi’s Gujar Khan.
It also shared videos showing a police van from the Gujar Khan station and men in police attire carrying batons.







In its statement, the PTI also alleged that late-night raids were being carried out on the residences of its workers in Lahore, “as a result of which, worker Rashid Yousuf Jan lost his life during a raid in the area of Hanjarwal”.
The PTI demanded that all “unjustly arrested” individuals be immediately released and that those responsible for these “unconstitutional and illegal actions” be held accountable.
‘Setting out to end oppression and cruelty’
At around 1:30pm, the TTAP said its delegation had reached Jhelum. The post also had a video, in which TTAP vice chairman Abbas alleged that the people’s mandate in the 2024 elections had been stolen.
“There is economic exploitation now […] and the political crisis is intensifying. We have taken to the streets to end cruelty, […] for the fundamental rights of the people, for the poor, labouerers, unemployed and farmers and for all those who are oppressed,“ he said, standing alongside Achakzai.
The senator said the alliance would take to the streets against “cruelty” across the country on February 8.







In a separate video before his departure to Lahore, Achakzai said, “We are not going to Lahore to conquer, curse at anyone or throw rocks at them; our slogan is that we are setting out to end oppression and cruelty.”
Achakzai, who has been nominated as the next opposition leader in the National Assembly, called on the public to stand with the opposition against a Parliament “thrust upon” Pakistan.
The TTAP chief stressed that the country was suffering from “endless issues because of ill-intended decisions”.
“The government itself knows that it is invalid,” Achakzai said.
“In this regard, the TTAP has appealed to people from all walks of life to protest on Feb 8 and come stand with us,” he said, calling on people to “close their shops, rickshaws, and taxis”.
“We are starting a peaceful movement and we are here to end oppression,” he reiterated.







Standing alongside Achakzai was the opposition leader of the Punjab Assembly, Moeen Qureshi, who extended his welcome to the TTAP chief.
“There are a lot of MPAs present here who will accompany Achakzai sahib to Lahore,” he said.
He warned Punjab authorities against treating the TTAP delegation the same way as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was treated during his visit to Lahore last month.
He also reiterated that the movement would be peaceful.
PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik, in a post on X, welcomed the TTAP leaders to Lahore. She said that her party would accord a “grand welcome” to the guests at nine locations on GT Road.
“This peaceful struggle is a struggle for the Constitution and the law,” she wrote.







In a post on TTAP’s X account, the alliance’s spokesperson, Hussain Yousafzai, termed the visit a “practice match for the larger movement”.
Yousafzai voiced optimism that the visit would give “hope to the PTI workers in Punjab”. The spokesperson also added that PTI leader Asad Qaiser would hold a press conference later today.







At a recent national conference organised by the TTAP alliance, KP CM Afridi had announced the observation of a “black day” at the national and international levels on Feb 8, which will mark the second anniversary of the general elections under which the existing parliament has been functioning.
The conference had also highlighted the need for a new Charter of Democracy — agreeing that the option of talks should never be closed — and put forth demands including an “independent” judiciary and election commission, as well as the release of “political prisoners”, which it believed were necessary for restoring stability in the country.
Meanwhile, as proposals for talks between the government and the opposition remain in limbo, a clique of politicians — under the banner of the ‘National Dialogue Committee’ (NDC) — on Wednesday called for the release of all political prisoners to reduce acrimony and pave the way for reconciliation.

In a post on X, Tareen said he and his family would not participate in the franchise auction.
“Our time with Multan Sultans was never just about owning a cricket team. It was about south Punjab,” he wrote. “[It was] about giving a voice to a region that had been overlooked for too long. That’s what drove everything we built.”
Tareen added that if he were to return to the league, it would have to be for the same reason, stating that south Punjab “is where my heart is”.
“This year, I’ll be in the stands. Cheering for players on and celebrating with the fans. And when the Multan team is being sold, we’ll be ready,” he wrote.

The remarks from the party came during a press briefing held in Islamabad by party chairman Gohar Ali Khan, and party leaders Salman Akram Raja and Asad Qaiser.
In his remarks, Gohar said, “The PTI’s stance has always been that terrorism is a menace and it is a national responsibility to eliminate it from its roots.
“Our stance has always been that there should be no politics on terrorism. In fact, we need a singular stance and narrative on terrorism,” he said, adding that the party and its leadership had always condemned terrorism.
“To say that the PTI and its government in KP is uncooperative is inappropriate and far from the truth,” he said, highlighting that a grand jirga was held on the matter in the province in October.
“Terrorists do not have a religion, nationality or boundaries. They do not differ between men and women. They attack our mosques, Eidgahs and we condemn each and every attack,” he said.
He said that at this time it was “inappropriate and dangerous” to ask why the PTI was not targeted by terrorists.
“We believe that any time someone comes under a terrorist attack, the whole of the country is targeted,” he said.
“If tackling terrorism requires a more serious approach, then the support of Twitter and press conferences should not be taken for labelling allegations. Present your argument in the relevant forums,” he said.
He further stated that the PTI government in KP had increased the capacity of the province’s police force and also spent Rs40 billion for this purpose.
He said that the top priority of the PTI and its government in KP was protecting the life and property of its people. “And there can be no compromise on this, nor has there been,” he said.
“Despite that, blaming us, doing press conferences and targeting us is making the rift wider and wider, which is harmful for the nation at this time,” he asserted.
“This should be avoided,“ he said.
“I am hoping that next time we will not feel the need to hold such a press conference. And I also hope that no press conference will be held against us either,” he said.
Raja, speaking at the press conference, also termed the allegations “unfortunate” and stressed that Imran and PTI are not “terrorist sympathisers”.
“Only a fool would sympathise with terrorists,” Raja maintained.
Addressing the allegations levelled at PTI on the matter of military operations, Raja held, “We stand with the people of Pakistan and can not accept the displacement and martyrdom of innocent people.”
He said that the PTI had always offered to “work in cooperation in deciding the action plan”.
Raja recalled the grand jirgah in KP, where he said that, “all political parties, scholars, and intellectuals from KP, unanimously agreed that the current policy on counter-terrorism was wrong”.
“Bombs and explosives can not create the conditions for peace,” he reiterated.
Raja believed that the state’s priority should be to “bridge the gap between people in KP and state institutions”, stressing that PTI was the only party which could help bridge this “gap.”
“PTI can bring people and institutions together for a national purpose,” he added.
Raja said that PTI’s main proposal was that “we sit down and talk,“ stressing that until the “gap” is not addressed, the future will remain “unstable”.
In that regard, he urged that the representative party in KP (PTI) can not be isolated in matters relating to policies on counter-terrorism.
Raja also maintained that “no negotiation — whether about terrorism or any other matter — could be done while keeping Imran Khan out”.
Qaiser recalled the grand jirgah as well and said that it was “unanimously decided that any policy the Centre brings should be made in consultation with the provincial assembly.”
Qaiser noted that there has been a “rise” in terrorism in the recent past and called into question the current counter-terrorism policies.
“If your policy has consistently failed, then it is time that you should review it, revisit it and adopt a policy which can help eliminate the issue”.
He assailed the Centre for “not providing KP funds for the development of its people“.
He stressed that such an attitude “served to foster bitterness”.
Qaiser asserted that PTI was the “largest party in the country” and claimed that it was being “crushed”.
“We are not being allowed to hold rallies, which is our constitutional right and on top of that, a campaign is being run against us,” Qaiser added.
Qaiser, holding up a statement issued after the grand jirgah, said, “This right here is our main stance“.
He read: “The peace jirgah condemns terrorism in KP and its merged districts and […] every resource should be used in consultation with the  provincial assembly and within the ambit of the law, to eliminate terrorism and ensure the establishment of peace in KP.
“Resolutions passed by the KP Assembly on the security situation and counter terrorism policies should be acted upon“.
“No party in KP has remained safe from terrorism”, Qaiser further added.
Some of the key demands made by the KP peace jirgah in October were taking the provincial government on board before making any decision regarding peace in KP and resolving the differences between the federal and provincial governments for the larger public interest.
The PTI press conference comes after the military’s spokesperson, in a wide-ranging press conference, accused a political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 — ostensibly referring to the PTI — of “internally facilitating terrorists”.
‘Decision on talks to be taken by Achakzai and Allama Nasir’
Barrister Gohar, in response to a question regarding PTI’s talks with the government, said, “As we speak, no dialogue is being held with anyone — either the establishment or the government”.
However, he added that “whether there is going to be a dialogue or not and whether it will be with the government or the establishment, this mandate Khan sahib has given only to Achakzai sahib and Allama Nasir Abbas”.
Raja also responded to the question, reiterating his earlier stance that there can be no dialogue without Imran.
“We did this before as well[..], but nothing came of it,” he said, stressing that “any dialogue without Khan sahib’s opinion would be meaningless”.
On the matter of the appointment of the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Barrister Gohar said, “We were supposed to meet the speaker today, but then we found out that he has gone to Quetta, so we could not meet”.</p><small>2026-01-08 11:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0813262663afa70.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965807/stopping-weight-loss-drugs-makes-people-pile-back-on-kilos-4-times-faster-than-they-would-after-ending-diet-study' target='_blank'><strong>Stopping weight-loss drugs makes people pile back on kilos 4 times faster than they would after ending diet: study</strong></a><br><p>When people stop taking the new generation of weight-loss drugs, they pile back on the kilos four times faster than they would after ending diet and exercise regimes, new research found Thursday.
But this was mostly because they lost so much weight in the first place, according to the British researchers who conducted the largest and most up-to-date review of the subject.
A new generation of appetite-suppressing, injectable drugs called GLP-1 agonists have become immensely popular in the last few years, transforming the treatment for obesity and diabetes in many countries.They have been found to help people lose between 15-20 per cent of their body weight.“This all appears to be a good news story,” said Susan Jebb, a public health nutrition scientist at Oxford University and co-author of a new BMJ study.However, recent data has suggested that “around half of people discontinue these medications within a year,” she told a press conference.This might be because of common side effects such as nausea or the price — these drugs can cost over $1,000 a month in the US.So the researchers reviewed 37 studies looking at ceasing different weight-loss drugs, finding that participants regained around 0.4 kilograms a month.Six of the clinical trials involved semaglutide — the ingredient used in Novo Nordisk’s brands Ozempic and Wegovy — and tirzepatide used for Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound.While taking these two drugs, the trial participants lost an average of nearly 15 kilograms.However, after stopping the medication, they regained 10 kilograms within a year, which was the longest follow-up period available for these relatively new drugs.The researchers projected that the participants would return to their original weight in 18 months.Measurements of heart health, including blood pressure and cholesterol levels, also returned to their original levels after 1.4 years.People who were instead put on programmes that included diet and exercise – but not drugs – lost significantly less weight. However, it took an average of four years for them to regain their lost kilos.This meant that people taking the drugs regained their weight four times faster.
‘Starting point, not a cure’
“Greater weight loss tends to result in faster weight regain,” lead study author Sam West of Oxford University explained.But separate analysis showed that weight gain was “consistently faster after medication, regardless of the amount of weight lost in the first place,” he added.This could be because people who have learned to eat more healthily and exercise more often continue to do so even as they regain weight.Jebb emphasised that GLP-1 drugs “are a really valuable tool in obesity treatment — but obesity is a chronic relapsing condition.”
“One would expect that these treatments need to be continued for life, just in the same way as blood pressure medication,” Jebb said.If this were the case, it would impact how national health systems judge whether these drugs are cost-effective, the researchers emphasised.
“This new data makes it clear they are a starting point, not a cure,” said Garron Dodd, a metabolic neuroscience researcher at the University of Melbourne, not involved in the study.
“Sustainable treatment will likely require combination approaches, longer-term strategies, and therapies that reshape how the brain interprets energy balance, not just how much people eat,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-08 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08144152ec16019.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965813/terrorists-using-bycs-platform-to-induct-balochistans-youth-into-their-networks-ctd-official' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorists using BYC’s platform to induct Balochistan’s youth into their networks: CTD official</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan Counter-Terrorism Department’s (CTD) Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Aitzaz Goraya on Thursday said terrorists were using the platform of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC) to induct youth into their networks.
Goraya made the remarks while addressing a joint press conference alongside Balochistan Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat in Quetta, where he gave details about a terrorist arrested during an operation in Panjgur.
According to Goraya, the CTD, police and law enforcement agencies arrested a man, Sajid Ahmad alias Shahwaiz, who was a resident of Turbat during the operation.
He said the man had received a Master’s degree in Sociology from the International Islamic University in Islamabad, then worked on contract at Zubaida Jalal Government College for three years, before teaching at the University of Turbat.
The CTD DIG said Sajid had “remained with BYC and was in constant communication with its leadership”.
“One thing that has surfaced prominently is the role of the BYC. Every man or child who is facilitating or [is involved in] what they call a sharing network or intelligence network […] they are somehow linked to the BYC,“ the CTD DIG said.
“Besides Sajid, we have also arrested three others against whom we are registering FIRs (first information reports),” Goraya added.
He said that one of them was 18-year-old Sarfaraz, who was a resident of Kharan and had been tasked with conducting a recce of the police and their polio duties.
“He was also first made to join the BYC, involved in their protests and roadblocks,” the CTD official said, adding that the person who inducted him into BYC was Jahanzaib alias Mehrbaan, aged 20 years.

 

Jahanzaib “not only remained involved in recce but also transportation, including one instance where he transported Rs0.6million of extortion money from Quetta and another when he transported Rs1m, as well as medicines”, DIG Goraya said.
He further said that Jahanzaib had been involved in BYC’s roadblocks in Noshki and Kharan. “He participated in the BYC’s so-called missing persons protests and properly organised who to bring and what to post on social media,” the DIG said.
According to Goraya, Jahanzaib also “inducted” 18-year-old Bezan into the BYC, following which he joined the so-called Baloch Liberation Army (BLA).
Bezan’s brother Shafqat Yar was killed in firing when the Levies force was attacked in Khad Kocha, DIG Goraya said. “He (Bezan) was first inducted into BYC, then he went into BLA.”
“All these are those people and children who were subverted, and their minds were used to take them to the other side and assigned these small tasks,” he said.
“Fitna al-Hindustan, they say we do not induct children, we do not use women or children, but again and again we have said — even today we are telling you with evidence — that they first use the platform of BYC and then they take them forward by using children,” the DIG stated.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Goraya said there was a “proper network being run that depends on underage children, as they are not thoroughly checked when going to schools and colleges“.
“We must bring these things into their parents’ knowledge,” he stressed, adding that such youngsters would be taken to internment and rehabilitation centres that were being established in Quetta and Turbat, “so we can check how much their minds have been subverted”.
“We will hold dialogue with them, provide psychological treatment, and involve their parents and society’s notables. We will take them ahead as an improved, responsible citizen,” the CTD DIG said.
He said the terrorists subverted educated people, who had even remained on the government’s payroll, and through them, “many children and students — innocent minds who do not have a sense of what to do — they recruit them to BYC first to brainwash them and then properly induct them into the organisation”.
In a joint press conference held with provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind in April last year, DIG Goraya had questioned the legitimacy of BYC, later stating that it is not a registered organisation.
The same month, when a protest drive had paralysed the province, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti termed BYC activists as “abettors” of separatists.
Sajid involved with BLA, BLF
According to DIG Goraya, Sajid, who was apprehended from Panjgur, had been involved with the BLA and the banned Baloch Liberation Front (BLF).
“Their sharing network includes recce of different locations in Turbat by marking them on Google Earth, which he shared with his commander Dostain in our neighbouring country.”
The CTD complex, roads going to and from the Turbat airport, and an under-construction high court were among the locations where Sajid allegedly carried out reconnaissance.
Goraya detailed that the items recovered from Sajid’s vehicle when he was apprehended included a rocket-propelled grenade, five rockets, two M-16 rifles with 23 magazines and 800 rounds, 20 hand grenades with 22 fuses, 30 C4 explosive slabs, one jacket, remote controls, 13 UBGL rounds, a compass, helmets and 30 feet of detonating cord.
Sajid was heading from Panjgur towards Turbat, the officer said.
“Not only did [Sajid] share things with them (BYC), but also remained involved in writing subversive literature for them and also posted it on different social media websites and carried out recruitment,” the DIG said.
“Other than that, on motivation, Balaj joined BYC, Jalal joined BYC, Hamal joined too, and Hamal also properly joined BLA and remained in contact with him (Sajid).
“He (Hamal) also went with him (Sajid) to meet Dostain in our neighbouring country using different routes.”
According to DIG Goraya, forensics of Sajid’s mobile phone revealed that a “lot of material of smuggling, also known as Zambad, also came with him, even to the extent of extremely sophisticated weapons, equipment, which were brought through those Zambad and given to their members”.
The CTD official said Sajid’s sister-in-law had also been a part of BYC and houses were acquired under her name to dump and transport materials from there.
‘100 persons abroad conspiring against Pakistan’
Meanwhile, the additional chief secretary said a “Red Notice Cell has been activated”, which included the prosecutor general and officials of the CTD and the home department.
“They have prepared lists. There are more than 100 people who are abroad and conspiring against Pakistan, promoting and sponsoring terrorist activities in Pakistan, lobbying and doing propaganda,” Shafqaat said.
He noted that a court order was needed to forward any person’s name to Interpol.
The official explained that to issue a “red notice” for someone, the Balochistan government would first file a charge sheet in the court, which would then declare the person as a proclaimed offender, after which the government would approach the interior ministry to take the process forward.

 

Shafqaat stated that the federal and provincial governments were arranging for more funds to strengthen the CTD.
He highlighted that one of the “biggest successful steps” taken in 2025 by the provincial government was the establishment of Provincial Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre (Piftac), which has been fully functional since December.
“We will now establish it on the district level. We are hopeful that by March, all our intelligence and actions will be coordinated.”
“Detention centres have been established. Two amendments have been made in the Anti-Terrorism Act, and we will be launching faceless courts in two months,” Shafqaat said.</p><small>2026-01-08 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0814021479ff111.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965810/at-least-2-cops-injured-as-police-vehicle-comes-under-attack-in-kps-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>At least 2 cops injured as police vehicle comes under attack in KP’s Bannu</strong></a><br><p>BANNU: At least two cops were injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu as a police vehicle transporting prisoners to Hangu came under attack by “terrorists” on Thursday, sources said.
Sources in Bannu police told Dawn that the vehicle, which belonged to Hangu police and was carrying prisoners for court appearances, came under fire at Domel Link Road.
A source in the Bannu Central Jail’s administration also confirmed this to Dawn, saying that the prisoners were being transported for court hearings as per routine. The vehicle was attacked on the way to the court, the source said.
Sources in Bannu police said the vehicle’s driver changed route and reached Karak following the incident.
The sources said the two injured cops were being provided medical treatment at the district headquarters hospital in Karak, adding that Hangu District Police Officer Khanzaib Mohmand also visited the injured personnel at the hospital.
Meanwhile, an investigation into the attack is under way and security in the area has been beefed up, according to police sources.

 

In recent days, multiple attacks targeting law enforcement personnel have been reported from various parts of KP.
On January 4, a policeman was martyred in firing by unidentified attac­kers in the Kashfi Khel area of Bannu.
The martyred constable Rashid Khan was leaving his home for work on Sunday morning when some armed assailants, who were on a motorcycle, opened fire, killing him on the spot.
Last month, five cops were injured after terrorists launched a late-night attack on a police checkpost in the Shaikh Landak area of Bannu.</p><small>2026-01-08 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08073247f8d3e5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965715/zalmay-khalilzad-asks-islamabad-to-have-fresh-accord-with-kabul' target='_blank'><strong>Zalmay Khalilzad asks Islamabad to have fresh accord with Kabul</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A day after the military’s chief spokesperson assailed the Afghan Taliban for not honouring their pledges in the Doha Agreement, one of the architects of that accord suggested that Pakistan should consider entering into a similar deal with Kabul.
Zalmay Khalilzad, who served as special representative to Afghanistan during the first Trump administration, tweeted on Wednesday that it was “a misunderstanding… to think that the agreement covered Afghanistan-Pakistan issues”.
In a post on his X account, he also attached the text of the agreement, which — among other things — contained a commitment to prevent the soil of Afghanistan being used by any group or individual against the security of the United States and its allies.
However, he posited that “a similar agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan… would serve the interests of both countries”.







Expanding on the idea, Mr Khalilzad said that the accord should be one “in which both countries commit to not allow any individual or group including ISIS and TTP to use its territories to threaten the security of the other, and in which they accept third party monitoring of such.”
“Based on recent conversations with Taliban leaders, I believe they are prepared to negotiate such an agreement. And it could be game-changing for the relations between these two neighbours,” he wrote on X.
Mr Khalilzad, who has also facilitated negotiations between Kabul and Washington to secure the freedom of US citizens being held in Afghanistan, is viewed by both capitals as an invaluable interlocutor.
In Washington circles, Mr Khalilzad is viewed as a hawk. He openly sympathises with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan and has — in the past — reserved critical words for Pakistan.

According to a statement issued by the PIA spokesperson, the airline was enhancing its flights to the United Kingdom.
“After the resumption of flights to Manchester and the announcement of flights from Islamabad to London from March 29, the airline has also finalised arrangements for the launch of a direct flight from Lahore to London from March 30,” the spokesperson said.
He added it would operate up to seven flights to the UK by the end of March.
He added that flights were being increased in light of the high demand and long-standing requests of Pakistanis and expatriates residing in the UK.
“All flights to the UK are operating on full loads,” he added.
The relaunch dates of Islamabad-London and Lahore-London flights were arranged for consecutive dates driven by demand and the airline’s readiness, the spokesperson said.
The airline will operate flights three times a week from Islamabad to London and one flight a week from Lahore to London, he said, adding it was also planning to operate more flights from Pakistan to other UK destinations in the future, while flights to London would be increased gradually.
He said the airline used to operate more than “22 frequencies” to the UK and expected to exceed this number.
In June 2020, the European Union Air Safety Agency had barred PIA from operating in EU countries over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers. The ban on flights followed the then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament, where he termed pilots’ licences “dubious”.
The European agency lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28, 2024. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
In September 2025, PIA received the go-ahead to resume direct flights to the UK after a gap of nearly five years. Subsequently, the airline resumed flights to the UK, with flight operations to Manchester resuming in the first phase.
Two months ago, the airline announced it was resuming direct flights to London in March 2026 after a six-year hiatus.</p><small>2026-01-08 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08104947dbbfdab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965793/cdf-field-marshal-munir-emphasises-armys-zero-tolerance-policy-towards-threats-to-national-security' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir emphasises army’s zero-tolerance policy towards threats to national security</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Thursday emphasised the army’s zero-tolerance policy towards any threats to national security, according to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The statement said CDF Field Marshal Munir made the remarks while addressing officers during a visit to Lahore Garrison. He also reaffirmed the military’s resolve to respond to evolving challenges with professionalism and determination, it added.
“He said the armed forces remained committed to safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and internal stability, while promoting discipline, excellence and selfless national service,” ISPR said.







During the visit, where he was received by the Lahore corps commander, CDF Field Marshal Munir was given a comprehensive briefing on the formation’s operational preparedness, training standards and key initiatives to enhance combat efficiency, it said.
The statement added that he witnessed a “specialised field training exercise showcasing the latest technologies, underscoring the army’s emphasis on innovation, adaptability to match the dynamic future battlefield”.
He also inspected sports and recreational facilities being provided to troops, highlighting their importance in maintaining physical fitness, morale, and overall well-being, it said.
CDF Field Marshal Munir also visited a care centre at Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Lahore, lauding the efforts of the medical staff and administration in establishing a fully equipped, state-of-the-art healthcare facility, it added.
The CDF‘s remarks come after the military’s spokesperson stated that Afghan­istan had become a hub of terrorists and non-state actors, declaring the ruling Taliban “the mother organisation” which had been harbouring such groups since 2021.
In a wide-ranging and marathon press conference, he also spoke at length about souring relations with Afghanistan, the belligerence being witnessed from India, as well as levelling criticism against the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Imran Khan, without explicitly naming the latter.
Last month, the army’s top leadership had also warned political forces against undermining national unity through agitation or rhetoric, besides vowing to deal sternly with what it described as India-sponsored proxies involved in terrorism.</p><small>2026-01-08 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0812440131752b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965804/in-meeting-with-air-chief-saudi-defence-leadership-lauds-pakistans-role-in-promoting-regional-peace-and-stability' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with air chief, Saudi defence leadership lauds Pakistan’s role in promoting regional peace and stability</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s air chief met high-ranking Saudi defence officials, the military’s media affairs wing said on Thursday, adding that the latter appreciated Islamabad’s “constructive role” in promoting regional peace and stability.
A statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Pakistan Air Force Air (PAF) Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu called on Royal Saudi Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Turki bin Bander bin Abdulaziz and Saudi Armed Forces’ Chief of General Staff General Fayiadh bin Hameed Al-Rowaily during a visit to the kingdom.
“During the meetings, matters pertaining to bilateral defence cooperation, regional security environment and future avenues of collaboration were discussed,” it said.
It added that the Saudi defence leadership “praised the professionalism, operational excellence and combat readiness of [the] PAF and expressed strong interest in enhanced joint training and operational collaboration, particularly in the domain of multi-domain operations“.
“They also appreciated Pakistan’s constructive role in promoting regional peace and stability,” it added.
“Both sides expressed satisfaction over the existing level of cooperation and agreed to further enhance engagement through joint training, operational collaboration and exchange of professional expertise, while highlighting the Pakistan–KSA Defence Agreement as a symbol of mutual trust and enduring brotherly relations,” the statement added.
It said ACM Sidhu highlighted during the exchanges the “historic and fraternal ties between the two countries and reiterated his commitment to strengthening military-to-military cooperation through bilateral and multilateral exercises”.
He also underscored the transformation of the PAF into a robust multi-domain force, integrating space, cyber, electronic warfare and artificial intelligence capabilities, demonstrated through its operational performance.
It further stated that the ACM’s visit “underscores the depth of the enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and reflects the shared commitment of both nations to further strengthen cooperation in the defence and aviation sectors”.
The visit comes as reports emerge about talks between the two countries to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal.
A day ago, Reuters reported a source as saying that discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced by the former.
The report quoted another source as saying that the jets were the primary option among others under discussion.
“The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion,” the report stated.
The development was reported months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year.</p><small>2026-01-08 08:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08125002589cd5a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965805/direct-bangladesh-pakistan-flights-to-resume-after-14-years' target='_blank'><strong>Direct Bangladesh-Pakistan flights to resume after 14 years</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh and Pakistan are to resume direct flights after more than a decade, Dhaka’s national airline said on Thursday.
Biman Bangladesh Airlines is scheduled to fly its first Dhaka-Karachi flight on January 29 and will be operated twice weekly, the first regular flights since 2012.
“We are relaunching the Dhaka-Karachi route with two weekly flights,” airline manager Bosra Islam told AFP on Thursday.
“The resumption of direct flights will significantly improve connectivity between Bangladesh and Pakistan, supporting business travel, tourism, and family reunions,” Biman Bangladesh Airlines said in a statement.
Travellers between Bangladesh and Pakistan must currently use connecting flights through Gulf hubs such as Dubai and Doha.
Cargo ships had resumed sailing from Karachi to Bangladesh’s key port of Chittagong in November 2024.
Last month, Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider had expressed the hope that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka would start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus.
Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during the rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly.
Recently, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq travelled to Dhaka for the funeral of the country’s first female prime minister Khaleda Zia in December.
In August 2025, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had also visitd Dhaka and met Yunus.</p><small>2026-01-08 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/081021570c6d998.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965792/killing-of-woman-by-us-immigration-officer-sparks-protests-in-minneapolis' target='_blank'><strong>Killing of woman by US immigration officer sparks protests in Minneapolis</strong></a><br><p>A US immigration officer shot and killed an American woman on the streets of Minneapolis on Wednesday, leading to huge protests and outrage from local leaders who rejected White House claims she was a domestic terrorist.
The woman, identified in local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was hit at point blank range as she apparently tried to drive away from agents who were crowding around her car, which they said was blocking their way.
Footage of the incident shows a masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fire three times into the Honda SUV, which then hurtles out of control and smashes into stationary vehicles, as horrified onlookers hurl abuse at the federal officers.
Her bloodied body is then seen slumped in the crashed vehicle.
US President Donald Trump’s administration moved quickly to claim Good had been trying to kill the agents, an assertion Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called “bullsh**” and urged ICE to get out of his city.
Thousands of protesters took to the frigid streets of Minneapolis after the shooting, holding signs reading “ICE out of MPLS”, a common abbreviation for the city.

 

ICE’s federal agents have been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s immigrant deportation drive, despite the objections of local officials.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched an aggressive recruitment campaign last summer to add 10,000 additional ICE agents to the existing 6,000-strong contingent.
That sparked criticism that new officers in the field were insufficiently trained.
DHS chief Kristi Noem said “any loss of life is a tragedy” but called the incident “domestic terrorism” and said Good “had been stalking and impeding (ICE’s) work all throughout the day”.
“She then proceeded to weaponise her vehicle,” she said.
Wednesday’s incident came during protest action against immigration enforcement in the southern part of Minneapolis, located in the midwestern state of Minnesota.
The Department of Homeland Security, which runs ICE, said on X the victim had tried to run over its officer who fired “defensive shots”.
Grisly scene
Minnesota’s Governor Tim Walz called the federal government’s response to the incident “propaganda” and vowed his state would “ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation”.
Witness Brandon Hewitt heard “three shots”.
“I got a bunch of video of them carrying the body to the ambulance,” he told MS NOW.
Another witness interviewed by local station FOX9 described a grisly scene.
“The surviving passenger got out of the car covered in blood,” the witness said.
He recounted seeing a man who identified himself as a doctor attempting to reach Good but being refused access by officers.
Anti-ICE protests
There have been passionate protests against immigration operations of the Trump administration, which has vowed to arrest and deport what it says are “millions” of undocumented migrants.
The DHS called the violence a “direct consequence of constant attacks and demonisation of our officers”.
The officer who opened fire, who was released from the hospital following the incident, was rammed and dragged along a road by an anti-ICE protester in June, Noem said.
The victim’s mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper that her daughter “was probably terrified”.
Good was “not part of anything like” challenging ICE officers, Ganger added.
Trump has made preventing unlawful immigration and expelling undocumented migrants priorities during his second term, and has tightened conditions for entering the United States and obtaining visas.
ICE — which critics accuse of transforming into a paramilitary force under Trump — has been tasked with deporting an unprecedented number of undocumented migrants.
US authorities said up to 2,000 officers were in Minneapolis for immigration sweeps.
A US immigration enforcement officer shot dead an undocumented immigrant in Chicago in September after federal authorities alleged the man tried to resist detention by driving his car into the official.</p><small>2026-01-08 07:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/080926555ace74c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965789/australia-win-final-test-to-complete-4-1-ashes-triumph-over-england' target='_blank'><strong>Australia win final Test to complete 4-1 Ashes triumph over England</strong></a><br><p>Australia clinched the final Ashes Test against England Thursday by five wickets to complete a dominant 4-1 victory after a gruelling series, sending the retiring Usman Khawaja out on a high.
The nervy hosts saw wickets tumble as they chased their 160 target, which they reached after lunch on day five with Cameron Green not out 22 and Alex Carey on 16.
“That’s Ashes cricket. Everyone got tense,” said Carey who hit the winning runs.
“Usman is going to be missed. A great career and a great way to finish.”
Australia lost openers Travis Head (29) and Jake Weatherald (34), along with captain Steve Smith (12) and Khawaja who made six in his final knock before retirement.

“It means a lot. So much has gone into it. The only thing I wanted was a win, as much as I wanted to hit the winning runs,” said Khawaja, who was almost in tears as he walked off to a standing ovation after being bowled by Josh Tongue.
“The whole Test match I found it hard to control my emotions,” Khawaja added after his 88th and final appearance on the Test stage.
“I’m grateful I’ve had the career I’ve had. I have full gratitude,” he said, adding that Australia were relieved to have got over the winning line.
“It definitely got a bit too tight. You never count your chickens. We got the job done though.”
Marnus Labuschagne, dropped on 20, compiled 37 before needlessly running himself out to give Ben Stokes’s men a flicker of hope as they reduced Australia to 121-5.
But victory was never seriously in doubt after England were dismissed for 342 on the back of Jacob Bethell’s stylish 154.
England horror show
Defeat ended a long tour for the visitors that quickly turned into a horror show when they lost the opening two Tests in Perth and Brisbane by eight wickets and the third at Adelaide by 82 runs.
Stokes’s side had arrived confident they could win their first series in Australia since 2010-11 amid taunts about the hosts having their worst side in 15 years.
Facing heavy criticism over their preparations, discipline and ultra-aggressive “Bazball” style of cricket, they rallied to pull off a stunning four-wicket comeback win in the fourth Test in Melbourne.
It was their first victory in 18 Tests on Australian soil and restored some pride, but another loss in Sydney, albeit close, will see them face a tough inquisition on their return home with coach Brendon McCullum’s job on the line.
Australia achieved their success despite being without pace spearhead Josh Hazlewood for the series and Pat Cummins for all but one Test, while veteran spin king Nathan Lyon played a limited role.
Nearly 860,000 fans watched the series with a record 211,032 through the turnstiles in Sydney.
Tempers flare
Tempers flared earlier when Weatherald survived a review for caught behind on 16 despite the controversial Snicko technology, which has been unreliable all series, appearing to indicate a faint murmur.
An angry Carse had to be pulled away from complaining to the on-field umpire by Stokes and the bowler exchanged heated words with Weatherald.
England finally got their reward when Head swiped Tongue to Carse at midwicket and Weatherland top-edged the same bowler to Matthew Potts.
Smith was bamboozled by a turning ball by spinner Will Jacks and Khawaja, after being given a guard of honour by England when he walked out for the final time, played on.
England resumed on 302-8 with a 119-run advantage and added 40.
Precocious number three Bethell, trumpeted as the future of English cricket, padded up on 142 with Potts yet to score.
He reached 150 before edging Mitchell Starc to wicketkeeper Carey to end a breakthrough innings, with his marathon 265-ball stay including 15 fours.
Tongue was the last man out for six, again to Starc, with Potts unbeaten on 18.
It was Starc’s 31st wicket of the series, more than any other bowler.
Australia were all out for 567 in their first innings on Wednesday on the back of centuries from Head and Smith in reply to the tourists’ 384, built on Joe Root’s 160.</p><small>2026-01-08 04:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695ed78c0c70d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965683/mayor-throws-his-weight-behind-culling-amid-surge-in-dog-bite-cases-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Mayor throws his weight behind culling amid surge in dog-bite cases in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>• Questions whether critics comprehend the suffering caused by dog attacks• Says a small group should not dictate stray dog policy, which must reflect majority’s will
KARACHI: Amid a surge in dog-bite cases across Karachi, Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday signalled that the situation was approaching a tipping point and openly suggested culling as a possible option if the people demanded immediate relief.
Responding to questions during an interaction with the media in Ittehad Town, the mayor said public opinion on the issue varied sharply across neighbourhoods, but warned against allowing a small group to dictate policy for a city of over 25 million people.
“If I ask people here in Ittehad Colony what should be done about stray dogs, they will say that the dogs should be killed. But if I go to Clifton, there are 10 to 15 people who say, ‘No, this should not happen.’ Those 10 to 15 people impose their way of thinking on 25 million people,” he said.
Emphasising the democratic will, Mr Wahab said he believes that “the will of all the people must be considered,” adding, “a handful of individuals cannot be given supremacy over everyone else.”
Highlighting the limitations of neutering, he said the method requires time to show results and questioned the criticism faced by authorities when attacks continue during that period.
“If neutering is to be done, its impact will take time to appear. Then people should not criticise when dogs bite,” he said. “If the city wants quick results, then culling will have to be carried out.
“We are prepared for both options. Hundreds of people have been bitten in just a few days. I appeal to critics to listen to victims and their families before objecting to decisive measures.”

 

Mayor Wahab also pointed to legal hurdles, saying that a small group repeatedly approaches courts to block action and then cited an example from India. “This issue also came up in the Indian Supreme Court, and it resolved it. The court said that instead of neutering, culling should be done,” he said.
He questioned whether those opposing culling truly understand the suffering caused by dog attacks. “Ask those people who have actually gone through this experience what they want — culling or neutering?,” he said.
Uplift work initiated in West, Keamari districts
Earlier, the mayor laid the foundation stones for two major infrastructure development projects in district West and district Keamari, aimed at improving road connectivity, drainage and overall civic facilities in the city.
In district West, he inaugurated a mega infrastructure project for the rehabilitation of Hub River Road to Tori Bangash Road in Ittehad Town.
The project, with an estimated cost of Rs8 billion, is one of the largest road development initiatives in the area.
Speaking at the ceremony, attended by city council members, elected representatives and a large number of locals, the mayor said the project reflects the Karachi Metro­poli­tan Corporation’s (KMC) commitment to inclusive and sustainable urban development.
Under the project, Hub River Road will be converted into a 12,500-foot-long dual carriageway, a move expected to significantly ease traffic congestion in District West.
A modern drainage system spanning 8,000 feet has been incorporated into the design, along with the installation of more than 21,000 feet of RCC drainage pipelines to improve stormwater management.
The completion of the project will eliminate flooding issues in the area, he added.
Separately, the mayor also laid the foundation stone for the reconstruction of Sparco Road in District Keamari.
The project is being executed at a cost of approximately Rs56m and is described as an important milestone in the city’s urban development efforts.
The scheme includes 48,000 square feet of paver blocks and 65,000 square feet of asphalt wearing course, along with a modern sewerage system and a high-quality road structure.

Informed sources told Dawn that the federal cabinet, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has linked the ECC-sanctioned Rs2.56 per litre additional bounty to the oil industry’s retail business for complete supply chain digitisation.
On Dec 9, Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb presiding over the ECC meeting approved an additional build-up of Rs2.56 per litre on petrol and diesel prices in two phases to improve the profitability of oil marketing companies (OMCs) and their dealers.
The ECC announced that it had approved a proposal to revise the margins of OMCs and petroleum dealers on petroleum and high-speed diesel, adjusting them in line with the national Consumer Price Index for 2023-24 and 2024-25, with increases capped between 5pc and 10pc. “It also decided that half of the increase in the margins will be paid immediately, while the remaining half will be conditional on the digitisation progress, with the Petroleum Division to report back by June 1, 2026”, it said.

PM links commissions and margins to full digitisation of petroleum supply chain

Under the decision, ECC had allowed Rs1.22 per litre increase in profit margins for OMCs and Rs1.34 per litre for petroleum dealers, in two equal installments. The first increase of 61 paise per litre in sale margins for OMCs and 67 paise per litre for dealers was to come into force with the following fortnightly price revision on Dec 15 or 31. This was to immediately take the OMCs’ margin to Rs8.48 per litre, while that of dealers was to rise to Rs9.31 per litre.
The second equivalent increase was scheduled to come into force on June 1, 2026 subject to digitalisation of their sales and stocks network and its live connectivity to the government entities like the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, the Federal Board of Revenue and Petroleum Division. With that increase, the OMCs would have charged Rs9.10 per litre while dealers were to get about Rs9.98 on sale of every litre. At present, OMCs are paid Rs7.87 per litre and dealers Rs8.64.
However, the government did not change revised rates for dealers and OMCs in two subsequent quarterly pricing revisions on Dec 15 and 31, although product prices were reduced significantly. When contacted, an official said the prime minister who had been personally pushing Digital Pakistan Initiative besides digitalisation of the entire petroleum sector from production to consumption stage and facilitated passage of an enabling law, opposed the two-phased hike in retail margins and linked implementation of ECC decision to 100pc digitisation, potentially with effect from June 1, 2026.
This followed a law passed in August last year by the parliament for digital tracking and monitoring of all petroleum products from import and production stage to storage, transportation and sales at retail outlets to minimise the menace of smuggling and adulteration, causing an estimated Rs300-500bn annual revenue loss besides associated environmental and engine degradation.
The Petroleum (Amendment) Act 2025 envisaged new clauses for information technology-based tracking of petroleum products to curb the smuggling and to initiate strict actions against illegal transportation and decantation of petroleum products, along with actions to be taken against illegal petrol pumps.
All the local refineries and major oil marketing companies have been demanding individually and from their collective forums from the government to take stringent measures at borders and at domestic locations of production and sales to control smuggling of petroleum products, including LPG, as it negatively affected their businesses and caused revenue loss to the government.

Trump has frequently employed the US military — which is currently funded at record spending levels — since returning to office, including strikes on Yemeni rebels, Iranian nuclear sites and alleged drug-smuggling boats, as well as a brazen special forces raid to abduct Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.
“I have determined that, for the Good of our Country, especially in these very troubled and dangerous times, our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars, but rather $1.5 Trillion Dollars,” Trump said on Truth Social.







“This will allow us to build the ‘Dream Military’ that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,” the US president said.
Trump said the increase is possible due to revenue from the sweeping tariffs he has imposed on friend and foe alike.
The United States is already by far the world’s biggest military spender, and a hike to $1.5 trillion would push Washington’s financial outlay on its armed forces even farther ahead of its rivals China and Russia, though it could also spark an arms race with such countries.
Trump slams defence companies
Trump’s announcement on boosting the US military budget comes after Nato allies committed last year to increase their defence spending to five per cent of GDP by 2035 in response to pressure from the US president.
Even as he announced a budget goal that would be a major boon to defence contractors, Trump took aim at them in posts on Truth Social.
Defence contractors are “issuing massive Dividends to their Shareholders and massive Stock Buybacks, at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment,” while pay packages for defence executives are “exorbitant and unjustifiable,” Trump said.







The president said salaries should be capped at $5 million and that he would prohibit stock buybacks and dividends “until such time as these problems are rectified,” without specifying how he would do so.
The announcement took the markets by surprise, sending US companies in the defence sector — such as Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics — more than four per cent lower. Northrop Grumman lost more than five per cent.
Trump took aim at Raytheon specifically, saying the Defence Department told him the company was the “least responsive” to its needs and the “slowest in increasing their volume”.







Raytheon must boost its investments in plants and equipment, Trump said, threatening it with a loss of US government business if it does not comply.</p><small>2026-01-08 02:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/080728395e68664.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965740/us-says-it-needs-to-control-venezuelan-oil-sales-indefinitely-to-drive-change' target='_blank'><strong>US says it needs to control Venezuelan oil sales indefinitely to drive change</strong></a><br><p>The US needs to control Venezuela’s oil sales and revenue indefinitely to stabilise that country’s economy, rebuild its oil sector and ensure it acts in America’s interests, top US officials said on Wednesday.
The comments reflect the importance of crude oil to US President Donald Trump’s strategy in Venezuela after US forces abducted and deposed the country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, in a raid on the capital Caracas on Saturday.
“We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,” US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech & Utilities Conference in Miami.

 

He said the revenues would be used to stabilise Venezuela’s economy and eventually to repay oil majors Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips for losses when their assets were nationalised by former president Hugo Chavez nearly two decades ago.
US Vice President JD Vance said that controlling Venezuela’s oil meant controlling the country.
“We control the energy resources, and we tell the regime: ‘You‘re allowed to sell the oil so long as you serve America‘s national interest; you‘re not allowed to sell it if you can‘t serve America‘s national interest,” he told Fox News.







“And that’s how we exert incredible pressure on that country without wasting a single American life, without endangering a single American citizen,” he said.
Democratic lawmakers criticised this approach, which Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy equated to stealing Venezuela’s oil at gunpoint, while industry analysts warned about political instability as the country treads a fine line between denouncing Maduro’s abduction and appeasing the US.
The OPEC member nation sits atop the world’s largest oil reserves but accounts for only about one per cent of global supply after decades of underinvestment eroded production.
Stored oil moving to market first
US Energy Secretary Wright said the US would market stored Venezuelan oil first and then sell ongoing future production indefinitely with revenues deposited into accounts controlled by the US government.
Such sales already have begun and the US has engaged “the world’s leading commodity marketers and key banks” to execute and provide financial support for them, according to a statement from the US Department of Energy.

 

Wright added he was speaking to US oil companies to learn what conditions would enable them to enter Venezuela to help boost the country’s production in the longer term.
“The resources are immense. This should be a wealthy, prosperous, peaceful energy powerhouse,” he said.
On Tuesday, Washington announced a deal with Caracas to initially export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a sign the government of interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez is responding to Trump’s demand that it open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.
Trump said on Wednesday in a post on Truth Social that Venezuela has agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of its oil to purchase American-made goods.
“A wise choice, and a very good thing for the people of Venezuela, and the United States,” he wrote.







Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA said it was progressing in negotiations with the United States for oil sales. PDVSA board member Wills Rangel told Reuters the US will need to buy cargoes at fair market prices.
Shares of US refiners Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66 and Valero Energy were up between 2.5pc and 5pc.
White House meetings
Trump is scheduled to meet with the heads of major oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss ways of raising Venezuela’s oil production.
Representatives from Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron — the top three US oil companies — would be present, according to a source familiar with the planning.
Chevron Vice Chairman Mark Nelson will represent that company at the meeting, another source said.
The companies, all of which have experience in Venezuela, have declined to comment.
Wright said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday afternoon that he spoke with the CEOs of all three companies immediately after Maduro was seized, and expected them to be engaged in rehabilitating Venezuela’s oil sector.
“Are they going to put billions of dollars into building new infrastructure in Venezuela next week? Of course not,” he said. “But they want to be productive advisers and helpers in that process.”
Wright also told CNBC that some of the proceeds from Venezuelan oil sales could eventually be used to repay ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil for losses when they exited the country, but only after Venezuela’s economy is stabilized.
Chevron is the only US oil major still operating in Venezuela’s oil fields.
Venezuela was producing as much as 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s. But mismanagement and limited foreign investment have since led to a huge drop in annual production, which averaged about 1.1 million bpd last year.
Wright said he believed Venezuelan production could be increased within a short period with an infusion of equipment and technology, but that a bigger recovery to past production levels would take years.</p><small>2026-01-08 02:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08074117d7aa370.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965745/nepra-cuts-power-tariff-by-62-paise' target='_blank'><strong>Nepra cuts power tariff by 62 paise</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has reduced the national average uniform electricity tariff by 62 paise per unit for the next six months, effective January 1.
According to a notification issued late on Wednesday night, the regulator has determined separate consumer-end tariffs for each distribution company (ex-Wapda Discos) in view of their differing revenue requirements and permitted levels of transmission and distribution (T&D) losses.
For CY26, the national average tariff has been set at Rs33.38 per kWh, down from Rs34.00 per kWh in 2025-26.
The Gujranwala, Quetta, Multan, Sukkur, Hyderabad, Peshawar, Tribal Areas and Hazara electric power companies had filed multi-year tariff petitions for the period 2025-26 to 2029-30, which have now been determined by the regulator.
In line with policy guidelines issued by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) and following the federal cabinet’s approval of the annual rebasing of consumer-end tariffs with effect from Jan 1, Nepra rebased the tariffs and issued its determination for the calendar year January-December 2026.
The determined tariffs have been communicated to the federal government for submission of the uniform tariff application.
The total revenue requirement of ex-Wapda Discos has been projected at Rs3.379 trillion, comprising Rs2.923tr for power purchase costs and Rs456.15 billion for distribution companies’ margins and prior-year adjustments, based on projected sales of 101,234 gigawatt-hours during CY26.

The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time of acute financial strain and as Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about US commitments in the Middle East.
The mutual defence deal was signed following Israel’s strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha, an attack that shook the Gulf region.
One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion.
The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion.
The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the deal.
Pakistan’s Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks, including on “military cooperation between the two sides”, Saudi media outlet SaudiNews50 said on social media platform X on Monday.
Tested in combat
Amir Masood, a retired air marshal and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment, including JF-17s and electronic and weapons systems for the jets.
He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations.
The JF-17’s marketability has been increased because “it is tested and has been used in combat,” he told Reuters, adding that it’s also cost-effective.
The aircraft was deployed during the conflict with India last May, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades.
The military or finance and defence ministries did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Saudi Arabia’s government media office also did not respond.
The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership.
Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress.
In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6bn support package for Pakistan, including a $3bn deposit at the central bank and $3bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payment.
Saudi Arabia has since rolled over deposits multiple times, including a $1.2bn deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures.
Arms sales outreach
Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry.
Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4bn with Libya’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the country’s largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.
Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East.
On Tuesday, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook.
“Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif told Geo News.
Pakistan is currently under a $7bn IMF programme, its 24th, which followed a short-term $3bn deal that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Fund’s support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.</p><small>2026-01-08 02:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695ed4b727dab.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965675/centre-provinces-green-light-action-plan-to-enrol-out-of-school-children' target='_blank'><strong>Centre, provinces green light action plan to enrol out-of-school children</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a show of unity, the federal government, provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) have approved the ‘National Education Action Plan’ to tackle the issue of out-of-school children (OOSC) during the 38th Inter-Provincial Education Ministers Conference (IPEMC).
UN agencies, including Unicef, say that more than 25 million children are out of school in Pakistan, placing the country among those with the highest number globally. The situation is exacerbated by economic hardship, climate-related events and inadequate funding for education.
The meeting, chaired by Federal Minister for Education Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, unanimously endorsed and approved the plan along with its provincial components and other key education-related initiatives following extensive consultations. Sources said participants set targets to reduce the number of out-of-school children over the next five years.
A press release issued by the Ministry of Education said that Minister of State for Education Wajiha Qamar, Federal Parliamentary Secretary Farah Naz Akbar, Federal Secretary Education Nadeem Mahbub and provincial ministers Rahila Hameed Durrani, Muhammad Ismail Rahoo, Rana Iqbal Sikandar and Arshad Ayub Khan attended the meeting.

Heads of federal education bodies, including the chairman of the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secodry Education and the executive director of IBCC, were also present.
During the session, participants were briefed on a special federal ‘Challenge Fund’ aimed at bringing out-of-school children back into the education system, with the federal government extending support to all provinces to address the issue.
The statement said that provincial representatives shared progress reports. 
Punjab’s Education Minister Rana Sikandar announced the outsourcing of 10,000 schools. 
Sindh’s Muhammad Ismail Rahoo confirmed the merit-based recruitment of 93,000 teachers, while Balochistan’s Rahila Hameed Durrani reported the restoration of 3,200 closed schools, bringing 140,000 children back to classrooms.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported a six per cent increase in enrolment along with the recruitment of 10,000 teachers. AJK Minister Malik Zafar highlighted the allocation of Rs7 billion for 10,000 new classrooms. Gilgit-Baltistan also shared initiatives related to special funds for out-of-school children and the expansion of the ‘School Meal Programme’.
Federal Secretary Education Nadeem Mahbub said all endorsed and approved projects would receive final ratification from the Education Emergency Task Force chaired by the prime minister. He also invited provinces to benefit from the federal board’s reform programme and stressed the need to align matriculation and inter-tech programmes with global standards.
PIE DG Dr Muhammad Shahid Saroya informed the forum that the National Action Plan was developed over six months of stakeholder consultations to address the challenge of 25 million out-of-school children.
The conference concluded with the unanimous approval of several key agenda items, including technical education initiatives presented by DG FED Syed Junaid Akhlaq, the Education Emergency Task Force terms of reference, a data regime by PIE, modern curriculum reforms by Director NCC Tabassum Naz, and a character-building strategy presented by Chairman National Rahmatul-lil-Aalameen Authority Khurshid Ahmed Nadeem.
In his closing remarks, Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui congratulated stakeholders on the successful conduct of the conference, calling it a milestone in national harmony. He said the participation of all federal units on one platform reflected a strong commitment to overcoming educational challenges.
He added that sustaining this coordination is essential to meeting evolving global standards, noting that informal education, outreach to remote areas and the mainstreaming of madrasa students remain key priorities.

Yet I have come to recognise another dimension: airports often capture the essence of the society that built them. 
Earlier in October, I booked my flight from Berlin to Karachi after completing my postgraduation in Germany. This was not my first time travelling the Berlin-Doha-Karachi route and, like every time, I looked forward to my three-hour layover at the Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar. 
DOHA’S DOUBLE-EDGED LUXURY
A brief stay at this airport feels like a delight for the senses; an artificial tropical garden, endless dining options and other curated attractions look like something from a fairytale. 
I realise that my liking sits at odds with my sociological leanings. The Doha airport represents all that I dislike about the region’s neoliberal culture: hyper-consumerism, late-stage capitalism and an undue fixation on aesthetics. 
Yet the airport’s commercial excess coexists with a highly efficient service apparatus. The wait times at immigration and baggage claim in Doha are virtually nonexistent. It is difficult not to appreciate the passenger experience, but anyone critical of the neoliberal paradigm is forced to confront certain questions: who built these terminals, who cleans the facilities, and who helps achieve such a high level of service? 

What do airports reveal about the societies that build them? Comparing Doha’s opulent excess, Berlin’s democratic modesty and Karachi’s perpetual stagnation offers unexpected insights

The answer is clear: migrant workers from South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa form the backbone of Gulf infrastructure. They work long hours constructing these expansive environments, while living under conditions marked by vulnerability, if not outright abuse.
In 2022, the kafala [sponsorship] system, which tied workers’ legal status to their employers, was officially abolished in Qatar. Nevertheless, the overall labour rights conditions are still far from adequate. The large migration of workers from other countries also speaks to a reality about where they come from: the lack of employment opportunities and survival options available to Pakistanis, Indians, Filipinos and Ethiopians compel them to migrate to the Gulf.  
BERLIN’S OLD SCHOOL
In contrast to Doha airport, Berlin’s Brandenburg Airport, though modern and efficient, is considerably smaller, with fewer shops and only two or three dining options per terminal. Just like its airport, there is certainly nothing in Berlin approaching the scale of luxury found in Gulf megacities. 
My two years as a student in Berlin surprised me on several fronts: remarkably few shopping malls, dated infrastructure and the metropolis seemed to be perpetually under construction, with dug-up roads and building sites scattered across neighbourhoods. 
Local friends explained that this was due to long-delayed government development projects, as a result of which fibre-optic cables were only now being laid beneath the city. For me, this reflected Germany’s adherence to older systems and strict bureaucracy.
The story of Brandenburg Airport has parallels to these characteristics: the airport, which was scheduled to open in 2012, missed seven scheduled opening dates and finally opened in 2020. 
Yet Berlin’s pace of modernisation isn’t just about the challenges of the scale of reconstruction. The city residents, too, have made a choice. Time and again, they have resisted the capitalist development model that prioritises profit over public access. 
REFLECTION AND COMPARISON
Unlike Gulf cities, Berlin resists excessive consumerism. Leisure isn’t gatekept by wealth: museums offer free entry days, galleries and exhibitions operate on donation, making cultural participation possible. 
The political systems of the two regions come into play here. As a strong democracy, the German state, which charges high taxes from its citizens, is also accountable to them. Gulf states, as described by UK-based Adam Hanieh, the author of Capitalism and Class in the Gulf States, operate as capitalist monarchies. By channelling their oil wealth into urban development, the ruling regimes have successfully built tourist economies, cultivated international investment hubs and, most recently, expanded toward knowledge economies.
Without elections or citizen-funded taxes, accountability does not operate through the public. Instead, the state strictly regulates chosen domains: food businesses face hefty fines for violations, littering incurs penalties. The resulting order and efficiency create comfortable conditions, selectively benefitting white-collar expats and wealthy natives. 
HOMECOMING REALITIES
When I landed at the airport of my home city after a 12-hour journey, I was overcome with nostalgia for a few seconds, as Karachi is the city where I spent my early childhood. 
But as my nostalgia faded, I felt the contrast between Karachi airport and any other international airport, including those of Doha and Berlin. The infrastructure was dated and the stores felt like relics of a bygone era. I saw my suitcase after nearly an hour of waiting, although there were only three flights at 7am on a Saturday. 
Why does the transport hub of Pakistan’s largest city feel frozen in time? What has prevented its renovation or the construction of a contemporary facility? Jinnah Airport, which opened in 1992, has remained unchanged since its founding. It is, in many ways, a microcosm of Karachi itself: perpetually stuck between what it actually is and what it struggles to become. 
Major governance challenges dominate Karachi’s urban landscape, where crumbling infrastructure frequently results in life-threatening accidents. Unchecked projects are often abandoned with little consequence. A clear blame rests on the shoulders of negligent authorities, but it is no less true that the general public in Karachi also suffers from an almost criminal lack of civic sense. 
Yet for all its flaws, Karachi is a city whose capacity to receive, absorb and sustain people from all walks of life is remarkable. Home to at least 21 million people, Karachi has, for generations, accepted people from across Pakistan. Punjabis, Pakhtuns, Sindhis, Baloch, Mohajirs, and Bengalis have all found their way here to seek opportunity, refuge, or simply to survive, and the city has given them space to build lives, however precarious.  
much said about the need for Pakistan to have an international-standard airport, there is a story to be told about the new Islamabad airport, too. When it was opened in 2018, the Islamabad International Airport, described as ‘world-class’ and ‘state-of-the-art’, was a celebration for Pakistanis. After years of unpleasant experiences at the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport, the consensus was that Islamabad deserves a transportation facility that offers, at the very least, a positive first impression of the capital city. 
Admittedly, the new airport is a significant step up from its predecessor; it is much larger, better-designed and more efficient. Yet one cannot help but notice the substandard quality of construction and other characteristics that fall short of qualifying it as a truly ‘world-class’ airport. The roofs have a tendency to leak when it rains and the elevators accommodate barely four passengers. 
A 2025 case study by Dr Bilal Karim, Engr Muhammad Arif and Engr Zafar Ali Khan deemed the airport a “project success” for meeting budget and schedule, but a “business failure” for missing air traffic projections. I contend it fails as a project, too. Aesthetically, the truck art offers a slight saving grace, as it shows an appreciation of the creative labour of local painters and calligraphers.  
With ample to complain about on the infrastructural front, in truth, my relationship with Karachi — my birthplace — and Islamabad, where I’ve lived, is more fundamental in shaping how I feel about their respective airports. Many hellos and goodbyes have been said here, and my associations are about personal memories, and significant life moments more than anything else.
So yes, I’m still an airport person — though the term now encompasses many different meanings.
