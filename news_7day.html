On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.
On July 31 this year, an ATC in Faisalabad sentenced PTI leaders, including Gul, to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the riots. The Election Commission of Pakistan later disqualified her and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions. Chaudhry was convicted in another May 9 case by an ATC in Lahore on July 22 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Gul filed an appeal against her conviction and sentencing in the LHC today. A division bench of the LHC will hear the case on Monday.
The appeal was filed through Gul’s lawyers, Barrister Ali Zafar and Muhammad Hussain, and pleaded the court to set aside her conviction and acquit her in the case.
It said that Gul was not nominated in the case or “found physically participant in the occurrence”. It added that no justification was provided by the prosecution for her being included through the supplementary statement, which it claimed cast doubt on the authenticity of the occurrence which had not been considered at the trial stage.
It stated that the ATC passed the “impugned judgment … in a hasty and slipshod manner”, based on three witnesses who had admitted in cross-examination that they had not nominated her but she was nevertheless convicted on their statements with a hefty punishment.
“The prosecution has failed to make out a case for such a punishment,” the petition argued, adding that the witnesses themselves had many times misstated and “cheated” the trial court with additions and deletions in their statements making their testimonies unreliable, but ultimately all exonerated the appellant.
“The other ATC court at Sargodha has disbelieved the same prosecution witnesses … but this is ignored in making (the) impugned decision,” it said.
It also stated that no evidence for conspiracy had been brought forward on the case file, challenging her punishment under section 120-B of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The petition pleaded that as “the prosecution also failed to establish the involvement of the appellant in the occurrence and instigation/abetment beyond the shadow of doubt, then there were no reasons to award punishment to the innocent appellant.”
It stated that the judgment was against “facts and law and resulted in (a) misreading of justice” and that, being passed hastily, material parts of evidence were not considered “despite the facts that the prosecution failed to adduce unimpeachable evidence and there was (every) chance of false implication”.
In particular, it cited the lack of material evidence to establish the intention to abet, instigate and conspire to facilitate the other accused parties. According to the petition, the investigation was “biased” and “flawed” but this was ignored by the court. It further criticised that more weight was given to witness statements than evidence by the court, failing to “properly appreciate” the prosecution’s evidence.
It added that 77 co-accused had been acquitted based on the same evidence, while Gul was convicted without valid reasoning.
The petition called for the judgment to be set aside as the case had not been proven “beyond the shadow of a doubt” due to a lack of unimpeachable evidence, adding that the evidence contained contradictions. It called the judgment of the court “arbitrary, capricious, indiscrete, non-speaking and without lawful authority based on no evidence”.
The petition noted that Gul was seeking leave from the court to advance further grounds at the time of argument.
Meanwhile, Chaudhry filed two petitions in the LHC through Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq.
Chaudhry pleaded the court to suspend his sentence and conviction, along with ordering his release on bail.
He further requested the court in the second petition to set aside his conviction and acquit him in the case in the “interest of justice”.
ATC reserves verdicts on two May 9 cases involving Chaudhry, Rashid, Qureshi, others
Separately, the Lahore ATC reserved its verdicts in two arson cases related to the May 9 riots, in which PTI senior leaders Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Chaudhry and Omar Cheema are accused, with the judge slated to announce the decisions on August 11.
According to Advocates Rana Mudassar and Rana Maroof, who represented the PTI leaders during the hearing, the trials in the cases of burning vehicles outside Rahat Bakery and arson near Shadman Nazar were completed and ATC Judge Manzar Ali Gul reserved his verdict.
“The trials for both cases were completed today; the verdicts will be issued on August 11,” the lawyers said.
“A total of 25 accused have been named in the [Rahat Bakery] case, while seven accused have been declared absconders,” they added. “The trial of 12 accused has been completed in the Shadman Nazar police station arson case. Five accused are in custody in this case, while one accused has died.
“Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Omar Sarfaraz Cheema and Mian Mahmoodur Rashid and other accused were present in the courtroom,” the lawyers said.
Mudassar argued on behalf of Qureshi and Rashid, while Maroof argued on behalf of Cheema.</p><small>2025-08-09 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/09223351125aee5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929782/tony-hemming-resigns-as-pakistan-cricket-boards-chief-curator' target='_blank'><strong>Tony Hemming resigns as Pakistan Cricket Board’s chief curator</strong></a><br><p>Australia’s Tony Hemming has resigned from his position as the chief curator, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Saturday.
He was appointed as chief curator in July last year as no extension was given to previous chief curator Agha Zahid.
“One of Hemming’s immediate tasks will be to prepare pitches for the upcoming five ICC World Test Championship matches against Bangladesh [two in August/September] and England [three in October]. Hemming will also oversee pitch preparations for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, which Pakistan will host from Feb 19 to March 9,” the PCB had said at the time.
“Hemming is a highly respected curator with nearly four decades of experience. He has worked at various iconic cricket grounds in Australia, including Melbourne, Perth and Tasmania, as well as in countries such as Bangladesh, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where he was the ICC Head Curator from 2007 to 2017 in Dubai.
“During his time with the ICC, Hemming also oversaw pitch preparation at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, which was one of Pakistan’s home [series] venues between 2009 and 2019,” the PCB statement had further said.</p><small>2025-08-09 17:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/09223537c836335.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929778/four-astronauts-home-from-space-station-after-successful-splashdown' target='_blank'><strong>Four astronauts home from space station after successful splashdown</strong></a><br><p>An international crew of four astronauts returned home on Earth on Saturday after nearly five months aboard the International Space Station, returning safely in a SpaceX capsule.
The spacecraft carrying US astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov splashed down off California’s coast at 8:44am local time (8:34pm PKT).
Their return marks the end of the 10th crew rotation mission to the space station under Nasa’s Commercial Crew Program, which was created to succeed the Space Shuttle era by partnering with private industry.
The Dragon capsule of billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX company detached from the International Space Station (ISS) at 2215 GMT (3:15am PKT) on Friday.
The capsule’s dizzying, 17-hour drop back down to Earth was slowed when it re-entered the atmosphere, then further reined in by the deployment of huge parachutes.
After the capsule splashed down, it was recovered by a SpaceX ship and hoisted aboard. Only then were the astronauts able to breathe Earth’s air again, for the first time in months.
The astronaut team, known as Crew-10, conducted numerous scientific experiments during their time on the space station, including studying plant growth and how cells react to gravity.
Their launch into space in March allowed two US astronauts to return home after being unexpectedly stuck on board the space station for nine months.
When they launched in June 2024, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were only supposed to spend eight days in space on a test of the Boeing Starliner’s first crewed flight.
However, the spaceship developed propulsion problems and was deemed unfit to fly back, leaving them stranded in space.
Nasa announced this week that Wilmore has decided to retire after 25 years of service at the US space agency.
Last week, US astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan’s Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov boarded the ISS for a six-month mission.</p><small>2025-08-09 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/091809267c52864.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929745/defence-minister-rubbishes-indian-air-chiefs-comical-claims-of-downing-6-pakistani-aircraft-in-may-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Defence minister rubbishes Indian air chief’s ‘comical’ claims of downing 6 Pakistani aircraft in May conflict</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday rubbished what he said were “implausible” and “comical” claims by the Indian Air Force chief that the country had shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other military aircraft during clashes in May.
The comments are the first such statement by the Indian side three months after its worst military conflict in decades with its neighbour. During the conflict, Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7, later stating that figure as six. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
Speaking at an event in the southern city of Bengaluru, Indian Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh claimed: “We have at least five fighters confirmed killed, and one large aircraft,” adding that the large aircraft, which could be a surveillance plane, was shot down at a distance of 300 kilometres.
He alleged that most of the Pakistani aircraft were downed by India’s Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system. He cited electronic tracking data as confirmation of the strikes.
 






Singh did not mention the type of fighter jets that were downed, but claimed that airstrikes also hit an additional surveillance plane and “a few F16” fighters that were parked in hangars at two air bases in Sindh and Punjab. “This is actually the largest ever recorded surface-to-air kill,” he insisted.
Responding to the claims in a post on X, the defence minister said: “The belated assertions made by the Indian Air Force chief regarding alleged destruction of Pakistani aircraft during Operation Sindoor are as implausible as they are ill-timed.
“It is also ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians. For three months, no such claims were voiced — while Pakistan, in the immediate aftermath, presented detailed technical briefings to the international media, and independent observers recorded widespread acknowledgment of the loss of multiple Indian aircraft, including Rafales, by sources ranging from world leaders, senior Indian politicians to foreign intelligence assessments.”
Asif said that “not a single Pakistani aircraft was hit or destroyed” by India, adding that Pakistan took out six Indian jets, S400 air defence batteries and unmanned aircraft of India while “swiftly putting several Indian airbases out of action”.
 






He added that the losses on the Line of Control for Indian armed forces were “disproportionately heavier” as well.
“If the truth is in question, let both sides open their aircraft inventories to independent verification — though we suspect this would lay bare the reality India seeks to obscure. Wars are not won by falsehoods but by moral authority, national resolve and professional competence.
“Such comical narratives, crafted for domestic political expediency, increase the grave risks of strategic miscalculation in a nuclearised environment,” he warned.
The defence minister iterated that every violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity would invite “swift, surefire and proportionate response, and responsibility for any ensuing escalation will rest entirely with strategically blind leaders who gamble with South Asia’s peace for fleeting political gains”.
Former envoy Dr Maleeha Lodhi said the Indian air chief’s claim was “laughable”, noting that it took him “several months to count the planes to make this ridiculous assertion!”
 






Meanwhile, Indian Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said when questioned about the matter: “The question we have after today’s information … when we had such a strong army and we were advancing then under whose pressure did you stop Operation Sindoor?”
 






American South Asia expert Michael Kugelman opined that “regardless of whether true or not, the timing of these claims, with US-India ties in crisis, is easy to understand.”
 






Pakistan, with the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) primarily operating Chinese-made jets and US F-16s, has previously denied that India downed any aircraft during the May 7-10 fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
New Delhi had previously claimed it had downed “a few planes”. United States President Donald Trump has echoed the figure of “five jets” shot down during the military confrontation, albeit without specifying which side’s craft he was referring to.
 
 

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has faced scathing criticism from opposition parties for its lack of “political will to fight” during the May clashes and “failures” to prevent the Pahalgam attack.
The May conflict was sparked by New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, which were without evidence and strongly refuted by Pakistan, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. After the May 7 combat and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
France’s air chief, General Jerome Bellanger, has previously said that he has seen evidence of the loss of three Indian fighters, including a Rafale. The Indian Air Force has not commented on those claims.
Days after the air combat, The Washington Post, based on visual evidence analysed by experts, reported that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.
According to The Wire, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, while speaking at a seminar in June, acknowledged that the PAF downed the Indian fighters.
During his presentation at the event, Kumar had acknowledged the loss of Indian planes. According to Kumar, Indian fighter jets were “operating under strict political orders from the Modi government not to target Pakistani military installations or air defence systems”, The Wire reported.
“This self-imposed limitation by the government was intended to prevent escalation of conflict in a nuclear environment,” the outlet added, quoting the Indian officer.
India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle between Pakistan and India, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force’s J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a report.
Reuters interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn’t the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.
The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15’s export variant.
“We ambushed them,” the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi’s systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.
“The Indians were not expecting to be shot at,” said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London’s Royal United Services Institute think-tank. “And the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.” The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.</p><small>2025-08-09 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0918193943d7125.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929759/ecnec-approves-100mw-solar-power-project-for-gilgit-baltistan' target='_blank'><strong>Ecnec approves 100MW solar power project for Gilgit-Baltistan</strong></a><br><p>The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council approved a 100 megawatt solar photovoltaic power project for Gilgit-Baltistan, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Saturday.
It added that formal work on the project would now commence. The prime minister had announced during his recent visit to GB that Ecnec would soon approve the 100MW power plants.
The report said that Central Development Working Party had already approved the project and it would benefit the districts of Astore, Darel, Tangir, Diamer, Ghanche, Ghizer, Gilgit, Hunza, Ishkoman, Nagar, Roundu, Skardu and Shigar.
It added that Skardu district would be provided with 18.96MW of electricity in the first phase; the districts of Hunza, Gilgit and Diamer would be supplied with 6MW, 28MW and 13MW of electricity, respectively, in the second phase and the remaining districts would receive 16.1MW of electricity in the third phase.
The project is set to be completed within three years at a total cost of Rs24,957 million.
In June, protest demonstrations were held in several areas of GB against massive loadshedding and power outages — leading to blockades on main roads and the Karakoram Highway. The issue was raised in the GB Assembly by opposition lawmakers, who said the crisis has made life unbearable for people.</p><small>2025-08-09 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/09132240eea0739.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929735/armenia-azerbaijan-truce-pakistan-again-hails-trumps-efforts-for-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Armenia-Azerbaijan truce: Pakistan again hails Trump’s efforts for peace</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President Donald Trump’s peace efforts following his role in brokering the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal.
A day earlier, Azerbaijan and Armenia signed an initial US-brokered peace agreement during a meeting with Trump, a deal aimed at boosting economic ties between the two countries after decades of conflict.
“Pakistan welcomes the historic peace agreement signed between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia at the White House Summit under the auspices of US President Donald J Trump,” the premier wrote in a statement on X.
He congratulated both countries on “charting a course for a peaceful future for their region”, stating: “Pakistan has always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan and we stand with them at this proud moment of their history.”
PM Shehbaz continued: “We also appreciate the facilitation role of the United States, under President Donald Trump, in bringing the two sides together and securing an agreement that opens new avenues for trade, connectivity, and regional integration.”
“It is our hope that this spirit of dialogue will serve as an example for other regions facing protracted conflicts,” he added.
He also said that the development marks the “dawn of a new era of peace, stability, and cooperation in the South Caucasus”, which has endured “conflict and human suffering” for decades.
 






Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also appreciated Trump’s role in “facilitating this breakthrough” and congratulated Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov.
In a post on X, he wrote, “Today marks a truly historic moment as Azerbaijan and Armenia take a decisive step towards resolving a bitter conflict that has lasted for over three decades.
“May this milestone pave the way in the Caucasus for a future free of the painful shadows of the past, and one built on peace, stability, and hope,” he added.
 






Highest aspiration is to bring peace: Trump
Separately, Trump said that both countries were “committing to stop all fighting forever, open up commerce, travel and diplomatic relations, and respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, while speaking to reporters alongside Azerbaijan’s Aliyev and Armenian PM Nikol Pashinyan.
Trump said the US signed separate deals with each country to expand cooperation on energy, trade and technology, including artificial intelligence. Details were not released.
Both leaders praised Trump for helping to end the conflict and said they would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize.
 


Trump has tried to present himself as a global peacemaker in the first months of his second term. The White House credits him with brokering a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand and sealing peace deals between India and Pakistan, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Following the announcement, Trump stated: “As president, my highest aspiration is to bring peace and stability to the world.”
“Today’s signing follows our success with India and Pakistan. They were going at it. They were going at it big. And, they were great leaders that came together just prior to what would have been a tremendous conflict, a nuclear conflict probably.”
Meanwhile, Russia said that the draft peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan was “positive” and that it hoped it would contribute to the peace in the Caucasus region bordering it.
“The meeting of the leaders of the South Caucasus republics in Washington, mediated by the American side, deserves a positive assessment. We hope that this step will help advance the peace agenda,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
Trump has repeatedly claimed — in contrast to India’s stance — that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between India and Pakistan following their most intense military confrontation in decades.
Tensions between the two countries escalated after the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly denied the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before a ceasefire on May 10.</p><small>2025-08-09 14:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/09172745451df98.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929757/thai-soldiers-injured-by-landmine-near-cambodia-amid-fragile-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Thai soldiers injured by landmine near Cambodia amid fragile ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Three Thai soldiers were injured by a landmine on Saturday while patrolling a border area near Cambodia, the Thai army said in a statement, days after the two neighbours agreed to a detailed ceasefire following a violent five-day conflict last month.
One soldier lost a foot and two others were injured after one of them stepped on a landmine as they patrolled an area between Thailand’s Sisaket and Cambodia’s Preah Vihear provinces.
“The soldiers are being treated at a hospital,” the army said.
Thailand said the incident took place within its territory and in an area recently cleared of landmines. It added that it would lodge a complaint against Cambodia for violating a treaty that bans the use of landmines and for infringing Thai sovereignty, the Thai foreign ministry said in a statement.
Both Thailand and Cambodia are signatories to the Ottawa Convention against landmines.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that it “has yet to receive clear confirmation from Cambodian frontline forces concerning the explosion”, adding that its army has been strictly respecting the spirit of the ceasefire.
The incident is the third time in a few weeks that Thai soldiers have been injured by mines while patrolling along the border. Two previous incidents led to the downgrading of diplomatic relations and triggered five days of violent clashes.
 
 

The Southeast Asian neighbours were engaged in deadly border clashes from July 24-28, in the worst fighting between the two in more than a decade. The exchanges of artillery fire and jet fighter sorties claimed at least 43 lives and left over 300,000 people displaced on both sides.
A fragile ceasefire has been holding since Thailand and Cambodia agreed on Thursday to allow observers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to inspect disputed border areas to ensure hostilities do not resume.
Bangkok earlier accused Cambodia of planting landmines on the Thai side of the disputed border that injured soldiers on July 16 and July 23. Phnom Penh denied it had placed any new mines and said the soldiers had veered off agreed routes and triggered old landmines left from its decades of war.</p><small>2025-08-09 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/09132053aa11271.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929740/zelensky-warns-on-decisions-without-ukraine-before-us-russia-summit' target='_blank'><strong>Zelensky warns on ‘decisions without Ukraine’ before US-Russia summit</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday warned that “decisions without Ukraine” would not bring peace and ruled out ceding territory to Russia.
“Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier,” he said on social media, as United States President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare to hold a summit next week in Alaska to discuss peace in Ukraine.
“Any decisions against us, any decisions without Ukraine, are also decisions against peace. They will achieve nothing,” he said, adding that the war “cannot be ended without us, without Ukraine”.
Zelensky said Ukraine was “ready for real decisions that can bring peace” but said it should be a “dignified peace”, without giving details.
 






Later, Zelensky wrote in a post on X that he exchanged views on a “diplomatic solution” to the conflict with French President Emmanuel Macron.
Expressing gratitude for France’s support, the Ukrainian leader wrote: “Ukraine, France, and all our partners are ready to work as productively as possible for the sake of real peace.
“It is truly important that the Russians do not succeed in deceiving anyone again. We all need a genuine end to the war and reliable security foundations for Ukraine and other European nations.”
 






Tens of thousands of people have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with millions forced to flee their homes.
Three rounds of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine this year have failed to bear fruit, and it remains unclear whether a summit would bring peace any closer.
Putin has resisted multiple calls from the United States, Europe and Kyiv for a ceasefire.
He has also ruled out holding talks with Zelensky at this stage, a meeting the Ukrainian president says is necessary to make headway on a deal.
Announcing the summit with Putin on Friday, Trump said that “there’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both” Ukraine and Russia, without providing further details.
 
 

The Alaska summit on August 15 would be the first between sitting US and Russian presidents since Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva in June 2021.
Trump and Putin last sat together in 2019 at a G20 summit meeting in Japan during Trump’s first term. They have spoken by telephone several times since January.</p><small>2025-08-09 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/09165638102755b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929748/modis-efforts-to-woo-us-china-hit-stalemate-after-frictions-with-trump-xi-report' target='_blank'><strong>Modi’s efforts to woo US, China hit stalemate after frictions with Trump, Xi: report</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to engage with the US and China have reached a stalemate, which exposes limitations to India’s powers on the global stage, The New York Times reported.
Modi’s first attempt came in 2014 through a high-level engagement with China came. The Indian premier rolled out the red carpet for China’s President Xi Jinping in his home town, organising an intimate riverside dinner in Ahmedabad.
The meeting at the time focused on economic cooperation, with India seeking Chinese funding for an overhaul of its dilapidated railways and cooperation in nuclear energy.
However, the talks were overshadowed by a stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops along their shared border. “The flare-up in 2014 was the first of several acts of aggression that would ultimately leave Mr Modi embarrassed, his economy squeezed by the need to keep tens of thousands of Indian troops on a war footing high in the Himalayas for several years,” The New York Times said.
Subsequently, Modi steered towards the US direction. “Mr Modi developed such a bonhomie with US President Donald Trump in his first term that he broke with protocol to campaign for a second term for him at a stadium-packed event in Houston,” the outlet said, adding that the increasing alignment grew further after “the Biden administration looked past that partisan play to continue expanding relations with India, a bulwark against China”.
During a joint session of Congress last year, Modi remarked, “AI stands for ‘America and India’”, the report added.
India’s relations with the US have seemingly faltered during Trump’s second term.  Terming the recent trade tensions a “very public humiliation” of Modi, the outlet said that India was singled out for a whopping 50 per cent tariff, with the US citing India’s continued imports of Russian oil and calling India’s economy “dead”.
Trump also “stirred rancour among Indians” by giving Pakistan’s leadership an “equal footing” as he tried to settle the military conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours earlier this year, the outlet said.
In June, Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir at the White House in the weeks following the military confrontation between India and Pakistan. This prompted a private diplomatic protest from India in a warning to Washington about risks to their bilateral ties while New Delhi is recalibrating relations with China as a hedge.
“All that has plunged India into a moment of soul-searching, exposing limitations to its power on the world stage despite its gargantuan size and growing economy,” The New York Times stated. The outlet also highlighted Modi’s acknowledgement this week that he might pay a “personal political price” for the trade dispute with the US.
Amid heightened tensions with the US, India has made moves indicating “increased activity toward warming ties with Beijing again”, the outlet said.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Friday welcomed Modi’s plan to visit China for the first time in seven years to participate in the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Last month, Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar made his first visit to Beijing since a deadly 2020 border clash between Indian and Chinese troops.
The outlet suggested that relations with China “remain strained” due to border disputes and China’s support for Pakistan during the recent military escalation, adding: “China, for its part, has been wary of New Delhi’s efforts to create a manufacturing alternative to China.”
It further noted Modi’s current engagement with Russia, saying, “Russia’s steadfastness as a partner is being talked up by officials in India. Mr Modi’s national security adviser was in Moscow this week to finalise details of a trip by Mr Putin to New Delhi.”
India’s aim to rise as an economic and diplomatic power “appears deflated by the sudden uncertainty”, according to The New York Times.
It said, “Stuck between two superpowers that have shown no hesitation to put India down in moments of friction, there is a growing sense among Indian officials and experts that the country will have to firmly return to its long-tested doctrine of ‘strategic autonomy’.”
This means that India was “on its own” and must “make do with a patchwork of contradictory and piecemeal ties, and avoid overcommitting to alliances”.
The outlet quoted Nirupama Rao, a former Indian ambassador to Beijing and Washington, who said that Trump’s punishing moves had upended “the strategic logic of a very consequential partnership” that had been carefully nurtured over more than two decades. “There will be ‘very pragmatic strategic recalibrations’ by New Delhi to protect its interests,” she said.
India’s growing economy allows its leaders breathing room, but it is still a moment of “deep introspection” for the country, Rao said, adding: “We have to draw our lessons from that and really focus on the national priorities and what we need to do to become strong and more influential.”</p><small>2025-08-09 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/09161208e2bd43c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929749/three-wounded-in-new-york-times-square-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Three wounded in New York Times Square shooting</strong></a><br><p>Three people were shot and wounded in New York’s Times Square, the New York Police Department said on Saturday.
The people — an 18 year-old female, 19 year-old male, and a 65 year-old male - are in a stable condition in hospital, an NYPD spokesperson said.
A 17-year-old male is in custody, the NYPD added. The police also recovered a firearm.
The shooting took place at around 1:20am ET (10:20am PKT) and followed a verbal altercation with one of the victims, the NYPD added. It said it was not known at this time whether the shooter or the victims knew each other.
Mass shootings are relatively common in the United States, where guns are widely available.
The incident at one of New York’s most iconic tourist spots comes after July’s high-profile shooting in a Manhattan office tower, which left four people dead, including a senior Blackstone executive and an NYPD officer.
New York experienced record-low shooting incidents and victims in the first seven months of this year, and in July, according to a statement published by the city’s police department on August 4.

The development adds to 33 terrorists, belonging to the “Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij”, who were eliminated on the night of August 7 and 8.
“On [the] night 8/9 August 2025, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Sambaza along Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.
“During the conduct of the operation, 14 more Indian-sponsored khwarij were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed khwarij,” the ISPR noted.
 
 

This followed the “successful engagements by the security forces in general area Sambaza, Zhob District on 7-8 August 2025, during which 33 khwarij were sent to hell”.
“The number of khwarij killed in two days anti-infiltration operation has risen to 47,” the military highlighted.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“The security forces remain committed to secure the nation’s frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan,” the statement asserted.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the security forces and praised their professionalism.
“The nation looks with admiration at the successes of the security forces against the terrorists of the Indian conspiracy. The security forces have brought the Indian-sponsored terrorists involved in spreading chaos in Balochistan to an exemplary end,” he said in a post on X.
He added, “Security forces, through timely operations, sent 47 terrorists of Fitna al-Hindu­stan to hell in two days. By taking swift action, they foiled a sinister conspiracy to sabotage peace in Balochistan.”
In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
 






Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
Last month, security forces killed three terrorists, while two security personnel, including an army major, embraced martyrdom during an intelligence-based military operation in Mastung district.
It followed two separate military operations in Kalat district, where a total of eight terrorists, belonging to the Indian proxy, Fitna al-Hindustan, were killed.</p><small>2025-08-09 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/090901263c3e587.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929727/hasan-nawaz-sparks-pakistan-to-5-wicket-odi-win-over-west-indies' target='_blank'><strong>Hasan Nawaz sparks Pakistan to 5-wicket ODI win over West Indies</strong></a><br><p>Hasan Nawaz made a triumphant one-day international (ODI) debut, going 63 not out on Friday to power Pakistan over the West Indies by five wickets in their ODI series opener.
Nawaz and Hussain Talat formed a sixth-wicket partnership of 104 not out to rally the visitors in the day-night affair, with game two on Sunday and the final ODI on Tuesday.
West Indies went 280 all out with Evin Lewis leading the way on 60 from 62 balls with three sixes and five fours, while Shai Hope added 55 and Roston Chase contributed 53.
Needing 281 to win, Pakistan got 53 runs from Mohammad Rizwan before he was bowled lbw by Shamar Joseph in the 38th over with the visitors still 101 runs shy of victory, setting the stage for heroics by Nawaz and Talat.
Nawaz struck for six on the second ball of the 49th over and blasted the winning shot to the boundary off the final delivery by Joseph, giving Pakistan the victory with seven balls to spare.
In all, Nawaz reached 63 on 54 balls with three sixes and five fours while Talat finished on 41 from 37 balls with one six and four fours.
 


Pakistan won the toss and sent the hosts in to bat first, a choice that paid quick dividends when Brandon King was taken for four on the fifth ball of the opening over, bowled by Shaheen Shah Afridi — his first of four wickets — and caught by Babar Azam.
Lewis exited on the last ball of the 19th over, bowled by Saim Ayub and caught by Afridi.
West Indies captain Hope got out to a delivery by Afridi and was caught by Rizwan on the second ball of the 41st over, leaving the hosts on 200 for five.
Romario Shepherd was sent off on four on the last ball of the 43rd over.
Chase made the third half-century for the West Indies with a boundary but went out on the next ball, caught by Babar and bowled by Naseem Shah, who also bowled out Gudakesh Motie and Jediah Blades on the last two Pakistan deliveries.

The PMDC is the national statutory organisation responsible for regulating the standards of medical and dental education throughout the country.
In a press release today, PMDC announced that the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test (MDCAT) was scheduled to be held on Sunday October 5, while addressing the concerns regarding the fee.
“It has come to the notice of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) that there has been a misunderstanding regarding the MDCAT examination fee, which claims that it has increased by 80pc,” it said.
“PMDC would like to clarify that the fee for the MDCAT has increased modestly and gradually over the past years,” it added, noting that it was Rs8,000 in 2024 and is set at Rs9,000 for 2025 — the Rs1,000 increase marking an increment of only 12.5pc, not 80pc as had been circulated on social media.
It also said that the exam would be conducted by universities nominated by federal and provincial authorities, rather than by PMDC.
“However, PMDC as a regulator has developed a uniform syllabus for the MDCAT in consultation with all stakeholders,” it said, adding that it had also “invested heavily” in developing a question bank based on a common syllabus agreed upon by the provinces.
According to the statement, the council’s decision to revise the fee upon the request of the examination-conducting universities was due to the rising costs of paper printing, enhanced security protocols and logistical arrangements, as well as payments for examiners, invigilators, and administrative staff and to ensure adequate seating and facilities for candidates.
“Despite significant inflation and increasing operational costs, PMDC remains steadfast to affordability and fairness,” PMDC said, stressing that the council had taken a “balanced approach to ensure that the exam remains accessible to all candidates while maintaining quality and integrity in the testing process”.
It reaffirmed its commitment to “transparent, responsible, and merit-based admissions” to ensure equal opportunities for all aspiring medical and dental students.
The MDCAT will be conducted through the following universities: University of Health Sciences, Lahore for Punjab; Sukkur IBA University, Sukkur for Sindh; Khyber Medical University, Peshawar for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Bolan University of Medical and Health Sciences, Quetta for Balochistan; and Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University, Islamabad for Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan as well as PMDC’s international venue in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Online registration for both local and international MDCAT candidates began yesterday and will close on August 25, 2025. After this date, late fees will be required for registration until the cutoff on September 1, 2025.
 
 

PMDC warned that candidates would have to “carefully select one city/centre for the MDCAT and fill out the application with all necessary requirements” otherwise the application would be rejected by the online system.
The statement added that the test would be a paper-based exam conducted in English, comprising 180 multiple choice questions with no negative marking. Of the 180 questions, 81 will be about biology, 45 chemistry, 36 physics, nine English, and nine logical reasoning.
It directed candidates to the exam’s syllabus available on their website, advising that candidates must complete their registration through mdcat.pmdc.pk. It warned that incomplete applications would not be accepted.
In June, the PMDC issued a decision to restrict MDCAT candidates to their respective provinces, sparking controversy as parents feared the decision could compromise the safety and well-being of students, many of whom had seldom traveled to their native areas.
The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA), the representative body of doctors, rejected the decision, demanding that the notification be withdrawn. The PMA argued that the policy would disproportionately disadvantage students from less developed areas and limit accessibility to medical education.</p><small>2025-08-09 10:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/091302411b9eb96.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929736/altaf-hussain-discharged-from-london-hospital-after-chest-infection' target='_blank'><strong>Altaf Hussain discharged from London hospital after ‘chest infection’</strong></a><br><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain was discharged from a London hospital in the early hours of Saturday after being admitted for a second time in a month, a party leader said.
The MQM founder was last hospitalised in London on July 10 due to “severe illness”. After undergoing multiple tests and blood transfusions, he was discharged on July 23.
Hussain was allowed to leave the hospital at 12:30am GMT (5:30am PKT) today after being treated in its emergency ward for nine hours and undergoing various tests, London-based senior MQM leader Mustafa Azizabadi said on X.
 






“After various tests, doctors diagnosed him with severe flu and a chest infection. The doctors prescribed antibiotics and other medications for Mr Altaf Hussain and advised him to take complete rest,” Azizabadi said.
Detailing Hussain’s hospital stay, Azizabadi noted the MQM founder “underwent a blood test, [electrocardiography], chest X-ray, and monitoring of oxygen levels”.
“Hussain has expressed his gratitude to all the workers and the public who prayed for his recovery during his illness,” Azizabadi said.
The MQM founder had also remained in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Britain, apparently after contracting Covid-19 in February 2021.
Hussain has been in self-imposed exile since 1992 and currently lives in London, where he was later granted British citizenship. From there, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.
 
 

Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.
Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third-largest party in the country.
The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation
Viewed as the man who controlled Karachi from London, Hussain came under fire in May 2013 for his televised speech across Pakistan, where he allegedly demanded the separation of Karachi from the rest of Pakistan if the public mandate of his party was not acceptable to the ‘establishment’. The party later said the statement was taken out of context.
However, the final undoing of the MQM, as it was known, came after Hussain delivered an incendiary speech in August 2016 in which he raised slogans against Pakis­tan.</p><small>2025-08-09 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/091144397cd73ab.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929636/pakistan-india-asia-cup-clash-will-go-ahead' target='_blank'><strong>‘Pakistan-India Asia Cup clash will go ahead’</strong></a><br><p>DUBAI: The Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) is confident that the high-voltage Pakistan-India clash at the Asia Cup will go ahead.
The neighbours have been at loggerheads since a terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam sparked a brief war and saw the cricketing relations between the two nations nose-dive.
Recently, two World Championship of Legends fixtures between the two countries were called off as the India Champions players decided not to play against their Pakistan counterparts.
The Asia Cup was originally scheduled to be staged in India but was shifted to the UAE due to tensions between the two countries.
India and Pakistan have been drawn in the same group at the Asia Cup. With a Super Four phase and a final to follow, it is possible they could face each other three times in Dubai between September 14 and 28.
 
 

And with just over a month remaining before the start of the tournament, ECB Chief Operating Officer Subhan Ahmed has suggested that it is highly unlikely that the two teams would avoid playing each other in the Asia Cup.
“We can’t make any guarantees, but comparing the Asia Cup against a private event like the WCL is not a like comparison,” Subhan was quoted as saying by The National newspaper.
“When decisions to play in the Asia Cup are taken, government permissions are taken in advance. That has definitely been done before arriving at the decision of announcing the schedule for the countries. So hopefully we won’t be in a situation as there was at the WCL.”

Several Indian media outlets quoted official sources on Wednesday as saying that Mr Modi would visit China for the summit, which was planned ahead of the rising tensions with the US.
In response to Indian media reports, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Friday that China welcomed Indian Prime Minister Modi to the SCO summit at Tianjin.
“We believe that with the concerted effort of all parties, the Tianjin summit will be a gathering of solidarity, friendship and fruitful results, and the SCO will enter a new stage of high-quality development featuring greater solidarity, coordination, dynamism and productiveness.”
Guo was quoted by the Global Times, a Chinese newspaper seen as close to the Communist Party, as saying that leaders of over 20 countries, including all member states of the SCO and heads of 10 international organisations, would attend “relevant events”.
The SCO summit will be the largest gathering in scale since the establishment of the SCO, he added.
On Wednesday, India Today and several other media outlets reported that Mr Modi plans to attend the SCO summit in Tianjin.
“If the visit materialises, it will mark the Indian prime minister’s first trip to China in seven years. Although the news has not yet been confirmed by the official authorities of China and India, it has drawn widespread attention from the international community as soon as it was released,” Global Times said in a commentary.
It quoted US magazine The Diplomat as commenting that “the trend in the past decade has seen the two neighbours embracing each other and then falling out … the time has come again for them to explore yet another round of engagement”.
Together, China and India account for over one-third of the world’s population, and both economies and their global influence are on the rise.
“At this crucial juncture, the trajectory of China-India relations carries even more reasons to capture global attention,” the Global Times said.
“Observers have noted that despite lingering differences and disputes between China and India, there have been signs of warming in their bilateral relations.”
Following the 2020 border clash, China-India relations went through a long period of frostiness, severely impacting political trust, economic ties and people-to-people exchanges.
Fresh restart
In October last year, the successful meeting between the Chinese and Indian leaders in Kazan set the tone for a fresh restart in bilateral relations. At all levels, both countries have been upholding the important consensus reached by the two leaders — namely, that “China and India are each other’s development opportunity rather than threat, and cooperation partner rather than competitor”.
Anchoring on development as the greatest “common denominator”, the two sides have continued to meet half way and maintain the momentum of progress.
Since June, India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar have visited China.
Currently, various previously suspended bilateral mechanisms are being resumed or are in the process of restarting, the Chinese newspaper said.
 
 

“Both sides have also vowed to not let the border issue become an obstacle to overall bilateral relations. In the area of people-to-people exchanges, the resumption of Indian pilgrimages to Mount Gang Rinpoche and Lake Mapam Yun Tso, in south-west China’s Xizang autonomous region, as well as the reinstatement of tourist visa issuance for Chinese citizens travelling to India, have all sent out positive signals.
“Both sides also hope to seize the opportunity of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties to achieve greater progress in China-India relations.
“If Modi visits China this time, it will present another favourable opportunity to consolidate the positive momentum in China-India relations,” the newspaper said.

Following the CCD raid, the MPA, who is also the parliamentary secretary in Punjab, called the police emergency helpline “15” and lodged a report against the CCD in-charge, the SHO and others.
According to sources, after the raid, matters took a turn as the MPA openly came out in defence of his employees.
The MPA claimed that the CCD raided his farmhouse with 30 officials in police uniform and 15 in plain clothes. He said four office boys were present in the house, while two other persons were at the gate.
The MPA alleged that CCD officials tortured Hamza, took cash, and took away three employees from the house.
Meanwhile, the SHO Chontra and the duty officer reached the spot after receiving the police emergency call. Official sources said the CCD team conducted the raid to arrest a highly wanted suspect in a kidnapping case involving the making of an objectionable video, which had been registered against him by a private citizen.
They added that the matter was brought to the notice of the MPA, and he was asked to surrender or present his farmhouse in-charge to the police, as a case had been registered against him under the Anti-Terrorism Act.
 
 

However, the suspect was not produced or handed over, the police said.
On Friday, the MPA’s spokesperson issued a statement along with videos of the raid, saying the CCD raided the farmhouse without conducting any investigation.
“Entering the house of any citizen without investigation and without reason is hooliganism and mischief. We reject the illegal and immoral activities of the CCD,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson further alleged that the CCD staged the raid to gain cheap publicity. He said guards from registered companies were deployed on security duty at the farmhouse, and looting cash under the pretext of a search amounted to robbery.
Later, the MPA filed a formal complaint with Regional Police Officer Babar Sarfraz Alpa, claiming that CCD officials had taken away Rs50 million from his farmhouse.

“After instituting applications for the termination of the plea bargain (deal appr­o­­ved in August 2020) betw­een Zain Malik and NAB, the references against the accused have been reverted to the preliminary  stage,” observed Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, a member of the  three-judge SC bench that had taken up the appeal against the Aug 4  short order of the Islamabad High Court.
As the IHC in its short order allowed NAB to go ahead with the auction of the six attached properties, the anti-graft watchdog sold one property and received conditional bids for two other properties, at a combined value of Rs2.27 billion.
However, the auction of three remaining properties was shelved for want of qualifying bids.

Three-member bench to hear Bahria Town appeal on regular basis from 13th

The SC decided that the appeals by Bahria Town would be fixed before any available three-judge bench of the apex court for regular hearing from Aug 13.
 
 

In its appeal, the Bahria Town contended that the IHC short order of dismissing its plea against the auction was bad in law and facts as it suffered from misreading and non-reading of the record and applicable legal provisions.
Both the Aug 4 order of the high court and the May 23 order of the accountability court were without lawful jurisdiction and in blatant violation of Section 88 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which does not authorise attachment of properties belonging to third parties, the SC was apprised.
The appellant argued that the IHC and the accountability court also failed to distinguish between the assets of the accused and those owned by a separate and independent juristic entity.

The weeklong trekking is part of the celebrations to mark the first successful ascent to the peak 75 years ago. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Culture and Tourism Authority (KPCTA) is organising the events.
Of the women trekkers, two belong to Chitral, while the rest was drawn from all the four provinces of Pakistan and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Fauzia Bibi, the board member of KPCTA, and president of tours’ operators association, Chitral, Syed Harir Shah saw the trekkers off.

A separate team of climbers plans to summit the highest peak of Hindukush range

Addressing a gathering on the occasion, Fauziz Bibi said the events would go a long way in inculcating in people of Chitral the passion of mountaineering.
She said the initiative would also attract foreign and national mountaineers to Terich Mir and its neighbouring 7,000-metre plus peaks to promote ecotourism.
The group will reach Shagrom, the last village of Terich Valley, before starting the trekking expedition formally towards the base camp situated at an altitude of 5,500 metres.
 






On Wednesday, an expedition of Pakistani climbers had also left Chitral city to the peak, which is also known as ‘roof of Chitral’.
The team consisted of Sarbaz Khan and Sherzad Karim from GB, Akmal Naveed and Shamsul Qamar from Chitral, Umar Arshad Khan, Major Atif of Pakistan Army, and Dr Naveed.
Akmal Naveed, the youngest member of the team, told Dawn that history was being created as it was for the first time that Pakistani climbers were trying to summit the highest peak of Hindukush.
Omar Arshad Khan, director KPCTA and a member of the team, said for the first time, the provincial government had taken a major step to promote adventure tourism.
He said on the instructions of the chief minister, helicopters would be kept on stand-by at the Chitral Airport to provide rescue services promptly and timely in case of an emergency.
“Special mountaineering equipment for the expedition has been purchased from Nepal and China, which will be available to the climbers in future,” he said.
“No matter whether the mission remains successful or not, its main objective is to promote mountaineering in Chitral and make the local people well conversant with climbing,” he said.
Arshad Khan said earlier, two groups had successfully returned after trekking to the Trich Mir base camp.
Chitral assistant commissioner Mohammad Aftab Munir said it was a milestone in the history of ecotourism of Chitral as the expedition of local people would pave the way for major achievements in the field and promote tourism.
He said potential of tourism would be exploited to its full in the aftermath of the celebrations.

The seventh session of negotiation between Jirga members and TTP leaders was held on Friday. Sources claimed that the terrorists, living among civilian population in Bajaur tribal district, were involved in sabotage and other crimes.
They said that the chief minister and security officials asked tribal elders to expel foreign terrorists, mostly Afghans, or vacate the area for one or two days for an operation against terrorists.
While promising the continuation of operation against terrorists “at all costs,” the chief minister and security officials called for efforts to minimise collateral damage.
Security sources said the government’s direct talks with terrorists or their facilitators was out of the question until the latter surrendered. They said the ongoing tribal jirga was a logical step to ensure the maximum public safety ahead of any action.
 
 

The sources, however, said both the state and residents were opposed to any compromise with terrorists. They said that the authority to conduct armed operations against terrorists rested with the state.
Meanwhile, the seventh round of talks between Bajaur Amn Jirga members and terrorist leaders concluded in Lowi Mamund tehsil here on Friday evening.
Jirga head Sahibzada Haroon Rashid didn’t update the media about the outcome of the negotiations. However, there is a high likelihood of the Jirga sharing “new developments” with the media shortly.

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told reporters that Trump signed separate deals with both Armenia and Azerbaijan on energy, technology, economic cooperation, border security, infrastructure and trade. No further details were provided.
The agreement includes exclusive US development rights to a strategic transit corridor through the South Caucasus, dubbed the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity.”
US officials said the agreement was hammered out during repeated visits to the region and would provide a basis for working toward a full normalisation between the countries.
Neither the joint declaration due to be signed nor the separate bilateral agreements with the US were released.
 


It was not immediately clear how the deal being signed on Friday would address thorny issues such as the demarcation of shared borders and Baku’s demand for a change in Yerevan’s constitution, which includes a reference to a 1989 call for the reunification of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, then an autonomous region within Soviet Azerbaijan.
Officials briefing reporters skirted over the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh — a mountainous Azerbaijani region that had a mostly ethnic Armenian population — broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia.
 
 

Both Armenia and Azerbaijan won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Azerbaijan took back full control of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2023 in a military offensive, prompting almost all of the territory’s remaining 100,000 Armenians to flee to Armenia.
US officials highlighted the opportunities presented for both countries and US investors through creation of the new transit corridor, which will allow greater exports of energy and other resources.
“What’s going to happen here with the Trump route is, this isn’t charity. This is a highly investable entity,” said one senior administration official, adding that at least nine companies had in recent days expressed interest in operating the transit corridor, including three US firms.
Safer and prosperous
Under a carefully negotiated section of the documents signed on Friday, Armenia plans to award the US exclusive special development rights for an extended period on a transit corridor that will be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, and known by the acronym TRIPP, the officials told Reuters this week.
Trump would sign a directive to set up a negotiating team to work out details for how to operate the corridor, with initial commercial negotiations to begin next week, one of the officials said.
“The losers here are China, Russia and Iran. The winners here are the West,” one of the officials said.
 
 

“Both countries that have been in conflict for 35 years … are looking and talking about full peace with each other tomorrow.”
“It’s being done, not through force, but through commercial partnership … with these two countries,” the official said.
“The joint declaration that we’re going to see signed today is the first-ever peace declaration signed bilaterally by the two countries since the end of the Cold War.”

He was speaking at the oath-taking ceremony of the Umerkot Bar Association here on Friday.
Describing the saying: “Justice delayed is justice denied” as absolutely correct, he declared that a court failing to deliver justice serves no purpose. Mentioning the cases where justice was delayed for decades, he gave a couple of examples: “One woman waited for 71 years for a decision on her inheritance case and another person’s case relating to an accident was decided after 24 years”.
He condemned use of influence by feudals and bureaucrats and observed that some judges were compromising their integrity to appease the powerful.
Justice Panhwar said judges must act with courage, and not fear, and warned them that betraying the oath undermines public trust.

Says ‘they compromise their integrity to appease the powerful’; regrets how three bars, some judges and police backed accused in journalist Nasrullah Gadani’s murder case

Highlighting systemic corruption, he referred to the case of journalist Nasrullah Gadani’s murder, and noted that lawyers from three bars, police and even some judges defended the accused.
 
 

He criticised misuse of the Dispossession Act, meant to protect the poor, and pointed out that it was now being used to harass them.
He also pointed to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) where, he recalled, judicial decisions had led to loss of life. He wondered: “Whose judges we are … people’s or the elite’s?”
Justice Panhwar also lamented societal hypocrisy, observing that in Pakistan, people pretended to be virtuous while acting otherwise. He urged judges to engage with communities directly, saying: “We must stop isolating ourselves and see how people live.” Sharing his feelings with the audience, he remarked: “Sometimes I wonder whether we are judges or bandits”.
Touching upon social issues, he debunked claims of “forced conversions” and pointed out that 90pc of girls running away from their homes happened to be from Muslim families, and not minorities. This, however, signals a broader societal failure to protect women, he said.
 
 

He also noted a lack of shelters for the girls and women vulnerable to injustice, and said this segment is denied education and inheritance rights, particularly in marginalised communities like the scheduled castes.
While criticising judicial system’s inefficiency, he cited the example of Mirpurkhas courts which ‘disposed of’ 319 out of 320 cases within a week, and remarked that it was a ‘formality’ rather than ‘justice’. How could police deliver, he wondered.
Justice Panhwar expressed the view that upper Sindh’s ‘dacoit culture’ and lower Sindh’s ‘drug epidemic’, particularly in Umerkot district, had paralysed the system.
He revealed that one Sukkur SSP had admitted his helplessness in controlling crime, and said he responded [to his statement] by saying that “If we can’t act, we should resign and go home.”
Justice Panhwar accused the Umerkot police of focusing on extortion, instead of curbing crime. “Crime surged under a former sessions judge,” he deplored.
 
 

He said that the Cooperative Housing Society Act was meant for protecting rights of farmers and labourers, not for developing housing schemes. It was designed to empower the working class through loans and by encouraging collective forums, he added.
Justice Panhwar concluded with a warning: “Our rulers tell lies, our institutions tell lies, and people also have stopped speaking the truth. If we don’t change ourselves, then the system will collapse.”
Justice Jan Ali Junejo of Sindh High Court, Tharparkar Sessions Judge Abdul Waheed Sheikh, Umerkot Sessions Judge Abdul Qudoos  Memon, Advocate Yousif Laghari, Mir Pervez Talpur, President of the SHC Bar Association (Mirpurkhas) and Sindh Bar Council members Nand Kumar Goklani and Sher Mohammad  Wassan were among the prominent figures who attended the ceremony.

• Another piece of legislation allows 19 and 20 grade officers to be appointed as chairmen of boards, despite MQM-P’s dissent
KARACHI: In a display of cross-party harmony, the Sindh Assembly on Friday unanimously passed a bill, paving the way for a fresh framework to govern the perks and privileges of its members.
The Sindh Assembly Members (Salaries and Allowances) Bill 2025, presented by Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Zia ul Hasan Lanjar, is aimed at replacing the existing law with “a more structured approach” overseen by a newly constituted Parliamentary Committee.
Under the bill, the Speaker will establish the Parliamentary Committee through an official gazette notification.
The committee’s membership will be determined by the Speaker based on proportional representation, ensuring fair representation. The committee will be empowered to oversee and recommend MPAs’ salaries and allowances, with its recommendations binding on the government.
Under the newly passed bill, key provisions include a consolidated salary for an MPA as determined by the committee, alongside a range of allowances such as sumptuary, house rent, utilities, daily, conveyance, subsidy, accommodation, and travelling and mileage allowances.
Additionally, the Leader of Opposition will receive a salary, allowances, and privileges equivalent to those of a Provincial Minister.
Chairpersons of various parliamentary committees will be eligible for multiple allowances but are limited to using one government vehicle during their tenure, with petrol and maintenance allowances provided.
They must return the vehicle within three days of leaving office.
Meanwhile, lone Jamaat-i-Islami MPA Muhammad Farooq, who is in Saudi Arabia and not part of the PA proceedings, told Dawn his partywas against the increase in lawmakers’ salary as it would be a burden on the provincial exchequer.
He said that the current salary of an MPA is Rs152,000 and after the passage of this bill it would become Rs575,000.
Bureaucrats can head educational boards
During the session, the parliamentary affairs minister also presented the Sindh Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Anti-Terrorism Sindh (Amendment) Bill 2025, both approved by a majority vote.
Regarding the education boards amendment, Mr Lanjar explained that the original 1972 ordinance equated the board chairman’s post to grades 20 and 21, but the new bill allows officers of grades 19 and 20 to be appointed as chairmen of boards.
The minister said that the bill is aimed at paving the way for more officers to be appointed in the education boards.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Qaimkhani supported the need for better board management but criticised what he called the lack of “consideration” for his party’s suggestions.
The MQM-P lawmaker proposed sending the bill back to the committee for further discussion, a suggestion Lanjar opposed.
The speaker put it to a vote, and the house approved the bill by majority of votes.
Earlier, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon praised police force for safeguarding law and order, and protecting life and property of citizens.
Speaking during the session, Mr Memon addressed the long-standing criticism and ridicule faced by the police.
“When we seek a target for blame, the police are an easy choice,” he remarked. “Yet, we rarely reflect on the constable who endangers his life daily for a modest wage, only to face criticism instead of appreciation.”
He praised the Sindh Police for their “exemplary service” since 2008, noting their “historic success in restoring peace” under a democratic government.
He said once-dangerous areas, where residents avoided venturing out after dark, have now returned to normalcy, crediting the force’s efforts.
He lauded their courage in tackling terrorism, citing the Karachi airport attack where then-Inspector General Iqbal Mahmood led the response in plain clothes.
Later, the house was adjourned to Monday.

• Spokesperson hints that Pakistan will continue US-Iran messaging role
ISLAMABAD: Although a UN Security Council travel ban is widely thought to be behind the cancellation of a planned visit by Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to Islamabad, the Foreign Office on Friday hinted that “procedural issues” had hindered the trip.
“There are certain procedural issues we are working through,” Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan told reporters at the weekly media briefing when pressed about media reports on Muttaqi’s aborted trip.
Mr Muttaqi was expected in Islamabad on August 4, continuing the recent high-level contacts initiated by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Kabul earlier this year, a move that led to a thaw in ties. The rapprochement was brokered by China.
However, the spokesperson clarified that no official dates had been confirmed for the Afghan foreign minister’s visit, so there was “no question of cancellation or postponement”.
 


However, diplomatic sources told Dawn that the United States had blocked a UN Security Council exemption that would have allowed Mr Muttaqi to travel to Pakistan.
As the Afghan foreign minister is under international sanctions, he requires special approval from the UN sanctions committee for any foreign travel. According to the source, Washington delayed its decision until the last moment and ultimately refused to grant the waiver, scuttling the trip.
As a key player in the UN Security Council, US holds significant sway in the 1988 Sanctions Committee, which manages sanctions like travel bans, asset freezes, and arms embargoes targeting Taliban-linked individuals and groups under UNSC Resolution 1988 (2011). It is believed the US blocked the waiver for Taliban’s FM to visit Pakistan, driven by worries about their growing ties with China.
US has often clashed with China and Russia at the committee, who advocate for more lenient exemptions, creating tensions within the committee’s efforts to promote stability in Afghanistan.
Mr Khan said that both Kabul and Islamabad are working to address the matter and added, “Once these procedural matters are resolved, we look forward to welcoming the Afghan foreign minister to Pakistan.”
When asked whether Washington had blocked Muttaqi’s visit to Pakistan at a recent briefing, a State Department spokesperson had simply responded with: “We do not comment on rumours”.
Iran mediation
The spokesman also confirmed that Pakistan was helping defuse tensions between the United States and Iran for the sake of the region’s stability.
“We want stability in the neighbourhood, and Iran is a very critical element of the stability in the region,” Mr Khan said. Pakistan’s mediation appears to have continued after Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s two-day visit to Islamabad last weekend.
 
 

Although officials did not publicly acknowledge Pakistan’s role during the trip, both Washington and Islamabad had confirmed such efforts earlier.
Notably, after the visit, Foreign Minister Dar held a phone conversation with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, further fueling speculation that Pezeshkian may have conveyed messages to Washington.
In an interview with China’s Phoenix Television during Pezeshkian’s visit, senior Iranian foreign ministry official Saeed Khatibzadeh said Tehran was in no hurry to engage with the United States and warned it would respond strongly if Washington maintained its “aggressive stance.”
He made it clear that Iran would not engage in direct or indirect talks without sufficient guarantees for productive talks.
An Iranian diplomat in Tehran confirmed to Dawn that Khatibzadeh’s remarks reflected the government’s official position.
Explaining Pakistan’s involvement, Mr Khan said Iran is “a very important country in the region” and that Pakistan would “do all what we can to bring tensions down and work for stability and a diplomatic solution to problems”.
“We have been doing that and will continue to do that,” the spokesman asserted, signalling the intended continuation of the role.

The ministry said the shortfall, from April 24 to June 30, was in overflying revenue and was lower than the reported Rs8.5bn. The closure followed India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty on April 23.
From the very next day, Pakistan withdrew overflight permission for all Indian-registered aircraft and those operated, owned, or leased by Indian carriers.
The measure affected 100 to 150 Indian aircraft daily, cutting transit traffic by almost 20 per cent. In 2019, a similar closure led to an estimated Rs7.6bn ($54m) revenue loss, compared to $100m previously reported.

Islamabad airport airspace to close daily for two hours until Aug 14

The ministry apprised the parliament that such decisions, under the jurisdiction of the federal government, were issued through Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) and carried strategic and diplomatic weight to safeguard civilians, protect infrastructure, and allow military planning.
Sovereignty, defence
“While financial losses occur, sovereignty and national defence take precedence over economic considerations,” the statement read.
The PAA’s average daily overflight revenue in 2019, before tensions, was $508,000, compared to $760,000 in 2025.
 
 

The ministry made it clear that the amounts reflected “revenue shortfalls, not overall financial losses”, and noted that overflight and aeronautical charges remained unchanged, demonstrating resilience and avoiding tariff hikes or government bailouts.
Pakistan’s airspace is open to all except Indian airlines and aircraft till last week of August after the ban was extended twice on a monthly basis. Similarly, Pakistani carriers remain banned from Indian airspace. “When safeguarding sovereignty and security, no price is too high,” the ministry reiterated.
Islamabad flights
Separately, Islamabad International Airport’s airspace will be closed daily for two hours until August 14 for operational reasons, according to NOTAM A0510/25. Departures and arrivals will be halted from ground level to FL210, affecting flights to Lahore and northern areas.
The airspace will remain closed from 11am to 1pm.
On Friday, the temporary closure caused minor delays, with hundreds of passengers facing changes to their travel plans. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said all immigration counters were fully staffed and operational, processing 2,847 passengers from 12 international flights in three hours.
A sudden schedule change led to many passengers departing at the same time. FIA Immigration completed screening and clearance in line with regulations and pledged to maintain efficient services while continuing efforts against human trafficking and wanted suspects.
