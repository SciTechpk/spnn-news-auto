<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/061908059bcc942.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971438/white-house-deletes-racist-trump-post-depicting-obamas-as-apes' target='_blank'><strong>White House deletes racist Trump post depicting Obamas as apes</strong></a><br><p>A video shared on United States President Donald Trump’s social media account that depicted former president Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes was deleted on Friday, following criticism that Trump’s post evoked racist imagery long used to dehumanise people of African descent.
“A White House staffer erroneously made the post,” said a White House official, who declined to be named. “It has been taken down.”







The statement came hours after White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt described as “fake outrage” a wave of negative reactions to the video, including from several prominent Republican lawmakers.
Late on Thursday, Trump shared a minute-long video amplifying the Republican US president’s false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud. Spliced into the video was an apparently AI-generated clip of dancing primates superimposed with the Obamas’ heads.
The post on Trump’s Truth Social network drew swift criticism from prominent political figures, including Republican Senator Tim Scott, a Trump ally who is Black.
“Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House,” Scott said on X. “The president should remove it.”







Republican Representative Mike Lawler of New York was among several other prominent political figures who said Trump should apologise and delete the post.
Prior to the post being deleted, Leavitt said it was “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King”. Trump’s clip included a song from that musical.
A spokesperson for the Obamas declined to comment.
White supremacists have for centuries depicted people of African ancestry as monkeys as part of campaigns to dehumanise and dominate Black populations.
“Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our history,” said Ben Rhodes, a former Obama aide, on X.







Trump has a history of sharing racist rhetoric and long promoted the false conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. In December, Trump described Somalis as “garbage” who should be thrown out of the country.
He has referred to that and other developing nations as “shithole countries.” He was also criticised last year for depicting House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who is Black, with a superimposed handlebar moustache and a sombrero.
Civil rights advocates have said Trump’s rhetoric has become increasingly bold, normalised, and politically permissible.
“Donald Trump’s video is blatantly racist, disgusting, and utterly despicable,” said Derrick Johnson, national president of the NAACP, a civil rights group, in an emailed statement. “Voters are watching and will remember this at the ballot box.”</p><small>2026-02-06 18:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06193954b974f40.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971418/at-least-31-killed-169-injured-in-suicide-bombing-at-islamabad-imambargah' target='_blank'><strong>At least 31 killed, 169 injured in suicide bombing at Islamabad imambargah</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: At least 31 people were killed and another 169 were injured in a suicide bombing at an imambargah during Friday prayers, according to authorities.
The explosion occurred at Imambargah Khadijah-tul-Kubra in the Tarlai area of the federal capital.



Images from the site showed bloodied bodies lying on the carpeted floor surrounded by shards of glass, debris, and panicked worshippers.
Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the imambargah as people called for help.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif suggested India’s and Afghanistan’s involvement in the attack, stating in a post on social media platform X that “it has been proved that the terrorist involved in the attack travelled to and from Afghanistan”.
“The collusion between India and Afghanistan is being revealed,” he said.







The defence minister said that security guards at the site of the incident had “challenged” the attacker, and in response, he opened fire. “He then blew himself up, standing in the last row of worshippers,” he said.
Asif said that the state would respond to this “cruelty with full force”.
“After a humiliating defeat, India is fighting a war through its proxies. It doesn’t have the courage to fight directly now,” he added.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’ later in the day, Asif said that the attack came as Pakistan signed landmark agreements with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and on the same day as the revival of Basant.
“The timing, I believe, is an effort to sabotage us and our progress … India cannot engage in an all-out clash with Pakistan, so it is using proxies and Afghanistan to disrupt peace here,” he said.
The defence minister said that the suicide bomber was a Pakistani national who had travelled to Afghanistan some time ago and undergone “extreme religious indoctrination”. He added that the bomber returned to Pakistan last year.
‘Attacker travelled to Afghanistan on several occasions’
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry later told the media in Islamabad that while the attacker was not an Afghan, authorities had been able to determine through forensic tests the number of times he had travelled to Afghanistan.
At the outset of his media talk, he said rescue teams from various departments began reaching the site of the incident within 10-12 minutes of the blast.
Regarding the attacker, he said: “Information has been obtained about the terrorist who carried out the suicide attack. He is not an Afghan national, but we have information about the number of times he travelled to Afghanistan after the forensics of his remains.”
Chaudhry added that a similar pattern was seen in terror incidents in the country, adding that attacks were either carried out “in the name of religion or on the pretext of … linguistic and provincial [differences].”
In connection with the latter, he particularly mentioned the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).
“They had planned a week ago that they would give a surprise in Balochistan, but they had to pay a heavy price for it and suffered losses.
“These terrorists have reached the extremes of cowardliness. They are attacking soft targets, including markets, schools, mosques, imambargahs, banks and other such places,” he added.
The state minister also said that a first cousin of the Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi had died in the blast.
“All of them are our brothers. Irrespective of any sect, they all are Pakistanis,” he said, adding: “We are resolute and determined that the implementation of the National Action Plan will continue [in the fight against terrorism]. There is no doubt or leniency on this.”
Chaudhry also said that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had visited the imambargah that was targeted in the attack and collected relevant information.
He said that Pakistan had shared evidence with the rest of the world, including its neighbouring countries, that terrorism in Pakistan was sponsored by India.
“We have proof that India has tripled its investment into this. They (terrorists) are not carrying out attacks for religion, but for dollars … Whether they belong to the BLA, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan or any other group, they are paid in dollars,” he added.
The minister further stated that Islamabad had repeatedly urged Afghanistan not to provide space to terrorists and not to become India’s proxy.
“These proxies will meet the same fate as India did in May [last year],” he added.
Speaking about today’s attack, he said “Everything is being monitored at the highest level … But a lot of information cannot be shared at this point because it is important to reach those who were behind them (attacker). And within 72 hours, we will share a detailed report, including information about their handlers.”
When asked whether the incident was also not a failure of the authorities and the state in protecting the public, Chaudhry replied: “This is not a failure … We are a frontline state that is protecting the world. And they are attacking us as they just want to weaken the wall that is Pakistan. If this wall weakens, this fire is not going to stop at our border … We are a responsible state and we are going to fulfil our responsibility. We are going to win this war, and we are winning this war.”
Earlier, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that “India is behind” the incident.
Speaking to the media at Polyclinic Hospital in Islamabad, he expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from Pakistan.
The minister further said that Pakistan had always promoted peace and wanted peace in the region. But, he added, Pakistan’s neighbours had been involved in terror activities in the country.

 


In this connection, the minister particularly mentioned India, saying that it was involved in “terrorism activities in Balochistan, Fata and in the incident that took place in Islamabad today”.
“We have exposed them to the world,” he said, adding that the nation was united against such “cowardly acts and enemies”.
“The fight against them (terrorists) will continue until they are eliminated,” he expressed resolve.
The minister said the injured and the dead had been taken to Pims and Polyclinic Hospital, and emergencies had been declared in hospitals across Islamabad.
Meanwhile, the district administration spokesperson said the site of the blast had been sealed off by security personnel, and added that assistant commissioners were assigned to oversee the treatment of the injured at various hospitals.

Pindi police on high alert; Punjab CM dispatches ambulances
In view of the prevailing security situation, Rawalpindi police were placed on high-alert, according to a statement by the police spokesperson.
“Security duties are being checked and [officials are being] briefed at imambargahs, mosques and other places across the city,” the statement read.
According to the statement, the police officials held meetings with the administrators and the guardians of the religious places and informed them about security standard operating procedures and the measures taken in this regard.
The Islamabad Bar Association also called for a day of mourning on Saturday. A notice issued by the association said that it strongly condemned the suicide blast and expressed deep sorrow over the lives lost.

Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in a post on X, said the provincial government had dispatched 25 ambulances to Islamabad.







She added that all hospitals across Rawalpindi district had been placed on high alert with “surgical teams, anesthetists, orthopedic and neurosurgical specialists on standby”.
“Blood banks are fully staffed, and operation theatres are fully equipped to ensure prompt and effective medical care for the injured.”
Maryam added that the commissioner and deputy commissioner of Rawalpindi were also instructed to extend every possible assistance.
She later said that she would be cancelling “all my Basant-related activities that were scheduled for tomorrow”.
“The mega Basant show at the Liberty Square also stands cancelled,” she said. The chief minister said that it was imperative that the nation was united against “ the khwarji menace and their ‘sympathisers’, shows them no mercy, and stands shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces in defence of the country”.







Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said the provincial government had decided to cancel the “musical segment of the cultural night planned in honour of the Commonwealth Parliamentarians Association”.
“We share the pain of the bereaved families. The dinner will be held simply, without music, out of respect for the victims and our national grief,” he said.







President, PM condemn blast
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari extended condolences to the victims who lost their lives in the blast, according to a statement issued by the PPP on X.
He expressed grief over the incident, saying, “Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity”.
The president prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to them.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the blast, according to a statement. He expressed grief over the deaths in the blast and expressed sympathy with the bereaved.
In a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the prime minister directed him to complete the investigation of the incident and immediately identify the people responsible for it.
He directed that “the injured be provided best medical facilities and the health minister will monitor” the situation, the statement quoted him as saying.
“No one will be allowed to disseminate chaos and unrest in the country,” he said.







In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said he was grateful for the messages of support and sympathy from across the globe.
“The support of our friends and partners has always remained critical in Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts. The perpetrators of this heinous crime will be brought to justice with full force and their nefarious designs will never be allowed to succeed,” he said.
“The brave Pakistani nation stands united at this time and we remain fully committed to our resolve to defeat  terrorism, as we always have,” he said.







Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also condemned the “cowardly suicide attack on innocent worshippers during Friday prayers at a Shia imambargah in Islamabad, killing dozens”.
“Targeting places of worship and civilians is a heinous crime against humanity and a blatant violation of Islamic principles,” he said.
Dar further said, “Pakistan stands united against terrorism in all its forms. This barbarity will not intimidate us and extremists will be brought to full account.”







In his condemnation, Information Attaullah Tarar termed the attack “cowardly”, expressing grief over the loss of lives.
He said, “Targeting worshippers is an extremely cowardly, inhuman and detestable act.”
The minister added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had instructed that those responsible for the attack should be penalised.
Tarar said the state was committed to protect the lives and properties of people, as well as mosques and imambargahs, and actions against miscreant would continue under a zero-tolerance policy.







In a later post, he said that those behind the attack could not shake the resolve of the nation through fear and terror.
“Until the complete annihilation of khwarijs — the enemies of Muslims and humanity — this nation will never be at peace,” he added.







The bombing comes less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast.
Friday’s attack also occurred as Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev was in the federal capital on an official visit to Pakistan.

“It was a good start to the negotiations. And there is an understanding on continuing the talks. Coordination on how to proceed will be decided in the capitals,” the minister, Abbas Araghchi, told Iranian state TV. “If this process continues, I think we will reach a good framework for an understanding.”
Officials from both sides, who held indirect talks through Omani mediation in Oman’s capital Muscat, will return home for consultations, Araqchi said.
While both sides have indicated readiness to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s long-running nuclear dispute with the West, Washington wanted to expand the talks to cover Iran’s ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and “treatment of their own people”, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday.
Araqchi told Iran’s state news agency IRNA that “any dialogue requires refraining from threats and pressure”, adding that Tehran “only discusses its nuclear issue. We do not discuss any other issue with the US”







Iranian officials have repeatedly said they will not discuss Iran’s missiles — one of the biggest such arsenals in the region — and have said Tehran wants recognition of its right to enrich uranium. For Washington, carrying out enrichment inside Iran is a red line.
Tehran’s clerical leadership remains deeply worried that Trump may still carry out his threats to strike Iran after a military buildup by the US Navy near Iran.
“The lack of trust is a huge challenge during the talks and it should be overcome,” Araqchi said.
In June, the US struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in the final stages of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.
The US naval buildup, which Trump has called a massive armada, has followed a crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran last month, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran.
Trump has warned that “bad things” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes.
World powers and regional states fear that a breakdown in the negotiations would lead to another conflict between the US and Iran, which could spill over to the rest of the oil-rich region.
Iran has vowed a harsh response to any military strike and has cautioned neighbouring Gulf Arab countries hosting US bases in the oil-rich region that they could be in the firing line if they were involved in an attack.
Negotiators in Oman will have to navigate Iran’s red line on discussing its missile programme to reach a deal and avert future military action. Tehran has flatly ruled out talks on its “defence capabilities, including missiles and their range.”
In a show of defiance, Iran’s state TV said hours before the talks that one of the country’s most advanced long-range ballistic missiles, the Khorramshahr-4, had been deployed at one of the Revolutionary Guard’s vast underground missile cities.
However, Tehran is willing to show “flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kilogrammes of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution,” Iranian officials told Reuters last week.
Iran also demands the lifting of sanctions, reimposed since 2018 when Trump ditched Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six powers.
The US, its European allies and Israel accuse Tehran of using its nuclear programme as a veil for efforts to try to develop the capability to produce weapons. Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only.
Israel has likened the danger of Iran’s missiles to its nuclear programme. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in January that Iran’s “attempt to build atomic weapons” and “20,000 ballistic missiles” were like “two lumps of cancer”.</p><small>2026-02-06 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06180652bf8d2f5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971409/info-minister-says-imrans-detailed-medical-report-handed-over-to-family' target='_blank'><strong>Info minister says Imran’s ‘detailed’ medical report handed over to family</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Friday that the “detailed” medical reports of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan had been handed over to the family.
His post on the social media platform X came hours after the PTI again approached the Supreme Court (SC) seeking Imran’s medical report and visitation rights for his personal doctors and family members.
In the post, the minister noted that National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai had written a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif while PTI leaders had also approached the apex court “regarding medical checkup of Imran Ahmad Niazi, who is serving his sentences in Central Jail, Rawalpindi”.







“On directions from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), a detailed report has been sent by the executive director of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) hospital to the superintendent of Central Jail, Rawalpindi (Adiala), which has been handed over to the family,” he said.
According to the report sent by Pims Executive Director Dr Rana Imran Sikander, the hospital was directed by the PMO to communicate and give an update about Imran’s medical condition.
“Mr Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi (age 74 years) reported reduced vision in the right eye. A senior and qualified ophthalmologist from Pims, Islamabad, conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiala Jail, including slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, intraocular pressure measurements, essential laboratory tests and Optical coherence tomography of the retina,” he said in the report.
“Based on his assessment, a diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made, and hospital-based follow-up treatment was recommended,” he said.
He further said that Imran was then brought to Pims for the procedure, where the treatment plan was explained to him.
“Accordingly, informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure,” the Pims executive director said.
He said that the procedure was carried out in the operating theatre under standard sterile protocols and monitoring. It was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes, he said.
“During the treatment, the patient remained vitally stable, and was discharged with routine post-procedure care instructions, follow-up advice and documents,” Dr Rana stated.
The development comes after the government last week admitted that the former premier was treated at Pims in Islamabad. The admission came days after reports regarding the treatment of Imran emerged in mainstream media.
The PTI had subsequently condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians.
Meanwhile, the Pims executive director, had earlier said that Imran’s eye procedure was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention.
It is worth mentioning that National Assembly Opposition Leader Achakzai on Tuesday wrote a letter to PM Shehbaz, seeking his “personal intervention” for the PTI founder’s medical examination by the jailed leader’s “trusted” doctors.
‘Imran, Bushra being provided care in accordance with jail rules’
Separately, the Adiala jail administration informed an anti-terrorism court in Islamabad that Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were being provided medical treatment in accordance with the jail rules.
A brief report on medical facilities provided to Imran and Bushra Bibi was submitted to the court of ATC judge Amjad Ali Shah, following earlier contempt proceedings over its non-submission.
The report, filed by Jail Deputy Superintendent Jamaat Ali Shah, stated that medical examinations and treatment for the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi were being carried out in accordance with the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978.
The court had earlier issued a contempt of court notice to the Adiala Jail superintendent for failing to submit the required report, prompting jail authorities to present the document during the hearing.
Further, the report by the Pims executive director was also submitted to the same court by Adiala jail officials.
However, Imran’s sister Aleema took to X to state that the SC chief justice had “committed last Friday that Imran Khan’s medical reports would be provided to his family”.
“Today, when the jail superintendent appeared before the ATC only two brief notes were submitted,” she said. “This conduct reflects a complete disregard for the authority of the chief justice of the SC,” she said.
“We urge Chief Justice Yahya Afridi to issue a contempt notice to the jail authorities and ensure that Imran Khan’s medical reports are handed over to his family without any further delay,” she asserted.







PTI approches Supreme Court
Earlier in the day, PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, expressing concern over Imran’s health, said that the party had submitted a memorandum to the registrar requesting access to Imran for his personal doctors, as well as requesting his medical report.

The memorandum, a copy of which is available with Dawn, reiterated the PTI’s request that “immediate access to Mr Imran Khan be provided to his family, doctors, lawyers and friends”.
Gohar said that this was the “10th time” the party was approaching the apex court about Imran and that they had approached the high courts 16 times as well.
Gohar said that Imran’s health was a “very important issue, not just for PTI’s parliamentarians but for the whole country and every Pakistani”.
The party chairman said that until now, they had not received information on Imran’s medical reports and the procedure that he recently underwent.
“In the middle of this, Tuesday and Thursday passed by,” Gohar added. “Still, there was no meeting of Imran with either family members or lawyers, nor his personal physician or doctors.”
According to Gohar, Achakzai had written a letter to PM Shehbaz seeking his “personal intervention” for Imran’s medical examination by his “trusted” doctors, there had been no answer.
Hence, he said, the PTI was again requesting the chief justice to make sure that not only would the party receive the report about the jailed leader, but his doctors would be able to meet with him as quickly as possible, for the peace of mind of “his family, the party and the whole country”.
“This is our minimum,” he said.

The amendment to rule 166(5) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate was approved by the upper House of Parliament as chair rejected the government’s request to defer the matter.
A motion seeking the amendment to the rule was moved by PPP, PML-N and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) senators.
However, during the session, PML-N’s Rana Sanaullah, who is special assistant to the prime minister on political affairs, conveyed Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar’s request that the motion may not be taken up before the matter was discussed with him.
However, PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwala, who spearheaded the move to amend the rule and was also chairing the session today, highlighted that the “interference of courts” in House committees’ proceedings was the reason behind the need for the change in the rule.
“High courts granted stays on the cases and petitions admitted by the chairman,” he pointed out, adding that there had been “back and forth on the amendment for months”.
“We do not want to delay it any further.”
But, Sanaullah asked what the urgency was.
In response, Mandviwala said the functioning of the committees was getting affected. “The amendment is in the interest of Senate and its committees, and it has already been unanimously approved by the standing committee concerned,” he contended.
Stressing that it was desire of the House, Mandviwala said he had already discussed it with the law minister and the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP).
However, Sanaullah insisted that the matter be deferred till Monday.
But, Mandviwala did not budge, asking Sanaullah not to insist for the amendment’s deferment.
“I have to proceed [with the session],” he said, asking Senator Abdul Qadir to move the motion, which was passed by the House by a majority vote.
The amendment
Supporters of the amendment say the change will leave no legal room for the judiciary to interfere in the parliamentary matters.
The amendment expands the definition of public petitions that can be taken up by Senate committees.
It states that a public petition, submitted by a citizen or a group of citizens in the prescribed form under Rule 277, may be presented on “any matter of public importance”, including grievances arising from disputes where circumstances disclose an element of public interest, systemic concern, regulatory oversight and/or the protection of rights.
It further provides that, after consideration, the committee may issue: (a) observations or recommendations for systemic or regulatory improvements; and (b) facilitative guidance for resolution of the grievance and take necessary steps for disposal of the matter in accordance with relevant law.
A proviso added to the rule gives the Senate chairman broad discretion over whether a petition should proceed.
It reads: “Provided that, notwithstanding anything contained in this rule, the chairman Senate may, at his sole discretion, review, admit, pend, dispense with or decline to proceed with any petition, if in his opinion such action is necessary in the interest of propriety, parliamentary discipline, or to prevent frivolous, vexatious or otherwise inappropriate proceedings.”
Rule 166(5) in its previous form stated: “Public petitions may be presented on any matter connected with the business pending before the House or a committee, or any matter of general public interest which is primarily the concern of the government, provided that it is not one which falls within the cognisance of a court of law or tribunal, and it shall not directly relate to a matter pending before any court or other authority performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions.”
How it all started?
The move follows a dispute last year over stay orders issued by the Islamabad High Court and Lahore High Court against proceedings of Senate standing committees.
On July 25, the Senate summoned the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle raised concerns about alleged judicial interference in parliamentary matters.
The issue was raised by Mandviwalla during a sitting presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan. Mandviwalla had described the stay orders as “alarming” and regretted that they had been issued despite the absence of any pending court cases. “This is direct interference in the functioning and proceedings of parliamentary committees,” he said.
Legislators from both treasury and opposition benches, including PTI and JUI-F, had endorsed the concerns.
On Aug 18, 2025, AGP Mansoor Usman Awan had made a rare appearance before the Senate and backed the judiciary, calling for keeping the door open for judicial intervention in parliamentary proceedings.
The AGP had referred to Article 69 of the Constitution, under which the validity of proceedings in parliament cannot be called into question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure. Awan had insisted that the bar was not absolute.
Senate Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges, chaired by Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi, had approved the amendment in December 2025 amid opposition from the Ministry of Parl­ia­mentary Affairs.
Need for reconciliation stressed
During the Senate proceedings today, the treasury and opposition members were also seen agreeing that both sides needed to move past their differences, work toward reconciliation and engage in dialogue.
The conciliatory tone was adopted merely minutes after the government and the opposition were witnessed exchanging allegations and barbs.
It was an admission by PTI’s Azam Swati that changed the mood in the House. The former federal minister admitted that mistakes had been committed when his party was in the government, stressing the need to learn from the past and move foward.
Swati emphasised the need for reconciliation, saying that “peace is under threat and joint efforts are the need of the hours to eliminate terrorism”.
He went on to say that incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s health was his party’s top priority as the country’s poor and underprivileged looked to Imran with hopes of easing of their difficulties.
The PTI has expressed concerns over Imran’s health after the government last week admitted that the former premier had been treated at Pims in Islamabad for an eye ailment.
Swati urged Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah to play a “positive role”, saying that people had no trust in the country’s justice system.
He urged the “decision-makers” to take the first step.
Swati also called for ensuring fundamental rights, including the rights to life and health, also mentioning Imran’s health in this connection.
He said he hoped the government would respond to his call for reconciliation and shunning the politics of hatred.
Responding to his remarks in an equally conciliatory tone, Sanaullah appreciated Swati’s admission of mistakes having been committed during the PTI’s tenure and said his party’s government was also prone to making mistakes.
Sanaullah said all matters could be settled when two parties sat together and added, “We are ready to move forward.”
He assured the House that Imran was being given facilities that he was “entitle to under the court order and according to his position”.
Sanaullah also maintained the Imran’s medical treatment was carried out with his consent.
Earlier, Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas delivered a hard-hitting speech, accusing the government of denying Imran the fundamental rights that a citizen and prisoner was entitled to under the Constitution.
“It is injustice” by means of which enmity would seep into politics, the opposition leader remarked.
He said any government’s “existence and legitimacy” would remain questionable if it failed to provide fundamental rights to its citizens.
Abbas alleged that the government was denying Imran the rights that he was entitled to as a citizen, prisoner and former prime minister.
“We have serious concerns about his health,” he said, adding that Imran’s family, lawyers and personal physicians were not being allowed to meet him.
He also alleged that police had began arresting PTI workers and supports after the party announced a “peaceful protest” on February 8.
“This can only happen in times of fascism and not in a respectable democratic country,” he said, proposing that a committee be constituted to look into the conditions of prisoners countrywide.
Taking exception to Abbas’s statements, Sanaullah said the House should hold a debate on “who turned politics into enmity… Who turned politics into an insult? You reap what you sow”.
He said the Islamabad High Court had directed the meetings with Imran be should have some “dos and don’ts”. Seemingly referring to some of Imran’s statements about the military leadership, he said the opposition party itself had failed to fulfil its responsibility and violated the terms of the meeting.
He asked the opposition to move the high court if they believed that court orders were being violated.
Addressing Abbas’s allegations of arrests following the announcement of February 8 protest, he said the PTI did not have a past record of holding peaceful protests. He also referred to May 9, 2023 riots following the arrest of Imran and the November 26, 2024 protest in Islamabad.
Sanaullah was of the opinion that a wheel-jam strike was also violence.</p><small>2026-02-06 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06200955b57e448.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971448/islamabad-atc-extends-imaan-hadis-judicial-remand-for-another-fortnight' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC extends Imaan, Hadi’s judicial remand for another fortnight</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Friday extended the judicial remand of lawyer Imaan Zainab Hazir-Mazari and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha for another fortnight.
The development came as ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra heard a case registered against the two under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act over their alleged involvement in a lawyers’ protest at Constitution Avenue.
The couple was arrested last month while leaving the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in connection with the case. It is worth mentioning that the two have been sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a separate case pertaining to controversial social media posts.
During the hearing, the prosecution submitted a notification dated February 5, citing the prevailing law and order situation that, according to authorities, made it difficult to physically produce the accused before the court. It subsequently requested the court to mark the suspects’ attendance via video link.
Accepting the request, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra marked the attendance of both accused via video link from Adiala jail.
Furthermore, the court extended the judicial remand of Imaan and Hadi for 14 days, directing jail authorities to ensure their virtual presence at the next hearing scheduled for February 19.
Separately, the Islamabad High Court issued a two-page written order on a petition filed by Dr Shireen Mazari against the two lawyers being denied visitation rights following their conviction in a separate case.
The petition was heard by Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, who noted in the written order that the couple had been sentenced on January 24, but, according to the petitioner, they were not being provided with the facility to meet their family members and lawyers after the sentence.
However, the court observed that the petitioner had not “approached the relevant administrative forum regarding the matter”.
The IHC converted the petition into an application and forwarded it to the Adiala jail superintendent, directing that the matter be decided “expeditiously in accordance with the law”.
The high court further clarified that issues related to facilities provided to prisoners under prison rules must first be raised before the relevant administrative authorities, after which judicial proceedings may be initiated if required.</p><small>2026-02-06 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/062019012841df4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971449/why-pakistans-squad-at-this-years-t20-world-cup-feels-like-a-team-again' target='_blank'><strong>Why Pakistan’s squad at this year’s T20 world Cup feels like a team again</strong></a><br><p>In 2015, Coke Studio released ‘Phir Se Game Uthadein’ — an anthem for the ODI World Cup set to happen the same year. It was inspired by Slogett and Carlone’s 1992 anthem ‘Who Rules the World’, the soundtrack to Pakistan’s first and most fabled major victory in cricket.
Produced by Strings and sung by Atif Aslam, the song proclaimed “Jeet ki daastaan, phir ho gi jawaan” to the same tune as “Who’s gonna be number one, who’s gonna take up the cup?”.
There is a dexterity required to mythologise something that has actually happened — Pakistan has done that with the 1992 World Cup. There must have been a time when the historical immediacy of the victory would lend itself as proof that it was real.
But ever since I can remember, the 1992 World Cup has been a pedestalised peak that seems harder and harder to re-mount as the years go by.
1992 is invoked in every metaphor for victory in Pakistan, sporting or otherwise. It is the incantation we chant when we are inviting good fortune, and the prayer we use to give shape to this imagined fortune.
We look for it every time we’re stuck in a quagmire mid-tournament (which is by and large a yearly occurrence).
The 2015 invocation was no different. The words josh and junoon were used, as they always are, those abstract ideals of hope and zeal and valour that never fully lend themselves in translations to other languages.
But what was perhaps most intriguing about this remake was the fact that a sad follow-up was shot.
After Pakistan was knocked out by Australia (because, of course), the TV and video advertisements that brandished all colours of waving flags a day before were replaced by clips of an imagined aftermath: hung faces in front of projector screens, the green stars and crescents painted on them going flaccid.
Empty rooftops with stray, limp pieces of confetti sadly billowing in the breeze. A sadder version of the song, essentially saying “we lost, but it’s okay.”
It’s not the reprise that particularly tickled my fancy, but the idea that a company producing a hype song for one of the decade’s most anticipated cricketing events had the foresight to produce a version for the sadder, but probably likelier outcome.
It’s not like it came as a shock — the campaign included the routine defeat to India, the fabled 1-4 collapse against the West Indies that the country woke up before dawn to witness, and of course, an immediately historicised dropped catch in the quarter final.
All of this is to say that Pakistan losing or ungracefully bowing out of a tournament isn’t necessarily an unfamiliar feeling. It is often anticipated, often met with a begrudging acknowledgement: “haan yaar, pata tha yehi hoga.”
And yet, I was thirteen years old during that particular World Cup, and while I do remember all the horrors in technicolour, I cannot help but remember the few gleaming specks of joy that somehow muscled their way out of them.
I remember a then 27-year-old Sarfaraz Ahmed playing perhaps the first iconic knock of his career against South Africa, falling short of a half-century by one run, and Pakistan winning a game that it probably shouldn’t have.

Across the world, as Wahab Riaz was bowling ball after ball of the spell of his life to Shane Watson, I remember loitering around my school’s staffroom during the quarter final, asking the one teacher who would indulge my classmates and me by giving us an update on the score.
After each of these trips, we would trundle back to class and take a moment to collectively (mournfully) pray at our desks.
I remember realising properly for the first time in my life that all the stretched out, worn out, drawn out cliches about coming back to this team over and over again would be true for my whole life.
Cricket feels different now than it did back then — it’s faster and more saturated, with so many more places and people and things involved.
There is some form of a “World Cup” every year, and it feels difficult to truly feel what a looming World Cup feels like when one is around the corner every month.
Much more recently, the constant uncertainty around cricket has been cause for further disillusionment — a Champions Trophy which was supposed to happen entirely at home not having been so, disappointing showings in 2023 and 2024, and an Asia Cup truncated with political puppet shows.
Going into the T20 World Cup, Pakistan is once again at the centre of what looks like a less-than-ideal unfolding: Pakistan has boycotted the match against India in solidarity with Bangladesh against ICC’s inconsistent treatment across teams.

As a result of the hybrid-model compromise with India in 2024, which promised neutral venues for both teams in the case of an ICC tournament in either one, Pakistan will be playing its group matches in Colombo, with Sri Lanka being cohosts for the tournament.
Of course, we have a long history with our good friend Colombo in the rain, and with a fluctuating percentage of rain in the forecast, the possibility of any of Pakistan’s games being washed out is not zero. There is no margin for error. The realistic thing would be to not hope too much.
And yet, one can’t help but feel like that after a while; the Pakistan side showing up to this World Cup feels like a team again.
Salman Ali Agha’s success at number 3 has unlocked a vein of potential for Pakistan — while his T20 strike rate is around 122, at this position, he has averaged 37 and struck at a solid 168, especially in the recent series against Sri Lanka and Australia.
Batting aside, Agha has amassed T20 series wins against South Africa, Australia, West Indies and Bangladesh, in addition to two tri-series wins and leading Pakistan to be the finalists in the Asia Cup.
As we speak, Saim Ayub is the world’s number one all-rounder in T20 cricket, and Usman Tariq, with his perfectly legal action, has provided Pakistan’s bowling line-up with a contested but undeniable innovation.
The spin arsenal of Saim, Abrar Ahmed, Usman Tariq, Shadab Khan and Muhammad Nawaz has shaped up to be one of the most promising in the tournament, if the statement 3-0 win against Australia was any indication.

All histories up till now have shown that Pakistan’s form before a tournament is just about as untrustworthy as Pakistan’s performances during one — but against all my wisdom, I am compelled to hope.
Of course, cricket is currently at the mercy of administrative mishaps and Pakistan fans are at the mercy of the Pakistan cricket team. But sometimes it is good to remember that not even the most illustrious of wisdoms and an undeniable breadth of knowledge does not absolve us of this reality: when Pakistan plays cricket, we will be tuning in.
Hopefully, this time, the sadder songs will remain in the archives.

Speaking at a press conference at the Central Police Office, the provincial police chief said since the launch of the operation, 113 encounters had taken place with criminals in which 27 kidnappers were gunned down, 82 others were injured, and 77 were arrested.
Flanked by Sindh Additional Inspector General of Police Iqbal Dara, Odho said 123 bandits had also surrendered before law enforcers as part of the government’s policy.
“These were not ordinary criminals,” he said. He further said that 15 people who had been kidnapped had been recovered safely. He lamented that some of the citizens rescued were in the custody of the bandits for up to three years.
Way forward
In an oblique reference to past operations against riverine bandits that failed to deliver desirable results, Odho said a comprehensive plan had been chalked out in which socio-economic aspects were also included as part of the government’s policy.
He vowed to continue the operation until the “total annihilation” of crime in riverine areas. The Sindh police chief said the riverine areas where military-grade weapons were available would be de-weaponised.
He said that under the plan, tribal feuds — which had remained nurseries for bandits in terms of provision of manpower and weapons — would be ended.
He said that these tribal feuds were the outcome of “egos, attempts to occupy government lands and petty issues”.
Some tribal chiefs had cooperated with the law enforcers for eliminating the criminals, he noted, adding that those who refused to do so would be taken to task.
He further said that there would be “permanent presence” of police to prevent the reemergence of the criminals. He declared that a “riverine police unit” would be set up for this purpose.
He claimed that recently hard-to-reach areas like Bagarji and Ranwati had been cleared of bandits, adding that notorious gangs were eliminated.
He further said that there would be a “socio-economic development plan” for riverine areas. He hoped that with the completion of the Ghotki-Kandhkot bridge on the Indus River, law enforcers would get easy access to riverine areas. He hoped that this proposed bridge would help to eliminate criminals.
Odho also said that roads, dispensaries and schools would be set up in these areas. For this purpose, certain non-governmental organisations in Karachi had pledged to help set up educational institutes in the riverine areas, he said.
He said that with the help of oil and gas companies, socio-economic uplift projects were launched in Ghotki district in 2003. He noted that these projects benefited local communities and helped in eliminating criminals, particularly from the Chachar community.
The police chief said that the riverine area was spread over 450 kilometres in the province. He said that out of this, 50-60km was where bandits had established their hideouts.
The police faced two challenges there, he said. “The presence of a significant quantity of water with fertile lands and islands, and the area’s proximity to border areas of other provinces like Punjab,” Odho added.
Referring to his recent talk with the newly-appointed Punjab police chief, who also belongs to Nawabshah, Odho said, the two had decided to further strengthen cooperation and joint operations in bordering areas.
“An air surveillance unit would also be set up for surveillance of the areas with the help of drones,” he added.
In response to a question about the alleged political patronisation of the bandits in areas, Odho said that certain individuals may support criminals due to caste, kinship, or land disputes in their individual capacity. However, he said that the government had given law enforcers a free hand, adding that they were not facing any pressure.
Odho said that with the launch of recent operations in Balochistan and the “improvement of the situation in the province”, he hoped that the “flow of sophisticated weapons” to riverine areas would end.
“The leakages in de-weaponising the areas will be addressed with the help of the federal government,” he said.
The Sindh IG said around 150,000 people were living in riverine areas, adding that the Sindh government had decided to “rehabilitate them”. He further said that if needed, they would be provided state land to sustain their livelihoods.
Crime in Karachi
During the press talk, the Sindh police chief said that another major challenge for the law enforcers was street crime in Karachi.
He said that there was a time when organised crime and terrorism prevailed in the metropolis, saying that there were “no-go areas” and police did not even “dare to go there”.
“Peace was restored in the provincial capital following the sacrifices of over 1,100 police officials,” he said.
He noted that crime had not been eliminated from Karachi, but said that the “numbers have declined”. He vowed to further improve the situation in the metropolis.</p><small>2026-02-06 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06173925e004f7c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971425/pakistan-and-uzbekistan-reaffirm-resolve-to-expand-trade-economic-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and Uzbekistan reaffirm resolve to expand trade, economic ties</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that ties between Pakistan and Uzbekistan from now onwards would be measured by trade flows, investment projects, industrial partnerships and people-to-people exchanges, Radio Pakistan reported.
According to the report, he made the remarks while addressing the Pakistan-Uzbekistan Business Forum in Islamabad alongside Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who is in Islamabad on an official visit.
In his remarks, the premier said that it was in this spirit that both countries had set an “ambitious yet easily achievable target of increasing our bilateral trade to $2 billion”, the report said.
He said the two countries had also signed a protocol, which would lead to the constitution of a working group to draft a five-year roadmap in order to promote trade, investment, and joint collaboration in research and development, information technology and agriculture, it added.
PM Shehbaz also said that tourism was another area in which both countries could benefit from each other’s experience.
“He expressed the confidence that business-to-business memoranda of understanding worth $3.4bn are going to materialise,” the report said.
The premier also stated that Pakistan considered Uzbekistan not only a partner but a gateway to Central Asia with great potential for joint ventures with Pakistani entrepreneurs, it added.
Meanwhile, the visiting dignitary urged the business communities of both countries to come forward to tap the full trade potential between Pakistan and Uzbekistan.
“He assured a ten-year tax exemption to Pakistani businesses in addition to all possible facilitation. The Uzbek president emphasised that both countries have a great trade potential in diverse areas,” the report said.
‘Pakistan committed to boosting ties with Uzbekistan in diverse fields’
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari said that Pakistan was committed to elevating bilateral relations with Uzbekistan to “new heights” through closer cooperation in connectivity, trade and people-to-people contacts, according to a separate report by Radio Pakistan.
According to the report, President Zardari met with Uzbekistan President Mirziyoyev and expressed the confidence that the visit would prove “productive and forward-looking”.
“President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working closely with Uzbekistan to further strengthen cooperation in trade, connectivity, defence, security, culture and heritage,” Radio Pakistan said.
He noted that direct air links between the two countries had brought the people of the two countries closer and underscored the importance of regional connectivity initiatives, including the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project, while highlighting the need to address remaining challenges through collective efforts, the national radio broadcaster said.
During the meeting, President Zardari highlighted the “steady growth in bilateral trade in recent years and underscored the need to realise the true economic potential of the relationship, with the shared objective of expanding trade to two billion dollars as agreed by the two sides,” the report said.
“He also stressed the importance of enhancing people-to-people contacts, tourism cooperation and cultural exchanges, drawing on the rich historical and spiritual links between the two nations,” it added.
President Zardari also expressed the need to extend collaboration and facilitation between the financial institutions, including banks, to support trade and investment flows, it added.
Radio Pakistan quoted Uzbek President Mirziyoyev as saying that the country attached great importance to strengthening friendship and the strategic partnership with Pakistan.
“He noted with satisfaction the steady growth in bilateral contacts at various levels, including the expansion of trade, an increase in joint ventures, and the implementation of cooperation projects in priority sectors of the economy,” it said.
It added that President Mirziyoyev directed his concerned minister to coordinate with the Pakistani counterpart in this regard.
“The Uzbek president emphasised the need to further expand practical cooperation through closer political dialogue, stronger trade, economic and investment ties, and more active business exchanges,” the state-run broadcaster said.
It stated that President Mirziyoyev invited his Pakistani counterpart to pay an official visit to Uzbekistan.
“He said two additional direct flights would be added between the two countries, taking the total number of weekly flights to six, to further facilitate people-to-people contacts, tourism and business exchanges,” it added.
During the meetings, the two presidents also discussed the regional situation, including matters affecting peace, stability and security, it said.
Later, President Zardari conferred the Nishan-i-Pakistan on President Mirziyoyev in recognition of his contribution to strengthening Pakistan-Uzbekistan relations, the report added.
Joint communique underscores commitment to connectivity, cooperation
Separately, Pakistan and Uzbekistan underscored their commitment to further deepen bilateral ties and strengthen cooperation in a joint declaration, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday.
The joint declaration, signed by Mirziyoyev and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, said that the leaders held comprehensive and in-depth discussions covering the full spectrum of bilateral relations between the two countries.
“The two sides reaffirmed their strong resolve to comprehensively develop and strengthen cooperation in order to support each other’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, while advancing sustainable development aligned with the long-term national interests of the people of both states,” the declaration read.







The two sides also exchanged views on key issues, such as regional peace and security, connectivity and trade, and expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation developed over the last 34 years, since the establishment of their diplomatic relations.
The declaration noted that these relations were “firmly anchored in longstanding bonds of friendship, as well as deep historical, cultural and spiritual affinities between the two nations”.
According to the joint statement, both nations underscored their commitment to deepen bilateral ties and elevate cooperation “to a qualitatively new level that advances the core interests of both nations”, it said.
The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment to the joint declaration signed after PM Shehbaz’s visit to Uzbekistan in February 2025, noting that the roadmap for the implementation of the decisions reached during that visit provided a blueprint for further deepening bilateral relations in multiple areas of cooperation.
PM Shehbaz and President Mirziyoyev regarded the decision to establish a High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC) during last year’s visit as a significant milestone.
“This mechanism provides close guidance and monitoring of the top leadership on bilateral cooperation,” the declaration stated.
They welcomed the inaugural meeting of the HLSCC during Mirziyoyev’s visit to Pakistan, wherein the two leaders “reached important decisions on furthering bilateral cooperation”.
The leaders also commended the work of the Joint Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) on Trade-Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation between Uzbekistan and Pakistan in promoting trade and commerce between the two countries.
“They noted with satisfaction the conduct of the 10th session of the IGC, held in Islamabad on Feb 2, and hoped to achieve the targets set therein in the stated timeframe,” the statement said.
Further, they welcomed the signing of the framework agreement of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project in July 2025, and noted the significance of connectivity as a means of regional integration, transit trade and socio-economic development in the region.
The two sides reiterated their commitment to enhancing regional connectivity and acknowledged the importance of this cooperation in promoting efficient, reliable, and cost-effective transport links, thereby contributing to deeper economic integration and strengthened bilateral and regional trade relations, according to the declaration.
To this end, they expressed their commitment to take measures necessary for the early operationalisation of an MoU on Multimodal Transport that was signed in September 2024. Pakistan also reaffirmed its readiness to provide access to its seaports for Uzbek transit cargo and to make available its road network of international standards to support Uzbek trade and transit requirements, the declaration said.
The leaders acknowledged the fact that Uzbekistan was the first country in Central Asia with which Pakistan had signed a Transit Trade Agreement as well as a Preferential Trade Agreement. They welcomed the growing volume of trade and commerce between the two countries.
They also reiterated their commitment towards achieving a $2 billion bilateral trade target by 2029.
The sides agreed to establish a joint management of economic or industrial zones in each country in order to create favourable conditions for developing industrial cooperation between the two countries, aimed primarily at exporting finished products to third countries, the declaration added.
“Noting the important role of interregional dialogue in promoting trade and economic cooperation, unlocking new opportunities and identifying new areas of growth for collaboration, the two leaders welcomed the signing of the framework agreement establishing the Inter-Regional Forum. The sides agreed to hold the first forum of regions of the two countries in the Republic of Uzbekistan in 2026 at mutually agreed dates,” it said.
According to the statement, both leaders expressed their satisfaction on the progress made by both sides for completing phase-II of expansion of the PTA, signing the Bilateral Investment Treaty and agreeing to explore the possibility of signing an agreement on aligning SPS measures and mutual recognition of standards to help Joint Ventures in pharmaceuticals, textile, leather industries, agriculture, minerals and engineering goods, and enhancing e-commerce cooperation.
They also emphasised the need to further diversify trade corridors between Uzbekistan and Pakistan to amend the existing Intergovernmental Agreement on Transit Trade for this purpose, it said.
In addition, both countries expressed their readiness to maintain regular dialogue and build constructive cooperation in the area of security and defence.
They expressed satisfaction at the level of defence cooperation, welcoming the recent engagements between the two sides in this regard, including the staff talks and high-level exchanges, the declaration said.
“In order to further promote cooperation in this area, they agreed to continue mutual participation in joint military exercises and training, and to cooperate in the field of professional development, exchange of best practices and collaboration between military institutions of the two countries.”
Additionally, they reaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations (UN) Charter and its purposes and principles. They pledged to consider each other’s initiatives favourably at multilateral fora.
“They underlined that sustained dialogue and peaceful engagement in accordance with the UN Charter, General Assembly and Security Council Resolutions remain essential for addressing longstanding issues and disputes, and advancing peace, stability and prosperity in South and Central Asia,” the declaration added.
Further, the countries agreed to extend favourable consideration to each other’s upcoming candidatures for various positions within international organisations, particularly at the UN.
Uzbekistan commended Pakistan on its contributions to advancing peace and security as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the term 2025-2026, and congratulated Pakistan on its successful presidency of the UNSC during June 2025.
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz congratulated the Uzbek president on the successful hosting of the 43rd session of the Unesco General Conference in Samarkand in 2025.
The declaration added that Uzbekistan expressed “full support” for Pakistan to work as the rotating chairman of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) for 2026-2027.
It also congratulated Pakistan on assuming the chairmanships of the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) of the SCO for the term 2025-2026, and the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) for the term 2026-2027.
“In addition, the Pakistan side noted its regular participation in the meetings of working groups on Uzbekistan’s accession to the WTO (World Trade Organisation) and its support for Uzbekistan’s early accession to the organisation,” it said.
Pakistan and Uzbekistan underlined the significance of peace and stability in Afghanistan as being “key to lasting regional peace, stability and prosperity in general and the successful implementation of the UAP Railway Project in particular”.
“The two leaders called on Afghanistan to address the threats of terrorism, and to take immediate and concrete actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan, which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country,” the declaration said.
They also reaffirmed the importance of their constructive roles in promoting peace, stability, and just resolution of global conflicts, including expressing their support for the people of Palestine and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
The two sides underscored that the talks held during the visit and the bilateral documents signed will serve to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan, the statement added.
According to the declaration, Mirziyoyev invited PM Shehbaz to visit Uzbekistan “at a convenient time in order to further develop comprehensive cooperation”.
“Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif kindly accepted the invitation,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-06 12:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/061630562d71e13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971423/captain-salman-agha-defends-x-factor-usman-tariqs-bowling-action-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-opener' target='_blank'><strong>Captain Salman Agha defends ‘X factor’ Usman Tariq’s bowling action ahead of T20 World Cup opener</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan captain Salman Agha defended off-spinner Usman Tariq’s unorthodox bowling action on Friday and called him the side’s “X factor” on the eve of their Twenty20 World Cup opener against the Netherlands in Colombo.
Tariq, who has played three T20 Internationals since his debut against South Africa in November, has been reported twice for a suspect bowling action in the Pakistan Super League. His bowling style culminates in him pausing near the crease before firing the ball in with a side-arm sling-shot action.
The 28-year-old claimed two wickets in his second T20 International, against Australia, and Australia batsman Cameron Green — one of his two victims in that match in Lahore — made a chucking gesture after being dismissed as he made his way off.
“I don’t understand why we are talking about his action because in my opinion it is a fair action,” Salman told reporters.
“He has been tested twice and he has been cleared,” he said.
“I think there is no problem in his action. Yes, he is the X factor of the team, and where we feel that we need an X factor, we will definitely use him.”
Having decided to boycott their Group A contest against defending champions India after Bangladesh were excluded from the tournament, Pakistan will have little margin for error in their bid to qualify for the Super 8 stage.
Apart from India, the group also contains the United States, who stunned Pakistan via the Super Over in the 2024 edition of the tournament.
Salman said they would have to be at their best even against second-tier teams like Namibia or the Netherlands.
“It is very important because you haven’t played much against these sides and you don’t really know their strength and weaknesses,” he said.
“So it is very, very important to bring your A game, and we as a team only think about how we can execute our plans for 40 overs.”</p><small>2026-02-06 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0613323180c5b3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971417/trump-rejects-putin-offer-of-one-year-extension-of-new-start-deployment-limits' target='_blank'><strong>Trump rejects Putin offer of one-year extension of New START deployment limits</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Thursday rejected an offer from his Russian counterpart to voluntarily extend the caps on strategic nuclear weapons deployments after the treaty that held them in check expired.
“Rather than extend ‘New START … we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved and modernised Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.







Arms control advocates warn that the expiration of the treaty will fuel an accelerated nuclear arms race, while US opponents say the pact constrained the US ability to deploy enough weapons to deter nuclear threats posed by both Russia and China.
Trump’s post was in response to a proposal by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the sides to adhere for a year to the 2010 accord’s limit of 1,550 warheads on 700 delivery systems — missiles, aircraft and submarines.
New START was the last in a series of arms control treaties between the world’s two largest nuclear weapons powers dating back more than half a century to the Cold War. It allowed for only a single extension, which Putin and former US President Joe Biden agreed to for five years in 2021.
In his post, Trump called New START “a badly negotiated deal” that he said “is being grossly violated,” an apparent reference to Putin’s 2023 decision to halt on-site inspections and other measures designed to reassure each side that the other was complying with the treaty.
Putin cited US support for Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion as the reason for his decision.
White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the US would continue talks with Russia.
Both sides signals openness to talks
Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was still ready to engage in dialogue with the US if Washington responded constructively to Putin’s proposal.
“Listen, if there are any constructive replies, of course we will conduct a dialogue,” Peskov told reporters.
The UN has urged both sides to restore the treaty.



Besides setting numerical limits on weapons, New START included inspection regimes experts say served to build a level of trust and confidence between the nuclear adversaries, helping make the world safer.
If nothing replaces the treaty, security analysts see a more dangerous environment with a higher risk of miscalculation. Forced to rely on worst-case assumptions about the other’s intentions, the US and Russia would see an incentive to increase their arsenals, especially as China plays catch-up with its own rapid nuclear build-up.
Trump has said he wants to replace New START with a better deal, bringing in China. But Beijing has declined negotiations with Moscow and Washington.
It has a fraction of their warhead numbers — an estimated 600, compared with around 4,000 each for Russia and the US Repeating that position on Thursday, China said the expiration of the treaty was regrettable, and urged the US to resume dialogue with Russia on “strategic stability.”
Uncertainly over treaty expiry date
There was confusion over the exact timing of the expiry, but Peskov said it would be at the end of Thursday.
Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Moscow’s assumption was that the treaty no longer applied and both sides were free to choose their next steps.
It said Russia was prepared to take “decisive military-technical countermeasures to mitigate potential additional threats to national security” but was also open to diplomacy.
That warning was in apparent response to the possibility that Trump could expand US nuclear deployments by reversing steps taken to comply with New START, including reloading warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched missiles from which they were removed.
A bipartisan congressionally appointed commission in 2023 recommended that the US develop plans to reload some or all of its reserve warheads, saying the country should prepare to fight simultaneous wars with Russia and China.
Ukraine, which has been at war with Russia since Moscow’s 2022 invasion, said the treaty’s expiry was a consequence of Russian efforts to achieve the “fragmentation of the global security architecture” and called it “another tool for nuclear blackmail to undermine international support for Ukraine.”
Strategic nuclear weapons are the long-range systems that each side would use to strike the other’s capital, military and industrial centres in the event of a nuclear war.
They differ from so-called tactical nuclear weapons that have a lower yield and are designed for limited strikes or battlefield use. If left unconstrained by any agreement, Russia and the US could each, within a couple of years, deploy hundreds more warheads, experts say.
“Transparency and predictability are among the more intangible benefits of arms control and underpin deterrence and strategic stability,” said Karim Haggag, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p><small>2026-02-06 09:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06113003f75b2df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971406/at-least-six-injured-by-stray-kite-string-as-basant-festivities-kick-off-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>At least six injured by stray kite string as Basant festivities kick off in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: As Basant festivities kicked off on Friday after an 18-year hiatus, at least six kite-flying-related injuries have been reported in the city so far.
In December last year, the Punjab government lifted the ban on kite flying and allowed the celebration of Basant with strict regulations. The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.

 

In the first incident, a 21-year-old man sustained injuries around his neck after coming in contact with a stray kite string in Lahore’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The young man was returning home from a local market on a bike when the string became entangled around his neck, leaving visible deep wounds.
However, a police official claimed that the injured person was riding the bike without a safety rod.
Earlier, the government had instructed the motorcyclists to install protective steel wires to shield themselves from stray kite twine to prevent any tragic incident.
The police official said that Rescue 1122 reached the site of the incident, where the injured person was provided first aid and rushed to a hospital, where he underwent surgery.
He added that the injured person was now in stable condition.
Orders have been issued to launch an investigation into the matter and investigate the string’s quality.
In another incident, a 45-year old man suffered multiple injuries to his face and neck after a kite string fell on him while he was riding a bike.
Rescue 1122 officials rushed the injured man to a hospital.
A police official indicated that the injured men would be investigated for taking their bikes on roads without safety wires despite repeated warnings.
He added that the act would be dealt with as a violation of standard SoPs.
In a separate incident, an eight-year-old girl sustained throat injuries when a kite string fell on her in Lahore’s Gulshan-e-Ravi area, police said.
In other incidents, two youngsters suffered injuries from kite strings in the city.
Another man fell from the roof of his house in the Ravi Road area, suffering multiple injuries.
The festival is set to run till February 8.

 

Basant Panchami, with ‘panchami’ meaning the fifth day of the lunar month Magh, is a celebration of future crop prosperity, spring, and good luck.
Under the new Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, the manufacturing of only thread-based kite strings will be allowed, and the use of metallic, chemical-coated, or sharp strings is strictly banned.</p><small>2026-02-06 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06115358dbf3392.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971404/us-expresses-solidarity-after-balochistan-attacks-says-it-stands-steadfast-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>US expresses solidarity after Balochistan attacks, says it stands ‘steadfast’ with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The United States on Friday expressed solidarity with Pakistan following recent militant attacks in Balochistan, reiterating its support for efforts to bring those responsible to justice.
In a post on X, the US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA) said it stood “steadfast with Pakistan” in the wake of the attacks, which it described as “horrific”.







The bureau noted that the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) remains a designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).
In August last year, the US State Department added the BLA and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, to its FTO list, according to a press release.
FTO designations are made by the secretary of state, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and “are an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business”.
“We support efforts to hold the perpetrators of these horrific attacks accountable,” the SCA added.
Earlier on Thursday, security forces concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The military’s media wing said the operation was launched following a spate of coordinated attacks across the province on January 31, which disrupted normal life in several areas. The ISPR said the intelligence-based operations targeted what it described as Indian-sponsored terrorist elements.
According to the ISPR, 36 civilians, including women and children, were killed during the violence, while 22 security forces and law enforcement personnel also lost their lives. It added that a substantial cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered during the operations.
The attacks have also drawn condemnation from the United Nations, with UN officials earlier expressing concern over the violence and stressing the need to hold those responsible accountable.</p><small>2026-02-06 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0612181968d9ea4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971408/train-services-suspended-once-again-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Train services suspended once again in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Train services were once again suspended in Balochistan on Friday, a day after resuming, following a five-day suspension in the wake of a spate of attacks in the province.
Spokesperson of Pakistan Railways Quetta division, Muhammad Kashif, in a statement, said that Jaffar Express (from Quetta to Peshawar) and Karachi-bound Bolan Mail had been suspended again.
“The passenger train to Chaman also remains suspended,” he added.
A day earlier, train services were restored in Balochistan as the security situation improved.
Authorities had also said on Thursday that mobile internet services remained suspended in many parts of Balochistan, but Quetta was expected to be back online on Friday (today).
On Thursday, after several days of “mop-up” actions in parts of the province following the January 31 attacks, the military announced that security forces successfully concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 36 civilians, including women and children, and 22 security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel were martyred.

Canberra has been seeking to bolster its military power in the Asia-Pacific region to counter China’s growing influence.
Indonesia has proven more cautious with its foreign policy, not wanting to be seen taking sides and upsetting Beijing, its biggest trading partner.
Albanese hailed the agreement as “a historic moment in our nations’ relationship”.
“Australia and Indonesia share one of the world’s longest maritime boundaries, which naturally makes us close partners. But today, we are more than just partners, we are close friends,” he added.
Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto said the new treaty reflects a “firm commitment to the good neighbour principle” and Indonesia’s “free and active” foreign policy.
“We believe that this agreement will be one of the important pillars for stability and cooperation in our region,” Prabowo said.

Albanese is on his fifth official visit to Indonesia, which is due to conclude Saturday.
He had described the treaty as a “major extension of our security and defence cooperation” and praised Indonesia’s growing investment in Australia.
The treaty builds on a 2024 defence pact, which pledged closer cooperation in the contested Asia-Pacific region.

“On reported presence of khwarij, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in Orakzai District. During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen khwarij were sent to hell,” said the ISPR, adding that “ten more khwarij were effectively neutralised” in Khyber.
Following the engagements, security forces conducted sanitization operations in the areas “to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area”.
The military’s media wing added that the counter-terrorism operation “under [the] vision [of] “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Earlier in January, 11 terrorists were killed in two separate IBOs in KP.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.</p><small>2026-02-06 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0609001715164e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971391/moonis-alvi-tenders-resignation-as-ke-ceo' target='_blank'><strong>Moonis Alvi tenders resignation as KE CEO</strong></a><br><p>K-Electric (KE) Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi on Friday stepped down from his position, according to a disclosure submitted to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX).
In July last year, the provincial ombudsman for protection against harassment of women ordered the removal of Alvi for harassing a former chief marketing and communication officer of KE and also directed him to pay Rs2.5 million to the complainant in compensation.
Alvi, however, had denied the charges and vowed to challenge the decision of the ombudsman before an appropriate legal forum.
“Syed Moonis Abdullah Alvi has tendered his resignation from the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of K-Electric Limited,” stated the disclosure, dated February 6, submitted to the PSX and available to Dawn.
The PSX was informed in “accordance with Section 96 and Section 131 of the Securities Act, 2015 and Clause 5.6.1(a) of the Rule Book of Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited”.
“You are requested to disseminate the information to the TRE Certificate Holders of the Exchange accordingly,” said the form, addressing the chief listing manager at PSX.
In a post on X, Alvi confirmed that he had “decided to step down”.







“It has been an honour to serve an institution so central to Karachi’s life, alongside some of the most resilient and committed professionals I know,” said the former KE CEO, adding that he will “support a smooth transition”.
Following the provincial ombudsman’s decision in July 2025, the KE chief approached the Sindh High Court (SHC), which suspended the ombudsman’s order.
In a subsequent hearing in August last year, the SHC extended its stay against the provincial ombudsman’s decision.
Alvi had also filed a representation/appeal before Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori. On February 3, the governor set aside the order of the provincial ombudsman.
Tessori, after hearing both sides and examining the record, overturned the impugned order.
During the hearing, Alvi argued that the complaint was not maintainable and there was no harassment involved, while the order passed by the ombudsman was based on assumptions.
The complainant in her arguments stated that the findings of the ombudsman’s order were correct and in accordance with law, and there was no requirement under the law to approach any other authority by filing a complaint, and therefore, the question of maintainability did not arise.

Speaking to Dawn from London, Mani — who has also served as the head of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) — said that being the current ICC chief, Jay Shah should not only speak to Mohsin Naqvi to defuse tensions, but also save world cricket from potential financial losses.
“He should go to Pakistan to convince the government to end the boycott and also listen to their grievances,” he said.
Asked about media that the ICC had appointed Deputy Chairman Imran Khawaja to negotiate with the PCB, Mani said that Khawaja represented associate member Singapore, and was not the right man to deal with the matter. “It is better for the ICC chairman to deal with the government of Pakistan on his own.”

 

He was of the opinion that if the government of Pakistan had taken such a bold step, it must have some solid grounds, in case the matter is moved before the ICC’s Arbitration Comm­ittee in the future.
“There may be some weakness in Pakistan’s case, because the ICC shifted Pakistan’s matches from India to Sri Lanka (under the hybrid model), but a competent legal team can argue it effectively.”

 

It is possible, he opined, that India — holding much sway over the ICC — may get a decision in its favour from the arbitration committee, like what happened in 2018.
“If the ICC again fails to deliver justice to Pakistan, [and chooses to] please India, we have the right to take it to the World Court of Arbitration in Switzerland. There, Pakistan will have every chance to win the case because there are many incidents, which are enough to prove politics is involved in the ICC’s affairs,” Mani said.
When asked about the potential financial losses due if the India-Pakistan match doesn’t go ahead, Mani said that while the match yields massive revenues for the ICC, Pakistan only gets 5.75 per cent against India’s hefty share 38.5pc from the income of the game’s governing body.
“This is the time for Pakistan to fight for an end to politics in the ICC. [They] did not take any action against India when they [spoilt] the gentleman’s game by refusing to shake hands with the Pakistan team [at the Asia Cup]. The ICC did not take any action when the Indian team refused to accept the Asia Cup trophy from ACC Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, just because he is a Pakistani.”
“The boycott of India-Pakistan match may be a violation of members’ participating agreement (signed between PCB and the ICC), but the negative attitude of the BCCI is to blame, which forced Pakistan to take such a big decision,” he said.

The latest charges bring the total number of people arrested in connection with the investigation to seven.
The charges relate to attacks on properties in Cambridge and Chesham in late December 2025 and form part of a wider counter-terrorism investigation being led by Counter Terrorism Policing London. Although the police statement did not name the victims, earlier reports indicate that the arrests are linked to attacks reported by former Imran Khan adviser Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber-blogger Adil Raja.

 

Adil Raja’s home was targeted on December 24, 2025, while Shahzad Akbar’s residence was attacked on December 24 and 31, 2025, and again on January 10, 2026.
Following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service, Asaf Afsar, 38, of Birmingham; Liam McGarry, 24, of Warwickshire; and Mark Regan, 52, also of Birmingham, were charged on February 4 with conspiracy to assault and to occasion bodily harm.
Mr Afsar and Mr Regan face two counts each, linked to incidents in both Chesham and Cambridge on December 24, 2025. Mr McGarry was charged with one count relating to the Cambridge incident on the same date.
All three men were in police custody and appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday.
The men were arrested a day earlier, on February 3, as part of what police described as an “ongoing investigation” into alleged coordinated attacks.
Two other men, aged 55 and 30, were also arrested in Birmingham and London, respectively, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit assault and criminal damage. Both have since been released on bail until May while inquiries continue.
Police said the arrests in the West Midlands and Warwickshire were carried out with support from local forces and Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. Officers also conducted five searches across the West Midlands, Warwickshire and London.
The latest charges bring the total number of people charged in the investigation to seven. Four other men were previously charged and are due to appear at the Old Bailey on Feb 13.

Ms Jan, a former federal secretary for information, was selected by the parliamentary panel as Pemra chairperson. If her appointment is approved, she will be the first woman to head the authority.
According to a reliable source, Ambreen Jan’s confirmation has been held up due to “objections regarding security clearance”.
Ms Jan is a former Grade-22 officer and has served as information secretary, the director general of Radio Pakistan and as managing director of PTV.
She also served as press counsellor in Bangladesh from 2011 to 2018, when Islamabad-Dhaka ties were under strain.
She was among the five shortlisted candidates considered for the Pemra job, along with retired Brigadier Anwar Ahmed, journalist Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf and Dr Hamid Khan.
The final shortlist narrowed the choice to three candidates, omitting the names of Irfan Ashraf and Hamid Khan.
Under an amendment made to Pemra Act, a parliamentary committee consisting of four members — two each from the National Assembly and the Senate — will recommend a candidate for appointment as head of the regulator.
The Treasury benches and the opposition will have one member each from the National Assembly and the Senate.
The parliamentary committee finalised and recommended the candidate for appointment by the President over a month ago, but the file is awaiting onward transmission to the Presidency from the Prime Minister’s Office.
Saleem Baig, the previous Pemra chairman, was also an officer of the Information Group. He was appointed in 2018 and reappointed in 2022.
Mr Baig retired in September last year after becoming the longest serving head of the Authority. His predecessor, Absar Alam, was removed from the post by the Lahore High Court in 2017.
Regulator’s mandate
Pemra was established under the Pemra Ordinance 2002 to facilitate and regulate the private electronic media.
It has mandate to improve the standards of information, education and entertainment and to facilitate dissemination of information related to current affairs, religious matters, art, culture as well as science and technology.
The key segments regulated by Pemra include Direct to Home (DTH) broadcasting, satellite television, landing rights permission (LRP), FM Radio and Cable TV.

It was learnt on Thursday that  the SMBBMU registrar had last month approached the PMDC and drew his attention to the seats in the private  institutions going vacant as candidates failed in meeting the criteria  of the admission. 
In a letter, he stated that approximately 350  MBBS seats remained vacant due to the failure of aspirants in meeting  the existing PMDC criteria. 
It said the SMBBMU, Larkana, has received multiple requests from  private medical and dental colleges, expressing serious concern over the  inability to fill those seats despite repeated admission rounds.

SMBBMU seeks 10pc reduction for MBBS and BDS programmes

The  registrar said that during the previous academic year, the passing  criteria for MBBS and BDS admissions were reduced by five per cent in  order to fill the vacant seats in the private sector medical and dental  colleges. That measure proved effective in facilitating admissions and  preventing the wastage of precious seats. The current criteria fixed by  the PMDC for the admissions in MBBS is 55pc passing marks while for BDS  it is 50pc. 
The letter highlighted that during the current  academic session, the number of eligible candidates was even lower than  the last year while the number of vacant seats was comparatively higher.  Consequently, the prevailing circumstances warranted a greater  relaxation in the passing criteria than that allowed previously, it  added.
The SMBBMU registrar recommended a 10pc reduction in the  passing marks’ criteria. For MBBS minimum passing criteria should be  reduced to 45pc and for BDS to 40pc, the communication said. 
This  proposed adjustment was essential to ensure optimal utilisation of  available seats, continuity of academic activities and safeguard the  interests of the institutions and aspiring students while maintaining  reasonable academic standards and contributing to the fulfillment of  healthcare service needs of Sindh, the registrar added.
The copies  of the letter were also sent to the secretary health, Government of  Sindh, LUMHS, Jamshoro, vice chancellor, and the chairperson Supervising  & Steering Committee, Sindh. 
When contacted, SMBBMU Vice  Chancellor Prof Dr Nusrat Shah on Thursday confirmed sending the letter  and added that so far no response was received from the PMDC.
