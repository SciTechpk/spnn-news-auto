“Our forces are on high-alert to combat any attacks,” Chaudhry told Reuters.
“You know the militants always react whenever we go after their hideouts in Afghanistan.”
Pakistan carried out air strikes on targets in Afghanistan over the weekend on what it said were militant targets responsible for a spate of recent suicide bombings on Pakistani soil.
Islamabad blames Kabul for allowing the fighters to use Afghanistan as a safe haven. Kabul denies the charges, saying the militancy is Pakistan’s internal problem.
Pakistani and Afghan forces exchanged fire along their border on Tuesday, with each side accusing the other of initiating the clash.
There have also been a number of militant attacks, including the ambush of a police vehicle in Kohat in which five officers and two civilians were killed and a suicide bombing at a checkpoint that killed two policemen.
Chaudhry said the retaliatory attacks by militants proved Islamabad’s case that they had linkages in Afghanistan, adding that the forces had averted several attacks in recent weeks and arrested a number of suspects, including Afghans.
Security forces have accelerated search and intelligence based operations and “have arrested dozens of suspected militants, their handlers and their facilitators,” the minister said.
Multiple sources added that Pakistan’s intelligence agencies have issued alerts for a possible surge in terror attacks in Pakistan in coming days.
Urban centres, markets, security forces and places of worship could be possible targets, according to the alerts, the sources said.
“We have been given a strong caution about more terror attacks in our official communications. In this regard, we have almost doubled our search operations across Pakistan,” said an intelligence official.
Militancy is a growing problem for Pakistan with the number of attacks rising every year since 2022, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), a global monitoring organisation.
Data from ACLED shows attacks in Pakistan rose nearly fourfold to 2,425 in 2025 from 658 in 2022 and over the same period, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) attacks increased more than seven-fold to 838 from 118.</p><small>2026-02-25 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25163221421df56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975678/imf-mission-opens-talks-with-central-bank-on-pakistans-loan-programmes' target='_blank'><strong>IMF mission opens talks with central bank on Pakistan’s loan programmes</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: An International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission led by Iva Petrova on Wednesday began technical-level discussions with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in Karachi for the third review of the $7bn Extended Financing Facility (EFF) and the second review of the $1.1bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
The mission will remain in Karachi this week and begin policy discussions with the federal and provincial governments on Monday, with the customary opening roundup with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.
The minister on Wednesday said the government was well-positioned for a successful review of its loan programmes.
Talking briefly to journalists after a parliamentary committee meeting, the minister said the government was also in a good position on collections by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).

 

Responding to a question, he said there was “absolutely no issue” with the rollover of the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) safe deposits with the central bank and the sides were in constant contact.
The UAE’s $2bn deposit, usually rolled over on an annual basis, had expired more than two months ago and has since been on short-term rollovers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also spoke about the matter during a media talk, assuring that the UAE’s $2bn deposit would be rolled over.
“Talks are ongoing with the UAE government regarding the rollover,” he said, adding that the deposits would be “automatically rolled over”.
Pakistan has been dependent on continuous annual rollovers of safe deposits from China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as $12.5bn from these countries form part of the foreign financing needs under the EFF.
During the almost two-week review by the IMF mission, ending March 11, the engagements will be of greater significance as both sides will also discuss programme performance for the half-year ending December 31, 2025.
Further, forward-looking preparations, including budget proposals based on the performance for this year and the setting up of broad contours of the upcoming budget will also come under discussion.

 

This would involve provincial reviews for now and the future, particularly those relating to provincial finances, including agriculture income tax and governance-related challenges, as well as an action plan to address those weaknesses causing trillions of rupees worth of economic losses.
In this regard, procurement and accountability agencies would be under added scrutiny, including their independence, institutional capacities, processes and performances.
The programme’s performance as of the end of December 2025 — the period under review — has mostly been up to the mark, albeit with a revenue shortfall, which authorities believe can be reduced following a recent decision by the Federal Constitutional Court regarding the super tax, which was in the government’s favour.
The two sides will also review all macroeconomic indicators for the third quarter still in progress.
The power sector will also remain under added scrutiny given volatile policymaking in the recent months, including those relating to the industrial sector, residential fixed charges and so on, although circular debt numbers are within the target range.
On the positive side, Pakistan has met almost all quantitative performance criteria for the period under review. However, it is lagging behind in indicative targets and structural benchmarks, which could affect future programme implementation.
Given the biannual reviews of the $7bn EFF and the $1.1bn RSF, the two sides will have to agree on past performance and forward-looking implementation plans.
Upon the successful completion of the review, Pakistan will be eligible for the disbursement of about $1bn under the EFF and another $200m under the RSF by the end of April.
On the technical side, Pakistan will likely meet almost all seven quantitative performance indicators.
Net international reserves are likely to remain slightly lower than the $7bn benchmark for September 2025 and below $6bn for December 2025 against the $6.5bn benchmark.
The central bank’s net domestic assets are estimated at around Rs12.5-13.5 trillion, versus the ceiling target of Rs14.9-15.1tr for September and December 2025.
It should be mentioned that the lending agency’s spokesperson said last week that policy efforts undertaken by Pakistan under the EFF had “helped stabilise the economy and rebuild confidence”.</p><small>2026-02-25 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2517521903f264f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975656/indias-modi-lands-in-israel-to-strengthen-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Modi lands in Israel to ‘strengthen cooperation’</strong></a><br><p>India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Israel on Wednesday for a two-day visit aimed at deepening ties with a key trade and defence partner, a trip that has drawn criticism at home.
It is Modi’s second visit to Israel as prime minister.
In a post on X, the Indian prime minister said that he has landed in Israel.
“I am extremely honoured to be received by Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mrs Netanyahu at the airport. I look forward to engaging in bilateral discussions and fruitful outcomes that strengthen the India-Israel friendship,” he added.







In a statement prior to his departure, Modi said, “Our nations share a robust and multifaceted strategic partnership”. He also said he would meet Netanyahu and address the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.
“Ties have significantly strengthened in the last few years.”
New Delhi has steadily expanded co-operation with Israel across the defence, agriculture, technology and cyber-security sectors while balancing diplomatic interests in the Middle East.
Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that total merchandise trade was $3.62 billion in 2024–2025.
Modi said he would hold talks with Netanyahu to “discuss ways to strengthen co-operation”, as well as meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
Herzog replied to him on X, saying that the state and the people of Israel looked forward to welcoming him.







Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1992. Ties deepened after Hindu-nationalist leader Modi took office in 2014.
Modi visited Israel as prime minister in 2017, before Netanyahu made a reciprocal visit to India the following year.
Both right-wing leaders have called each other a “friend”.







In September 2023, grand plans were unveiled in New Delhi for an India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor – to link railways, ports, electricity, data networks and pipelines, including through Saudi Arabia and Israel.
Those plans were stalled by Hamas’s October 7 actions against Israel, which responded with a devastating war in the Gaza Strip, killing over 71,000 Palestinians.
One of India’s largest conglomerates, Adani Group, operates the Mediterranean port of Haifa, while Israeli military drone technology was deployed against Pakistan during the conflict between the two nuclear powers in May 2025.
At the same time, India maintains strong relations with Gulf nations and Tehran, including developing Iran’s Chabahar port — a trade gateway to Afghanistan, where New Delhi has built a relationship with Taliban authorities.
Modi displaying ‘moral cowardice’: Congress
On the other hand, the opposition Indian National Congress launched a scathing attack on Modi over his visit to Israel.
Senior Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi — sister of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi — said she hoped Modi would mention the killing of “thousands of innocent men, women and children in Gaza” when he addresses Israel’s parliament and demand “justice for them”.
“India has stood for what is right throughout our history as an independent nation, we must continue to show the light of truth, peace and justice to the world,” she said on X.







Congress parliamentarian Jairam Ramesh said Modi will be displaying “moral cowardice” when the entire world is critical of his “dear friend” Netanyahu.
He said Modi was “brazenly embracing” his Israeli counterpart, who has “reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and who is orchestrating the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank”.
“On May 20, 1960, Jawaharlal Nehru was in Gaza and met with the Indian contingent of the UN Emergency Force there,” Ramesh recalled.







Days ago, Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus and unnamed Arab, African, and Asian countries as part of a “hexagon of alliances” against “radical axes” of Muslim nations.
India, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4bn people, is majority Hindu, but an estimated 220 million Indians are Muslim.

A day earlier, the PTI founder was taken to the hospital for follow-up treatment of his eye ailment, which came to light in late January. However, his party took exception to the ‘secrecy’ surrounding this procedure and the complete exclusion of family members from this process.
The opposition has also repeatedly demanded that cases of the incarcerated PTI founder be fixed for an early hearing.
Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Aleema said the health of the PTI founder was the family’s primary concern and insisted that no decision regarding his treatment should be made without their permission.
Referring to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s statement from February 17 regarding Imran’s health, she said the minister had publicly claimed that Imran had received medical treatment, but no one from the party leadership could confirm the nature of that treatment.
In his statement, Naqvi had also accu­sed Aleema of trying to exploit her incarcerated brother’s health issues for political gains.
“Why doesn’t anyone deny or confirm what treatment was carried out?” Aleema asked.
She alleged that the family had recommended doctors, including Dr Asim, Dr Uzma Khan and Dr Barki, for examination at Shifa International Hospital. Still, their names were either rejected, or no response was given.
She claimed the family later learned that treatment had been conducted at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) and that they were kept unaware of developments.
“We were demanding treatment at Shifa International Hospital. Instead, we were sent to jail when we raised the issue,” she said.
She further alleged that pressure was being exerted on government doctors and said the family would no longer communicate concerns in closed-door meetings but would raise them publicly.
Aleema also questioned the silence of senior PTI lawyers and office-bearers, naming Hamid Khan, Ali Zafar, Latif Khosa and Barrister Gohar, and asked why they were not actively pursuing the founder’s cases.
“Where are the senior lawyers who were given party tickets? The founder repeatedly asked them to get his cases filed,” she said.
She claimed that information about meetings and medical arrangements was coming from Naqvi instead of party representatives. “Will we get information from the minister or from our own party?” she asked.
Expressing frustration, she remarked that the party appeared “as relaxed as if Imran Khan has been treated,” adding that if anyone could not bear the burden of the PTI founder’s narrative, they should step aside.
On the matter of the delay in cases being fixed, Aleema said the PTI founder had been coming to court for the past 13 months to pursue his cases, but hurdles were being created.
“We come and sit in court for hours, but cases are not fixed,” she said, adding that on one occasion, when Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi appeared in court and attempted to speak, the chief justice left the courtroom.
Aleema maintained that the “chair of justice” existed to provide relief to the people and claimed that courts elsewhere in the world did not function in such a manner.
Separately, senior lawyer Salman Akram Raja told the media that court orders regarding meetings with the PTI founder were not being implemented.
He added the IHC had ordered two weekly meetings — one for lawyers and one for family members — but alleged that meetings were not arranged despite the appearance of the KP chief minister.
Raja further claimed that contempt petitions filed over non-compliance were not heard and that the high court had become a “closed door” for the party. He added that applications for medical examination had also not been taken up.
“In one case related to [X account], the court directed that we meet the party founder and file a response. How can we file a reply without meeting him?” he questioned, alleging that proceedings continued without facilitating the meeting.

 

Raja said the party would approach the Supreme Court if relief was not granted.
KP CM also spoke to reporters, saying he had attempted to address Chief Justice Dogar in open court but was not heard.
“I went to the rostrum while fasting and greeted the chief justice, but he did not respond,” he said, adding that PTI wanted to demonstrate peaceful protest rather than agitation.
Meanwhile, Barrister Salman Safdar said that if bail cases were not fixed for hearing, the matter would be taken directly to the SC. Later, the IHC administration fixed an early hearing plea for Thursday.
Gohar acknowledges communication gap within party leadership
Separately, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan also arrived at the IHC. Addressing the media upon his arrival, Gohar said that the party leadership had decided to pursue its cases before the Supreme Court of Pakistan, and he had made an appearance there before arriving at the IHC.
He acknowledged a communication gap within the party leadership but stressed that all leaders were making sincere and coordinated efforts to secure Imran’s release.
The PTI chairman also congratulated the newly elected office-bearers of the Islamabad High Court Journalists Association, saying that “dynamic individuals are stepping forward” to lead the journalist community.
In a conversation with IHCJA President Asad Malik and General Secretary Asif Naveed, Gohar assured the association of his party’s full support on issues facing journalists.
“Wherever you encounter difficulties, we will raise our voice and extend our cooperation wherever it is required,” he said, adding that PTI would stand by the journalist community in its struggle for rights and professional freedom.
He further stated that his party would raise its voice against the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), particularly regarding concerns about restrictions on freedom of expression.
Gohar maintained that the PTI would continue to advocate for journalists’ rights, especially against what he described as language restrictions imposed on media personnel, reiterating that freedom of expression is indispensable for a democratic society.
He also assured journalists that the party would take up the issue of the unannounced and prolonged ban on Dawn’s advertisements in Parliament, terming it a curtailment of press freedom.</p><small>2026-02-25 12:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2517474996bb513.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975677/italian-minister-says-decision-to-issue-10500-work-visas-for-pakistanis-aimed-at-promoting-legal-migration' target='_blank'><strong>Italian minister says decision to issue 10,500 work visas for Pakistanis aimed at promoting ‘legal migration’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi reiterated a decision made last year to issue visas to over 10,000 skilled Pakistani workers, saying that it was aimed at promoting “legal migration”.
Italy would issue 10,500 work visas for Pakistan’s skilled workers to promote “legal migration”, he said during a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in Rome, according to a statement issued by the interior ministry.
In December last year, an agreement was reached between Pakistan and Italy, under which the latter had allocated a labour quota for the former.
According to the agreement, 10,500 Pakis­tani workers will be provided employment in various sectors in Italy, including ship brea­king, hospitality, healthcare and agriculture.
Each year, 3,500 Pakistani workers will sec­ure overseas jobs under seasonal and non-seasonal quotas, as per the agreement.
Visa-free entry for diplomatic passport holders
During the meeting, it was also decided that Pakistani diplomatic passport holders would be allowed visa-free entry to Italy.
This decision, the statement said, was taken at Naqvi’s request.
It added that the Italian minister recalled that his Pakistani counterpart had raised this matter at a previous meeting.
Discussion on illegal immigration
Moreover, the two sides reviewed internal security cooperation between Pakistan and Italy, as well as measures to curb illegal immigration during the meeting, the statement said.
The two ministers also discussed enhancing cooperation in combating narcotics trafficking, human smuggling, and terrorism, it said, adding that  both sides appreciated the ongoing measures to prevent illegal immigration and human smuggling.
Naqvi apprised his counterpart of the measures taken by the Pakistani government to curb illegal immigration, elaborating that strict monitoring at airports and maritime borders had led to a “significant reduction” in the practice.
For his part, the Italian minister appreciated Pakistan’s “effective policies” for addressing the issue of illegal immigration, the statement said, adding that he also commended the achievements of Pakistani institutions in tackling illegal immigration, human smuggling, and drug trafficking.
“Both sides agreed to enhance mutual cooperation to promote legal migration, and the Italian interior minister reaffirmed his country’s readiness to expand cooperation with Pakistan in areas of shared interest,” according to the statement.
During the meeting, officers from Punjab police also briefed the participants on the utility and effectiveness of the Police Khidmat Markaz Global initiative.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to Italy, Ali Javed, Federal Investigation Agency Director General Dr Usman Anwar, Punjab Safe City Authority Managing Director Ahsan Younas and senior police officers were also present at the meeting.</p><small>2026-02-25 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25172031c71d6b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975681/e-visas-introduced-for-pakistanis-travelling-to-uk' target='_blank'><strong>E-visas introduced for Pakistanis travelling to UK</strong></a><br><p>Pakistanis, including tourists, travelling to the United Kingdom (UK) will now be able to do so with an e-visa, receiving confirmation by email rather than stickers in passports, according to a statement issued by the British High Commission on Wednesday.
In July 2025, the UK government introduced an e-visa system for Pakistanis; however, it was limited to study or work visas. Applicants applying for general visitor visas were still required to obtain a physical visa.
In the statement released on Wednesday, the high commission said visitors would continue to submit their applications online and attend a visa application centre to provide biometrics.
It said that successful applicants would have a digital record of their immigration status provided through an e-visa, accessible through an online UK Visas and Immigration account.
“It means applicants no longer need to attend a visa application centre a second time to collect their passport, instead holding on to it after their biometrics session,” the commission said.
It said that e-visas provided a more secure way to manage immigration status and reduce the risk of lost or damaged documents.
“Applicants can generate a share code to prove their visa status at borders and elsewhere. There is no change to visa processing times, eligibility criteria or conditions,” it said.
The statement also quoted British High Commissioner Jane Marriott as saying that this was a “hugely exciting step” for Pakistanis travelling to the UK.
“As well as being able to save time by holding on to your passport, the new share code system makes it easier than ever to demonstrate your visa status,” she said.
Separately, in a video message posted on her X account on Wednesday, Marriot said that “nearly all visitors going to the UK can now use the new e-visa service when they travel”.







She said that under the new system, travellers will be able to keep their passports with them as they will not be required to hand them in.
She added that the “major difference is that you get to keep your passport with you and you no longer need to visit a visa centre for a second time (to pick up your passport)”.
She further said that “the process and application timelines have not changed”.
In 2024, the UK government had announced that the country’s immigration system was transitioning to a fully digital format, replacing physical documents with an online immigration system.</p><small>2026-02-25 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25164204253b1e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975679/56-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-islamabad-parts-of-kp' target='_blank'><strong>5.6-magnitude earthquake jolts Islamabad, parts of KP</strong></a><br><p>A 5.6-magnitude earthquake jolted Islamabad and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Wednesday.
The tremors were felt in Peshawar, Chitral, Swat, Swabi, Bajaur, Mardan, Charsadda and Mansehra, DawnNewsTV reported, adding that they were also felt in Islamabad.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the quake struck at 4:12pm at a depth of 114 kilometres. It said the earthquake’s epicentre was Afghanistan’s Hindu Kush region.
The department also added that the quake was felt in Islamabad, Swat, Peshawar and Chitral. Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
Last week, a 5.9-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of KP, with tremors felt in Shangla, Swat, Mardan, Swabi and Nowshera.</p><small>2026-02-25 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25133223d61ba0d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975667/pti-moves-sc-for-imrans-treatment-at-hospital-of-choice-access-to-personal-doctors' target='_blank'><strong>PTI moves SC for Imran’s treatment at hospital of choice, access to personal doctors</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Wednesday approached the Supreme Court seeking the medical treatment of jailed party founder Imran Khan at a hospital of his choice, along with access to his personal physicians.
The application, filed by PTI lawyer Sardar Latif Khosa under Order XXXV Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules 2025, comes after Imran underwent a government-facilitated follow-up treatment for his eye ailment.
The application, available with Dawn, was filed on behalf of Imran and named the Islamabad district election commissioner as the respondent, as it invoked the Toshakhana case in which the PTI founder was first arrested on Aug 5, 2023.
The plea requested the SC that Imran be “immediately shifted to Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad for proper treatment of his eyes from [a] retina specialist”.
It may be mentioned that Shifa International Hospital — where Imran’s family and personal doctors want him to be taken — is in Islamabad, whereas Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital, a doctor of which was involved in Tuesday’s treatment, is located in Rawalpindi.
The plea also sought Imran’s access to his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf, “who may be associated with all the procedures of examination and treatment”.







“It is also prayed that the petitioner’s family members be duly informed and grant reasonable access to them during his medical check-up and treatment,” the application added.
The petition requested that Imran’s lawyer be provided with attested copies of medical reports and checkups carried out regarding the ex-premier.
The lawyer may also be “granted reasonable access to his client for updated instruction for his effective representation before this Honourable court and so as to enable complete justice to the petitioner,” the plea added.
In his application, Khosa highlighted that Imran was 73 years old, adding that “his advancing age and declining health are matters of grave concern not only for his family but for the people of Pakistan at large”.
“The conduct of a medical examination in secrecy, without notice to the family or independent doctors, has given rise to serious apprehensions,” he contended.
Referring to Imran’s Tuesday hospital visit, Khosa pointed out that the procedure was conducted in the absence of the former premier’s personal physicians, family members, and lawyers.
“Nothing is known regarding the outcome of the petitioner’s medical examination and or procedures conducted in Pims hospital. Such secrecy is mindboggling and not acceptable on any hypothesis,” he added.
Following Imran’s follow-up treatment, a hospital doctor stated that the former was “clinically stable”, with Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar also providing details about it to the Senate.
Khosa pointed out that the February 15 examination at Adiala jail, where Imran is imprisoned, was also conducted in the absence of his family members, personal doctors or legal representatives.
He rejected the government’s claims of certain family and party members voluntarily choosing not to come despite being informed as “wholly incorrect and unrealistic”.
“At no stage were the petitioner’s family members, personal physicians, or counsel informed. In fact, when the petitioner’s sisters approached the authorities, they were denied access. Instead, a panel of handpicked doctors was formed to conduct the examination,” the plea asserted.
Khosa recalled that in a February 16 communication through him, Imran requested the Chief Justice of Pakistan, “seeking appropriate orders for compliance of his medical examination and shifting to the Shifa International Hospital for treatment of his ailment as no retina specialist is available in Pims”.
The counsel argued: “The insistence of the petitioner’s treatment from Pims where no retina specialist exists, continued exclusion of the petitioner’s family and personal medical practitioners from information concerning his health has created unavoidable doubts.
“Such secrecy not only undermines confidence in the medical process but is also causing unrest and distress among his family members, friends and supporters,” he argued.
Gohar laments pending cases before IHC
Separately, speaking outside the SC, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said his party’s parliamentarians will go to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday at noon to seek the fixation of Imran’s pending cases.
He highlighted that the PTI has approached the IHC 17 times and the SC 14 times in the past year.
“We have only one demand: fix Khan sahib’s cases, hear them and make decisions based on justice,” Gohar told reporters.
The PTI leader recalled that the party has already moved the SC for Imran’s access to his lawyers in multiple ongoing cases, noting that an application related to his health has now been filed too.
Referring to his meeting with the SC registrar on Tuesday, Gohar said the registrar had told them to file an application for the “next hearing” via the advocate-on-record (AOR).
Subsequently, Gohar added, they submitted an application today via the AOR for fixing the plea regarding Imran’s health and doctors “as soon as possible”.
“I hope that the way the Supreme Court has made a commitment, this plea will be fixed for hearing,” the PTI chairman said.
Barrister Gohar lamented that the pleas regarding the suspension of sentence in the £190m Al-Qadir Trust case and the second Toshakhana case had not been fixed for hearing yet.

 

He highlighted that the Al Qadir case plea had been pending for over a year, even though such cases “should be decided within 35 and 60 days as per the Judicial Policy”.
Gohar noted that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi paid a visit to the IHC today.
However, Gohar said he was “saddened” upon IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar not giving the KP CM a “positive response”.
“We have been told on behalf of the chief justice and the registrar that both the Toshakhana and Al Qadir cases will be fixed for hearing at the IHC tomorrow,” Gohar said.
Imran’s ailment and treatment
Imran’s eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January, with concerns mounting after partial vision loss in one eye was reported via a lawyer who met the incarcerated former premier upon the SC’s intervention.
A report prepared by a team of doctors who visited Imran on February 15 stated that, unaided, Imran’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left.

 

Since then, the government and the opposition have been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, of not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran, and of not allowing his personal physicians access to him.
The government denies these allegations.
Imran’s first medical procedure, which was carried out on January 24, was confirmed by the government five days later. A follow-up visit to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) was made in the early hours of February 24.
The PTI founder’s family, party, and the opposition strongly objected to the manner in which it was carried out, lamenting that they had not been informed in advance.</p><small>2026-02-25 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25132230b19fc19.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975666/6-killed-in-firing-mortar-attack-on-kech-house-dsp' target='_blank'><strong>6 killed in firing, mortar attack on Kech house: DSP</strong></a><br><p>GWADAR: Six people, including the attacker, were killed and four others were injured in a shooting and mortar attack at a house in the Minaz locality of Kech district’s Buleda tehsil, a police official said.
Initially, police sources said six members of a family, including three children, were killed when assailants opened indiscriminate gunfire and launched a mortar strike.
Later, Buleda Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Talal Gichki stated that an attacker was among the six dead in the incident, while four others were injured.
“Firing continued for one and a half hours. During the exchange of fire, a rocket fell on a hut,” the DSP said, adding that the entire residence got burned down as a result.
Over a dozen cattle were also lost as a result of the attack.
Following the incident, security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to trace the attackers.
Police sources said an investigation was under way and the matter was being probed from multiple angles.
On February 16, unidentified armed men shot dead a man from Faisalabad in the Pishukan area of Gwadar.
In November last year, three bullet-riddled bodies, including that of a newly married man, were found in Gwadar’s Tump tehsil. Police said the victim had been kidnapped by unknown armed men and killed after refusing to pay a ransom.</p><small>2026-02-25 11:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25155724329979a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975675/punjab-govt-imposes-30-day-ban-on-flying-drones-outdoors-over-risk-to-public-safety' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt imposes 30-day ban on flying drones outdoors over risk to public safety</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government on Wednesday imposed an “immediate and complete” ban on flying drones outdoors across the province for the next 30 days, citing risk to public safety.
In a notification issued by the Punjab home department, available with Dawn, a complete ban on the outside flying of drones was announced under Section 144 (6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, which is to remain in force “for a period of 30 days from the date of issuance or until withdrawn earlier”.
However, the notification said that the ban did not apply to “use of small drones for coverage of indoor activities, such as in halls or marquees”.
It further added that the ban was also not applicable to “drones used by intelligence and law enforcement agencies”.
The home department noted that “credible reports and prevailing circumstances indicate that the increasing and unregulated use of drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) within the territorial limits of Punjab poses potential risks to public safety, security of public and private property and the maintenance of public order”.
It added that drone activity also “may cause obstruction to official duties, create law and order concerns, and disturb the peaceful atmosphere of the province”.
It termed the ban “essential” in ensuring the “security of the people and installations/buildings against any potential threat or untoward activity, in the larger interest of public safety, security, peace and tranquility and to avoid any untoward incident”.
It is worth mentioning that a day earlier, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz approved the launch of an anti-drone unit in Punjab to combat any terrorist attack, besides directing the installation of the latest digital scanners at the province’s entry and exit points.</p><small>2026-02-25 10:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2515255809d6e8b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975674/a-lonely-baby-monkey-named-punch-broke-the-internet-but-what-does-it-say-about-us' target='_blank'><strong>A lonely baby monkey named Punch broke the Internet, but what does it say about us?</strong></a><br><p>Anyone in need of a good cleansing cry in the last week has only had to peek at TikTok, Reddit or X.
Punch the Japanese macaque’s virality has turned the internet into one big grief support group.
Abandoned by his mother at birth and hand-raised by keepers, the young primate is one of about 60 at Ichikawa City Zoo’s Monkey Mountain exhibit. The humans gave Punch an Ikea orangutan stuffed toy because it provided the comfort and security missing from his life.
The photos and videos of Punch clinging to his toy after other monkeys slapped him away broke the Internet’s collective heart.
Like millions of others, I consumed this sadness porn like it was candy. The sight of this human-looking primate seeking solace did not just evoke pity; people were willing to go to battle for Punch.

Some felt that keepers should intervene and enforce more control over monkey behaviour, or that Punch deserved more toys and his own safe space. Others felt that Monkey Mountain was a concrete abomination, while another camp went further, saying all zoos were inherently cruel.
One commonly seen opinion is that humans will sympathise with an animal half a world away before they care about starving people living down the street.
Another variant: Humans will send money to help pandas, kittens and puppies – or cute monkeys – before they send funds to help other humans in the aftermath of floods or earthquakes.
This comment, many say, is not the “gotcha” that commenters think it is, because humans can care for two things at once. Just because someone sends money to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals or World Wildlife Fund does not mean their wallet is shut when it comes to helping refugees.

Someone can support a cure for breast cancer without calling for kidney patients to be ripped from their dialysis machines.
But the “where is this energy for human victims of real crimes” outcry has some basis in reality.
Having spent enough time online that I consider myself an expert in Internet drama, I should be allowed to say that the global attention paid to Punch speaks volumes.
When was the last time the Internet zoomed in so feverishly on the starving or homeless? Or people left in the rubble of a state-sanctioned bombing campaign?
The drama around Punch says something about the attention economy, the way it fixates on single videos and images at the expense of stuff that does not have a visual hook.
In the early 1980s, the issue of AIDS remained theoretical for many. In 1987, Britain’s late Princess Diana shook hands, without gloves, with an AIDS patient.

The famous handshake photo and, later, images of her holding other patients, did more to raise awareness of AIDS transmission and reduce its stigma than any awareness campaign up to that point.
Punch’s plight could not have been more suited to short-form video if an art director had executed it with a budget of millions.

In under 30 seconds, this microdrama, backed by mournful music, brought so many around the world – including me – to tears, when reams of textual evidence can fail to evoke pity for victims of genocide, ban guns or bring paedophiles to justice.

This small but perfectly packaged tearjerker even came with a call-to-action mission in the form of an affordable Ikea orangutan, sold out in many parts of the world.
That emotional manipulation is possible with a single image is not lost on the public relations industry, which places the adorable children of a leader in front of him when he makes an on-camera apology for a grievous lapse in judgment.
The World Wildlife Fund has a panda, not a salamander or an endangered fish, as its mascot. What is also interesting is how humans insert themselves into a monkey-on-monkey incident.
Punch, like every social animal, has to learn where he stands in the tribal pecking order. That discipline looks like purposeful malice when it is hard-wired instinct.

The fancy name for the flaw in thinking is anthropomorphism, where people assign human motives to objects and animals. In this case, people are projecting their memories of school playgrounds on a troop of monkeys.

People think a bird sings because it is happy, when it is actually screaming, “Males, keep off my turf, or I will peck your eyes out.”

Anthropomorphism is, strictly speaking, a logical fallacy. But if it keeps animals alive – Punch included – then it is a fallacy I can support.

Volatility persisted in the market, with the index touching an intraday high of 168,191.64 and a low of 164,229.36, underscoring continued instability in trading activity.
This follows Tuesday’s particularly turbulent session that saw the index swing from an intraday gain of 1,546 points to a steep decline of 3,783 points as selling pressure intensified.
Analysts at Topline Securities note that the benchmark was primarily impacted by weak investor sentiment and futures rollover pressure.
The top active stocks were led by K-Electric Limited, which rose 1.85 per cent to Rs7.71 at a volume of 99,786,190, followed by Cnergyico PK Limited, which rose 8.31pc to Rs7.17 at a volume of 70,330,560, and First National Equities Limited, which rose 0.68pc to Rs1.48 at a volume of 33,421,278.

Overall, amid sustained market volaility market participation remained reasonable with total traded volume reaching 619 million shares and turnover standing at Rs 29.2 billion.
As analysts debate whether the recent market downturn reflects a natural correction or is the result of rising geopolitical uncertainty, an equally important factor to watch may be the impact corporate earnings reports could have on investor sentiment.</p><small>2026-02-25 10:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25133242fc34c05.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975201/from-paper-to-action-the-missing-link-in-pakistans-response-to-climate-change' target='_blank'><strong>From paper to action: The missing link in Pakistan’s response to climate change</strong></a><br><p>As the Climate Week Karachi 2026 came to a close on February 4, the urgency for climate action was palpable across panels and community dialogues, with one message reiterated loud and clear by experts and policymakers: Pakistan can no longer afford business as usual on climate change. Adaptation and resilience must move from paper to action.
Climate change is no longer a future threat, but a lived reality in Pakistan today, manifesting regularly in the form of melting glaciers and heat waves, erratic rainfall, and flooding. According to the United Nations Development Programme, rising global temperatures are accelerating glacier retreat in Pakistan, with almost 10,000 glaciers having receded in recent years, leading to floods and future water scarcity.
Meanwhile, erratic rainfall patterns have made the country vulnerable to floods and droughts. The 2025 monsoon season displaced about 3.5 million people in Pakistan and left 1.6m in Sindh at the risk of flooding, per data compiled by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.



Sindh suffered an estimated loss of Rs32.2 billion last year due to these climate anomalies, which range from urban flooding and heatwaves in urban areas to droughts and livelihood damage in rural villages. These trends, now backed by scientific and meteorological data, underscore the need for both mitigation and adaptation strategies that are locally grounded.
And this is exactly what was discussed at length during Climate Week Karachi 2026; that resilience is not just an environmental necessity but a socioeconomic need. When there is a lack of early warning systems, resilient infrastructure, and equitable access to finance, vulnerable communities bear the brunt of climate shocks.
Climate finance in Pakistan
In the past few years, Pakistan has initiated several climate finance initiatives — both domestic and international — to build adaptive capacity.
In 2024, Pakistan launched the National Climate Finance Strategy to mobilise and streamline funds for climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as to strengthen institutions and enhance transparency. The next year, the government issued its first sovereign Green Sukuk, a Shariah-compliant instrument that raised significant capital of around Rs30 billion for climate-aligned investments. Similarly, Green bonds were also introduced to fund environmentally sustainable projects.
Apart from local initiatives, the country secured more than $1.5 billion in climate finance from global sources, including the International Monetary Fund’s Resilience and Sustainability Facility ($1.4 billion) and Green Climate Fund (GCF) commitments. The latter has approved a number of projects in Pakistan addressing flood risk management, smart agriculture, urban transit emissions, and distributed solar deployment.
In late 2025, Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank signed climate resilience projects worth $304.5 million, including the Sindh Coastal Resilience Sector Project, designed to improve water resource management, restore nature-based defence, and enhance planning capacities for coastal communities in Thatta, Sujawal, and Badin districts.
Similarly, the World Bank has also approved $102 million for the Resilient and Accessible Microfinance (RAM) Project, aimed at strengthening access to finance for vulnerable populations, especially in the face of climate shocks and disasters.
Where the system still falls short
But even after all the progress Pakistan has achieved in mobilising climate finance, there remains a profound gap between available resources and their translation into effective local-level resilience-building against climate change. This particularly holds true for Sindh.
In a 2018 research paper, the World Bank referred to the southeastern province as the country’s most vulnerable hotspot, owing to its geographic location, population concentration, lack of access to infrastructure, and climate-induced disasters (floods, heatwaves and droughts).



The economic implications of this vulnerability are stark. The UNDP, in its policy paper, ‘Cost of Inaction on Climate Change’, estimated that unmitigated climate impacts could impose losses — damage to agriculture, health infrastructure and productivity — equivalent to about 20 per cent of Sindh’s gross domestic product.
On the other hand, the costs of avoiding or reducing these impacts would amount to 2.5pc of the province’s GDP, the paper noted, highlighting how proactive adaptation and resilience investment could translate into a large economic return.
Simply put, delayed or insufficient climate action is not just an environmental risk but a macroeconomic liability for all, especially in Sindh.
Decentralisation and access
One of the core weaknesses in Pakistan’s climate finance system lies in its highly centralised structure. Climate finance, especially international funds, is commonly routed through federal ministries and other implementing agencies, even though responsibility for key climate-sensitive sectors such as water management, agriculture, urban development, and disaster response rests primarily with provincial and local governments.
This institutional mismatch limits provinces and municipalities from designing and implementing projects that respond directly to local climate risks.
Analysis conducted by the Consortium for Development Policy Research, a Pakistan-based research and dissemination organisation, highlights that fiscal and constitutional arrangements for climate action plans, including approval, restructuring, and disbursement majorly reside at the federal level, while the responsibility for implementation resides at the provincial level.
This structure of centralised control creates delays and gaps.

 

Case in point: the Sindh Coastal Resilience Project. Formalised at the end of 2025, its preparatory phase laid bare the common administrative and access risks that Pakistan’s climate financing ecosystem faces.
The project was launched to protect coastal livelihoods, food security, and ecosystems in climate-vulnerable districts of Thatta, Sujawal and Badin. But even as it was designed for Sindh and implemented by provincial institutions, the project’s grants — from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Green Climate Fund — were formally negotiated and signed by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs.
So even when it is by Sindh, for Sindh and to Sindh, the province does not have direct access to the full financing envelope. Instead, all of the approvals, fund releases, and compliance requirements flow through federal channels, lengthening preparation and implementation timelines.
This yet again proves that without streamlined mechanisms that pass access and management of climate funds down to the grassroots — provincial and municipal governments — vulnerable populations will continue to suffer.
Absorptive capacity and implementation gaps
The lack of access and control is not just limited to Sindh but plagues the entire country. Reports reveal how Pakistan’s capacity to absorb and utilise climate funds continues to be a bottleneck, with chronic underspending, delayed disbursements, and setbacks in project implementation.
For instance, the GCF’s $37 million ‘Transforming the Indus Basin with Climate Resilient Agriculture and Water Management’ project had disbursed less than 45pc of its funds by its original completion timeline. In its documents, the Fund prominently mentioned absorption capacity as a climate finance constraint in Pakistan.
Sindh’s experience demonstrates that limited absorptive capacity is not an abstract national problem but a project-level constraint with measurable consequences. Despite repeated climate shocks and sustained financing commitments, many projects have suffered delays, pointing to institutional and procedural barriers in converting approved funds into timely adaptation outcomes.
A prominent example is the Sindh Resilience Project, launched in 2016 and supported by the World Bank to strengthen flood and drought risk management in the province through infrastructural upgrades and institutional capacity building.
Originally scheduled to close in 2021, only half of the project’s planned sub-schemes have been completed as of 2024-2025. Several of its components are yet to begin. In its implementation status report, the World Bank blamed limited procurement bottlenecks, limited project management capacity and governance risks for the delays.
Similarly, the Greater Karachi Bulk Water Scheme (K-IV) has faced many challenges as well. The project, originally launched to supply 260 million gallons of water per day, has been repeatedly delayed since its inception in the early 2000s. As of 2025, K-IV remains only 60-65pc complete, with original timelines pushed back and costs escalating significantly from initial estimates.

 

A key driver of these delays has been the mismatch between budget allocations and implementation requirements, where the federal budget 2025-26 only earmarked Rs3.2 billion of the roughly Rs40 billion required to push the project towards completion. Coordination mechanisms, including redesign of project components and transfer of execution responsibility from provincial agencies to Wapda have also contributed to higher costs and deferred timelines, illustrating how absorptive capacity constraints can amplify vulnerabilities even when financing is available.
These project-level findings are backed by budget execution. An independent analysis of Sindh’s climate-relevant expenditures shows that less than half of the allocated climate funds were spent over a 15-16 year period, i.e. out of Rs48.8 billion allocated for climate-related departments, only Rs20.2 billion was spent, pointing to chronic under-utilisation.
Building a resilient future
All of this evidence suggests that climate change in Pakistan is no longer just about risk recognition or finance mobilisation. It is equally about whether existing institutions and frameworks can convert approved resources into a timely and local-level response, implementing reforms as the central task of the next phase of climate action.
For climate finance to yield a meaningful impact, Pakistan must first start with decentralising access by empowering provincial and municipal governments with direct financing windows and simplified procedures.
Next, it should build technical capacity at the local level for project design, planning and implementation, alongside strengthening monitoring and transparency mechanisms.
And most of all, the nation must integrate climate priorities into local and provincial development planning, thereby ensuring that resilience is embedded in decision-making across sectors.
Turning climate finance into real resilience requires political will, institutional reform, and a decisive shift toward localised climate governance. Without this, climate action will only be visible on paper.</p><small>2026-02-25 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2513243446b3221.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975665/israel-committed-two-thirds-of-record-press-killings-in-2025-cpj' target='_blank'><strong>Israel committed two-thirds of record press killings in 2025: CPJ</strong></a><br><p>A record 129 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide in 2025, the Committee to Protect Journalists said on Wednesday, blaming Israel for two-thirds of the deaths.
It was the second consecutive annual record for press deaths and the deadliest year since the CPJ began collecting data more than three decades ago.
“Journalists are being killed in record numbers at a time when access to information is more important than ever,” CEO Jodie Ginsberg said in a statement.

 

“We are all at risk when journalists are killed for reporting the news.” Over three-quarters of all the fatalities in 2025 were in conflict settings, the CPJ said in its report.
More than 60 per cent of the 86 members of the press killed by Israeli fire in 2025 were Palestinians reporting from Gaza, it added.

 

The Israeli military claims that it never “deliberately targets” journalists.
The number of journalists killed in Ukraine and Sudan also increased in 2025 compared to the year before.
The CPJ highlighted a rise in drones being used, with 39 cases documented, including 28 killings by Israel in Gaza and five by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Sudan.
In Ukraine, four journalists were killed by Russian military drones, the highest annual number of journalist deaths in the war since 15 were killed in 2022.
Journalists are increasingly vulnerable due to a persistent culture of impunity, the CPJ said, noting a lack of transparent investigations into killings.
In Mexico, six journalists were killed in 2025, and all the cases remain unsolved. The Philippines saw three journalists shot dead.
Others were killed following their reporting on corruption, such as a Bangladeshi reporter hacked to death by suspects linked to a fraud ring, according to the CPJ report.
Similar organised crime-related deaths were recorded in India and Peru.
In Saudi Arabia, prominent columnist Turki al-Jasser was executed by the state after being convicted on several charges that the CPJ likened to “spurious national security and financial crime allegations” used to punish reporters.
It was the Gulf state’s first documented killing of a journalist since the 2018 death of Jamal Khashoggi.</p><small>2026-02-25 09:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25132217a0b3e04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975664/17-deaths-reported-during-basant-in-lahore-says-punjab-home-department-report-submitted-to-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>17 deaths reported during Basant in Lahore, says Punjab Home Department report submitted to LHC</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab home department submitted a report to the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday stating that 17 people died during the recent Basant festival in Lahore.
The three-day Basant festival was held in Lahore from February 6-8, following the Punjab government’s decision to lift a ban on the historic event after 18 years, with strict regulations.
However, despite the government’s emphasis on safety measures, over 100 accidents were reported in connection with the festival.
The petition, heard by Justice Owais Khalid, sought the details of deaths and injuries during Basant.
According to the report, three people died of electrocution during the festival, and two died after falling from trees. In addition, 12 people lost their lives falling from roofs, the report added.
The LHC also sought details of people injured by kite strings during Basant. According to the petitioner’s lawyer, Advocate Azhar Siddique, the data was not provided.
Earlier this month, the court summoned a police report on the deaths and injuries reported during the Basant festival while hearing petitions filed by the Judicial Activism Panel and others challenging the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025.
The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
Upon its revival, under the new Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, only thread-based kite strings were allowed to be manufactured and the use of metallic, chemical-coated, or sharp strings was strictly banned.
Other safety measures included the division of the provincial metropolis into three kite-flying zones under 24/7 surveillance, the installing of protective safety wires or antennas on motorcycles to prevent neck injuries, and a ban on aerial firing and the consumption of alcohol on rooftops during the festival.
After the festival, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif had praised authorities for organising a “safe Basant” in Lahore. She also stated that there was not a single death caused by injuries from kite strings during the festival.</p><small>2026-02-25 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/251200097077ee2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975663/road-between-kp-and-punjab-remains-closed-after-suicide-attack-at-dajil-checkpost-in-bhakkar' target='_blank'><strong>Road between KP and Punjab remains closed after suicide attack at Dajil checkpost in Bhakkar</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The main highway linking Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with Punjab remained closed on Wednesday following a suicide attack at the Dajil checkpost near the Dera Darya Khan bridge in Punjab’s Bhakkar district, causing hardship for commuters and traders on both sides of the inter-provincial border.
The attack occurred on Tuesday at around 7pm when a suicide bomber detonated explosives near the checkpost, located a short distance from the bridge connecting Dera Ismail Khan with Punjab. CCTV footage reportedly showed the attacker approaching the post before carrying out the blast.
Two police personnel were martyred in the explosion, while four others sustained injuries. All injured personnel were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, where their treatment is ongoing.
Following the attack, security was placed on high alert in both DI Khan and Bhakkar districts. Punjab police sealed the road near the Dera Darya Khan bridge and suspended all traffic as a precautionary measure, while a search operation was launched in the surrounding areas.
The continued closure of the inter-provincial route has caused significant inconvenience to travelers and transporters. Vehicles remained stranded for hours, and passengers were forced to seek alternative routes at additional expense.
The disruption comes days after the same route remained blocked for several days due to protests by the PTI, which had already affected the movement of goods and people.
Traders in DI Khan said repeated closures had disrupted supply lines from Punjab, particularly from Lahore and other major commercial centres.
President of the Markazi Anjuman-i-Tajiran, Sohail Ahmed Azmi, said the prolonged suspension of traffic was compounding the difficulties faced by the business community. He warned that with Ramazan underway and Eidul Fitr approaching, any further delay in the transportation of goods from Punjab could result in financial losses and possible shortages in local markets.
Azmi urged the regional police authorities in Bhakkar to restore traffic after conducting necessary security checks, stating that while security concerns were understandable in the aftermath of the attack, the extended closure of the highway was adding to public hardship.
Officials have yet to announce when the route will be reopened.
KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.</p><small>2026-02-25 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25114728b004ecb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975661/5-key-moments-from-trumps-record-breaking-state-of-the-union-address' target='_blank'><strong>5 key moments from Trump’s record-breaking State of the Union address</strong></a><br><p>For the first State of the Union address of his second term, United States President Donald Trump decided to go long, broaching everything from the economy to Iran during his one-hour-and-47-minute speech to Congress.
Here are five key moments from the longest-ever State of the Union address:
Supreme Court tension
Upon entering the US Capitol, Trump shook hands with several Supreme Court justices in attendance — three of whom had ruled days earlier to strike down the global tariffs he had made his signature economic policy.
Trump voiced his displeasure during the speech, calling the ruling “very unfortunate,” as the justices watched on from the front row.
The president did not dwell long on the subject, however, and said his administration was already planning a legal workaround to keep the duties he insists will be paid for by foreign countries.

 


Team USA unifies
During a speech marked by political divides between Trump’s Republicans and opposition Democrats, one of the few moments of unity occurred when the gold medal-winning US men’s Olympic hockey team entered the room.
The entire audience rose and applauded, chanting “USA! USA!” in unison, to recognise the Olympians, who clinched America’s first ice hockey gold in 46 years.



Democratic lawmaker expelled
Congress plays a key, performative role during the State of the Union, applauding and standing up in agreement with the president or sitting still to voice their displeasure.
Dozens of Democrats skipped the event altogether, and those in attendance largely stayed seated except on rare occasions.
Several wore white to pay homage to the suffragette movement celebrating women’s right to vote, or donned pins demanding accountability over those named in the files released on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
In one notable act of resistance, Democratic lawmaker Al Green was expelled after holding up a sign reading “Black people aren’t apes!” in response to a racist video of the Obamas shared by Trump.



Ilhan Omar heckles Trump
Tensions soared when House Democrat Ilhan Omar, who has frequently sparred with Trump, shouted at the president while he spoke.
“You should be ashamed of yourselves,” Trump told Democrats in attendance, who had refused to stand up throughout his address.
“You have killed Americans,” Omar shouted in response, in reference to the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents dispatched to Minneapolis last month.
The lawmaker, whose district represents Minneapolis, later left the speech before Trump had finished.



Longest speech ever
At one hour and 47 minutes, Trump delivered the longest State of the Union speech in US history, beating the previous record of one hour and 20 minutes set by former president Bill Clinton in 2000.
The speech even outlasted Trump’s address to Congress last year shortly after taking office, which lasted one hour and 40 minutes.

The formulation, which projected readiness for talks while keeping the option of military force deliberately ambiguous, reflected his broader doctrine of “peace through strength.”

Trump argued that a rebuilt US military and higher defence spending by Nato allies had strengthened Washington’s hand.
At the same time, he asserted that Iran was developing missiles capable of reaching the United States and complained: “We haven’t heard those secret words (from Iran): ‘We will never have a nuclear weapon.’”
He blamed Tehran for pursuing a “sinister nuclear program” and claimed that earlier US strikes had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear weapons capabilities.
Trump’s Tuesday night State of the Union address lasted one hour and 47 minutes — the longest before a joint session of Congress in at least six decades, according to the American Presidency Project.

As American television commentators noted, the president turned the annual constitutional ritual into an extended political performance aimed at boosting his approval ratings and energising Republican voters ahead of this year’s midterm elections.
Trump also briefly brought South Asia into the address, highlighting his peacemaking role in ending the May 2025 war between Pakistan and India, claiming that his efforts “saved millions” of lives by preventing the conflict from turning nuclear.
“Pakistan and India … it would have been a nuclear war. Thirty-five million people, the prime minister of Pakistan said, would have died if not for my involvement,” he declared.
Repeating his claim that he had halted eight wars in his first 10 months in office, he snapped at sceptics in the chamber: “Isn’t it funny? Sick people,” while glancing toward those who laughed.
Despite weeks of the largest US military buildup in the Middle East in two decades, Trump did not signal whether he was prepared to order a strike on Iran. He waited more than an hour before addressing the issue and avoided any reference to the scale of American deployments in the region, underscoring a speech that, even on foreign policy, largely followed a domestic political script.
Trump accused Tehran and its allies of being responsible for roadside bombings that “have killed US service members and civilians.“ He also referred to the killing of General Qasem Soleimani, saying “we took out Soleimani” and that it had a “big impact”.

Within the same sweep of foreign affairs, he hailed what he called a “colossal victory for the security of the United States” in Venezuela and introduced Enrique Marquez, an opposition lawmaker freed from prison after the US abduction of President Nicolás Maduro, telling a relative in the gallery: “I’m pleased to inform you that not only has your uncle been released, but he is here tonight.”
The address began with a campaign-style flourish — “Our nation is back: bigger, better, richer, and stronger than ever before!” — and quickly led to a sharply polarised spectacle.

When Trump asked those who believed “the first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens” to stand, Republicans rose and applauded for several minutes while Democrats remained seated, prompting him to say: “You should be ashamed of yourselves, not standing up.”
Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib repeatedly shouted, “You have killed Americans!” and “You should be ashamed!” as the speech continued, while Al Green was escorted from the chamber earlier after waving a protest sign reading “Black People Aren’t Apes,” an apparent reference to a video Trump had reposted on Truth Social depicting the Obamas as apes.
Trump directed much of his gaze toward the Republican side, basking in applause, but as he moved into immigration, crime, election security, and gender issues, he increasingly addressed Democrats directly, saying:
“These people are crazy, I’m telling ya, they’re crazy … Democrats are destroying our country, but we’ve stopped it just in the nick of time.”

On immigration, he renewed attacks on Somali Americans, referring to “the Somali pirates who ransacked Minnesota” and arguing that “importing these cultures through unrestricted immigration and open borders brings those problems right here to the USA, and it is the American people who pay the price”.
On economic policy, he criticised a recent Supreme Court decision against his tariffs as “very unfortunate” and said the duties would remain in place under “fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes,” adding: “Congressional action will not be necessary.”
Turning to prices, he blamed Democrats for inflation and told Americans: “Just hold on a little while we’re getting it down, and soon you will see numbers that few people would think were possible to achieve.”
He also urged passage of the SAVE America Act, requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration, a measure Democrats have pledged to block in the Senate.
At another point, Trump took aim at New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani as the “new communist mayor of New York City,” before adding in a softer aside: “I think he’s a nice guy. Bad policy, but nice guy.”

For much of the evening, the visual tableau — a president speaking almost exclusively to one side of the chamber while the other jeered — mirrored the substance: an address that fused campaign mobilisation at home with selective, carefully timed signals abroad, particularly on Iran, where the decisive choice between diplomacy and force remained conspicuously unstated.</p><small>2026-02-25 06:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25092103b607c4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975650/muslim-european-countries-condemn-israeli-attempts-aimed-at-de-facto-annexation-of-palestinian-land-in-west-bank' target='_blank'><strong>Muslim, European countries condemn Israeli attempts aimed at ‘de facto annexation’ of Palestinian land in West Bank</strong></a><br><p>Muslim and European countries, including Pakistan, on Wednesday condemned Israeli attempts aimed at the “unacceptable de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank.
A joint statement by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Brazil, France, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Egypt, Pakistan, Luxembourg, Norway, Palestine, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, United Arab Emirates, the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation said that recent changes made by Israel to reclaim land in the occupied West Bank as “state property” are “wide-ranging” and accelerate illegal settlement activity and further entrench Israeli administration.
Earlier this month, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of international law, which states that an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories. The measures would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory.
“These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” said the joint statement, also shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on X.







“We are clear that Israel’s illegal settlements, and decisions designed to further them, are a flagrant violation of international law, including previous United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the 2024 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice.”
“These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” added the joint statement.
The statement, referring to the Trump-brokered Gaza ceasefire and the subsequent 20-point plan for Gaza, said it threatens any meaningful prospect of regional integration.
“We call on the Government of Israel to reverse them immediately, to respect its international obligations, and to refrain from actions that would result in permanent changes to the legal and administrative status of the occupied Palestinian Territory,” the statement said further.
According to the statement, the decisions made by Tel Aviv follow the “unprecedented acceleration” of Israel’s settlement policy and such actions amount to a “deliberate and direct attack” on the viability of a Palestinian state and the implementation of the Two-State Solution.
“In that context, we reiterate our rejection of all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem. We oppose any form of annexation.”
The statement called upon Israel to put an end to settler violence and hold those responsible accountable.
“We reaffirm our commitment to taking concrete steps, in accordance with international law, to counter the expansion of illegal settlements in Palestinian territory and policies and threats of forcible displacement and annexation.”
The nations stressed the importance of preserving, in the holy month of Ramazan, the “historic and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its Holy Sites”, recognising the special role of the historic Hashemite custodianship in this regard.
“We condemn repeated violations of the status quo in Jerusalem, which constitute a threat to regional stability.”
Earlier, the Palestinian Presidency slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, Wafa news agency reported.
Palestinian group Hamas also condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.
Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967.

Videos that went viral on social media show the delivery rider, 26-year-old Farhan Ali, standing on his bike in front of a house near the main Saba Avenue signal when the speeding car flipped over and crashed into him. The delivery rider died in the incident.
On Tuesday, South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the police “detained” the injured car driver, identified as Hasan Banghwar, and brought him to the Sahil police station for legal proceedings after his treatment.
He said he was released on ‘personal surety’ with the consent of the parents of the deceased.
Sahil SHO Hikmatullah said the police asked the deceased’s parents to give a statement to lodge an FIR. However, they told the police that they were taking the coffin to Thatta for burial and would approach the police later.
He said the car involved in the accident and the motorbike had been seized by the police.
He said investigations were under way and formal legal proceedings would be initiated depending upon the parents’ willingness to pursue the case legally.

The group made a net loss of Rs9.7 billion for 2025.
The mobile segment of the group, Ufone posted a revenue growth of 14pc year-on-year, its operating profit reached Rs17.6bn that is 283pc against 2024, yet the company still remains in net loss, which reduced significantly by 89pc.
The group loss was primarily driven by accelerated expected credit loss (ECL) provisioning at Ubank following revisions to the Prudential Regulations.
Ubank has strengthened its balance sheet by adopting IFRS 9, resulting in increased impairment allowances for ECL following updated regulatory requirements.
The group’s consolidated revenue increased by 12pc year-on-year, driven by strong performance in fixed broadband, enterprise, wholesale and mobile services. The consolidated operating profit grew 216pc year-on-year, underscoring strong operational performance.
Revenue grew by 12pc, led by 50pc growth in Flash Fibre and 16pc growth in business solutions compared to the last financial year.
The carrier and wholesale business has maintained momentum with 28pc growth.
PTCL’s operating profit reached Rs18.2bn, up 49pc YoY and posted a net profit of Rs1.4bn despite one-off booking of additional pension liability amounting to Rs6.9bn pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court.

• ATC declares 30 PTI workers proclaimed offenders in Nov 26 protest cases
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Tuesday sought final arguments on an application seeking the closure of the X (formerly Twitter) account of the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Imran Khan.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir heard the matter. Advocate Muhammad Ali Bukhari appeared on behalf of the PTI founder, while Barrister Zafarullah Khan represented the petitioner. Advocate General Islamabad Ayaz Shaukat also appeared before the court.
At the outset of the hearing, Mr Bukhari informed the court that PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja could not appear due to ill health. He stated that the court had earlier directed that a meeting be arranged with the PTI founder in jail; however, he complained that jail authorities had not facilitated the meeting.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority lawyer told the court that a report had already been submitted in the case. Justice Tahir asked Barrister Zafarullah what relief the petitioner was seeking. The petitioner’s counsel responded that they were ready to advance arguments and requested that copies of replies be provided to the other side.
Mr Bukhari contended that neither the PTI founder nor the party had received the reply. He requested time to first meet the PTI founder in jail before submitting a formal response. The court asked whether PTI intended to file a reply in the matter. Justice Tahir observed that the party was also a respondent and needed to clarify its position.
After brief exchanges, the court adjourned the hearing until the first week of May and sought final arguments from the parties.
Pre-arrest bails
In a separate development, the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka approved pre-arrest bail applications of the PTI founder in six cases, and of Bushra Bibi in one case.
During the hearing, prosecutors Raja Naveed Hussain Kiani, Mazhar Bashir and Assistant Inspector General (Legal) Tahir Kazim appeared on behalf of the state, while Barrister Salman Safdar represented the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi.
Barrister Safdar argued that the delay in deciding the bail applications was unprecedented in his legal career.
He said that 63 adjournments had been granted to the state. On 30 occasions, the court had directed jail authorities to produce the accused, but compliance was not ensured. He added that five show-cause notices had been issued to the jail superintendent.
The prosecution opposed the bail pleas, arguing that there was solid evidence against the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi and that they were not entitled to relief.
During proceedings, the court asked whether the receipt related to the Toshakhana case had been recovered. The prosecution replied in the negative. Judge Majoka further questioned whether the allegedly fake receipts shown in the media had been sent for forensic examination.
After completion of arguments, the court granted pre-arrest bail against surety bonds of Rs50,000 each.
Meanwhile, an Anti-Terrorism Court declared 30 PTI workers as proclaimed offenders (POs) in cases registered at Khanna police station in connection with the November 26 protest.
At the previous hearing, proceedings had been initiated against 31 workers. However, after one PTI worker appeared before the court, proclamation proceedings against him were terminated.

LAHORE: Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb strongly condemned PTI activists and others for running a vilification campaign against Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz over the Punjab government’s decision to acquire a luxury jet.
CM Maryam has faced severe criticism from the opposition and some journalists regarding the government’s purchase of a luxury aircraft for her personal use.
“Elements engaged in character assassination against the CM on media and social media are affiliated with the PTI. The national media should expel and reject those operating under PTI’s foreign funding,” Ms Aurangzeb said in a statement on Tuesday.
She added that the PTI’s toxic mindset was spreading filth across social and mainstream media platforms, which was deeply regrettable.
The senior minister said the seeds of this vile, poisonous, and repugnant mindset were sown during PTI’s tenure. “This reflects the continuation of the PTI founder’s offensive thinking. The media should condemn the character assassination campaign against Maryam Nawaz Sharif,” she urged.
She further said that whenever legal action was taken against such campaigns, an outcry was raised in the name of curbing freedom of expression.
Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari described the PTI’s “gutter mentality” as a cancer clinging to the country and society.
The Punjab government acqui­red a luxury Gulfstream 19-seater jet worth between $38 million and $42 million (over Rs10bn) for the chief minister’s use.

 

Initially, the Punjab administration remained tight-lipped about the acquisition, but later claimed that it was part of a proposed airline project.
When questions arose about the absence of a roadmap for the airline, the government later stated that the previous plane used by CM Maryam had become old and needed replacement with a “safe new jet”.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram criticised the purchase as an “extravagant expenditure amid economic hardship”, arguing that it contradicted the government’s public calls for austerity while citizens face rising inflation, unemployment, and financial strain.
He argued that spending billions on a VIP aircraft is unjustifiable when a large portion of the population lives below the poverty line and the country relies heavily on foreign loans. He warned that PTI would hold those responsible accountable for what he termed misuse of public funds.
Adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Finance Muzammil Aslam pointed out that, while the federal PML-N government sold 75 per cent of Pakistan International Airlines shares for just Rs10 billion, the Punjab government purchased a jet for Rs11bn.
Similarly, Jamaat-i-Islami Emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that while the prime minister celebrated the PIA sale, his niece, CM Maryam Nawaz, went ahead and purchased a luxury aircraft for “elite” travel.

He was speaking at a conference titled, Pakistan-Iran Relations: An enduring Partnership in a Changing Region, organised by the Centre for Afghanistan, Middle East and Africa (CAMEA) at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI).
Mr Moghaddam noted that terrorism and separatist movements are serious challenges, which required enhanced cooperation and coordination between the two neighbours.
The Iranian ambassador said that collaboration between the two countries has been reinforced through regional engagement, mutual diplomatic suppo­­rt, and common membership in importa­­nt multilateral platforms such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, Or­­­ganisation of Islamic Cooperation, Eco­­nomic Cooperation Organisation (ECO), and the Developing Eight Orga­nisation for Economic Cooperation (D-8).
He said that currently, relations bet­ween the two countries are experiencing one of their most constructive phases.
The exchange of more than 25 high-level delegations over the past two years, along with the signing of 25 agreements and memoranda of understanding across diverse sectors, reflects the upward trajectory of cooperation and the shared recognition of the strategic importance of bilateral relations.
Two presidential visits from Iran within this period, in addition to visits by the speaker of Parliament, the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, foreign ministers, and other senior officials, underscore the depth and dynamism of mutual interaction, Mr Moghaddam said.

 

He said that Iran-Pakistan relations rest upon a solid foundation of shared history, cultural affinity, and common strategic interests.
He said the two neighbouring countries share a long common border and together represent a population of nearly 350 million people. Robust people-to-people ties, a strategically significant geographic location, substantial complementary, and non-competitive economic structures create extensive opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation.
Speaking on the occasion, retired Ambassador Khalid Mahmood said Iran’s support for Pakistan during the 1965 and 1971 wars was a testament to their close ties.
There have been difficult phases in the relationship, which have strained the relationship at times, but now the two countries are closer to each other than ever before, although challenges remain, like terrorism and sectarianism.
Dr Amina Khan said that Pakistan and Iran share a long-standing bilateral relationship grounded in historical ties, geographic proximity, and intertwined security and economic interests.
In recent years, she said bilateral relations have remained positive and forward-looking, characterised by sustained high-level engagement, close coordination on regional and international developments and commitments to the principle of sovereign equality.

US AIR Force tanker aircraft are lined up at Ben Gurion airport, near Tel Aviv.—Reuters

• CSIS report terms current convergence of US military hardware largest since 2003 Iraq war, but smaller than 1991’s ‘Desert Storm’• Ahead of Geneva talks, Iran says it is ready to take any steps towards a nuclear deal
WASHINGTON: As the world’s largest aircraft carrier sails to join a massive military build-up in the Middle East, a new study reveals that the deployment looks to be structured for “limited action” rather than a “large-scale war”.
The assessment comes as US President Donald Trump’s reported consideration of a short, coercive strike to pressure Tehran into accepting his demands has triggered intense debate in Washington and beyond over the likelihood of conflict, the definition of objectives, and the danger of a wider regional war.
In the meantime, oil prices are hovering near seven-month highs, with traders assessing risks to supply from any military escalation as another round of US-Iran nuclear talks looms.
Ahead of Thursday’s planned nuclear talks between Iran and the US, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said on Tuesday that his country was ready to take any necessary steps to reach a deal with the United States.
The talks are set to take place on Thursday in Geneva.
We are ready to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We will do whatever it takes to make this happen. We will enter the negotiating room in Geneva with complete honesty and good faith,” Takht-Ravanchi said in comments carried by state media.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s first option was always diplomacy but that he was willing to use lethal force if necessary.
“If there is an attack or aggression against Iran, we will respond according to our defence plans… A US attack on Iran is a real gamble,” Takht-Ravanchi added.
Trump confident US can easily beat Iran
President Donald Trump on Monday denied reports that the top US military officer had flagged the risks of a major operation against Iran, saying Washington would “easily” beat Tehran in any war.
US media reported that General Dan Caine, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had warned of various risks associated with strikes against Iran including a long-term entanglement.
But Trump said on his Truth Social network that it was “100 percent incorrect” that Caine was “against us going to war with Iran.”







“General Caine, like all of us, would like not to see War but, if a decision is made on going against Iran at a Military level, it is his opinion that it will be something easily won,” Trump wrote.
“He has not spoken of not doing Iran, or even the fake limited strikes that I have been reading about, he only knows one thing, how to WIN and, if he is told to do so, he will be leading the pack.”
The US president, however, accused the media outlets of writing “incorrectly, and purposefully so.” “I am the one that makes the decision, I would rather have a Deal than not but, if we don’t make a Deal, it will be a very bad day for that Country and, very sadly, its people,” Trump added.
In response to a separate report in The New York Times suggesting that Trump is weighing a near-term limited strike — with the possibility of a broader campaign later — Middle Eastern scholar Vali Nasr wrote: “Trump is signaling Iranians via New York Times. He is trying to force a deal by threatening war.”
Nasr cautioned that continued pressure, even after a deal, could push Tehran toward confrontation, quoting Middle East analyst Ali Hashem as saying: “Washington assumes military pressure buys diplomatic leverage. Tehran sees a challenge to ideological survival.”
Build-up
The USS Gerald R. Ford, meanwhile, has reached the US naval base of Souda Bay on Crete, en route to the Persian Gulf.
US Naval Support Activity Souda Bay is home to approximately 1,000 people, including active duty military, US civilian employees, local national employees, contractors, and family members.



Washington currently has more than a dozen warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier — the USS Abraham Lincoln — nine destroyers and three littoral combat ships.
It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers — which carry dozens of warplanes and are crewed by thousands of sailors — in the Middle East.
However, a recent study by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) provides a detailed picture of what current US deployments can and cannot do.
It notes that the naval “armada” in the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean is the largest US maritime presence in the region since five carrier strike groups were assembled at the start of the 2003 Iraq war. The force is sufficient for targeted strikes and for defending US allies and partners.
However, it lacks Marine units, special operations forces for raids or ground missions, and the logistics required for a prolonged air campaign.
The study also stresses that the current deployment is far smaller than the forces used in the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the US conducted major combat operations and regime change.
A surge in cargo aircraft and aerial refueling tankers does not indicate the movement of ground combat units, the report says, making scenarios such as capturing or killing Iran’s leadership unrealistic — particularly given the distance from likely launch points to Tehran.
The available force package is also deemed insufficient for regime change, and the report argues that even a decapitation strike would be unlikely to destabilise Iran’s political system, which has shown resilience under pressure.
For a sustained, multi-week air campaign, CSIS concludes, Washington would need a much larger logistical buildup that would take additional time.

Pakistan have only one point from two Super Eight matches so now must win their final game and rely on other results going their way to have any hope of reaching the semi-finals.
“We know our fate is not in our hands,” he admitted, “But we need to beat Sri Lanka in our last match on Saturday and then hope other results go our way.”
“It’s not ideal, but it’s like this,” Shaheen said during a press conference after the match.

 

He also hailed Harry Brook’s century in the match against England as a “world-class knock”.
Brook reached his maiden T20 International hundred off 50 balls, with four sixes and 10 fours, as England went past their 165-run target with five balls to spare to win by two wickets.
Afridi jolted the England top order with a burst of three wickets before Brook played the ultimate captain’s innings to steer his side home.
“In my opinion this will be the best innings of his life,” Afridi told reporters. “It wasn’t an easy pitch to bat on but he took the game away from us.”
Promoted to number three after a morning conversation with England coach Brendon McCullum, Brook walked in after Afridi dismissed Phil Salt off the first ball of the innings.
Afridi then removed Jos Buttler and Jacob Bethell to leave England wobbling at 35-3 in the power play.
Brook stood firm, adding 45 for the fifth wicket with Sam Curran and 52 with Will Jacks for the sixth.
His century was the second fastest in T20 World Cup history, and the first ever by a team’s captain.
Only West Indies great Chris Gayle, against England in the 2016 T20 World Cup, reached three figures quicker. He took just 47 balls.
Afridi was clobbered for a six and a four as Brook raced through the “nervous nineties” in two balls, going from 90 to 100 before raising his bat.
The tall paceman bowled Brook with a yorker next ball, but did not celebrate wildly – instead he immediately went to congratulate the England captain in a superb show of cricket sportmanship.
“Brook played proper cricketing shots and he desreved a handshake, so I went to him and shook his hand in appreciation,” said Afridi.</p><small>2026-02-24 19:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/242108332593216.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975483/afghan-taliban-initiated-unprovoked-firing-along-pak-afghan-border-pms-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing along Pak-Afghan border: PM’s spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, said on Tuesday said that the Afghan Taliban regime initiated unprovoked firing along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Torkham and Tirah.
In a post on the social media platform X, he said, “Pakistan’s security forces responded immediately and effectively, silencing the Taliban aggression.”
He said that any further provocation would be responded to “immediately and severely”. He said Pakistan would “continue to protect its citizens and guard its territorial integrity”.







The development comes after Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes.
The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year.
According to an information ministry statement, issued in the early hours of Sunday, the strikes were carried out in res­ponse to a number of terrorist attacks inside Pakistan — such as the suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad and a number of attacks in Bannu and Bajaur.
“Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij at the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers,” it said.
The information ministry said that in a retributive response, Pakistan carried out “intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban [Fitna al Khw­arij] and its affiliates, and [Islamic State-Khorasan] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghan border with precision and accuracy”.
Fitna al Khwarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“Despite repeated efforts by Pak­istan to urge the Afghan Tali­ban Regime to take verifiable mea­sures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the statement noted.
Souring relations
There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded.
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire.
Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast.
Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault.
Then, on Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district.
In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted.
On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable.
In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR.
The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.</p><small>2026-02-24 16:24</small></div><hr>
