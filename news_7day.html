Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions including at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, while Israel declared a state of emergency in anticipation of retaliatory missile and drone strikes.

Key developments so far:

Iran says top commander, Hossein Salami, killed
Israel says military has begun intercepting drones fired from Iran
US says it has no part in the operation
Civilians, six nuclear scientists among killed, says Iran
Attack comes ahead of US and Iranian officials’ talks on Sunday
Israeli military says tens of thousands of soldiers “prepared across all borders”


An Israeli military official said that the army had begun intercepting drones outside Israeli territory that had been fired from Iran.
“The (Israeli military) has begun intercepting UAVs fired from Iran, outside of Israeli territory,” the military official said in a statement.
Israel’s army had earlier said Iran launched about 100 drones toward Israel following a wave of Israeli air strikes across the Islamic republic.
Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit.
Several children had been killed in a strike on a residential area in the capital, it said.
“We are at a decisive moment in Israel’s history,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded video message.
“Moments ago Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.”

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement that Israel had “unleashed its wicked and bloody” hand in a crime against Iran and that it would receive “a bitter fate for itself”.
An Israeli military official said Israel was striking “dozens” of nuclear and military targets including the facility at Natanz in central Iran. The official said Iran had enough material to make 15 nuclear bombs within days.

The United States said it had no part in the operation, which raises the risk of a fresh escalation in tensions in the Middle East, a major oil producing region.
Alongside extensive air strikes, Israel’s Mossad spy agency led a series of covert sabotage operations inside Iran, Axios reported, citing a senior Israeli official. These operations were aimed at damaging Irans strategic missile sites and its air defence capabilities.
At least six nuclear scientists were killed in Israel’s attacks, media outlets in the Islamic republic reported.
Tasnim news agency named the six scientists including Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was the president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran. Fereydoun Abbasi, a former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, was also among the scientists killed, it added.
The UN nuclear watchdog said that Iranian authorities told it that no increase in radiation levels have been observed at the Natanz uranium enrichment site following Israeli strikes.
“Iranian authorities have informed the IAEA… that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a post on X, after earlier confirming that the facility was “among targets” of the strikes.
It added that Iran’s only nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr had not been targeted.
 






Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport was closed until further notice, and Israel’s air defence units stood at high alert for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran.
“Following the pre-emptive strike by the State of Israel against Iran, a missile and UAV (drone) attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate time frame,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.
Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said tens of thousands of soldiers had been called up and “prepared across all borders”.
“We are amidst a historic campaign unlike any other. This is a critical operation to prevent an existential threat, by an enemy who is intent on destroying us,” he said.
Israeli Minister Gideon Saar was holding “marathon of calls” with counterparts around the world regarding Israel’s attack on Iran, the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which condemned Israel’s strikes, with the Foreign Office calling it “unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned “in the strongest possible terms today’s unprovoked attack on Iran by Israel.”
“I convey my deepest sympathies to the Iranian people on the loss of lives in this attack. This grave and highly irresponsible act is deeply alarming and risks further destabilising an already volatile region,” he said in a post on X.
“We urge the international community and the United Nations to take urgent steps to prevent any further escalation that could imperil regional and global peace.”
 






Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on X that a 24/7 Crisis Management Unit has been created at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani nationals in Iran.
“Pakistan Embassy in Tehran has also been directed to provide all facilitation to community members/Zaireens. The Embassy’s hotline number is (0098)-2166941388,” he said in a post on X.
 






Air raid sirens sounded in the Jordanian capital after Israel pounded Iran, while the public security directorate called on people to stay in their homes.
“Adhere to the guidelines and stay in your homes,” was the announcement made through loudspeakers in Amman, an AFP correspondent said.
Earlier, Jordan and Iraq announced the closure of their airspace and grounded all flights, with Amman vowing it would not allow any violations of its airspace.
“The kingdom’s airspace is temporarily closed, and air traffic suspended for all aircraft — incoming, outgoing and in transit, as a precaution against any risks resulting from the regional escalation,” the Jordanian civil aviation authority said in a statement.
“Jordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace, reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any conflict,” government spokesperson Mohammad Momani told AFP.
Iraq, which borders Iran, also closed its airspace on Friday. “The ministry of transport closes Iraqi airspace and suspends air traffic at all Iraqi airports,” the Iraq News Agency reported.

US ‘not involved’
US President Donald Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with Fox News after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.
“We will see,” Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.
Trump would convene a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday morning, the White House said. He had said on Thursday an Israeli strike on Iran “could very well happen” but reiterated his hopes for a peaceful resolution.
The US military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a US official told Reuters.
Iran’s armed forces spokesperson said Israel and its chief ally the United States would pay a “heavy price” for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation.
While the US tried to distance itself from Israel’s military operation, an Israeli
official told public broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.
“We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said in a statement.
“Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,” he added.
 






The State Department issued an advisory saying that all US government employees in Israel and their family members should “shelter in place until further notice”.
The attacks triggered sharp falls in stock prices in Asian trade on Friday, led by a selloff in US futures, while oil prices jumped as investors scurried to safe havens such as gold and the Swiss franc.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned any military escalation in the Middle East, said deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq.
“The Secretary-General asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford,” Haq said.
Flight disruptions, airspace closure
Emirates airline said flights to and from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Iran had been cancelled after Israel’s strikes  sparking concerns of a wider escalation.
Several flights scheduled for Friday and one Tehran flight on Saturday were listed as cancelled on the airline’s website, with the Dubai international airport also reporting that “some flights at [DXB] and DWC — Al Maktoum International have been cancelled or delayed due to airspace closures over Iran, Iraq, and Syria” in a statement on X.
The United Arab Emirates capital’s international airport warned of flight disruptions.
“Flight disruptions are expected through today at Zayed International Airport. Passengers are advised to check with their airline for the latest status of their flights before travelling to the airport,” the Abu Dhabi airport said in a statement on X.
 






German airline Lufthansa also said it had suspended all flights to and from Tehran.
“Lufthansa Group flights to and from Tehran will be suspended until further notice due to the current situation,” the company said in an emailed statement, adding it would also avoid Iranian, Iraqi and Israeli airspace for now.
Nuclear talks
US and Iranian officials were scheduled to hold a sixth round of talks on Tehran’s escalating uranium enrichment programme in Oman on Sunday, according to officials from both countries and their Omani mediators.
A US official said those talks were still scheduled to proceed despite the Israeli attack.
The Israeli military said on Friday that it was forced to act based on new intelligence information showing that Iran was “approaching the point of no return” in the development of a nuclear weapon.
“In recent months, this program has accelerated significantly, bringing the regime significantly closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” it said in a statement, without disclosing the purported evidence.
A source familiar with US intelligence reports said there had been no recent change in the US intelligence assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and that Khamenei had not authorised the restarting of the nuclear weapons programme that was shuttered in 2003.

Calling it a “decisive moment in Israel’s history”, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was also targeting Iranian scientists working on a nuclear bomb and missile factories in an operation that would continue for days.
Iran has long maintained that its nuclear-related activity is for peaceful purposes.
Israel declared a state of emergency in anticipation of retaliatory missile and drone strikes by Tehran.
Here are some reactions from top officials and governments around the world:
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio
“Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.”
“Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.”
 






Pakistan condemns ‘unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel’
Pakistan strongly condemned the “unjustified and illegitimate aggression” by Israel and stood in solidarity with the people of Iran, according to a statement by the Foreign Office.
“Pakistan stands in resolute solidarity with the people of Iran and unequivocally denounces these blatant provocations, which constitute a grave danger and a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, with serious implications,” the FO said.
“The Israeli military strikes violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran and clearly contravene the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law. Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.”
Pakistan noted that the international community and the UN bear responsibility to “uphold international law, stop this aggression immediately and hold the aggressor accountable for its actions.”
 






Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also noted that Israel’s attacks were a “brazen violation of Iran’s sovereignty.”
“This abhorrent action has shaken foundations of international law as well as conscience of humanity, and gravely undermines regional stability & international security. Pakistan stands in solidarity with the government and the people of Iran,” he said in a statement on X.
Condemning the Israeli attack on Iran, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman cautioned, “the start of a new war in the region could be very dangerous,” adding that the “world can not afford any wars.”
She urged world leaders to “make every possible effort to establish peace in the world.
“The effects of war are not limited to only one country; it affects us all,” she said. “The goals of developing countries are badly affected during times of war.”
Saudi Arabia condemns ‘blatant Israeli aggressions’ on Iran
Riyadh, once a rival of Tehran before reconciling about two years ago, condemned the wave of strikes that Israel said it launched against nuclear and military sites in Iran.
“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expresses its strong condemnation and denunciation of the blatant Israeli aggressions against the brotherly Islamic Republic of Iran, which undermine its sovereignty and security and constitute a clear violation of international laws and norms,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
 






Oman, which is mediating Iran-US nuclear talks
“Oman considers this act a dangerous, reckless escalation, representing a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter, the principles of international law. Such aggressive, persistent behaviour is unacceptable and further destabilises the regional peace and security.”
“The Sultanate of Oman holds Israel responsible for this escalation and its consequences, and calls upon the international community to adopt a firm and unequivocal stance to halt this dangerous course of action.”
Qatar says Israel attack on Iran ‘hinders’ diplomatic efforts
Gaza mediator Qatar criticised a wave of Israeli strikes on Iran saying it “hinders” attempts “at de-escalation and reaching diplomatic solutions”.
Qatar “expresses its strong condemnation and denunciation of the Israeli attack,” the Gulf state’s foreign ministry said in a statement reported by the official Qatar News Agency, adding the “dangerous escalation threatens security and stability of the region and hinders efforts to de-escalate and reach diplomatic solutions”.
UAE calls for ‘self-restraint and judgment’
The United Arab Emirates condemned “in the strongest terms” Israeli strikes on Iran, urging diplomacy, AP reports.
The UAE is one of only a handful of Arab countries to recognize Israel, after it signed onto the Abraham Accords in 2020. The ministry of foreign affairs for the federation of seven sheikhdoms “stressed the importance of exercising the utmost self-restraint and judgment” and urged against the conflict’s expansion.
Spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres
“The Secretary-General condemns any military escalation in the Middle East. He is particularly concerned by Israeli attacks on nuclear installations in Iran while talks between Iran and the United States on the status of Iran’s nuclear programme are underway.
“The Secretary-General asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford.”
Turkiye condemns ’barbaric
A top Turkish official condemned Israel’s strikes on Iran, describing them as “barbaric” and unjustifiable aggression, the Associated Press (AP) said.
Omer Celik, the spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s governing party also maintained that the action was a diversion tactic, aimed at shifting attention away from international criticism of its actions in Gaza.
“There can be no legitimacy or justification for the Israeli attack. This is barbaric aggression,” Celik said on a X post.
Celik went on to accuse Israel of “hostility” toward diplomatic efforts, noting that the attack took place amid ongoing negotiations between the US and Iran.
India urges Israel and Iran to not escalate tensions
Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal urged both Israel and Iran “to avoid any escalatory steps,” saying India has “close and friendly” relations with the two nations, AP reported.
India, he added, urges “dialogue and diplomacy” and is “closely monitoring the evolving situation, including reports related to attacks on nuclear sites.”
He said India “stands ready to extend all possible support.”
Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong
“Australia is alarmed by the escalation between Israel and Iran. This risks further destabilising a region that is already volatile. We call on all parties to refrain from actions and rhetoric that will further exacerbate tensions.
“We all understand the threat of Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile program represents a threat to international peace and security, and we urge the parties to prioritise dialogue and diplomacy.”
New Zealand prime minister Christopher Luxon
“It’s a really unwelcome development in the Middle East. The risk of miscalculation is high. That region does not need any more military action, and risk associated with that.”
Japan’s chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi
“Japan continues to make all necessary diplomatic efforts to prevent the further deterioration of the situation, while implementing every possible measure to ensure the protection of Japanese citizens.”</p><small>2025-06-13 07:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/684b67564f0a5.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916867/rain-forecast-offers-some-respite-amidst-relentless-heatwave' target='_blank'><strong>Rain forecast offers some respite amidst relentless heatwave</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI/LAH­ORE: The sizzling heatw­a­­ve that has swept Pakistan over the past week may subside, as the Pakistan Meteorological Depart­m­ent (PMD) forecast gusty winds and rain in the northern and central parts of the country from Friday (today) to Monday.
According to the PMD, moist currents are penetrating the upper parts of the country, and a westerly wave is also like­­ly to approach the upper parts on June 13.
Under the influence of this weather system, dust storms, rain, and thundershowers (with isolated hailstorms) are expected in Azad Kash­mir, Gilgit-Baltis­tan, Murree, Galiyat, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Mala­kand, Ma­­nsehra, Batta­gram, Shan­g­­la, Kohistan, and Abbott­abad, with occasional gaps.
 
 

Identical conditions are expected in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Attock, Cha­k­w­­al, Jhelum, Mianwali, Sargodha, Hafiz­abad, Ma­­n­di Bahauddin, Gujran­w­ala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Nar­o­wal, Lahore, Faisal­abad, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Haripur, Peshawar, Mar­dan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Moh­mand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Bannu, Karak, Dera Ismail Khan, Waziristan, Zhob, Bar­khan and Musakhel.

Noorpur Thal among hottest Punjab regions with mercury touching 48.5°C

Dust storms, thunder and rain are also exp­­ected in some districts of southern Pu­­njab and upper Sindh during the period.
Heatwave
Punjab is currently ex­­p­eriencing a severe heatw­a­­ve, with temperatures re­­aching a scorching 48.5°C in Noorpur Thal, making it one of the hottest regio­­ns in the province. Baha­w­alnagar, Bhakkar, Gujran­wala, and Hafizabad rec­o­rded te­­mperatures bet­w­een 47°C and 48°C, while major cities like Lahore and Fai­salabad recorded temperatures of 46°C.
Meanwhile, the Provin­cial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) also issued an alert warning of an impending weather shift from today.
The Punjab governm­ent also directed district administrations and other departments to prepare for potential weather-related disruptions.
NDMA advisory
An impact-based wea­ther advisory issued by NDMA’s National Emer­g­e­ncies Operation Centre (NEOC) has urged the public to take precautions and stay updated via the NDMA app, as extreme heat is expected to affect the rest of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Ba­­lochistan, some areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK from Friday to Wednesday (June 13-18).
A weak western wea­ther system is forecast to affect the upper regions of the country from June 13 to 16, potentially influencing weather conditions across multiple provinces. In Punjab, hot weather is expected to persist throu­ghout the week.
In Khyber Pakhtun­kh­­wa, mostly hot conditions are predicted, but scatte­red rain and windstorms are likely in several districts, including Chitral, Dir, Haripur, Karak, Ko­­h­at, Kohistan, Khyber, Ku­­rram, Mansehra, Moh­ma­­nd, Nowshera, Malakand, Charsadda, Abbottabad, Bannu, Buner, Hazara, Pe­­shawar, Swabi, Swat, Waz­iristan, and adjoining areas.
Sindh and Balochistan are forecast to remain predominantly hot and dry throughout the advisory period.
In Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK, hot weather will prevail, although areas such as Astore, Skardu, Hunza, Shigar, Bagh and Neelum Valley may receive isolated rainfall from June 13 to 16.
Published in Dawn, June 13th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-13 04:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/13092603fa27528.jpg?r=092840' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916865/lahore-high-court-restores-ombudsperson-for-workplace-harassment' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore High Court restores ombudsperson for workplace harassment</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has declared null and void the Punjab caretaker government’s decision to remove Nabila Hakim Ali Khan from her position as Ombudsperson for Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace, restoring her to office with immediate effect.
Justice Raheel Kamran issued a detailed 21-page judgement on a writ petition filed by Ms Khan, who had challenged her de-notification on Aug 4, 2023, on the grounds of lack of legal authority, procedural impropriety, and infringement of her guaranteed tenure.
The petitioner was appointed for a fixed term of four years under the amended Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Amendment) Act, 2022.
The judge held that no removal is permissible during the tenure except for proven misconduct or incapacity, and even then, only after due process, which was entirely absent in this case.
The judge observed that the caretaker government lacked the authority to remove the ombudsperson, terming the act outside its limited constitutional and statutory functions.
Justice Kamran noted that caretaker setups are designed to ensure electoral neutrality and cannot take policy-level or structural decisions that impact statutory bodies. He said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had directed the caretaker government to ensure removal of all politically appointed institutional heads.
However, the judge found the ECP overstepped its authority, as it had no power to direct the termination of a statutory office-holder unless there was compelling evidence that the official could influence electoral outcomes — a criterion that was not met in the petitioner’s case.
The judge also criticised the absence of any inquiry or due process in the petitioner’s removal.
He said despite objections raised later by the provincial government about the petitioner’s qualifications and prior political affiliations, no formal hearing or notice was given to her before de-notification.
“Even if an elected government intended to take any action based on such objections, it would be required to act while following the principles of natural justice, ensuring fairness and due process for the petitioner,” the judge noted.
Recognising the constitutional role of the ECP in conducting free and fair elections, Justice Kamran found that its 2023 directive — used by the caretaker government to justify the de-notification of the petitioner — did not authorise the removal of statutory office holders unless there was a demonstrated risk of election interference.

PAKISTAN’s first and comprehensive National Security Policy has assumed marked importance in the wake of skirmishes between India and Pakistan between May 6-10. I referred to the NSP in my last column, ‘Development challenges’, published in these pages on May 30, 2025. After receiving numerous inquiries, I realised that our NSP may not be general knowledge. So I figured a column was in order.
First, let’s recognise that we do, in fact, have a valid National Security Policy 2022-2026, and a very good one at that. Most countries either don’t have a national security policy or don’t make it public. Not only does Pakistan have a national security policy but it is also a largely public document, with a confidential portion.
By contrast in India, as reported by the media there in 2023, the National Security Council Secretariat has been trying to bring out a national security strategy for many years. Deliberations between the military and strategic community have attempted to build a case and content for the strategy, but it has yet to come to fruition.
After Pakistan, Japan has also produced a national security policy with some interesting similarities between the two. Our NSP was approved after thorough discussions by the highest security forum in the country — the National Security Committee (NSC), and then by the highest national government decision-making body, the federal cabinet, on Dec 28, 2021. It was launched publicly on Jan 14, 2022, with full civil and military support.

‘Security of Pakistan rests in the security of its citizens.’

Good public policies are those which are backed up by robust research and wider, inclusive consultative processes, as is the case with the NSP. It was led by our first civilian National Security Adviser Dr Moeed Yusuf, who was well-suited to his post because of his laudable credentials. A security and strategy academic, he has credible standing in the global security research community, with his wide-ranging experience and academic contributions.
“Formulating a comprehensive National Security Policy for the approval of the National Security Committee as well as ensuring its sustainability through monitoring its implementation and undertaking periodical reviews/updates in consultation with all stakeholders as required” reads the mandate of the National Security Division, according to the Rules of Business, 1973. However, the division had not fulfilled this important part of its mandate since 1973. There was some active interest in 2014, but even then a national security policy could not be developed.
Upon assuming office in December 2019, Dr Yusuf picked up the mantle. Wider national consultations were undertaken, some of which I witnessed personally; 120 working groups in almost all sectors were set up and more than 500 experts consulted.
The policy passed through civil-military scrutiny. The process eventually involved tabling the document in an in-camera briefing before the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, with the then opposition members unfortunately boycotting the proceedings. Eventually, it was approved by the NSC and the federal cabinet.
Rolling out the NSP was meant to set a “directional tone” and send a message to the world that our vision for national security is broad and seeks to identify the means of expanding economic resources so that Pakistan can simultaneously strengthen its traditional and non-traditional security. “The security of Pakistan rests in the security of its citizens,” wrote the prime minister in his message. “Realising the symbiotic relationship between economic, human and traditional security is now imperative for Pakistan’s long-term development. Domestic stability and reg­ional peace based on mutual coexistence, regional connectivity, and shared prosperity are essential prerequisites to optimising national security.”
The NSP articulates a citizen-centric comprehensive national security framework for Pakistan whose ultimate purpose is to ensure the safety, security, dignity and prosperity of Pakistanis.
Organised in eight parts, the NSP covers almost all important aspects of a comprehensive national security framework: national cohesion; economic future; defence and territorial integrity; internal security; foreign policy in a changing world; and human security. The last section on human security covers population growth and migration; health security; climate and water stress; food security and gender security. The NSP includes education in the section on “securing our economic future” as a means of producing an employable and skilled labour force in a highly competitive and technology-driven global job market.
Personally, I am not too happy with the section on health security as it is patchy in concept. It is mainly driven by the Covid pandemic and how to prepare and respond to health emergencies rather than paying serious attention to the urgent need to strengthen essential healthcare for all without discrimination, ie, universal health coverage, which is not possible without investing in primary healthcare.
The continuity of public policies across governments is a sign of system maturity. However, implementation is another challenge altogether.
Regarding the continuity of the NSP, despite providing an inbuilt annual review within the policy, we haven’t heard anything about its implementation. Even in the case of the best laws and policies, the devil resides in the space between policy and implementation.
At the moment, it seems that our NSP has been forgotten. In the backdrop of the events of last month, and with Pakistan now sending its delegations to other capitals to present its case, I wonder if the NSP was even a part of the dossiers prepared for members of the delegation.
It is never too late, however. It is time to revisit Pakistan’s National Security Policy, update it, and implement it. This would be our best case on national security to put before the world.

During the last 65 years of its operation, the IWT has served its purpose well. It includes substantive provisions that clearly fix and regulate the rights and obligations of both India and Pakistan. Since the IWT was a bargain between the two countries, at least for Pakistan, the lower riparian, modifications or changes in the treaty can only be considered if they address its concerns.
However, India had expressed its intent to have the IWT renegotiated before holding it in abeyance. As a matter of fact, Article XII of the IWT itself provides for this eventuality: “The provisions of this treaty may from time to time be modified by a duly ratified treaty concluded for that purpose between the two governments.” And, “The provisions of this treaty or provisions of this treaty as modified … shall continue in force until terminated by a duly ratified treaty concluded for that purpose between the two governments”. India, pursuant to Article XII, sent two notices to Pakistan in January 2023 and in September 2024 inviting Pakistan to begin parleys for the IWT’s modification.
 
 

Post-Pahalgam, Pakistan has invited India to open talks on all issues including the operation of the IWT, which was held in abeyance by India in April 2025. If, ultimately, the two countries agree that the treaty is liable to modification, then Pakistan will be called upon to protect its interests in any Protocol added to the IWT following the modifications agreed upon. I believe there are at least four areas where Pakistan is advised to protect its interest via the Protocol:
i. In order to make the IWT a multilateral water-sharing arrangement, China should be invited to become a party. Both China and India being upper and lower riparians in the region have many disputes inter se. It would be a strategic decision by both to enter into a formal water-sharing arrangement. Such a partnership is not altogether fanciful; its foundations have already been laid in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and related treaties. India, Pakistan and China are members of the SCO.

There are at least four areas where Pakistan is advised to protect its interests via any Protocol to the treaty.

Article 3 of the SCO Charter identifies areas of cooperation among the member states. Article 3 includes “sound environmental management, including water resources management in the region, and implementation of particular joint environmental programmes and projects”. Article 3 additionally provides for expansion of the spheres of cooperation by mutual agreement. If a multilateral arrangement is agreed to in the shape of a Protocol to the IWT, all three countries will benefit and it will help lessen tensions.
China’s case for becoming a party to any future Protocol to the IWT is supported by precedents of various major rivers in the world. For example, the Mekong is a transboundary river and all countries sharing it are parties to the 1995 Framework Agreement for sustainable development and management of the river basin. The Mekong River Commission manages the obligations under the said agreement.
Similarly, the Nile River Basin Cooperative Framework 2010 is executed by states that share the river. It also established the Nile River Basin Commission that develops the river in a cooperative manner.
In Europe, the Danube is shared by 14 countries, which have formed an international commission through a convention in 1994. Given that the Indus originates from Tibet, China, it creates a just cause to consider China becoming a party to any new arrangement under the IWT. In any case, India itself has created a locus standi for China through its own doing vide the presidential order of Aug 5, 2019.
ii. Clause 8 of Annexure D to the IWT lays down the criteria which India has to observe while designing any dam on the western rivers. Clause 9 further requires India to inform Pakistan six months before starting any construction on a dam to allow Pakistan to assess whether or not the provisions of Clause 8 have been duly followed by India. In fact, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII (2) of the IWT, India’s decision to construct a dam (apart from the matter of its design) is taken outside the purview of the IWT regime and is based wholly on India’s arbitrary assessment of its energy needs and strategic interests.
In the above scenario, Pakistan may only object to the technical specifications under the provisions of Annex-D but cannot challenge the necessity or soundness of the decision of the upper riparian state to construct a particular dam. In order to restrain the abusive and arbitrary use of power to construct as many dams as it likes, it is necessary to provide a judicial mechanism in the shape of the International Court of Justice or Court of Arbitration, where the decision of constructing a dam itself may be challenged as unnecessary or mala fide. In this view, three years’ notice to Pakistan to protect its interests is also called upon after a political decision to construct a dam has been taken.
iii. Presently, the IWT does not contain any provision envisaging the management of climate change. The IWT in its present form relies on historical data in order to ensure that water supplies remain consistent. However, this is no longer safe on account of climate change. It is recommended that the IWT reflect the need to establish mechanisms to quantify and collect data regarding climate change, while also strengthening existing data collection. Therefore, in order to assess changes that are required as a consequence of the impact of climate change, provisions should be introduced for establishing a permanent panel of experts with representation from all parties.
iv. A provision to the effect that India should maintain minimum water flow in the eastern rivers for the lower riparian state needs to be added to the Protocol. In the context of international water law, ‘minimum flow’ refers to the least amount of water that a river needs to continue to flow to satisfy the needs of lower riparian states, including ecological needs.

During a meeting with UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, PM Shehbaz appreciated the Gulf state’s consistent efforts in promoting peace, dialogue and stability in the region.
The high-level engagement took place as part of the prime minister’s day-long official visit to Abu Dhabi, aimed at reaffirming Pakistan’s gratitude to friendly nations that supported Islamabad’s position during its recent standoff with New Delhi.
Tensions flared following what Islamabad termed a “false flag operation” by India in the mountainous resort town of Pahalgam. In the wake of the incident, both countries carried out missile and air strikes. According to Pakistan’s military, India lost six aircraft in the exchange, including a Rafale fighter jet.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, both sides expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of bilateral ties and ongoing engagements at all levels. The leaders agreed to maintain close coordination and continue working together to advance shared goals of regional peace and prosperity.
The meeting underscored the deep-rooted, brotherly relations between Pakistan and the UAE, built on mutual trust, shared values and a history of close cooperation.
The two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral, reg­i­o­nal and global issues of mutual interest, and reaffirmed their commitment to further enhancing collaboration in key areas. Prime Minister Shehbaz reiterated his earlier invitation to the UAE president to visit Pakistan.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi were also present at the meeting.
Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz was warmly received at Abu Dhabi’s Al Bateen Airport by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE’s national security adviser and brother of the president. He also accompanied the prime minister to the Presidential Palace.
Secretary General of the UAE Supreme National Security Council Ali Ahmed Al Shamsi, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, and Pakistani diplomatic staff were also present at the airport to receive the prime minister.
London Tech Week
Later in the day, PM Shehbaz addressed Pakistan’s participation at London Tech Week 2025 held in Abu Dhabi, where he highlighted the country’s commitment to transitioning into a knowledge-based economy.
Speaking at the global platform, the premier said Pakistan’s dedication to digital transformation, technological innovation and youth empowerment remained unwavering.
The prime minister congratulated all stakeholders on Pakistan’s impactful presence at London Tech Week 2025.
“This positions Pakistan as a forward-looking country that is harnessing technology, innovation and youth potential to engage with the world,” he said. “Our presence at such an important platform reflects our growing digital footprint and global ambition.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz returned to Pakistan on Thursday evening after concluding his official visit to the United Arab Emirates.
PM’s notice
In a separate development, PM Shehbaz has taken notice of a more than five-fold increase in the salaries of the National Assembly speaker and Senate chairman and sought a report from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.
Sources said the prime minister’s action came in the wake of widespread public criticism over the increase in the salaries of the custodians of the two houses from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3 million a month.
The decision has drawn criticism from within the ruling PML-N, as two party stalwarts — Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Khawaja Saad Rafique — publicly criticised the move.
However, during the post-budget press conference on Wednesday, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb defended the steep hikes — some as large as 550 per cent — in the salaries of the speaker, deputy speaker, members of parliament, and ministers.

However, this breach is not limited to the industrial sector or Sindh. The situation in the services sector, where few are paid minimum wages, is more alarming. Women work for less wages than their male colleagues though they put in an equal number of hours and do the same job.
At Wednesday’s post-budget press conference, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb himself admitted that industry in particular and the private sector in general are not willing to pay minimum wages. The lame explanation was that the government had not announced increased minimum wages in the new budget. His response underlines the helplessness of the state before employers who do not give a hoot about the law.
 
 

The large-scale informality in the economy due to the lack of any credible attempt to document unregistered businesses has deepened the challenge of enforcing the minimum wage, leaving workers vulnerable to exploitation. But the main reason for non-compliance is the systematic annihilation of trade unions by the state at the behest of employers over the last four decades.
Thus it is foolish to expect toothless and corrupt provincial employees’ social security organisations to force wealthy employers to implement the minimum wage.
Enforcement of the latter across the board is also linked to implementing other labour laws and active labour unions putting pressure on delinquent employers. Overall, the lack of enforcement of laws, including those related to minimum wages, is contributing to poverty and inequality.
If the authorities can seek punitive legislation for tax compliance, they can also draft a similar bill for implementation of the minimum wages rather than ceding to employers’ diktat.

• Minister expects policy rate to come down before next year, seems hopeful about privatisation
• Finance secretary says current year’s uplift budget reduced to Rs967bn, hints at further drop
• Lawmakers concerned over tax-to-GDP ratio, revenue shortfall, taxes on solar panels, among other things
ISLAMABAD: Amid a downward revision in federal development spending, which may fall further by the end of this month, the Ministry of Finance told a parliamentary panel on Thursday that armed forces officers had been granted a special relief allowance at 50 per cent of their basic salary, while junior commissioned officers and soldiers would get 20pc allowance in the upcoming fiscal year.
Testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Secretary Finance Imdadullah Bosal highlighted relief measures proposed in the budget, saying that “special relief allowance at the rate of 50pc to officers and 20pc to JCOs/soldiers” of their basic salary had been granted. The meeting was presided over by MNA Syed Naveed Qamar.
The ministry did not disclose the financial impact and the reason for the higher allowance for officers in response to members’ questions about the financial impact of these allowances. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb promised to get back with a detailed response, besides few other things, later saying he had noted down the points raised by Omar Ayub, the leader of the opposition.
Mr Bosal disclosed that the current year’s public sector development programme had been revised to Rs967bn from Rs1.1 trillion and conceded even this amount may not be fully utilised by June 30, given the fact that Rs662bn had so far been actually spent.
At this, the members pointed out that a reduction in development expenditure would not only change the current year’s growth estimates (2.7pc of GDP) based on Rs1.1tr investment but also many other economic indicators as well.
The minister expected the central bank’s policy rate decline to single digits before the close of the current calendar year, as inflation had been a ‘fantastic story’ and both fiscal and current accounts improved significantly. He said the monetary policy committee was set to meet next week and there was a cushion to do more. He did not comment further, saying it was the State Bank of Pakistan’s domain.
The minister said Pakistan would be receiving about $1bn foreign inflows before the close of the current fiscal year through a syndicated arrangement from banks, with about $500 million guarantee from the Asian Development Bank, to be doubled next year. Therefore, the foreign exchange reserves currently at over $11bn would touch $14bn by June-end.
The minister said Pakistan would double commercial and capital market borrowing next year as credit ratings improved further, pointing out that about $500 million foreign bond maturing in September and another $1.2bn in April next year would be repaid in time.
The finance secretary said the major source of non-tax revenue – SBP profit – that stood at Rs2.6tr during the current year and projected at Rs2.4tr next year was mainly because of windfall from the higher policy rate. Normally, it remains around Rs1tr or so, he said.
Petroleum levy
He said the petroleum levy, another major source of non-tax revenue, stood at Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs77 per litre on petrol and would be increased by Rs2.5/litre carbon levy under the next year’s budget, taking its size on average to Rs80/litre on these two products.
With an additional levy on furnace oil, the PDL was targeted to generate Rs1.468tr next year from Rs1.161tr during the current year. He confirmed that the upper cap on the petroleum development levy had been removed as the government increased its rate by Rs10/litre for the power sector subsidy and another Rs8 per litre for the Quetta-Karachi (N25) highway. The government had no plan to further increase it, he added.
Mr Bosal said the BISP allocation for next year had been increased by 21pc to Rs716bn from Rs592bn, while Azad Kashmir’s grant had been jacked up by 33pc to Rs140bn next year from Rs105bn. The allocation for Gilgit-Baltistan had also been raised by 18pc to Rs80bn from Rs68bn, which was in addition to another Rs20bn wheat subsidy to the region. Likewise, another special area of tribal merged districts had also been increased by 21pc to Rs80bn from Rs66bn.
The minister acknowledged members’ concern about Rs87bn revenue projections next year from privatisation deals. He said this was an area where the government could not complete any transaction, but many corrections had been made, including certain incentives allowed by the IMF. This would not only take the PIA to the finish line but also the Roosevelt Hotel, three power distribution companies and a couple of financial sector transactions, both through strategic sale and listings on the capital market, he added.
The finance minister thanked the four provinces for delivering over Rs1tr cash surplus this year and hoped to secure another Rs1.464tr next year. Their support helped the overall fiscal deficit reach 5.6pc of GDP against the federal deficit of 6.8pc envisaged in the budget last year. With their support, the consolidated fiscal deficit was estimated at 3.9pc of GDP for next year.
The committee members expressed concerns over the tax-to-GDP ratio, revenue shortfall, taxes on solar panels, hybrid vehicles, carbon levy, petroleum levy, private sector lending and debt, SMEs, industrial and agricultural growth and targets, withholding tax (WHT) on ATMs and bank deposits, pensions, gender-specific allocations, health-specific allocations, electric vehicles, structural reforms, sales tax on cotton, public sector expenditure, defence spending, the widening current account deficit, and the negative growth rates observed in both the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.
The discussion also highlighted the challenges of climate change and the need for social protection. The members expressed serious concerns regarding the inefficiency of Customs Intelligence and smuggling at the borders.

The Israeli army said on X that its soldiers seized several suspected members of Palestinian group Hamas in a  “targeted” operation in Beit Jinn, 12 kilometres (seven and a half miles) from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Since the overthrow of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria aimed at denying military assets to the Islamist-led interim administration. It has also deployed tro­ops across the demilitarised zone on the Syrian side of the armistice line that used to separate the opposing forces on the Golan.
Syria’s interior ministry said “these repeated provocations constitute a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic… these practises cannot lead the region to stability and will only result in further tension and turmoil”.
The Israeli military said troops carried out a  “targeted, intelligence-based nighttime operation in Syria and apprehended several Hamas terrorists”. It alleged that those seized were plotting attacks on Israeli troops.
The Syrian interior ministry said that Israeli soldiers detained seven people and fired directly at the villagers, killing one civilian.
In a statement, Syria’s foreign ministry called on the international community to  “take decisive steps to stop these recurring attacks”.
The raid comes days after the Israeli army said it  “struck a Hamas terrorist in the area of Mazraat Beit Jinn”, which neighbours Beit Jinn. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said one person was killed in the attack.

AHMEDABAD: More than 200 people were killed when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed shortly after takeoff, authorities said on Thursday, in what is said to be the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
Only one person is known to have survived, as the plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel just outside the airport at lunchtime.
The passengers included 169 Indian nationals, 53 British, seven Portuguese, and a Canadian. Two pilots and 10 cabin crew were also aboard, according to AFP.

According to air traffic control at Ahmedabad Airport, Air India’s flight 171 — bound for London Gatwick airport — departed at 1:39 pm local time (0809 GMT) from runway 23. It gave a Mayday call, signalling an emergency, but thereafter there was no response from the aircraft.
Footage of the crash showed the plane taking off over a residential area and then disappearing from view, before a huge ball of fire and smoke is seen rising into the sky from beyond the houses.
Another video circulating on social media showed an aircraft rapidly losing altitude — with its nose up — before it hit a building and exploded into an orange ball of fire.
India’s CNN News-18 said the plane crashed on top of the dining area of state-run B.J. Medical College hostel, killing many medical students as well.
‘Sole survivor’
City police chief G.S. Malik told Reuters that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. Vidhi Chaudhary, another senior police officer, said they had found one survivor, who was in seat 11A.
Indian media identified the fortunate man as UK resident Ramesh Viswashkumar.
“Thirty seconds after takeoff, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed,” the 40-year-old told the Hindustan Times.
 






“It all happened so quickly,” he told the paper from his hospital bed.
Police chief Malik said the bodies recovered could include both passengers and people killed on the ground.
“When I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me,” he said.
“Someone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital.”
He said that his brother Ajay was seated in a different row on the plane. “He was travelling with me and I cant find him anymore. Please help me find him, he said.
According to the BBC, Vishwash has a wife and child and has lived in the UK for many years. His relatives, who had gathered at the family home in Leicester, said they were awaiting more information.
Federal minister C.R. Patil said the dead included Vijay Rupani, a former chief minister of Gujarat state.
The Indian aviation minister’s office said PM Narendra Modi, whose home state is Gujarat, had told it to ensure all support was extended to the rescue efforts.
Ahmedabad Airport, which suspended all flight operations after the crash, said it was operational again but with limited flights. The airport is operated by India’s Adani Group conglomerate.
The last fatal plane crash in India, the world’s third largest aviation market and its fastest growing, was in 2020 and involved Air India Express, the airline’s low-cost arm.
Tata will provide Rs10 million ($117,000) to the families of each of the dead, cover all medical expenses of those injured and help rebuild the hostel of the medical college, chairman N. Chandrasekaran said.
First Dreamliner crash
Aviation tracking site Flightradar24 said the plane was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, one of the most modern passenger aircraft in service.
It was the first crash for the Dreamliner, which began flying commercially in 2011, according to the Aviation Safety Network database. The plane that crashed on Thursday flew for the first time in 2013 and was delivered to Air India in January 2014, Flightradar24 said.
Investigators with the US National Transportation Safety Board will travel to assist Indian counterparts probing the brutal Air India crash, the agency announced Thursday.
“The NTSB will be leading a team of US investigators travelling to India to assist… with (the) investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 in Ahmedabad, India,” the agency said on X, adding that under international protocols, “all information on the investigation will be provided by the Government of India.”
 






The UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) says it has “formally offered its assistance” to the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in India.
It adds that the UK AAIB will have expert status in the Indian investigation because UK citizens were on board the plane.
Boeing said it was aware of initial reports and was working to gather more information. Boeing shares fell 5pc as the crash posed a major setback for the planemaker as its new CEO looks to rebuild trust following a series of safety and production challenges.
Aircraft engine-maker GE Aerospace said that it would put a team together to go to India and analyse cockpit data, CNBC TV18 reported.

• Says fiscal space shrinking, provinces must share burden and invest in human development
ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Thursday proposed shifting the “regressive” population-based formula for distributing divisible pool resources under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award to criteria based on climate adaptation and other performance indicators.
Speaking at a news briefing, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the current NFC criteria were regressive as population, being the overwhelming consideration, had been made an incentive instead of a disincentive. He said the Centre would seek climate adaptation and other social sector indicators as key determinants for distributing resources with and among the provinces when the NFC meets in August this year. He went on to question the devolution planned under the 18th Amendment and the 7th NFC Award in place since 2009.
He said the devolution was incomplete as the provinces had not devolved responsibilities and resources down to the district level for such a long time despite commitments. He said the size of provincial finances had expanded, which required a district government system to be activated. He said the Centre had devolved powers to the provinces, which would have to empower local governments.
On the occasion, Chief Statistician Naeemuz Zafar defended economic growth estimates for the current year at 2.7 per cent, saying he could elaborate and defend the outcomes of the recent National Accounts Committee (NAC).
He said the objections over NAC datasets were not justified as the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics had published all the data on its website, and statistics about the growth estimates were transparent.
He said he had also noticed some objections over agricultural output, but it should be recognised that major crops only made up 18pc of the agricultural sector. The remaining 80pc comprises livestock, fisheries and forestry.
However, responding to a question, he conceded that the GDP growth rate estimates had taken into account Rs1.1 trillion public sector development investments and data pertaining to livestock was worked out based on the 2010 survey.
This indicated that, along with the industrial sector’s upsurge reported in the fourth quarter, the 2.7pc GDP growth rate would need to be revised by the September-October NAC review, as the Ministry of Finance separately put the PSDP spending at Rs967 billion instead of Rs1.1tr and indicated its further revision.
Fiscal space shrinking
The planning minister said the Centre’s fiscal space was shrinking as the development programme had contracted to 0.8pc from over 1.2pc of GDP in a few years, which was a matter of concern. He said that after transfer of provincial shares, the Centre would be left with about Rs11tr, of which over Rs8.2tr would go for debt servicing and the remaining on defence expenditure.
Therefore, the provinces must share the expenditure and invest in human development, including child stunting, as 40pc children were currently stunted, he said.
Responding to a question, the minister said India was weaponising water, which was a serious challenge for Pakistan, but warned that India would need to avoid that route or face consequences. He stressed that Pakistan was prioritising water sector projects and dams.
Mr Iqbal said the national leadership had resolved collectively to transition from crisis to stability and sustained growth under the vision of Uraan Pakistan and the 13th Five-Year Plan. “This year’s budget is not merely a financial statement. It’s a roadmap towards recovery, resilience and opportunity for all Pakistanis,” he added.
He said the government had been struggling for two years to pay for ongoing development projects. “Today, we are paying our defence expenditures and servicing debt obligations from our own resources, but very soon, we will finance our development independently,” he said.
This would be achieved through 4.5pc growth in agriculture through Rs4.2bn investments in crop productivity and livestock, modernisation and mechanisation, backed by provincial initiatives such as the Punjab Kissan Card.

The distribution of food and basic supplies in the war-ravaged Gaza Strip has become increasingly fraught and perilous, exacerbating the territory’s deep hunger crisis.
Civil defence official Mohammed al-Mughayyir told AFP that the Al-Awda Hospital received 10 dead and around 200 wounded, including women and children, “after Israeli drones dropped multiple bombs on gatherings of civilians near an aid distribution point around the Netzarim checkpoint in central Gaza”.
He said that Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital received six dead following Israeli attacks on aid queues near Netzarim and in the Al-Sudaniya area in northwestern Gaza.

GHF accuses Hamas of attacking aid workers; Palestinian group calls the foundation a ‘filthy tool’ of Israeli forces

The Israeli army said it was looking into the reports when asked for comment by AFP. Restrictions imposed on media in the Gaza Strip and the difficulties of access on the ground mean AFP is not able to independently verify the death tolls.
Mughayyir said another six people were killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza.
Aid workers
The US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) on Thursday accused Palestinian group Hamas of attacking aid workers en route to distribution centres, saying that at least eight people had been killed.
GHF had earlier given a toll of at least five killed in the attack, which took place late Wednesday in the southern Gaza Strip.
“We are still collecting more information on the deadly and unprovoked attack on our dedicated local team members and volunteers,” GHF interim executive director John Acree said in a statement.
“As of now, we can confirm at least eight fatalities, multiple injuries, and we fear that some of our team members have been taken hostage,” he added.
In an earlier statement, GHF said a bus carrying more than two dozen members of it team, “local Palestinians working side by side with the US GHF team to deliver critical aid, were brutally attacked by Hamas”.
It said the team was en route to one of the foundation’s distribution centres west of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip.
“We carefully considered closing our sites today given the heightened security risks and safety concerns, but we decided that the best response to … murderers was to keep delivering food for the people of Gaza who are counting on us,” Acree said in the group’s update.
“We will not be deterred from our mission towards providing food security for the Palestinian people in Gaza.”
An officially private effort with opaque funding and backed by Israel, GHF began operations on May 26 after Israel completely cut off supplies into Gaza for more than two months, sparking warnings of mass famine.
The United Nations and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives. GHF claimed it had distributed nearly 2.6 million meals today and more than 18.6 million to date.
Hamas accused GHF of becoming a “filthy tool” of Israeli forces. “The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has become a filthy tool in the hands of the occupying army, used to lure civilians into deadly traps,” the Hamas government media office in Gaza told AFP on Thursday.

Trump had offered to work on the Kashmir issue after he brokered a ceasefire between the two nuclear powers following their most intense military confrontation in decades. In a message lauding the countries’ leaders for achieving peace, he remarked, “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”
Responding to a question on the steps the US plans to take in the wake of Trump’s offer, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce noted, “[Trump] has been the only one to bring certain people to the table to have conversations that nobody thought was possible,” remaining hopeful that the Kashmir issue can also get resolved.
Fielding questions after a bill-signing ceremony on Thursday, the US president said that he “stopped a war” between Pakistan and India.
“Eventually they were gonna go nuclear … and I stopped it, I called each leader … and I spoke to them and talked about trade,” Trump said. “I said, ‘You’re not trading with us if you go to war … if you’re going to start throwing nuclear weapons around.
“They were both unbelievable. They understood it exactly, they stopped. I stopped that war with phone calls and trade,” Trump added.
He further said that India is negotiating a trade deal in Washington, and a Pakistani delegation would arrive “I think next week”.
In response to another question, Trump said, “We’re going to get them together. I told them, India and Pakistan … they have a longtime rivalry over Kashmir. I told them ‘I can solve anything.’
“I will be your arbitrator. I will be your arbitrator. I can solve anything.”
 
 

Pakistan and India have been at odds since the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly denied the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before the US brokered a ceasefire on May 10.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team visited London and will also visit Brussels.
The delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Subzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.

The move was made in a notification today from the Sindh Excise, Taxation and Νarcotics Control Department.
The Associated Press of Pakistan reported that on September 16, 2024, the Sindh Excise Department had taken a significant step by making biometric verification mandatory for vehicle registrations and transfers.
Sindh Senior Minister for Information, Transport, Excise, Taxation, and Narcotics Control Sharjeel Memon had said that all new and old vehicles would be subject to biometric verification during the registration or transfer process.
He elaborated that the change would be implemented in three phases under the new policy. In the first phase, starting from July 1, biometric verification will be mandatory for the registration of new vehicles.
In the second phase, beginning on November 1, biometric verification would be required for vehicle buyers.  In the third phase, biometric verification of both the vehicle seller and buyer would be enforced.
Memon had said that the government was working to make all processes more transparent in the Excise Department and was committed to ensuring that Sindh led the way in digitising public services.
He had emphasised that biometric authentication in vehicle registration and transfers was a significant milestone in promoting transparency that would enable the accurate identification of buyers and sellers, thereby helping to protect citizens from illegal vehicle transfers and fraud.
Memon had said that vehicle owners could visit any Nadra e-Facilitation Centre or district excise office to complete the biometric verification process.</p><small>2025-06-12 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12212700e2411db.jpg?r=215106' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916754/pm-shehbaz-discusses-regional-peace-bilateral-ties-with-uae-leadership' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz discusses regional peace, bilateral ties with UAE leadership</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday met with the United Arab Emirates leadership to discuss regional peace and stability and explore ways to deepen bilateral ties during his official day-long visit to the emirates.
Over the last few months, UAE has expressed commitment to strengthening its long-standing partnership with Pakistan and announced a $2 billion debt rollover soon after.  In April, the two nations signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen the bonds between the people of both nations.
The premier arrived in Abu Dhabi earlier today, where he was welcomed by the UAE’s National Security Adviser, Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
During a high-level meeting with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, PM Shehbaz discussed bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest and reaffirmed commitment to further enhance cooperation in key areas, state media PTV reported.
“Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the positive trend of bilateral relations and the ongoing progress at all levels,” it added.
They agreed to maintain close communication and continue working together to advance the shared goals of regional peace and prosperity, the report said.
It added, “PM [Shehbaz] reiterated the invitation to the President of the UAE to visit Pakistan soon.”
The premier’s delegation included Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, and Special Assistant to the PM Tariq Fatemi.
In a statement posted on X, PM Shehbaz said that he was “delighted” to meet with Al-Nahyan, thanking him for the UAE’s “vital role in easing recent tensions” with India.
“We reaffirmed our shared commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” he said. “Our deep-rooted ties built on trust and brotherhood, continue to grow stronger, especially in trade and investment. “I look forward to welcoming His Highness to Pakistan soon.”
 






In February, PM Shehbaz was invited by the UAE to participate in the World Governments Summit (WGS) in Dubai, where he delivered a keynote address highlighting Pakistan’s vision for inclusive economic growth, digital transformation and governance reforms.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p><small>2025-06-12 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/121959296c9b9ca.jpg?r=211931' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916747/mahrang-approaches-sc-against-bhcs-dismissal-of-constitutional-pleas-for-release' target='_blank'><strong>Mahrang approaches SC against BHC’s dismissal of constitutional pleas for release</strong></a><br><p>Rights activist Mahrang Baloch on Thursday moved the Supreme Court against the Balochistan High Court’s (BHC) May 22 order that dismissed constitutional petitions challenging her detention and that of two other Baloch leaders, more than two months after they were held under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO).
Mahrang, the chief of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), along with other activists of the group was arrested on March 22 for allegedly “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after their members faced a police crackdown in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang’s sister had challenged the detention in the BHC but the court had asked the petitioner to approach the home department for her release. The sister had subsequently filed constitutional petitions in the high court challenging the detentions but those were dismissed.
Mahrang’s petition, filed in the Supreme Court (SC) through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi and lawyer Jibran Nasir, pleaded for the right to appeal against the May 22 order and requested the apex court to set aside the BHC judgment and allow the constitutional petitions.
Mahrang argued the BHC judgment was “without jurisdiction, illegal, and liable to be set aside”.
She said that the continued detention was “unjustified and disproportionate” as her name was already placed in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, subjecting her to stringent restrictions on movement, liberty, and livelihood and enabling the government to maintain oversight through measures including good behaviour bonds, movement restrictions, reporting requirements and asset inquiries.
“It is submitted that further preventive detention under the MPO, in addition to these restrictions, amounts to excessive and punitive control which fails the legal tests of legality, necessity, and proportionality,” the petition said, adding that she was entitled to be released from preventive custody so she may lawfully defend herself in pending cases and seek appropriate legal remedies.
The petitioner also argued that the impugned decision by the Balochistan government was “vitiated by a manifest misapplication of law and a complete failure to adhere to statutory procedure”.
She requested to be allowed to urge further grounds in addition to the above at the hearing of this appeal.
A day earlier, her sister urged the apex court to set aside the BHC’s April 15 order that rej­ected the plea against Mahrang’s detention under the MPO.
The petition alleged that her “repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a sympathiser of militants” was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons. It apprised the court that her father and brother were “subjected to enforced disappearance in 2011 and 2017.”
The federal governm­ent through the interior ministry, home and tribal aff­airs department of Baloch­istan, prosecutor general, inspector general of police, Federal Investiga­tion Agency director general, Quetta deputy commissioner and the state have been named as res­pon­dents in the petition.
Along with the main appeal, a separate application was also filed before the Supreme Court, seeking suspension of the BHC order during the pendency of the present case.</p><small>2025-06-12 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1219581430744a4.jpg?r=200453' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916751/motorway-cop-allegedly-killed-by-wife-in-mardan-police' target='_blank'><strong>Motorway cop allegedly killed by wife in Mardan: police</strong></a><br><p>A woman on Thursday allegedly gunned down her husband, a motorway cop, in the Mian Khan area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan district, according to police.
Mardan police spokesperson Faheem Khan told Dawn.com, “The suspect has been arrested and a first information report (FIR) has been registered at the Baizai police station.”
The FIR, registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and seen by Dawn.com, states that the complainant, the slain police official’s elder brother, alleged that he was asleep in his room when gunshots were heard in the house.
“When my wife and I went inside, we found my brother’s wife with a pistol in her hand, while he was lying in a pool of blood,” the complainant alleged, adding that the victim succumbed to his injuries while being transported to a hospital in Katlang.
“There have been domestic disputes between them since they got married and they used to fight regularly,” the complainant added in the FIR.
Incidents of homicides are frequently reported in various parts of the country. According to the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), Punjab, KP, and Sindh are among the regions with a higher number of murder FIRs.
A day ago, Punjab police said they arrested a suspect in Okara for the alleged murder of his wife last month.
The FIR of the incident was registered at Okara’s Renala Khurd Saddar Police Station at the complaint of the woman’s father under Section 302 of the PPC on May 19. According to the FIR, the complainant found his daughter murdered with her throat slit when he reached his son-in-law’s home with the latter lying unconscious on the ground in an injured state as well.
Last month, a man and his two sons were shot dead in Mardan district, police and rescue officials said, adding that the five suspects had fled the scene.</p><small>2025-06-12 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12203111fe54059.jpg?r=203115' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916752/harvey-weinstein-jury-resumes-deliberations-after-partial-conviction-infighting' target='_blank'><strong>Harvey Weinstein jury resumes deliberations after partial conviction, infighting</strong></a><br><p>Jurors will reconvene on Thursday in Harvey Weinsteins sex crimes retrial, a day after they handed down a partial conviction against the former movie mogul but hit an impasse on a rape count as deliberations spiralled into angry infighting.
Weinstein, once one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood, faced a retrial that began on April 23 after a state appeals court last year overturned his 2020 conviction.
He was accused by prosecutors in the case of raping an aspiring actress and assaulting two other women.
Weinstein, 73, pleaded not guilty and has denied assaulting anyone or having non-consensual sex.
The jury found Weinstein guilty on one of the three counts he faced, which stemmed from his alleged assault of former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The jury found Weinstein not guilty of a charge stemming from his alleged assault of Kaja Sokola in 2002 when she was a 16-year-old aspiring actress.
The jury has not yet reached a verdict on a third count, which charges him with raping aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013.
In a startling development on Wednesday, the jury foreperson told presiding Supreme Court Justice Curtis Farber that other members of the panel were shouting at him and threatening him for refusing to change his vote on the rape count.
Farber sent jurors home for the day to give them time to cool down and instructed the foreperson to arrive in court separately on Thursday.
Weinstein’s lawyers unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial, arguing that the breakdown in the jury room would taint any verdict.
Regardless of the eventual verdict on the rape charge, Weinstein faces up to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced. He has separately been sentenced to 16 years in prison following a rape conviction in California.
In closing arguments on June 3, the prosecution told the 12 jurors that the evidence showed how Weinstein used his power and influence to trap and abuse women.
The defence countered that the accusers lied on the witness stand out of spite after their consensual sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer failed to result in Hollywood stardom.
A jury found Weinstein guilty in February 2020 of raping Mann and sexually assaulting Haley. Sokola’s allegation was not part of that case.
The conviction was a milestone for the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct by powerful men.
But the New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, threw out that conviction in April 2024. It said the trial judge erred by letting women testify that Weinstein had assaulted them, though their accusations were not the basis of the criminal charges.
Though the conviction was thrown out, Weinstein, who has had a litany of health problems in recent years and attended the retrial in a wheelchair, has remained behind bars because of his California conviction. He is appealing that verdict.
More than 100 women, including famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of misconduct.
He co-founded the Miramax studio, whose hit movies included such Academy Award winners as “Shakespeare in Love” and “Pulp Fiction.” Weinsteins own eponymous film studio filed for bankruptcy in March 2018, five months after sexual misconduct accusations against him became widely publicised.</p><small>2025-06-12 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12181458d761bde.jpg?r=185008' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916743/pakistan-hits-rock-bottom-in-wefs-global-gender-gap-report-out-of-148-countries' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan hits rock bottom in WEF’s global gender gap report out of 148 countries</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan was bottom-ranked among 148 countries in the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Gender Gap Report 2025 — with 56.7 per cent gender parity — the highest since 2006, it emerged on Thursday.
The annual report benchmarked the current state and evolution of gender parity across four key dimensions: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.
In the latest report, Pakistan has been ranked below Sudan, (57pc, 147th), Chad (57.1pc, 146th), Iran (58.3pc,145th), Guinea (59.5pc, 144th), Democratic Republic of the Congo (60.1pc, 143rd), Niger (61.3pc,142nd), Algeria (61.4pc, 141st), and Mali (61.7pc, 140th).
Occupying the bottom rank of the index, Pakistan saw its overall parity score decline from last year’s edition, from 57pc to 56.7pc, the report said. Overall Pakistan has closed +2.3 of its gender gap since 2006.
However, this year’s results were a second consecutive drop from the economy’s best score of 57.7pc, achieved in 2023. Pakistan’s parity in economic participation and opportunity has declined by 1.3 percentage points, the report said.
While economic representation indicators have remained unchanged, income disparity in Pakistan has slightly increased since the last edition (0.02 points), as has perceived wage inequality (4 percentage points).
The sole sub-index advance registered by Pakistan in this year’s edition was “Educational Attainment”, bumping educational parity upwards by 1.5 percentage points to reach 85.1pc.
The shift was partly driven by an increase in female literacy rates (from 46.5pc to 48.5pc). However, parity has also risen because male enrolment shares have dropped in tertiary education, increasing the relative balance between men and women but lowering educational reach overall.
The report said Pakistan’s economy had seen political parity drop from 12.2pc in 2024 to 11pc in 2025.
While parity in parliament increased by 1.2 percentage points, women’s ministerial representation dropped from 5.9pc in 2024 to zero in 2025 and with it the overall sub-index score, the report added.
Pakistan was listed among countries including Azerbaijan, Hungary, Saudi Arabia, and Vanuatu that have all-male ministerial cabinets.
Commenting on the 2025 edition of the report, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, Saadia Zahidi, said the report “arrives at a decisive moment, with the world in flux as technological breakthroughs, geopolitical conflict and economic uncertainty are creating unprecedented challenges as well as bringing new opportunities.
“Amid such change, gender parity is both a principle and a strategy,’’ she said, adding that “economies that tap into the full spectrum of their talent and human capital are best positioned to navigate an era of transformation and accelerate productivity and prosperity.”
Zahidi said most economies were not fully leveraging this pathway for growth.
 






The report found that there was still a combined global average gender gap of over 30pc across four areas: economic participation and opportunity, political empowerment, educational attainment and health and survival, she added.
The global gender gap score in 2025 for all 148 economies included in this edition of the index stands at 68.8pc. The global gender gap closed by 0.3 percentage points in 2025, from 68.4pc in 2024 to 68.8pct in 2025.
Based on the collective speed of progress of those 100 economies, it will take 123 years to reach full parity globally, the report said.
The 2025 Global Gender Gap Index shows that no economy has yet achieved full gender parity. Iceland (92.6pc) continues to lead the Global Gender Gap Index, holding the top position for 16 consecutive years, and remains the only economy to have closed more than 90pc of its gender gap since 2022.
Each of the top 10 ranked economies have closed at least 80pc of their gender gaps, the only economies to do so. Globally, gender parity has increased by 4.8 percentage points since 2006.</p><small>2025-06-12 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/121838200486122.jpg?r=184116' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916746/trump-says-los-angeles-safe-and-sound-for-two-nights-after-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Los Angeles ‘safe and sound’ for two nights after protests</strong></a><br><p>Los Angeles was “safe and sound for the last two nights”, United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday morning, as he hailed troops for helping to restore order in the city after days of anti-deportation protests.
“Our great National Guard, with a little help from the Marines, put the LA Police in a position to effectively do their job,” Trump said on Truth Social, adding that without the military, the city “would be a crime scene like we haven’t seen in years”.
The mostly peaceful protests ignited last week over a sudden escalation in efforts to apprehend migrants in the country illegally. But there were also pockets of violence, including the burning of self-driving taxis and hurling stones at police.
Trump deployed several thousand National Guard troops and some 700 active-duty Marines over the objections of Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom, the first such action by a US president in decades.
In his post, Trump said Newsom “had totally lost control of the situation”.
“He should be saying thank you … instead of trying to justify his mistakes and incompetence!!!” the president added.
Similar protests also ignited in other cities across the United States, as California prepared on Thursday for a legal showdown over Trump’s deployment of the military.

As part of the Global March to Gaza, thousands of activists planned to travel to Egypt’s Rafah border crossing with the Palestinian territory on Friday to demand the entry of humanitarian aid.
On Thursday, the march’s spokesperson Saif Abukeshek told AFP: “Over 200 participants were detained at Cairo airport or questioned at hotels across Cairo.” He added that those detained included nationals from the United States, Australia, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Morocco, and Algeria.
Abukeshek said that plainclothes police entered hotels in Cairo on Wednesday with lists of names, questioned activists and in some cases confiscated mobile phones and searched personal belongings.
“After interrogations, some were arrested and others were released,” he added.
 
 

At Cairo airport, some detainees were held for long hours without explanation, Abukeshek said, adding that others were deported, without specifying exact numbers.
Twenty French activists who had planned to join the march were held at Cairo airport “for 18 hours”, he said. “What happened was completely unexpected,” Abukeshek said.
Footage shared with AFP showed dozens of people with their luggage crammed inside a holding room at the airport.
“We’re locked up here in this room with so many people — some 30-40 people,” a German national said in one video. “I called the embassy and they told me their people are trying to figure things out,” she said.
The Greek contingent said in a statement that dozens of Greek nationals were among those held at Cairo airport “despite having all legal travel documents, having broken no law and followed every legal procedure in entering the country”.
Cairo’s security chief did not respond to an AFP request for comment.
Pressure
After 21 months of conflict, Israel is facing mounting international pressure to allow more aid into Gaza, which the United Nations has dubbed “the hungriest place on Earth”.
 
 

Another convoy dubbed Soumoud, or steadfastness in Arabic, left the Tunisian capital on Monday, hoping to pass through divided Libya and Egypt — which organisers say has yet to provide passage permits — to reach Gaza.
The Global March to Gaza, which is coordinating with Soumoud, said around 4,000 participants from more than 40 countries would take part in the event, with many having already arrived ahead of the Friday march.
According to the plan, participants are set to travel by bus to the city of El-Arish in the heavily securitised Sinai Peninsula before walking 50 kilometres (30 miles) towards the border with Gaza.
They would then camp there before returning to Cairo on June 19.
Israel has called on Egyptian authorities “to prevent the arrival of jihadist protesters at the Egypt-Israel border”.
Such actions “would endanger the safety of (Israeli) soldiers and will not be allowed”, Defence Minister Israel Katz said.
In response, Egypt’s foreign ministry said that while it backs efforts to put “pressure on Israel”, any foreign delegations visiting the border area must receive approval through official channels.
“We will continue despite what happened because the current numbers in Egypt and those expected to arrive are enough to organise this march,” Abukeshek said.</p><small>2025-06-12 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12163502b3e71aa.jpg?r=170022' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916738/islamabad-high-court-restrains-fia-from-harassing-ex-senator-farhatullah-babar' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad High Court restrains FIA from ‘harassing’ ex-senator Farhatullah Babar</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court on Thursday restrained the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) from “harassing” former senator and prominent human rights defender Farhatullah Babar.
FIA Anti-Corruption Circle (ACC) opened an inquiry against Babar in March over alleged “corruption, tax evasion and illicit asset accumulation”. Babar appeared before the FIA in Islamabad on March 28 to respond to the notice over a complaint filed by a citizen named Touseef Abbas in Rawalpindi.
The senator, who is the head of PPP’s Human Rights Cell, filed a writ petition through lawyers Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatha with the Ministry of Interior and FIA as respondents, urging the court to quash an anti-corruption inquiry filed against him and restrain the agency from harassing or arresting him.
Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the case today on a petition filed by Babar under Article 199 of the Constitution, one that grants high courts the power to issue writs to enforce fundament rights.
The petitioner’s counsel told the court that Babar was being repeatedly issued “vague, illegal notices and summons.” The lawyer told the court that the FIA’s inquiry was initiated on March 25 on the complaint of a citizen whom the petitioner does not know, accusing him of suspected corruption, tax evasion, and acquiring illegal assets.
The former playmaker appeared before the FIA on March 28, but was not provided with a copy of the complaint, the lawyer said. “On April 11, 2025, he was sent a detailed questionnaire consisting of 12 questions via WhatsApp, and asked to submit the answers by April 7, 2025 (after the deadline),” the lawyer added.
The court adjourned the hearing until the last week of June and “restrained the FIA from harassing Babar.” The court also issued notice to the FIA and other respondents and asked them to submit their replies.
Writ petition
Babar had filed a writ petition in the IHC alleging that the FIA’s conduct was “unlawful, illegal, arbitrary, and mala fide”. The petition called the anti-corruption inquiry against him a baseless “fishing expedition” designed to harass a critic of state institutions.
Babar claimed he received no details of allegations, complaint copies, or legal basis for the probe despite repeated requests. He said the first notice of March 27, 2025, demanded his appearance within 24 hours without specifying charges, and a 12-point questionnaire dated March 28 was sent via WhatsApp on April 11 with the deadline four days earlier.
Babar asserts the FIA’s actions target his human rights advocacy, highlighting his decades-long advocacy, including efforts to regulate intelligence agencies. The petition requested the court to quash the inquiry and all related notices and sought direction from FIA to disclose allegations, documents, and legal basis for the probe.
Babar — a three-term senator, Hilal-i-Imtiaz recipient, and council member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) — last held office in 2013 and served as spokesperson to President Asif Ali Zardari.</p><small>2025-06-12 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/121744423e11a8e.jpg?r=174510' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916729/president-pm-call-for-joint-efforts-from-employers-parents-to-end-child-labour-exploitation' target='_blank'><strong>President, PM call for joint efforts from employers, parents to end child labour, exploitation</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday urged parents and employers to make joint efforts to eliminate child labour, as the country observed World Day Against Child Labour.
Over 12.5 million children in Pakistan are involved in child labour, according to the Child Rights Movement (CRM) National Secretariat. One in four households in Pakistan employed a child for domestic work, often in hazardous conditions, as per the International Labour Organisation (ILO). According to a provincial survey, working children accounted for 11.1 per cent of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s child population.
According to a statement from the President’s House, President Zardari, in his message, called for efforts to protect children from exploitation, expressing hope for a future where children could “learn, play, and grow in a safe and dignified environment”.
Stressing the need for collective action by governments, the president urged employers to “strictly follow child labour laws and ensure that their workplaces are free from exploitation.”
He also called on parents and guardians to prioritise their children’s education over “short-term gains”.
“I urge schools and teachers to identify children at risk of dropping out and keep them in classrooms,” he was quoted as saying in his message.
Detailing Pakistan’s efforts towards ending child labour, he added: “Pakistan has enacted the National Commission on Rights of Child Act (2017), the ICT Child Protection Act (2018), the Juvenile Justice System Act (2018), the Employment of Children’s Act (1991), and the Domestic Workers Act (2002).”
“Pakistan has also established effective mechanisms and service units for the prevention of child exploitation, child labour, and providing care and rehabilitation to the affected children.
“Pakistan, as a signatory to various international conventions aimed at eliminating child labour, is fully committed to ending the exploitation of children.”
He called on the media to raise awareness on the matter of child labour and appealed to philanthropists to “support vulnerable families so that no child is forced into Labour due to poverty.”
He further urged the international community to “pay urgent attention to the children in Gaza”.
“Thousands of innocent children in these areas have been displaced, injured, or orphaned due to violence and aggression by the occupation forces,” he stated.
Noting that children in such vulnerable states were at a heightened risk of being pushed into child labour, he emphasised the need for “immediate global support, protection, and justice.”
“Together, we can dismantle the systems that exploit children and create a Pakistan and a world where every child is free to dream, learn, and build a brighter future.”
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz, while reaffirming the government’s commitment to ending child labour, highlighted the role of “the federal and provincial governments, the private sector, educational institutions, media, and civil society” in preventing child labour, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
“Children subjected to child labour not only face sexual and psychological abuse but they are also deprived of their fundamental right to education. They are robbed of their childhood,” he said.
PM Shehbaz also noted that children from “developing countries are the most affected by the scourge of child labour.”
“Pakistan stands shoulder to shoulder with the global community in its fight against child labour,” he added.
He said that this year’s theme, “Progress is clear, but there’s more to do: let’s speed up efforts!” highlights that while progress has been made, much more remains to be done.
“On this occasion, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNICEF are launching the 2025 Global Estimates and Trends Report on Child Labour, which will help assess the effectiveness of the steps taken so far,” the PM’s statement read.
Reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to ILO conventions on child labour, he noted that Article 11 of the Constitution of Pakistan prohibits all forms of forced labour and child labour.
Appealing to all stakeholders to help the government in its effort to promote education, he pointed out the Danish School system as an initiative by the government to provide access to quality education to underprivileged children.
Pakistan’s last Child Labour Survey, conducted in 1996, determined that agriculture involved the greatest proportion of children engaged in child labour (66pc), followed by manufacturing (11pc), hotels and restaurants (9pc), domestic work, social and personal services (8pc), transport (4pc) and construction (2pc), as per an ILO report.
Every year on June 12, the ILO, along with its constituents and partners around the world, commemorates the World Day Against Child Labour. This year’s theme reflects both the progress achieved and the urgency to intensify action to meet global targets.
The 2025 World Day focuses on a key milestone: the release of the 2025 global estimates and trends of child labour. This ILO and UNICEF joint report will provide a comprehensive overview of where we stand in our global commitments to eliminate child labour.
Although the detailed data are not yet available, the estimates and trends identified will guide policy debates and calls for renewed commitment and investment.</p><small>2025-06-12 12:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/121352074606083.jpg?r=135411' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916710/dacoit-with-extensive-criminal-record-arrested-in-punjabs-lodhran-police' target='_blank'><strong>Dacoit with extensive criminal record arrested in Punjab’s Lodhran: police</strong></a><br><p>Police arrested a suspect with an extensive criminal record in Punjab’s Lodhran district, while two other suspected dacoits escaped during an exchange of fire, police officials said on Thursday.

Trump unveiled the first such visa aboard Air Force One in April, holding a golden prototype that bore his face and promising the special permit would probably be available “in less than two weeks.”
The visas are not available yet, but the website announced on Wednesday allows interested parties to submit their name, desired visa and email address under a header that says “The Trump Card is Coming.”
Trump previously said the new visa, a high-priced version of the traditional green card, would bring in job creators and could be used to reduce the US national deficit.
The announcement comes as deportation raids are being ramped up across the country, prompting protests, and as Trump’s administration faces ongoing lawsuits and accusations of rights violations over its anti-immigration blitz.
Trump has said the new card would be a route to highly prized US citizenship. He said in February that his administration hoped to sell “maybe a million” of the cards and did not rule out that Russian oligarchs may be eligible.</p><small>2025-06-12 08:09</small></div><hr>
