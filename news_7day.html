<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/20092328a832653.jpg?r=092345' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918330/power-lunch' target='_blank'><strong>Power lunch</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN is, for the moment, in President Donald Trump’s good books, as he told the media that he “loves” this country before throwing a working lunch in honour of Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House on Wednesday.
Though the meeting, apparently arranged through ‘unconventional means’, may have rewritten the rules of protocol, as no senior civilian leader was present, the fact is that when it comes to matters of import, American leaders have always preferred dealing with Rawalpindi rather than holders of high office in Islamabad.
 
 

The meal was unprecedented in many ways, as previously, Pakistani generals have met US presidents directly, but only when the former were serving as military rulers of this country. As per ISPR, the meeting was marked by “depth and cordiality”, while counterterrorism and trade dominated the agenda.
Mr Trump said he wanted to thank Field Marshal Munir “for not going to war with India”, while reiterating the claim that it was his intervention that prevented last month’s Pakistan-India clashes from transforming into a full-blown conflict. The meeting indicates that the Trump administration is interested in engaging Pakistan, particularly in areas of close personal interest to the US president, such as cryptocurrencies and trade in rare earth minerals, and that the Pakistan-India dispute is still on the US leader’s radar.
Mr Trump has on several occasions said he is ready to mediate the Kashmir dispute, even though India has said it will “never” accept such mediation. The improvement in Pakistan-US ties is welcome, especially when compared to the lukewarm nature of relations under Joe Biden’s watch. Mr Trump had himself been critical of Pakistan during his first term.
Yet Pakistan must proceed carefully. Improved ties with Washington should be pursued, especially in the economic and geopolitical spheres. But it should also be remembered that the US leader is known for making sharp U-turns, and what is considered American policy today may be disowned and discarded tomorrow.
 
 

The Iran-Israel situation also came under discussion between Mr Trump and the field marshal. The significance of this is considerable, as Pakistan is a neighbour of Iran, while it also shares decades-old military ties with the US. Whatever decision Mr Trump takes vis-à-vis Iran — and it is certainly hoped that he decides not to join Israel’s reckless war on Tehran — the civilian and military leadership here must keep in mind Pakistan’s position on the conflict.
Pakistan’s parliament has passed a unanimous resolution condemning Israeli aggression against Iran, and expressing solidarity with our western neighbour. Political parties and civil society here are also opposed to Tel Aviv’s military action against Iran. Therefore, however things develop on the battlefield, Pakistan must maintain this position, and stand by its neighbouring state.

• FO condemns Israeli aggression against Iran, expresses indignation over attacks on nuclear sites
JUNE 18th was an extraordinary day at the White House; never before had an American president hosted a Pakistani chief of army staff in an exclusive, high-level setting. Despite decades of military cooperation between the two nations, the optics of this meeting were without precedent.
The backdrop of the meeting — a rapidly escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, one that is increasingly threatening to spill into a broader regional war — made the confab even more intriguing as President Donald Trump welcomed Field Marshal Asim Munir for a closed-door luncheon in the Cabinet Room.
Notably absent were any Pakistani civilian officials. No ambassador, no foreign minister — only the army chief and Pakistan’s top intelligence officer, Lt Gen Asim Malik, who also serves as national security adviser.
On the American side, Trump was flanked by Secretary of State Senator Marco Rubio and Special Representative for Middle Eastern Affairs Steve Witkoff.
The select list of attendees underscored the strategic weight assigned to the meeting by both sides.
Despite the intrigue and symbolism, sources told Dawn the meeting was exploratory rather than definitive.
“Although initially scheduled for one hour, the meeting extended for over two hours, underscoring the depth and cordiality of the dialogue,” said the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media wing, in a statement signalling rare openness and engagement between the parties.
A wide range of issues reportedly came up during the discussion, including Pak­is­tan’s recent standoff with India, as well as Islam­abad’s interest in cryptocurrency, offer of rare minerals and prospects of cooperating on artificial intelligence.
But ISPR noted that “a detailed exchange of views also took place on the prevailing tensions between Iran and Israel,” adding that both sides “emphasized the importance of resolution of the conflict.”
 
 

Trump himself echoed the idea that Pakistan had something meaningful to contribute — particularly in understanding Iran.
However, according to sources on both sides, the conversation was less about commitments and more about testing the waters.
Backing for Iran?
The day after the meeting, Foreign Office reiterated its official stance on the Iran-Israel war, offering further clarity.
FO Spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan stated: “We condemn what Israel is doing in Iran. It is in violation of all rules of civilized behaviour, interstate relation, international law, and international humanitarian law.”
He went further: “Our support to Iran is fundamental to our position. It is unequivocal and unambiguous… This is inconceivable for any Pakistani or the government for that matter on the Israeli side.”
Yet, when pressed on whether Pakistan might assist Iran militarily, Mr Khan demurred: “Any role to play at this point is speculative… we have not received any specific req­uest for military support from Iran.”
Pakistan’s response, in essence, is not simply about declining to back Iran militarily — it is a reflection of the country’s longstanding balancing act. Morally aligned with Tehran, diplomatically committed to de-esc­ala­tion, and militarily noncommittal, Is­­la­mabad is navigating tricky waters.
This balancing act is informed by Pakistan’s own experience with conflict, particularly its volatile relationship with India and the ever-present spectre of nuclear confrontation. Just last month, the two neighbours nearly edged into open conflict following an attack in Pahalgam.
The FO spokesperson also condemned Israeli strikes on Iran’s nuclear installations: “It is a clear violation of international law to attack nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards. And we condemn it.”
This line hints at Islamabad’s deepest concern — the setting of a precedent. If one state can bomb another’s nuclear sites with impunity, the norms of global security begin to unravel, which is a harrowing thought for Pakistan, a nuclear-armed state located next door to a similarly armed rival.
In a statement issued Thursday, ISPR declared: “US-Pakistan relations have achieved in the last three days, what India could not achieve in three decades.” This reflects the military’s view of the meeting as a validation of its role as Pakistan’s principal interlocutor on security.
ISPR further asserted that the meeting signalled a shift in US foreign policy, with Pakistan now being accorded “strategic priority.”
But the scene at the Cabinet Room — Trump seated across from Pakistani generals, while Pakistan’s political leadership remained invisible was unsettling in many ways.
“Any foreign government seeking alliance/support from a democracy normally deals with civilian leadership!” former federal minister Dr Shi­­reen Mazari observed. “But Pak­istan sends a different message now!”
 






‘No free lunches’
In New Delhi, too, the meeting set off alarms. Analysts described it as a setback for US-India relations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s quiet rejection of a parallel White House invitation, citing “scheduling conflicts”, only added fuel to speculation of a stressed US-India axis amid a pivotal global realignment.
For Trump, however, the Munir luncheon was strategic. With Israel pushing for US involvement against Iranian nuclear facilities and American forces quietly repositioning in the Gulf, Trump appeared to be seeking a partner with proximity and intelligence depth. In his eyes, Pakistan fit the bill.
“They know Iran very well, better than most,” Trump told reporters, hinting at some convergence of views. “He (Munir) agreed with me,” he added. “They are not happy about anything (relating to happenings in Iran). It is not that they are bad with Israel.”
What that agreement entailed – Iran’s nuclear aspirations, the Israeli strikes, or broader regional chaos- remains unclear. Perhaps deliberate ambiguity was the objective.
For Pakistan, that very ambiguity may serve as a shield. By signaling moral solidarity with Iran while withholding military commitments, Islamabad hopes to maintain room to manoeuvre, avoiding American frustration and Iranian suspicion alike. Its decision to abstain from the recent IAEA vote censuring Iran reflects that tightrope walk.
But one truth lingers. “There are no free lunches. Especially not the ones hosted in the White House,” said Dr Adil Sultan, dean at Islamabad’s Air University. “We should brace to become a frontline state once again.”

These developments mark a major push to accelerate privatisation in key sectors, with the commission aiming to enhance private sector participation, improve efficiency, and reduce the government’s financial burden.
At its meeting on Wednesday, the Board of the Privatisation Commission approved the process to appoint financial advisers for four power distribution companies — Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco), Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco), Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco), and Hazara Electric Supply Company (Hazeco) — all of which are slated for privatisation in the second phase. Financial advisers will also be appointed for two power generation plants: the 747MW Guddu Power Plant and the 525MW Nandipur Power Plant.
 
 

The board meeting, chaired by Ad­­v­i­ser to the Prime Minister on Privati­sation Muhammad Ali, also reviewed ongoing transactions. Financial advisers for three other distribution companies — Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco), and Islam­abad Electric Supply Company (Iesco) — have already been appointed and these companies are part of the first phase of privatisation.

PIA attracts five potential buyers

The board further examined the status of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, another strategic asset under consideration.
Expressions of interest
Regarding PIACL, the deadline for submitting EoIs and statements of qualification (SOQs) expired on Thursday for acquiring management control of the national carrier, with a stake ranging from 51 to 100pc of its share capital. This is the second attempt to privatise the airline, with the submission deadline previously extended from June 3.
Eight interested parties submitted EoIs, and five of them submitted SOQs by the deadline. These include consortia comprising Lucky Cement Ltd, Hub Power Holdings Ltd, Kohat Cement Company Ltd, and Metro Ventures (Pvt) Ltd; Arif Habib Corporation Ltd and Fatima Fertiliser Company Ltd; City Schools (Pvt) Ltd and Lake City Holdings (Pvt) Ltd; Air Blue Ltd; and a consortium of Augment Securities & Investments (Pvt) Ltd and Serene Air (Pvt) Ltd, joined by Bahria Foundation, Mega C&S Holding, and Equitas Capital LLC. Other parties expressing interest include the AKD Group, Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd, Habib Rafique Engineering (Pvt) Ltd, and Sardar Muhammad Ashraf D. Baloch (Pvt) Ltd.
The submitted SOQs will now be evaluated by the commission according to its prequalification criteria. Prequalified parties will proceed to the next phase, where they will be granted access to the virtual data room for buy-side due diligence.
In addition to these developments, the board also approved the audited financial statements of the Privatisation Commission for 2022-23 and 2023-24, as well as budget estimates for 2025-26 to support the commission’s operations and ongoing transactions.

She was speaking at a ceremony to mark a major milestone — Pakistan surpassing 200 million telecom subscribers, including 150m broadband users and over 2m fibre-to-home subscribers.
Organised by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), the event highlighted the country’s accelerating digital growth. Senior executives from Jazz, Telenor, Ufone, Zong, and SCO were in attendance. To celebrate the achievement, all mobile users will receive 2GB of free data and 200 on-net minutes, valid for 24 hours on Friday (June 20). Subscribers can activate the offer by dialing *2200#.
To promote digital inclusion — particularly among female students — the PTA, in collaboration with PTCL, Transworld, Nayatel, Cybernet, and Wateen, is deploying free Wi-Fi hotspots for six months at selected HEC-recognised universities, including women-only institutions, to enhance access to online learning resources.

Free data and on-net minutes on offer only for today

As part of the celebrations, mobile phone manufacturers have donated 200 locally assembled smartphones, which will be distributed among female SIM owners through computerised balloting across Pakistan, including AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan.
 
 

While the total number of SIMs issued has reached 200 million, the teledensity has remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from 81.4 per cent in June 2023 to 81.21pc in June.
In contrast, broadband penetration has shown significant growth, increasing from 53.6pc in June 2023 to 60.8pc by June 2025.
PTA officials also reported progress in closing the mobile internet gender gap, with women now accounting for 38pc of mobile internet users, up from 25pc last year. Moreover, over 36 mobile device manufacturing companies are operating in the country, and approximately 136 million handsets have been locally manufactured or assembled since 2019, including 37pc smartphones.

One of the key targets under the policy is to ensure that electric vehicles account for 30 per cent of all new vehicles sold in the country by 2030.
This transition is projected to save 2.07 billion litres of fuel annually, resulting in nearly $1bn in foreign exchange savings. Additionally, the policy aims to reduce carbon emissions by 4.5 million tonnes and cut healthcare-related costs by $405m each year.
Addressing a news conference, Special Assistant to the Prime Mi­­nister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan said the new EV policy is in line with the premier’s vision of promoting clean, sustainable and affordable transport while boosting local industry and protecting the environment.
He emphasised that the transport sector is a major source of carbon emissions in Pakistan and urgently needs reform.
Mr Akhtar announced that an initial subsidy of Rs9bn has been allocated for the fiscal year 2025-26, under which 116,053 electric bikes and 3,171 electric rickshaws will be facilitated. Besides, 25pc of this subsidy is reserved for women to provide them with safe, affordable and eco-friendly mobility.
He said a fully digital platform has also been introduced to ensure transparent online application, verification and disbursement of subsidies.
 
 

Furthermore, the policy outlines the installation of 40 new EV charging stations on motorways, with an average distance of 105 kilometres between them.
The policy also includes the introduction of battery swapping systems, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) schemes and mandatory integration of EV charging points in new building codes to facilitate wider adoption in urban areas.
Currently, over 90pc of parts for two- and three-wheelers are already manufactured locally and to encourage local manufacturing, incentives are being provided to domestic producers.
The government will also introduce special support packages for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to further boost localisation.
He also highlighted that locally produced goods were 30-40pc cheaper than imported alternatives. In the two-wheeler segment alone, more than 90pc of parts are now produced locally.
The Auto Industry Development and Export Policy will remain in place until 2026 and will be phased out gradually by 2030, he added.
The PM’s special assistant noted that the policy was developed through consultations with over 60 experts, institutions and industry stakeholders, guided by a steering committee under the Ministry of Industries and Production since September 2024.
 
 

The committee will hold monthly and quarterly review meetings, while the auditor general of Pakistan will conduct a performance audit every six months.
He stressed that the NEV Policy 2025-30 is not only an environmental revolution but also a foundation for industrial growth, local employment, energy efficiency and technological self-reliance in the country.
The policy is expected to yield savings of around Rs800bn over the next 24-25 years through reduced fuel imports, the use of cheap electricity and revenue from carbon credits. Charging vehicles with electricity will also reduce capacity payments from Rs174bn to Rs105bn, and carbon credits could generate around Rs15bn in revenue.
The country’s total energy demand for EVs over the next five years is projected at 126 terawatt-hours, which can be met using the existing surplus in the national grid.
He added that an electric rickshaw or bike user is expected to recover their initial investment within a year and 10 months due to the low cost of charging compared to petrol.
For instance, if the additional cost of an electric bike is Rs150,000, this can be recouped within less than two years through fuel savings.
Mr Khan concluded by saying that the government has also provided exemptions on customs duties and sales tax on EV parts to support the local industry.

The bench’s term was due to expire this month.
Under the 26th Amendment, a seven-judge constitutional bench was constituted on Nov 5, 2024, for an initial period of 60 days. The bench comprised Justices Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Moha­mmad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. In December, its tenure was extended by six months.
In February, the bench was expanded to 13 members with the inclusion of Justices Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Shakeel Ahmad, Aamer Farooq and Ishtiaq Ibrahim.
The JCP held two meetings on Thursday. The agenda for the first session included considering the extension of the CB’s term and deciding on a policy for drafting rules to set up effective standards for the annual performance evaluation of high court judges under Article 175A(20) of the Constitution.
In the second session, the JCP reviewed the term and composition of the CB of the Sindh High Court.
During its first meeting on Thursday, the JCP approved, by majority vote, an extension of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench until the end of November this year.
The commission, by majority, extended the term for a further six months from July 23, nominating Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhry and Justice Jaffar Raza, while replacing Justice Agha Faisal and Justice Sana Akram Minhas.
Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi also formed a broad-based committee to evaluate the judicial performance of judges across all high courts. The committee, which includes representatives from the judiciary, parliament, the executive and the legal fraternity, will prepare draft rules for the annual performance evaluation of high court judges.
Subsequently, the JCP issued a fresh agenda to hold another session next month to consider the appointment of chief justices for the high courts of Islamabad, Sindh, Peshawar and Balochistan.

• Approve new taxes on high-value pensions, athletes
• Govt asked to reveal terms of IMF’s resilience facility
ISLAMABAD: The parliamentary committees on Thursday rejected the government’s proposal to impose a carbon levy on petroleum products, terming it an undue burden on the public, whereas the finance minister stressed that “the era of tax exemptions and amnesty schemes is over”.
However, they approved new taxes on high-value pensions and the income of international athletes.
The carbon levy became a focal point as the Senate and National Assembly Standing Committees on Finance and Revenue held simultaneous sessions at Parliament House for a clause-by-clause review of the Finance Bill 2025-26.
Chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla and MNA Naveed Qamar, respectively, both panels proposed several amendments and struck down a number of measures. The Senate concluded its deliberations on the proposed tax provisions on Thursday.
The debate revolved around whether the measure should be classified as a levy or a tax, its revenue potential and provincial share, and whether its purpose is genuinely another tool for the federal government to raise additional funds.
Senator Sherry Rehman firmly distinguished bet­w­een fiscal instruments, stating there is a significant diff­erence between a carbon levy and a carbon tax. Carbon levies are not stan­dard practice, she said, add­ing that it is carbon taxes that are typically imposed.
She argued that such a measure cannot be introduced through the Finance Bill, calling instead for dedicated legislation.
Senator Shibli Faraz criticised the move as contradictory. “On the one hand, the government highlights climate change; on the other, it introduces a levy. This is not a carbon levy — it is more like extortion,” he said.
Senator Mohsin Aziz cited the Supreme Court ruling in the Zafar Iqbal Jhagra case, stating that “under that decision, a carbon levy cannot be imposed. Doing so may constitute contempt of court.” He also raised concerns over unchecked fuel smuggling from Iran.
Sherry Rehman stressed that carbon taxes are usually applied to specific industries with targeted environmental goals, not levied directly on the general population. “You are burdening ordinary men and women while labelling it climate finance,” she said.
“Our party’s position is clear. Such a levy cannot be implemented through the Finance Bill,” Ms Rehman clarified. Senator Faisal Vawda also opposed the carbon levy, terming it an undue burden on the general public.
MNA Syed Naveed Qamar also sought clarity on the projected revenue from the proposed carbon levy. In response, finance ministry officials said the measure is expected to generate Rs45 billion in fiscal year 2025-26.
Mr Qamar further questioned how much of that amount would accrue to the federal government if the levy is redefined as a tax. State Minister for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani clarified, “If it is converted into a carbon tax, the federal government would receive Rs18bn”.
To this, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb asked, “Where did this carbon tax proposal come from?” Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial resp­onded, “The matter surfaced earlier in the Senate Standing Commi­ttee on Finance.”
MNA Dr Mirza Ikhtiar Baig offered a key clarification: “If it remains a levy, the entire amount will go to the federal government. But if it becomes a tax, then the provinces will also be entitled to a share.”
Senator Mandviwalla asked for details on the specific use of those funds, while Senator Sherry Rehman demanded that “the government disclose the full terms of the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) agreement”.
Surcharge cap removal
Meanwhile, the Senate parliamentary committee rejected the surcharge cap removal on the plea that it would escalate costs for energy consumers. The committee also rejected the proposed tiered levies on small vehicles.
However, the committee approved proposals to tax annual pensions exceeding Rs10 million, withdraw income tax exemptions for international athletes and extend tax holidays for economic and special technology zones.
The National Assembly’s committee also deliberated on the government’s proposal to impose a 10 per cent sales tax on solar products. Mr Qamar said that the government has agreed to lower the sales tax rate from the proposed 18pc to 10pc on solar panels.
The FBR chairman said that parliament must take the final decision; once it does, the tax authority will implement the required amendment.
MNA Mubeen Arif remarked that if the Senate has recommended a 10pc rate, the National Assem­bly committee should push for a further reduction. Mr Qamar clarified that the recommendation did not come from the Senate but originated within the NA committee itself.
Provisions relating to fraud were deferred for further deliberation, and the Finance Bill was held over for reconsideration at the next meeting.
The committee recommended reviewing the Ex­­port Finance Scheme for raw cotton and suggested aligning taxes on local cotton production with those on imported cotton.
New energy vehicle adoption
Members also discussed the New Energy Vehicle Adoption Levy Act, 2025, and noted the lack of a comprehensive plan for transitioning to electric vehicles, citing the scarcity of charging stations.
It was further noted that hybrid vehicles have not been included in the proposed measures. Given these concerns, the committee decided to defer consideration of the matter until the next meeting, with directions to the ministry to present a comprehensive and actionable plan for the implementation of the objectives outlined in the proposed Finance Bill.
The committee also considered the proposed amendments to the Stamp Act. During detailed deliberations, it was observed that the term non-filer is being used in the proposed amendment, even though this category has been removed from the applicable laws. In light of this inconsistency, the committee decided to defer consideration of the amendment until the next meeting.
Tax amnesty scheme
Finance Minister Aurangzeb said that there will be no more tax exemptions or tax amnesty schemes. He said the era of tax exemptions and amnesty schemes is over. “We are now focused on expanding the tax net, and that process is actively underway,” he added.
The committee’s debate underscored deep concerns over tax compliance, as the FBR proposed stringent enforcement measures — barring unregistered individuals from operating bank accounts and disconnecting utilities for non-compliant Tier-1 retailers — while acknowledging systemic gaps, with only 35,000 of 300,000 industrial units registered for sales tax.
Lawmakers weighed punitive amendments to Section 14AC against the practical risk of overreach. While MNA Javed Hanif endorsed the tougher stance, others like Shar­mila Faruqi urged a shift towards incentives rather than penalties.
Opposition leader Omar Ayub questioned how many connections had actually been cut for non-filers, warning that excessive powers for tax officers could be counterproductive.
The FBR chief acknowledged evasion tactics and stressed the need for enhanced powers, while assuring that deterrents such as bank account fre­ezes would be temporary.

Officials said that Pakistanis were returning from different cities of Iran, starting from the first batch that reached Taftan via passenger coaches on Monday night.
Over the past three days, around 1,400 Pakistani pilgrim and some 400 students have crossed back, of whom 481 people who crossed via Taftan, reached Quetta on Thursday night.
 
 

“We are providing all facilities to the Pakistanis coming back to the country on their arrival at Taftan and shifting them in Pakistan House,” Assistant Commissioner Taftan Naeem Qasim Shahwani said.
The official said that on Wednesday, a convoy of five coaches carrying around 200 people arrived in Quetta from Taftan. Among them were 80 pilgrims and 120 students who had earlier reached Taftan by bus from Iran.
In Gwadar, the return of Pakistani citizens also continued through the Gabad-Rimdan crossing.
According to the Foreign Office, nearly 3,000 Pakistani nationals have already been evacuated from Iran via multiple routes.

GAZA: A massive cloud of smoke rises after an Israeli strike in the Jabalia area in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.—AFP

• 21 of them killed trying to reach aid distribution points
• Military resorts to gunfire, tank shelling and bombs
GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 72 people on Thursday, including 21 who had gathered near aid distribution sites as famine looms after more than 20 months of war.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that six people were killed while waiting for aid in the southern Gaza Strip and 15 others in a central area known as the Netzarim corridor, where thousands of Palestinians have gathered daily in the hope of receiving food rations.
The Israeli army told AFP that its troops in Netzarim corridor — a strip of land militarised by Israel that bisects the Palestinian territory — had fired “warning shots” at “suspects” approaching them, but that it was “not aware of any injured individuals”.
The army did not comment on the incident reported in the south.
In northern Gaza, Bassal said that nine separate Israeli strikes killed another 51 people, updating earlier tolls provided by his agency.
Bassam Abu Shaar, who witnessed the shooting incident in the Netzarim area, said thousands of people had gathered there overnight in the hope of receiving aid at the US- and Israeli-backed distribution site when it opened in the morning.
“Around 1:00am (2200 GMT Wednesday), they started shooting at us,” he told AFP by phone, reporting gunfire, tank shelling and bombs dropped by drones.
Abu Shaar said that the size of the crowd had made it impossible for people to escape, with casualties left lying on the ground within walking distance of the distribution point, which is run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.
“We couldn’t help them or even escape ourselves,” he said.
 
 

At least 300 Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks while trying to reach aid distribution points in Gaza, which is suffering from famine-like conditions, the territory’s health ministry has said.
Israeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by rescuers and authorities in the Palestinian territory.
In early March, Israel imposed an aid blockade on Gaza amid a deadlock in truce negotiations, only partially easing restrictions in late May.
After Israel loosened its blockade, the privately run Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began distributing aid, but its operations have been marred by chaotic scenes.
UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation — which has the support of Israel and its ally the United States — over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
On Wednesday, the head of a UN inquiry said that the use of GHF to distribute food in the Palestinian territory is “outrageous”. “In every war, the siege and starvation surely leads to death,” Navi Pillay, who chairs the UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Israel and the Palestinian territories, told journalists.
“But this initiative of what’s called a foundation, a private foundation, to supply food, is what I see as outrageous, because it involves the United States itself, the government, and it turns out, as we watch daily, that people who go to those centres are being killed as they seek food.”
Pillay said the commission would “have to look into… the policy purpose and how it’s being effected.
“We have to spell out what is the motive of, right now, the killing of people who are coming for humanitarian aid from this so-called foundation — and that lives are being lost just in trying to secure food for their children.”
The UN humanitarian office OCHA said that its humanitarian partners, including the World Food Programme (WFP), pointed out fuel in Gaza was reaching “critically low levels”.
“Without immediate resupply, essential services — including the provision of clean water — will grind to a halt very soon,” it added.

Exercising the right of reply during the ‘Interactive Dialogue on the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’ Annual Report’ in Geneva on Wednesday, Pakistan’s representative, Muneeb Ahmed, rejected India’s allegations, stressing that New Delhi had blamed Pakistan without evidence. He said India had dismissed calls for an independent and impartial investigation and ignored international appeals for restraint.
The dialogue formed part of the ongoing session of the UN Human Rights Council.
“Even before its own investigation authorities put out a public call for evidence, India intensified its oppression against the people of Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Even worse, India carried out deliberate and unjustifiable military strikes on civilians, residences, and places of worship in Pakistan,” Mr Ahmed said.
 
 


New Delhi following ‘beaten path’ of invoking terrorism for geopolitical motives, says envoy

He noted that India’s reservations to common Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) regarding the right to self-determination served as a pretext for denying this fundamental right.
It underlies the Indian occupation of Jammu and Kashmir as well as numerous other territories and is reflected in the large number of movements against New Delhi’s yoke, he said, adding, “But India is following a beaten path of invoking terrorism for geopolitical motives.”
Resolving the Jammu and Kashmir remains key to lasting peace and prosperity in South Asia and is the best safeguard against future human rights abuses, he said.
“The territory of Jammu and Kashmir is not, has never been and will never be a so-called integral part of India. It remains an internationally recognised disputed territory until the people of Jammu and Kashmir exercise their inalienable right to self-determination in accordance with numerous UN Security Council resolutions,” Mr Ahmed said.
Pakistan is ready to discuss Indian support for the menace of terrorism along Pakistan’s western borders, and unlike India, “we have the evidence to engage in a substantive conversation”, he added.
“Rather than blaming Pakistan or Muslims, we urge India to revisit its Hindutva supremacist pursuit of hegemony, uphold the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination, and, importantly, behave like a normal country at peace with itself and its neighbours,” he said.

In a written statement on fiscal risks placed before parliament, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal divided these risks into seven categories — macroeconomic, revenue, debt, SOEs, climate change, natural disasters, and other contingent liabilities — and quantified their possible impact on fiscal deficit.
They suggested mitigation measures in case one or more of these risks materialise during 2025-26.
According to the statement, the macroeconomic risks arise from slower-than-expected GDP growth, inflation shocks, and exchange rate volatility. “A one percentage point slowdown in GDP growth could reduce government revenues due to lower tax collection and increase exp­enditures on automatic stabilisers such as social safety net programmes,” it said.

Inflation, debt servicing, inefficient SOEs and climate disasters seen as major hurdles

The combined effect of slower than targeted economic growth, inflation sho­cks and exchange rate variation could widen the fiscal deficit by roughly 0.13pc of GDP in FY26. This is important given that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has been given a collection target of Rs14.13 trillion for next year and in view of a record Rs1.161tr shortfall during the current fiscal year on a budget target of Rs12.97tr.
“Inflation spikes and currency depreciation may further strain public finan­ces, though these effects are more challenging to quantify precisely,” it said.
Revenue collection faces hurdles
Talking about revenue risks, the statement said the revenue collection remained vulnerable to lower tax buoyancy, slower economic growth, and underperformance in key sources. 
“Should tax revenues grow at only half the anticipated rate, the fiscal deficit could increase by 0.4pc of GDP.” 
Additional revenue risks include a potential 30pc decline in State Bank profits transferred to the government, which alone could widen the deficit by 0.32pc of GDP, and a 20pc shortfall in petroleum levy collections, increasing the deficit by about 0.2pc.
The government has set a Rs2.4tr target from SBP profits for the next fiscal, slightly lower than Rs2.62tr for this year on the back of historically high interest rates.  Petroleum levy is projected at Rs1.47tr for the next fiscal, up from Rs1.28tr budget target for current year, missed by Rs121bn to Rs1.16tr. 
“These factors indicate the government’s reliance on volatile revenue streams and the importance of improving tax administration and compliance,” the statement said.
It also pointed out that debt servicing costs represented a significant fiscal vulnerability. A two-percentage point increase in domestic interest rates and a one percentage point rise in external interest rates could lead to higher interest payments, raising the fiscal deficit by an estimated 0.42pc of GDP. 
Loss-making SOEs
According to the statement, SOEs posed fiscal risks through potential shortfalls in dividend payments and increased government support. A decline in SOE dividends by 6.1pc relative to projections could add around 0.02pc of GDP to the deficit. 
Increased government financial support to SOEs, amounting to 1.5pc of GDP, could exacerbate the fiscal gap by a margin of 0.4pc.
In contrast, the more severe scenario anticipates lower short-term fiscal impact, but greater long-term costs due to increased frequency and severity of climate-related disasters. 
These projections highlight the growing fiscal burden of climate adaptation and mitigation policies.
Likewise, natural disasters represent the largest fiscal risk identified in the statement. “Without dedicated disaster risk financing mechanisms, an average disaster event could increase the fiscal deficit by as much as 1.03pc of GDP,” it said. 
However, with effective disaster risk financing tools such as catastrophe bonds or insurance funds, this impact could be reduced to about 0.44pc per cent of GDP.

“We’ll never allow America and its allies to be threatened with terrorism or nuclear attack,” Trump told the crowd, sending a message to the leadership in Tehran.
“The time is right now for them to choose. Right now. We don’t have a lot of time to wait. Things are happening at a very fast pace.”
That May 13 ultimatum received little attention at the time.
But behind the scenes, the president already knew an attack on Iran could be imminent — and that there might be little he could do to stop it, according to two US officials.
By mid-May, the Pentagon had begun drawing up detailed contingency plans to aid Israel if it followed through on its long-held ambition to strike Iran’s nuclear programme, the officials said. And the US had already diverted thousands of defensive weapons away from war-torn Ukraine toward the Middle East in preparation for potential conflict, according to a Western source familiar with the matter and a Ukrainian source.
The Pentagon declined to comment for this story.
This account of the weeks and days leading up to Trump’s decision to throw his support behind Israel’s bombing campaign is based on interviews with over a dozen administration officials, foreign diplomats and Trump confidantes, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
The picture that emerges is that of a long, secretive preparation process and a president who, for weeks, found himself torn between diplomacy and supporting military action — and was ultimately persuaded in part by an ally whose actions he did not fully control.
While Trump has long described himself as a peacemaker — dispatching Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to the region several times to try to seal a diplomatic accord — he had several trusted political allies pushing him to back an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
And US intelligence had indicated a unilateral Israeli strike was possible, even likely, even if Trump wanted to wait, according to two US officials.
While it is unclear if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Trump’s more hawkish allies ever got him to a “yes” to Israel’s plans, by the days leading up to the strike, he was at least not a “no”, according to two senior US officials and a senior Israeli source.
That stance, people familiar with the dynamics said, helped tip Israel into action.
Seven days into the Israel-Iran conflict, Trump is left with a dilemma, said Aaron David Miller, a veteran diplomat who has advised six secretaries of state on Middle East policy.
He can try again to pursue a diplomatic resolution with Iran, allow Iran and Israel “to fight it out” or he can enter the war with US airstrikes on the deeply buried Fordow enrichment plant, a step that would have unknown consequences for the region.
Trump “let it (the Israeli attack) happen”, said Miller. “He got on the tiger and he’s riding it.”
The White House, the Israeli prime minister’s office and Iran’s delegation to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. Tehran has consistently said its nuclear programme is designed for peaceful purposes only, a conclusion Washington has rejected.
The coming storm
One of the first hints that Trump might sign off on an Israeli bombing campaign came in April.
During a closed-door meeting on April 17, Saudi Arabia’s defence minister delivered a blunt message to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian: Take Trump’s offer to negotiate an agreement seriously because it presents a way to avoid the risk of war with Israel.
Reuters could not determine whether the message was sent at Washington’s behest, nor whether Iran’s leaders took that message seriously.
With hindsight, they should have.
The Israel Defence Forces and the head of US Central Command, General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, were discussing detailed intelligence about Iran’s missile buildup and nuclear programme and steps that could be required to defend US troops and Israel itself in any conflict with Iran, according to a US official and senior Israeli official.
Meanwhile, the US was funnelling weapons to Israel that would be useful for an air war with Iran. In one instance in early May, a large shipment of defensive missiles originally meant for Ukraine was diverted to Israel instead, according to the Western source and the Ukrainian source.
The diverted shipment caused consternation in Kyiv and sparked continued fears that additional weapons needed to defend against Moscow will instead be used to defend US interests elsewhere, the Ukrainian source said.
 
 

In the opening months of Trump’s term, Israel had already proposed to Washington a series of options to attack Iran’s facilities, according to sources.
While Trump had rebuffed those ideas, saying he preferred diplomacy for the time being, several people close to him said he was never dead-set against using military force against Iran.
He had done so before. In 2020, despite a foreign policy during his first term that was otherwise marked by restraint, Trump ordered a drone strike that killed major general Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ division responsible for its international operations.
The Iranian government has since sought to murder Trump in revenge, US prosecutors have said, an allegation Tehran denies.
Behind the scenes, Trump had been pulled in multiple directions on the Iran issue since before he even took office.
On one side, many supporters, including conservative media personality Tucker Carlson, and administration officials saw Trump’s Make America Great Again movement as an antidote to decades of foreign wars that cost thousands of American lives without significantly advancing American interests.
On the other hand, several close Trump allies — from conservative commentator Mark Levin to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham — were portraying a nuclear Iran as an existential threat that must be removed at any cost.
Trump himself took pride in being a broker of peace.
“My proudest legacy,” he said during his inauguration address, “will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.”
‘It’s a tango’
Ultimately, no US official, Trump confidante or diplomat Reuters talked to identified an epiphany that tipped the scales for the president.
One senior administration official said that after months of sitting on the fence, a lack of diplomatic progress, a push from the Israelis and appeals by hawkish allies likely wore him down.
Trump aides and allies have noted that Israel’s attack unfolded just after the expiry of a 60-day deadline the Trump administration had set for a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran.
The senior US official said another dynamic was at play: as US intelligence consistently showed Israel might go ahead with an attack with or without US support, the administration could look caught off guard if they did not get behind it. Worse, it could appear that the US was opposing a longtime ally.
Although Trump had appeared to some to snub Netanyahu as he pushed for a peaceful solution to the crisis, privately, Israel understood that Washington would stand by it, said a separate official.
 
 

By the time Trump talked to Netanyahu on Monday, June 9 — one of many phone calls in recent days — his stance was one of tacit, if not explicit approval, according to one US and one Israeli official.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had said he would like more time to see diplomacy play out. But the US official said that he did not explicitly veto Israel’s plans.
By Wednesday, June 11, it was clear to Washington that Israel’s plans were a go.
That day, Reuters reported that the US was preparing a partial evacuation of its Iraqi embassy amid fears of reprisals from Iran following an imminent attack.
The next day, June 12, Washington sent a formal diplomatic note to several regional allies, warning them that an attack was imminent.
That evening, Israel launched its overnight barrage, an attack that almost immediately escalated into an air war.
Trump and some key cabinet members watched the events live from the wood-panelled “JFK room” part of the White House Situation Room. Other officials watched the events nearby.
On the menu, per one official: stone crabs from a local restaurant.
The initial attack appeared to be a success, with several close advisers to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei killed and key nuclear sites seriously damaged. Over the weekend, the Israelis considered killing Khamenei himself, but were waved off by Trump, according to two US officials.
Almost immediately, a political civil war erupted in Trump’s Republican Party, with several high-profile conservatives, including members of Congress, accusing his administration of fanning the flames of war.
 
 

Seven days on, the US intelligence community believes the strikes have set Iran’s nuclear ambitions back by only months, according to a source familiar with US intelligence reports, confirming a CNN report.
A significant blow to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, most analysts say, will require dropping bunker-busting bombs on the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, the crown jewel of Iran’s nuclear programme. Only the US has that capability.
Trump has said he is considering such a strike, which would represent a major escalation for the US.
As of Thursday, his intentions were still unclear.</p><small>2025-06-19 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1922251825b8ec3.jpg?r=223635' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918215/trump-extends-deadline-for-tiktok-sale-by-90-days' target='_blank'><strong>Trump extends deadline for TikTok sale by 90 days</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump announced Thursday he had given social media platform TikTok another 90 days to find a non-Chinese buyer or be banned in the United States.
“I’ve just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, putting off the ban for the third time.
A federal law requiring TikTok’s sale or ban on national security grounds was due to take effect the day before Trump’s January inauguration.
The Republican, whose 2024 election campaign relied heavily on social media, has previously said he is fond of the video-sharing app.
 


“I have a little warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” Trump said in an NBC News interview in early May. “If it needs an extension, I would be willing to give it an extension.”
TikTok on Thursday welcomed Trump’s decision.
“We are grateful for President Trump’s leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users,” said a statement issued by the platform.
Digital Cold War?
Trump said in May that a group of purchasers was ready to pay TikTok owner ByteDance “a lot of money” for the video-clip-sharing sensation’s US operations.
Trump has repeatedly downplayed the risks that TikTok is in danger, saying he remains confident of finding a buyer for the app’s US business.
The White House had announced on Monday that Trump would throw the wildly popular video-sharing app, which has almost two billion global users, another lifeline.
During this new grace period, the administration will work “to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,” the administration said in a statement.
 
 

The president is “just not motivated to do anything about TikTok,” said independent analyst Rob Enderle. “Unless they get on his bad side, TikTok is probably going to be in pretty good shape.”
Trump had long supported a ban or divestment, but reversed his position and vowed to defend the platform after coming to believe it helped him win young voters’ support in the November election.
Motivated by national security fears and a belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump’s inauguration, with ByteDance having made no attempt to find a suitor.
TikTok “has become a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry; a flashpoint in the new Cold War for digital control,” said Shweta Singh, an assistant professor of information systems at Warwick Business School in Britain.
The president announced an initial 75-day delay of the ban upon taking office. A second extension pushed the deadline to June 19. Now the deadline is September 17.
Tariff turmoil
Trump said in April that China would have agreed to a deal on the sale of TikTok if it were not for a dispute over his tariffs on Beijing.
ByteDance has confirmed talks with the US government, saying key matters needed to be resolved and that any deal would be “subject to approval under Chinese law.”
Possible solutions reportedly include seeing existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company.
Additional US investors, including Oracle and private equity firm Blackstone, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance’s share in the new TikTok.
Much of TikTok’s US activity is already housed on Oracle servers, and the company’s chairman, Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally.
Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok’s valuable algorithm.
“TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it’s simply not as powerful,” said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering.
Despite the turmoil, TikTok has been continuing with business as usual.
The platform on Monday introduced a new “Symphony” suite of generative artificial intelligence tools for advertisers to turn words or photos into video snippets for the platform.</p><small>2025-06-19 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/192144103f72cc3.jpg?r=222114' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918208/govt-draws-five-potential-buyers-for-pia' target='_blank'><strong>Govt draws five potential buyers for PIA</strong></a><br><p>In its efforts to sell its struggling flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the government has received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm, the Privatisation Ministry said on Thursday.
The bids were submitted ahead of a June 19 deadline to acquire up to 100 per cent of PIA, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. Still, following major restructuring, it posted its first operating profit in 21 years in the 2024-25 fiscal year.
The sale is seen as a test of Pakistan’s ability to shed loss-making state firms and meet conditions of a $7bn International Monetary Fund bailout. It would be the first major privatisation in nearly two decades.
Eight parties submitted their expression of interest, but only five of them provided documents of qualification, the ministry said in a statement.
Among the five groups is a consortium of major industrial firms: Lucky Cement Ltd, Hub Power Holdings Ltd, Kohat Cement Co Ltd and Metro Ventures.
Another is led by investment firm Arif Habib Corp Ltd and includes fertiliser producer Fatima Fertiliser Co Ltd, private education operator The City School, and real estate firm Lake City Holdings.
Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd, a military-owned conglomerate, Pakistani airline Air Blue Ltd and a consortium including Bahria Foundation, domestic carrier Serene Air and US-based Equitas Capital LLC also submitted documents.
“The government will review the documents and give qualified parties access to data for due diligence,” the statement read.
Full divestment
Once a leading global airline, PIA resumed European flights in January after a four-year EU ban linked to safety concerns, and is seeking UK clearances, seen as key to its turnaround. Industry insiders say the winning bidder is expected to partner with a foreign airline to run operations.
A previous attempt to sell the airline failed as a $36 million bid from real estate firm Blue World City fell short of the $305m floor price, with concerns over debt, staffing, and limited control.
This time, the government is offering full divestment, has scrapped the sales tax on leased aircraft, and is providing limited protection from legal and tax claims. Around 80pc of the airline’s debt has been transferred to the state.
“We’re targeting Rs86bn in privatisation proceeds this year,” Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali told Reuters. “For PIA, in the last round of bidding, 15pc of the proceeds were going to the government, with the rest staying within the company.”
He said bidders would be pre-qualified in early July, with due diligence lasting two to two-and-a-half months, with final bidding and negotiations expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.
Officials hope the sale will revive the stalled privatisation drive. Other planned deals include the Roosevelt Hotel and several power firms by mid-2026.
“From the Roosevelt Hotel, we’re expecting over $100m as [the] first payment during this year,” said Ali.</p><small>2025-06-19 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/19122337cc9b292.png?r=124708' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918120/spacex-starship-explodes-during-routine-test-texas-officials' target='_blank'><strong>SpaceX Starship explodes during ‘routine’ test: Texas officials</strong></a><br><p>One of tech billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starships exploded during a routine test in Texas late on Wednesday, law enforcement said according to AFP, adding that no one was injured.
The Starship 36 suffered “catastrophic failure and exploded” at the Starbase launch facility shortly after 11pm (9am PKT Thursday), a Facebook post by the Cameron County authorities said.
Musk’s SpaceX said the rocket was preparing for the tenth flight test when it “experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase”.

“A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for,” SpaceX added on social media.
“There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area while safing operations continue.”
Starbase, on the south Texas coast near the border with Mexico, is the headquarters for Musk’s space project.
Standing 123 metres tall, Starship is the world’s largest and most powerful rocket and central to Musk’s long-term vision of colonising Mars.
The latest setback follows an explosion of a prototype Starship over the Indian Ocean in late May.
 
 

The biggest and most powerful launch vehicle ever built had lifted off on May 27 from the Starbase facility, but the first-stage Super Heavy booster blew up instead of executing its planned splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.

And London police say they have evidence to suggest he could have targeted more than 50 other women.
Serial rapist Zhenhao Zou, 28 — described in court as “calculated and predatory” — targeted young Chinese women who he invited to his London flat for drinks or to study before drugging and attacking them.
Zou filmed nine of the rapes with hidden or handheld cameras but only two of the 10 victims have ever been identified.
Sentencing him at Inner London Crown Court, Judge Rosina Cottage said there was “no doubt that you planned and executed a campaign of rape” that had caused “devastating and long term effects”.
To the world, he appeared “well to do, ambitious and charming”, but this was a mask hiding a “sexual predator”, she added.
He treated his victims “callously” as “sex toys” for his own gratification and “desire to assert power over women”, which meant he would be a “risk for an indefinite period”.
Zou, wearing a dark suit and glasses, listened impassively in the dock to the sentence via a translator. He will spend a minimum of 22 years in jail, after accounting for time already spent in custody.
The former engineering student at University College London was found guilty by a jury in March of 28 offences including 11 counts of rape — with two of the counts relating to one woman — three counts of voyeurism and one of false imprisonment.
He was found guilty of raping three women in London and seven in China between 2019 and 2023.
He was also convicted of three counts of possessing butanediol — an industrial solvent — with intent to commit a sexual offence and 10 counts of possession of an extreme pornographic image.
‘Prolific’ rapist
Victims told the sentencing hearing in impact statements of the psychological damage they suffered, including nightmares, self-harm and a sense of despair and isolation.
One recalled “wandering like a trapped animal trying to find an exit” after she was attacked.
“What happened that night is etched on my soul”, she said, adding that Zou’s family was “very powerful in China” and she feared he would “seek revenge”.
After the sentence, Saira Pike of the Crown Prosecution Service said: “Zou is a serial rapist and a danger to women.” Pike added that analysis of footage and web chats showed the former student’s “meticulous planning and the horrifying execution of his crimes”.
Since he was convicted, and following an international appeal by UK police, over 20 women have come forward to say they might have been sexually assaulted by Zou.
London’s Met police have said they have evidence to suggest he could have targeted more than 50 other women and urged possible victims to come forward.
“Given how prolific Zou seems to have been, there is every potential he could be one of the most prolific offenders that we’ve ever seen,” the Met’s Commander Kevin Southworth said.
Southworth said 24 potential victims had already contacted officers from “different parts of the globe”.
“The primary places where we believe offending may have occurred at this time appears to be… here in London, and over in China.”
But given how “active and prolific” Zou appeared to have been, there was “every prospect that he could have offended anywhere in the world”, he added.
The Met said earlier officers were compiling a file of new evidence to be submitted to prosecutors after Zou’s sentencing.</p><small>2025-06-19 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1918410504fdddf.jpg?r=184220' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918192/pre-monsoon-rains-to-lash-country-from-june-20-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Pre-monsoon rains to lash country from June 20: PMD</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Thursday predicted that pre-monsoon rains will fall across the country between June 20 and 23.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia’s nearly two billion people.
According to a statement, “currents from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are penetrating the central and northern areas of Pakistan, while a westerly wave is expected to approach the north. Both of these weather systems are expected to arrive on June 20 (tomorrow).”
It added that duststorms, thunderstorms and heavy rain are expected in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan, Murree, Galliyat, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Sargodha, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Lahore, Faisalabad, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Bannu, Karak, Dera Ismail Khan, and Waziristan from June 20-23 with occasional gaps.
“Similar weather events could be expected in Zhob, Barkhan, Musakhel, Kalat, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Sahiwal from June 21-23, and in Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, and Jacobabad from June 22-24.
PMD warned that the inclement weather “may damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels” among others and advised farmers to “manage their crop activities keeping in view the weather conditions”.
“Urban flooding may occur in Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi [and] Islamabad during the forecast period,” the press release warned. “[The] general Public, travellers and tourists are advised to take precautionary measures during the weather activity.”
PMD added that hot weather is likely to subside gradually during the forecast period.
Last month, heavy rain triggered flash floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mohmand, South Waziristan and Upper Kohistan districts, damaging roads and agricultural land. However, no casualties were reported from any districts.
Heavy rainfall triggered flash floods in several areas of Halimzai tehsil in Mohmand district, including Shanikhel ,Tarikhel, Barokhel, Durbakhel and Babikhel.
The flood, caused by overflowing mountain streams, swept away dozens of livestock and damaged houses and link roads.
Last month, at least 13 civilians died and 92 others were injured as heavy rains lashed several parts of Punjab.</p><small>2025-06-19 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/191806242d62fd0.jpg?r=180642' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918186/cambridge-confirms-partial-leak-of-3-a-level-papers-for-june-2025-exams' target='_blank'><strong>Cambridge confirms partial leak of 3 A-Level papers for June 2025 exams</strong></a><br><p>Cambridge International Education (CIE) on Thursday confirmed that question papers of three AS and A Level examinations were partially leaked across Pakistan.
CIE, part of Cambridge University Press and Assessment, offers internationally recognised exams to over 10,000 schools in 160-plus countries. In Pakistan, O Levels (grades 9–10) cover a broad subject range, while A and AS Levels (grades 11–12) are more specialised and advanced, providing pathways to higher education in Pakistan and abroad. CIE exams are typically held twice a year, in June and November, with results released in August and January, respectively.
“We have written to our schools in Pakistan to tell them that, against our regulations, some content from three question papers was available before the timetabled exam dates in Pakistan,” the CIE said in a statement.
The examinations that were affected include:

Cambridge International AS/A Level Mathematics Paper 12, where one
question was shared before the exam was taken.
Cambridge International AS/A Level Mathematics Paper 42, where parts of two question were shared before the exam was taken.
Cambridge International AS/A Level Computer Science Paper 22, where parts of one question were shared before the exam was taken.

However, it said, “In all three cases, we found no evidence that the whole paper had been shared before the exam.”
CIE said it will issue a syllabus grade for all subjects on August 12, 2025, as usual, saying that the “grade will be based on the question paper content completed.”
“We have decided to take action for each of these syllabi/components to maintain the integrity and fairness of the assessment for all candidates, and so that we can award an overall syllabus grade on our published results days.
“Therefore, we have disregarded some questions from each paper — we will award you full marks for these questions,” it added.
The examiner said candidates will not be disadvantaged by these actions and will be awarded a “fair and reliable” final grade.
“Our actions make sure that candidates who accessed question paper content before their exam do not have any advantage and will not achieve higher marks by cheating,” it added.
CIE said it is protecting the integrity of the assessment and making sure that it remains a trusted qualification by schools and universities worldwide.
Cambridge said cases of malpractice are taken “extremely seriously”, adding that multiple investigations are ongoing. It vowed to take decisive action against anyone proven to have been involved in malpractice.
It said the centres will likely be deregistered, and this information will be shared with other awarding organisations. “For candidates, it is likely to mean disqualification and barring from entering our exams,” it added.
CIE reassured that before every exam series, it carries out extensive and detailed planning to review exam security arrangements.
“The security of our exams is of the utmost importance. As usual, we will review and plan security arrangements before the next exam series,” it added.</p><small>2025-06-19 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/19175915a9f61be.jpg?r=180011' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918183/amazon-to-invest-233m-in-india-to-expand-operations-infrastructure-improve-tech' target='_blank'><strong>Amazon to invest $233m in India to expand operations infrastructure, improve tech</strong></a><br><p>Amazon will invest more than $233 million in India in 2025 to expand and update its operations infrastructure, develop new technology for its fulfilment network and improve delivery safety, it said on Thursday.
The investment builds on top of Amazon’s prior investments for the creation of an operations network to deliver to all serviceable PIN-codes in the country, it added.
In June 2023, the e-commerce major — which competes with Walmart’s Flipkart and billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail in India — had said it will take its investments in the country to $26 billion by 2030, without providing a breakdown.
The new investment will be used to launch new sites and upgrade existing facilities across its fulfilment and delivery network, improving speed and processing capacity, it said.
Additionally, Amazon plans to use technology to alert delivery associates about unsafe speeds and ensure equitable distribution of delivery routes.
Some of the funds will also be used to expand initiatives to improve the health and financial well-being of its employees, the company said.
In March, India’s information technology ministry said Amazon’s cloud services provider, Amazon Web Services, will invest about $8.2bn in the country.</p><small>2025-06-19 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/191603274139012.jpg?r=160333' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918159/sc-constitutional-bench-dismisses-pleas-against-transfer-of-ihc-judges' target='_blank'><strong>SC Constitutional Bench dismisses pleas against transfer of IHC judges</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on Thursday announced its verdict in a case pertaining to the seniority and transfer of Islamabad High Court (IHC) jud­ges, declaring that their transfers were not unconstitutional.
The bench — headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and comprising Justices Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Salahuddin Panhwar and Shakeel Ahmed — took up petitions filed by five IHC judges, the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) and the IHC Bar Association, among others.
In February, Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar from the Lahore High Court (LHC), Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the Sindh High Court (SHC) and Justice Muham­mad Asif from the Balochistan High Court (BHC) were transferred to the IHC.
The controversy centres around the alteration of the judges’ seniority list after these transfers as Justice Dogar was made the senior puisne judge, which paved the way for his appointment as the acting IHC chief justice after Justice Aamer Farooq’s elevation to the SC.
Today’s judgement was announced in a 3-2 majority ruling, with Justices Afghan and Ahmed dissenting.
In the short order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the SC noted that “the transfer of a judge by the president of Pakistan by means of Article 200 of the Constitution (permanently or temporarily) cannot be construed as a fresh appointment.”
 
 

The order explained that exercise of powers of transfer by the president under Article 200 of the Constitution was not unregulated or unfettered.
Rather, it was structured on a “four tier formula which expounds that no judge shall be transferred except with his consent and after consultation by the president with the chief justice of Pakistan and the chief justices of both high courts”.
The short order emphasised that before exercising the power of transfer, certain inbuilt procedures and mechanisms had to be followed and the decision was “within the sphere and realm of judiciary and not within the domain of executives”.
The short order added: “Thus, for all intents and purposes, the transfer of judges by the president of Pakistan (…) is within the framework of the Constitution and cannot be
declared ultra vires.”
The judges further noted that the terms and conditions of transfer, including seniority, should have been taken up and mentioned by the president at the time of issuing the notification of transfer in terms of Article 200 of the Constitution.
The judges also said that they partially remanded the matter to the president, “without upsetting the notification of transfer to determine the seniority after examining/vetting the service record of the transferee judges as soon as possible, including the question of whether the transfer is on a permanent or temporary basis”.
The order concluded that the seniority and transfer of judges was determined by the president by means of a notification/order and that Justice Dogar would continue in his role as acting chief justice of the IHC till the seniority and nature of posting —
permanent or temporary — of the transferred judges were determined by the president by means of notification/order.
Dissenting order
In the dissenting order, authored by Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, he said that the judges accepted the constitutional petitions.
The order declared the impugned notification regarding the transfer of concerned judges as “null, void and of no legal effect”.
Justice Afghan said, “The permanent transfer of three Judges to IHC has been made
by the president in wrong exercise of discretion under Clause (1) of Article 200 of the Constitution.”
He added: “It has offended Article 175A of the Constitution and has made the same redundant.”
The order also stated that the permanent transfer process of three Judges to the IHC was under the “concealment of relevant and material facts from the transferee Judges”, adding that it was also “lacking meaningful, purposive and consensus-oriented consultation” with the chief Justices of the apex and high courts.
It further said that “the process for permanent transfer of three Judges to IHC has
been completed in an unnecessary haste.”
According to the judges, the proportionate representation of provinces in IHC could have been achieved by “making fresh appointments of judges from the provinces by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan under Article 175A of the Constitution”.
The dissenting note added: “It [notification] is violative of Article 2A, Article 4 and Article 25 of the Constitution and it has undermined the independence of judiciary, due process and principle of equality.”</p><small>2025-06-19 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/19121026cf84864.jpg?r=122552' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918113/india-to-send-crashed-planes-black-box-to-us-local-media-report' target='_blank'><strong>India to send crashed plane’s black box to US: local media report</strong></a><br><p>India will send the black box recovered from the recent fatally crashed Air India plane to the US for analysis, local newspaper Economic Times reported on Thursday, citing people aware of the development.
“The recorder sustained heavy external damage from post-crash fire making it impossible to extract data in India,” the ET report said, citing people aware of the development.
India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.
Indian authorities are investigating the crash of an Air India Boeing Dreamliner, which last week killed 241 people on board and at least 30 on ground, marking the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
The black box consists of two components — the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR). It provides crucial insights for crash investigators, including altitude and airspeed data and pilot conversation records that help determine probable causes of crashes.
Data from the flight data recorder will be extracted at the Washington-based laboratory of the National Transportation Safety Board and shared with AAIB, the ET report added, citing sources.
Meanwhile, the airline said its plane was “well-maintained” before it crashed a week ago.
As investigators attempt to retrieve data from the plane’s black boxes, the airline said that no problems were detected with the jet before the disaster.
“The plane was well-maintained, with its last major check in June 2023,” Air India said in a statement.
“Its right engine was overhauled in March 2025, and the left engine was inspected in April 2025. Both the aircraft and engines were regularly monitored, showing no issues before the flight,” the airline said.
Initial checks since the crash on Air India’s Dreamliners “did not reveal any major safety concerns”, the country’s civil aviation regulator said on Tuesday.
Air India said there were 169 Indian passengers, 53 British, seven Portuguese and a Canadian on board the flight, as well as 12 crew members. The airline said the pilots were accomplished flyers.
“The flight was led by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, a highly experienced pilot and trainer with over 10,000 hours flying widebody aircraft,” it said. “First Officer Clive Kunder, had over 3,400 hours of flying experience.”
While investigators try to piece together what went wrong, families of dozens of victims are still waiting for their loved ones to be identified.
As of Thursday, 210 victims have been identified through DNA testing, state health minister Rushikesh Patel said.</p><small>2025-06-19 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/19162900741018b.jpg?r=163021' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918168/greenpeace-warns-of-potential-disaster-after-oil-spill-off-uae' target='_blank'><strong>Greenpeace warns of ‘potential disaster’ after oil spill off UAE</strong></a><br><p>Greenpeace on Thursday warned that an oil spill resulting from a tanker collision off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) could have grave environmental consequences, after authorities reported a “small” slick.
On Tuesday, the Emirati coastguard said it rescued 24 crew members of the Adalynn oil tanker after it collided with the Front Eagle vessel in the Gulf of Oman, off the coast of the Khor Fakan area of the UAE.
“Greenpeace Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has warned of a potential environmental disaster after two crude oil tankers collided,” the group said in a statement.
The environmental campaign group said satellite imagery indicated a “large plume of oil stretching up to around 1,500 hectares from the site of the crash”.
 






The group said the Adalynn was part of a Russian “shadow fleet”, which it described as “a collection of partially obsolete tankers that operate below basic security standards and carry Russian oil”.
Security analysts say Russia uses the fleet of ageing vessels to circumvent international sanctions that ban it from selling oil.
Greenpeace stated that the Adalynn could be carrying approximately 70,000 tonnes of crude oil, despite being officially listed in ballast condition, and therefore should not have been carrying cargo.
The Front Eagle is owned by the shipping company Frontline.
Farah Al Hattab of Greenpeace urged authorities to “act swiftly to contain the spill and assess its ecological impact”.
“Oil spills endanger marine life, disrupt delicate ecological balances and possibly the entire food web, and carry the potential to spark widespread environmental damage,” she said.
On Wednesday, the Emirati Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure said the accident was “caused by a navigational misjudgment by one of the vessels”.
The accident caused “minor surface damage to the outer hulls of both ships, a small oil spill, and a fire that broke out in the fuel tank of one of the ships”, according to the statement.
The incident took place close to the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a waterway between the Arabian Peninsula and Iran that carries one-fifth of global oil output.</p><small>2025-06-19 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/19160418afe8b85.jpg?r=160435' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918149/karachi-reports-second-congo-fever-related-death-this-year' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi reports second Congo fever-related death this year</strong></a><br><p>Another patient died of Congo fever on Thursday in Karachi, as the number of fatalities from the disease reached two this year in Sindh, a statement from the district health officer in Malir said.
Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), commonly known as Congo Virus, causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent, according to the World Health Organisation. There is no vaccine available for the disease.
Per experts, the CCHF virus is primarily transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. In April, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued an advisory urging the prevention of Congo fever ahead of Eidul Azha.
A 25-year-old man, Zubair, a fisherman from Ibrahim Hyderi, passed away on Thursday morning, a day after the disease was confirmed, said a report by DHO Malir Dr Imdad Ali Chandio.
The victim butchered animals continuously for two days on June 7-8 during Eid. On June 13, he developed high fever with headache and myalgia and went to a hospital in Ibrahim Hyderi but was discharged the same day. After his condition worsened, he went to the Creek General Hospital but was not admitted due to the unavailability of beds.
On June 16, he went to the emergency ward of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where he was diagnosed as a ‘suspected’ case of CCHF and was admitted. The patient’s health deteriorated the next day and he was referred to medical ICU.
Due to the unavailability of bed, he was referred to the Sindh Infectious Disease Hospital & Research Centre (SIDH) where he was placed on ventilator support. The patient passed away on Thursday morning.
The report said the victim visited the cattle market on Eid and butchered animals for two days as an occasional butcher without safety precautions. The lab result confirmed the prevalence of CCHF on June 18.
DHO Malir said a team was sent to the area and a detailed medical history was taken from his brother and other family members. He said the family members were safe with no symptoms of Congo fever, while other people he was in contact with are being identified.
Amid the rising cases of Congo fever, the provincial health authorities have set up a daily alert system against 35 diseases in the district.
The Provincial Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (PD SRU) at Directorate General Health Services Sindh said the system is collecting daily case based data from districts across the province to identify unusual increase in cases and timely interventions. It advised the health officers in Malir district to investigate an alert and submit a report within a day.
Sindh reported its first death of the year from Congo fever a day earlier, saying a 42-year-old man passed away in Karachi, as per a statement from the provincial health ministry’s media coordinator.
The deceased, a resident of District Malir, was admitted to the Indus Hospital in Korangi, where he tested positive for CCHF on June 16, said media coordinator for the Sindh health ministry, Meeran Yousuf. The patient passed away the next day. A team of health experts visited his residence but found the door locked.
3 die from Congo virus in KP
Meanwhile, the disease killed three people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the province’s Health Adviser Ehtesham Ali confirmed in a statement, raising concerns over public health safety during the Eid holidays.
Ali said two of the fatalities occurred last night (Wednesday) at the Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), where the patient succumbed to the virus.
KP health department spokesperson Attaullah Khan said three cases of suspected CCHF were brought to the HMC. Naik Shad of South Waziristan was brought dead to the hospital on Tuesday, while Aizaz, 28, and Shafiullah, 70, both residents of Karak, passed away last night.
Expressing sorrow over the loss of lives, the health adviser attributed the deaths to negligence and lack of precaution during Eid celebrations. “These lives could have been saved with timely care and awareness,” he said, urging the public to remain vigilant and strictly follow preventive measures.
He added that the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response System (IDSRS), operating under the Public Health department, is actively responding to the outbreak and monitoring the situation closely.
The district health officers of affected areas have been notified, and contact tracing and sanitisation activities have commenced at the homes of the deceased victims to prevent further transmission, he added. The health department appealed to cooperate with authorities and prioritise hygiene and safety during the ongoing high-risk period.</p><small>2025-06-19 10:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1914233192df24e.jpg?r=142418' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918140/two-killed-in-kohat-shooting-11-injured-police-say' target='_blank'><strong>Two killed in Kohat shooting, 11 injured, police say</strong></a><br><p>Two people, including a woman, were killed and 11 others injured on Thursday after unidentified men opened fire at a group of people returning from a funeral in Chashma Ganda area of Gumbat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district, according to a police official.

The injured, along with the deceased, have been shifted to a nearby hospital for medical treatment and legal formalities, according to DPO Kohat.
Further investigation is underway to apprehend the assailants.
On Wednesday, two people were killed and one was injured during a shooting incident in Karachi’s Ittehad Town due to personal enmity between the two sides.

Gen Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.
The high-level engagement was scheduled at the Cabinet Room over luncheon, followed by a visit to the Oval Office.
Secretary of State Senator Marco Rubio and Special Representative for Middle Eastern Affairs Steve Witkoff were present during the meeting from the US side, while National Security Advisor Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik — also the intelligence chief — accompanied the COAS.
“Although initially scheduled for one hour, the meeting extended for over two hours, underscoring the depth and cordiality of the dialogue,” the ISPR said in a press release.
During the meeting, Trump “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”, the statement said.
It noted that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continued collaboration in the field of counterterrorism.
 
 

“Discussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains, including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency, and emerging technologies,” the ISPR stated.
“President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,” it highlighted.
The US president also commended Field Marshal Munir’s “leadership and decisiveness during a period of complex regional dynamics”.
The army chief extended an invitation to Trump, on behalf of the government, to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date, the ISPR said, calling it a “gesture reflecting the warmth of bilateral ties”.
On his part, COAS Munir conveyed the deep appreciation of the government and people of Pakistan for Trump’s “constructive and result-oriented role in facilitating a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in the recent regional crisis”.
He “acknowledged President Trump’s statesmanship and his ability to comprehend and address the multifaceted challenges faced by the global community”, the ISPR press release said.
“A detailed exchange of views also took place on the prevailing tensions between Iran and Israel, with both leaders emphasising the importance of resolution of the conflict,” it added, referring to the ongoing missile exchange between the two regional arch foes that marks a week today.
The military noted that the engagement “marks a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to reinforce the longstanding partnership between Pakistan and the United States, built upon shared objectives of peace, stability, and prosperity”.
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the meeting a “milestone in Pak-US ties” and a “success of the current hybrid model of governance”.
“This is the most important turning point in the 78-year history of relations. The way international and regional issues were discussed in this meeting highlighted the importance of the beloved homeland,” Asif said on X.
He added that Pakistan’s abilities to help resolve issues were acknowledged, along with the Pak-India conflict being shed light on again.
“The revival of the economy, the defeat of India, the glorious and highly successful improvement in relations with the US — all these revolutionary changes were possible with the cooperation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir and the excellent relations between Islamabad and Rawalpindi.”
 






Trump ‘honoured’ to meet army chief
When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media, Trump said, “I was honoured to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.
“He (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM [Narendra] Modi as well, who just left a few days ago,” he added.
“We’re working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.”

Asked whether the talks included the current Iran-Israel conflict, Trump said: “They (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they’re not happy about anything. It’s not that they’re bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.”
Questioned by reporters about the meeting prior to it, Trump remarked, “This man (Gen Munir) was extremely influential in stopping it (India-Pakistan fighting) from the Pakistan side.”
White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was hosting Field Marshal Munir after he called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for preventing a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, Reuters reported.
But insiders suggested that the meeting was not arranged through routine diplomatic channels, but rather was the outcome of “unorthodox efforts” by a group of advisers, businessmen, and other influential figures.
Diplomatic sources in Washington said this initiative had been cooking for months and kept under wraps until the White House released Trump’s official schedule on Tuesday.
Sources said that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation, engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, and targeted lobbying via Republican-aligned firms in Washington helped Pakistan secure the meeting.
Previous military rulers — such as Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, and Gen Pervez Musharraf — met US presidents only after they had assumed the role of head of state.
Former president Barack Obama did briefly “walk in” on a White House meeting with then-COAS Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, but that too was not a formal engagement.</p><small>2025-06-19 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/19130800f8d5033.jpg?r=131145' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918124/homeland-insecurity-expelled-afghans-seek-swift-return-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Homeland insecurity: expelled Afghans seek swift return to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan says it has expelled more than a million Afghans in the past two years, yet many have quickly attempted to return — preferring to take their chances dodging the law than struggle for existence in a homeland some had never even seen before.

Since April and a renewed deportation drive, some 200,000 Afghans have spilled over the two main border crossings from Pakistan, entering on trucks loaded with hastily packed belongings.
But they carry little hope of starting over in the impoverished country, where girls are banned from school after the primary level.
Hayatullah, a pseudonym, returned to Pakistan a month after being deported, travelling around 800 kilometres (500 miles) south to the Chaman border crossing in Balochistan, because for him, life in Afghanistan “had come to a standstill”.
 
 

He paid a bribe to cross the Chaman frontier, “like all the day labourers who regularly travel across the border to work on the other side”.
His wife and three children — including daughters, aged 16 and 18, who would be denied education in Afghanistan — had managed to avoid arrest and deportation.
Relative security
Hayatullah moved the family to Peshawar. “Compared to Islamabad, the police here don’t harass us as much,” he said.
Samad Khan, a 38-year-old Afghan who also spoke using a pseudonym, also chose to relocate his family to Peshawar.
Born in Lahore, he set foot in Afghanistan for the first time on April 22 — the day he was deported.
“We have no relatives in Afghanistan, and there’s no sign of life. There’s no work, no income, and the Taliban are extremely strict,” he said.
At first, he tried to find work in a country where 85 per cent of the population lives on less than one dollar a day, but after a few weeks, he instead found a way back to Pakistan.
“I paid Rs50,000 to an Afghan truck driver,” he said, using one of his Pakistani employees’ ID cards to cross the border.
He rushed back to Lahore to bundle his belongings and wife and two children — who had been left behind — into a vehicle, and moved to Peshawar.
“I started a second-hand shoe business with the support of a friend. The police here don’t harass us like they do in Lahore, and the overall environment is much better,” he told AFP.
‘Challenging’ reintegration
It’s hard to say how many Afghans have returned, as data is scarce.
Government sources claim that hundreds of thousands of Afghans are already back and settled in KP — figures that cannot be independently verified.
Migrant rights defenders in Pakistan say they’ve heard of such returns, but insist the numbers are limited.
The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) told AFP that “some Afghans who were returned have subsequently chosen to remigrate to Pakistan”.
“When individuals return to areas with limited access to basic services and livelihood opportunities, reintegration can be challenging,” said Avand Azeez Agha, communications officer for the UN agency in Kabul.
They might move on again, he said, “as people seek sustainable opportunities”.</p><small>2025-06-19 08:31</small></div><hr>
