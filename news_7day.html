<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22071157fedb001.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956677/trump-lavishes-praise-on-new-york-mayor-elect-mamdani-at-warm-white-house-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Trump lavishes praise on New York Mayor-elect Mamdani at warm White House meeting</strong></a><br><p>After months of trading insults, US President Donald Trump and incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani smiled at each other, swapped compliments and pledged to collaborate on tackling crime and affordability in the nation’s biggest city at an unexpectedly friendly meeting at the White House on Friday.
The political opposites, a Republican billionaire and a young democratic socialist, have clashed over everything from immigration to economic policy.
But it was clear the two forged a rapport in their first encounter.
Mamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker, stood by Trump’s desk as the 79-year-old president smiled up at him and patted him warmly on the arm, having only recently falsely caricatured Mamdani as an anti-Semitic communist, among other jibes.
 







“We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,” Trump said after letting journalists and cameras into the Oval Office at the end of a private meeting with the mayor-elect.

“We have one thing in common: We want this city of ours that we love to do very well.”
The meeting in the Oval Office, where Trump has sometimes embarrassed or chastised visiting heads of state, far exceeded Trump’s prediction earlier on Friday that it would be “quite cordial”.
The men, two different generations of New Yorkers, announced nothing new on policy except what seemed to be the launch of an unexpected, politics-shifting professional friendship.
“What I really appreciate about the president is that the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, which there are many, and also focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers,” Mamdani said.
Just 26 per cent of Americans say Trump is doing a good job at managing the cost of living, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.
Meanwhile, Mamdani, promising a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, was one of a slew of Democratic victors around the country in elections earlier this month.
It was among the most deflating nights endured by Republicans this year, and Trump had not been expected to enjoy the reminder through a visit by one of the most prominent Democratic winners.
Yet the president, who found his fame as a New York real estate developer, brightened at Mamdani’s call for more housing in the city he will lead from January 1.
Trump was cheered to hear a chunk of New Yorkers who voted for him in last year’s presidential election had gone on to vote for Mamdani.
“When we spoke to those voters who voted for President Trump, we heard them speak of the cost of living,” Mamdani said.
Trump, who says he is paying increasing attention to affordability and inflation, said this made sense to him.
“Some of his ideas are the same ideas I have,” Trump explained. “The better he does, the happier I am.”
Mamdani, Trump laugh off past insults
As Mamdani surged in the polls to victory on November 4, Trump issued threats to strip federal funding from New York City. Mamdani has regularly criticised Trump’s promise to ramp up federal immigration enforcement efforts in a city where four in 10 residents are foreign-born.
In the weeks before they met, Trump had labeled Mamdani a “radical left lunatic,” a communist and a “Jew hater”.
Mamdani has espoused Nordic-style democratic socialism, not communism.
While a staunch critic of Israel, he was endorsed by prominent Jewish politicians, is bringing Jewish staff into his new administration, notably New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, and has repeatedly condemned anti-Semitism.

And yet, less than an hour after first meeting each other in person, Trump was repeatedly coming to Mamdani's aid to fend off pointed questions from the press.

The pair laughed away some of their spicier insults as reporters reminded them of what they had said about each other.

“I've been called much worse than a despot,” Trump said with a smile. “So it's not that insulting, but I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together.”

Mamdani was asked if he still considered Trump a fascist. “That’s OK, you can just say ‘yes’,” Trump interjected, swapping grins with Mamdani and patting his arm twice. “It’s easier than explaining it.”
 






Trump defends Mamdani as ‘very rational person’
Trump also defended the Uganda-born Mamdani, who will be New York City’s first Muslim mayor, from some of the Islamophobic slurs he has faced.
One reporter asked Trump if he believed he had “a jihadist” standing by him.
“No, I don’t,” Trump said as Mamdani looked on. “I met with a man who’s a very rational person.”
Some politicians and commentators were discombobulated by the televised friendliness. At least a couple Republicans said they still did not trust Mamdani, Trump’s new approval notwithstanding.
“What the heck just happened?” U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat from Michigan, wrote on social media, sharing a clip of one of the meeting’s Trump-Mamdani buddy moments.
 







Trump had repeatedly urged New Yorkers not to vote for Mamdani, warning it would be a disaster for a city that is already portrayed as a crime-ridden hellscape by conservative media, despite being among the safest big cities in the country.

After his first term as president, Trump decamped from Manhattan to become a Florida resident.
A reporter asked Trump if he would consider moving back to the city of his birth with Mamdani running it.

“Yeah, I would,” Trump said, “especially after the meeting.”</p><small>2025-11-22 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2210341608c02ec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956688/vietnam-flooding-death-toll-rises-to-55-as-rescuers-race-to-find-more-than-a-dozen-missing' target='_blank'><strong>Vietnam flooding death toll rises to 55 as rescuers race to find more than a dozen missing</strong></a><br><p>Rescuers raced to find more than a dozen people still missing on Saturday after a week of heavy flooding in Vietnam, where authorities said at least 55 people have died.
Relentless rain has lashed south-central Vietnam since late October and popular holiday destinations have been hit by several rounds of flooding.
Whole city blocks were inundated this week in coastal Nha Trang, while deadly landslides struck highland passes around the Da Lat tourist hub.
At least 55 people have been killed across six provinces since Sunday, while the search continues for 13 others, the environment ministry said in a statement released on Saturday.
Mountainous Dak Lak province was the hardest hit, with more than two dozen fatalities, it said.
Rescuers were still plucking people from treetops and the roofs of homes as floodwaters receded there on Friday, state media reported.
Multiple highways remained impassable Saturday and 300,000 people were without power, after a blackout that initially affected more than a million, the environment ministry added.
Natural disasters have left 279 people dead or missing in Vietnam and caused more than $2 billion in damage between January and October, according to the national statistics office.
The Southeast Asian nation is prone to heavy rain between June and September, but scientists have identified a pattern of human-driven climate change making extreme weather more frequent and destructive.</p><small>2025-11-22 05:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/6920e400c54da.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956668/provincial-autonomy' target='_blank'><strong>Provincial autonomy</strong></a><br><p>PROVINCIAL autonomy has always been an ultra-sensitive subject in Pakistan.
The country was split in 1971 primarily because we failed to manage the just expectations of the erstwhile eastern province of Pakistan. We experimented with various constitutional formulas to satisfy the aspirations of our former eastern wing, but the half-hearted implementation of the agreed constitutional arrangement in 1956 led to a weakening of trust between the federation and its eastern wing.
The military coup of 1958 and the subsequent 1962 constitution given by one person, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, and its unitary contours further disappointed East Pakistan. Therefore, there is a need to be extra-sensitive when it comes to provincial rights and autonomy, not only in letter but, more importantly, in spirit of the constitutional arrangement.
Fortunately, the near-unanimous passage of the 1973 Constitution created a robust legal base for federalism in what remained of the country, consisting of the four provinces and the federally administered territories. The 18th Constitutional Amendment, passed with broad consensus 37 years later, further strengthened the federal constitutional framework.
 
 

Over the subsequent 15 years, the provinces have emerged much stronger, more prosperous and even more assertive. Although we hear voices pleading for more autonomy or complaining about too much autonomy, the fact is that Pakistan has set a firm constitutional framework for federalism.
While after a long and painful journey, we may have been successful in settling most of our legal issues regarding federalism, the political forces are apparently not conducting politics in the true spirit of the constitutional provisions regarding provincial autonomy. In general, political parties continue to be the proverbial lengthened shadows of their top leaders and there is hardly any ‘devolution’ of powers from the central figure to the provinces. The overall organisation of most of the parties is weak, but as one goes down the hierarchy from federal to local, there is a steep decline in the powers and autonomy of sub-national organisations.
Most of the decisions are taken at the central level, which the provincial set-up is supposed to implement without question. Even if provincial parliamentary boards exist, final decisions about candidate selection for provincial assemblies are taken by the central parliamentary boards which, in many cases, authorise the top party leader to take the decision.
According to the Constitution, the election of the chief minister is the prerogative of the members of the respective provincial assemblies. They do go through the motions of electing a leader of the House but the candidate of the majority party is almost invariably picked by the central party leader who in many cases, may not belong to the province.
Since the Constitution binds assembly members to vote according to party direction or face ouster from the assembly, members have no choice but to go along with the choice of the party leader, even if they have strong reservations about the candidate.

The top party leadership designs the system to keep CMs dependent on its directions.

To understand the powerlessness of the MPAs, a case in point is the nomination of the little-known and least-qualified Usman Buzdar as a PTI candidate for the position of CM after the 2018 elections. The poor MPAs had absolutely no idea who they would be asked to vote for until party chairman Imran Khan dropped the bombshell just two days before the CM’s election. The members had no role whatsoever in picking the nominee and were generally shocked at the choice but went along with it and elected Mr Buzdar as CM.
 
 

It is now an open secret that the logic behind selecting a weak CM was that there would be no resistance to running the province from the federal capital through the prime minister’s principal secretary. A similar scenario was seen in the case of KP after the 2024 election, when a rather weak and indecisive candidate for the CM’s position was nominated so that the province could be run by the PM’s secretariat.
It would be unfair to single out the PTI in this context. PM Nawaz Sharif’s choice of Ghulam Haider Wyne as Punjab CM in 1990 followed the same pattern. Although Mr Wyne was a seasoned political worker, he was weak as a CM and followed the PM’s directions in running the province without asking any questions.
The top party leadership designs the system to keep CMs dependent on its directions even in routine provincial matters. The former KP chief minister, Mr Ali Amin Gandapur, was asked by his party to seek the directions of the incarcerated party founder Mr Imran Khan before passing the province’s annual budget for 2025-26. He faced extreme criticism when he had to get the budget passed without his leader’s directions as the federal and Punjab governments denied him the opportunity to meet Mr Khan in prison. This must have been one of the reasons he was later removed from his position.
The new CM delayed the formation of his provincial cabinet for 18 days and the provincial government remained nearly paralysed because he wanted to get Mr Khan’s approval by meeting him in jail. But the prison authorities again did not let him meet his leader.
 
 

These are only a few instances; almost the entire political system, contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, is geared towards total obedience to the central party leadership in purely provincial matters, making a mockery of provincial autonomy.
Framers of the Constitution have done their job to ensure provincial autonomy; it is now for the political parties and their leadership to devolve their powers to the provincial organisations of the party and the CM, if the party happens to be in power in a province.
Centralisation of powers is not only against the spirit of the Constitution, it also stunts the growth of the party organisation and provincial leadership, weakening democracy in general.

Published in Dawn, November 22nd, 2025</p><small>2025-11-22 04:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/6920e45be0be4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956669/jungle-raj' target='_blank'><strong>Jungle Raj</strong></a><br><p>PRIME Minister Narendra Modi’s face was glowing as he approached the podium to address a charged crowd celebrating the BJP’s stunning election victory in the state of Bihar.
After thanking the people of Bihar, Modi immediately rela­psed into the BJP’s familiar narrative. Criticising the Indian National Congress, Modi pejoratively referred to it as ‘Muslim League-Maoist Congress’ — in part an allusion to the Congress’s purported soft spot for Bihar’s Muslims who constitute 18 per cent of the state’s population.
The BJP’s jubilation is not without cause. The party has emerged as the single largest party for the first time in Bihar by improving its tally to 89 seats compared to 74 in 2020. All in all, the Na­­ti­o­nal Democratic Alliance — the BJP and its allies — surged ahead with 202 seats in the 243-seat assembly.
It is important to understand the drivers behind this remarkable electoral victory in Bihar as the same formula is likely to be repeated in upcoming state elections. Before Chief Minister Nitish Kum­ar, the BJP’s ally in the recent elections, took over two decades ago, Bihar, a state of some 135 million people, had rampant lawlessness or ‘Jungle Raj’.
In the first decade, Kumar focused on providing public goods, mainly roads, bridges and access to electricity. But, failing to create jobs for India’s poorest state, Kumar soon ran out of steam. Instead of turning towards pro-market policies that would generate competition, economic growth and jobs, without increasing the state’s fiscal deficit, Kumar turned more statist in Bihar, where state spending was already at 34pc of GDP, double the national average.

As in India, Pakistan’s political parties are aware of the transformative political power of cash transfers.

Manipulation of macroeconomic policy tools to stimulate the economy and create employment ahead of elections to ensure re-election is known to economists. These tendencies were first captured by the ‘political business cycle’ literature that includes the Nobel laureate William Nordhaus amongst its pioneers.
 
 

India’s rapid digitisation of government services, however, has exacerbated the phenomenon described by Nordhaus. In perhaps what can be described as digital political business cycles, some politicians can now use digital payment systems to engage in ‘virtual vote buying’ by directly reaching voters just before elections.
In recent years, cash transfer schemes directed specifically at women are increasingly being used by all political parties to win elections in India. Despite waxing eloquent against the use of such tactics — ‘revdi culture’ — Modi’s party used women-oriented financial support schemes ahead of polls in Maharashtra last year.
In the most recent elections, Kumar announced pre-election schemes amounting to 3pc of GDP despite Bihar’s fiscal deficit at 6pc of GDP. Before polls opened, Kumar started sending INR 10,000 to one woman from each family, claiming that this was ‘seed money’ for small businesses such as bea­uty parlours, dairy units, tailoring and retail kiosks.
It goes without saying that with little oversight, and due to money’s fungibility, the amount was probably consumed immediately. Economists warn that such populist policies can create serious fiscal implications, with Bihar being forced to rely on additional debt financing to sustain such expenditures.
According to Indian political analyst Neerja Chowdhury, these cash transfers underpinned the election results in Bihar. The 2025 Bihar election saw a record overall voter turnout of 66.91pc, the highest since 1951.
 
 

This was driven by a landmark surge in female participation, where female turnout stood at 71.6pc — significantly outpacing male turnout (62.8pc) and marking a clear watershed from the 60.48pc and 59.69pc female turnouts of the previous two elections. In a sense, by directly doling out cash to voters, the BJP and its allies were able to encourage women to break from traditional loyalties of caste and identity.

To be sure, the BJP’s rivals in Bihar had also promised goodies — one government job for every family — if they were voted into office. In this case, however, voters did not consider these to be credible commitments as government job promises appeared too good to be true.
It appears that, as in India, Pakistan’s political parties are fully aware of the transformative political power of cash transfers. This is the reason why, despite being allies at the federal level, Pakistan’s two main political parties were recently at loggerheads.
After the recent floods, the PPP had asked the PML-N’s government in Punjab to provide flood relief through the PPP’s signature Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP). Despite repeated requests, the PML-N resisted their federal ally’s demand with full force in the province, arguing that the amounts provided through the BISP were not enough to cover flood-related damage.
 
 

Meanwhile, BISP allocations have been rising steadily over the years. This year, the BISP allocation was increased by 20pc to Rs716 billion. The ability of cash transfers to tip the electoral scales in India, and Pakistani politicos’ cognisance of this phenomenon, does not bode well for Pakistan’s future fiscal management.
Where providing un­­conditional cash transfers to poor citizens is commendable, political competition may lead to exponential increases in BISP allocations in the future, especially as we get close to the next elections.
Back in India, there were multiple fatalities in a bomb blast near the Red Fort in Delhi the night before the second round of elections in Bihar. Though it is too early to trace a connection, this tragic incident may have also impacted electoral outcomes, especially in the aftermath of the Pakistan-India conflict earlier this year.
 
 

In a bid to highlight his strongman image, Modi repeatedly alluded to the Pakistan-India conflict on the campaign trail. Under fire from opposition leader Rahul Gandhi for “lacking courage”, the BJP even branded Gandhi the “poster boy of Pak­is­­tan”. Surprisingly, where the usually bellicose Indian media seems to have simmered down, Pak­istan keeps living rent-free in the BJP’s imagination.
In all likelihood, Modi’s victory in Bihar and the BJP’s strong political momentum for the upcoming state elections are going to embolden foreign policy hawks in India. This is especially so since India was unable to achieve any of its military or political objectives in the recent conflict with Pakistan.
The BJP’s surprising performance underscores its strategy for cementing power in different Indian states: direct cash transfers and a potent anti-Pakistan narrative. As the party seeks to maintain this momentum for upcoming state elections, Pakistani policymakers should be wary of runaway social spending, which could ultimately encroach on vital defence resources.

At a meeting of the ISIL and Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee held recently at the UN Security Council, Denmark, in its position as the current chair of the committee, said that the banned TTP posed a “serious threat” to Central and South Asia, while pointing out that the terrorist group received “logistical and substantial support” from the Afghan authorities, namely the Taliban. The Danish representative also mentioned the frequent cross-border attacks that TTP terrorists have conducted against Pakistan, while alerting the international community to the threat that IS-K — also based in Afghanistan but opposed to its rulers — posed to the region.
The Pakistani representative used the forum to criticise both the Taliban and their newfound ally, India, when he observed that terrorist groups, including the TTP and BLA, were thriving “under the patronage of their hosts”, and were backed by “our principal adversary and net destabiliser in the region”.
 
 

While the Taliban are often dismissive of Pakistan’s concerns in this regard, it will be hard for them to brush aside the issues raised by the UN body. The sanctions committee has reaffirmed what Pakistan has been saying for long: that the Taliban are supporting the TTP, and that terrorist groups in Afghanistan can destabilise the entire region. The Afghan Taliban’s responses to these grave concerns have been ambiguous, from stating that the TTP are Pakistan’s problem, to claiming they are hosting Pakistani ‘refugees’, to saying that no TTP terrorist is based on their territory. As is evident, the international community is not buying the Taliban’s explanations.
Instead of displaying obduracy over the matter, the Kabul regime needs to work constructively with Pakistan to address the problem. The last round of peace talks held in Istanbul earlier this month ended inconclusively, though the ceasefire between both states has held. Though it would be overly idealistic to expect the Taliban to take strong action against the TTP — both groups are from the same ideological stock, and have fought together in Afghanistan — Pakistan’s demand that Kabul stop cross-border attacks is entirely doable.
 
 

The alternative to the Taliban’s dithering and denialism would be more conflict, which is not in the interest of either country. The Pakistani state, therefore, while taking a firm stand against cross-border terrorism and internal security, must not let bilateral and people-to-people ties nosedive further.
If ties with Kabul sour even more, inimical actors in the region will be ready to exploit these differences, which will only add to Pakistan’s security dilemmas.

• Umrani says Balochistan CM enjoys complete support of his party
QUETTA: Parliamentary leaders of both the PML-N and the PPP have dismissed reports of a change in Balochistan’s chief minister, saying Senator Mir Dostain Khan Domki’s claim had no basis and that CM Sarfraz Bugti continued to enjoy the full support of all coalition parties.
They said on Friday that this appeared to be a personal desire of PML-N’s Domki, as the central leaderships of both parties had not even considered this move, adding that no such proposal was under discussion.
Talking to reporters after the Balo­chistan Assembly session, Mir Saleem Khosa, the PML-N’s parliamentary leader and provincial minister for communication and works, said the statement of his party’s senator might be his personal opinion or due to some disagreements with CM Bugti.
 
 

He noted that Balochistan faced serious law and order as well as governance issues, and these matters had been reviewed during the in-camera briefing held in the assembly.
Mr Khosa said after Mr Domki’s statement, he spoke with National As­­sembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, and the PML-N central leadership wou­ld certainly question the senator about issuing such remarks without the permission of the party leadership.
“Personal disagreements may occur, but statements against party policy are inappropriate,” Mr Khosa added.
He said the PML-N had nothing to do with the PPP’s internal matters, noting that every party had its own issues and that disagreements could arise even within families.
“Differences between MPAs and the chief minister are normal, and that their own party [PPP] members also raise concerns, which are addressed through dialogue.”
The PML-N parliamentary leader said Mr Bugti was working efficiently and tirelessly, and that the coalition government stood firmly behind him
“The PML-N will continue supporting Chief Minister Bugti under all circumstances. Balochistan faces serious challenges, including external threats, but the situation is gradually improving,” Mr Khosa remarked.
‘PPP leadership backs Bugti’
PPP parliamentary leader Mir Muhammad Sadiq Umrani also refuted Senator Domki’s claim, saying that CM Bugti enjoyed his party leadership’s complete confidence and would continue to serve as the chief executive of the province.
“No individual, who is not a member of the PPP, has the authority to issue policy statements about the party,” Mr Umrani said. He said the PPP had already decided that Mr Bugti was their chief minister and would remain so.
Mr Umrani said he could not comment on future political developments, but added that the party leadership had directed him to reject the rumours about a change of chief minister, which he had done.
 
 

He said the decision on the remaining two and a half years of the power-sharing arrangement rests with the party leadership. “The PPP believes the next two and a half years will also belong to them,” he said.
To a question, he said he had remained a part of the PPP for 53 years. “People come and go, but they remain steadfast with the party,” he added.

A source in the PM Office said the prime minister expressed full confidence in Mr Kundi and gave signals that the government has no intention of removing him.
The discussion covered key administrative issues concerning KP and the country’s overall political situation. Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam and Federal Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashir Iqbal also attended.
A few days ago, the governor denied reports about his removal but said he would “accept whatever the decision will be by the leadership of Pakistan Peoples Party”.
The issue of imposing governor’s rule was also discussed, reportedly due to a rigid stance by KP’s newly elected Chief Minister Sohail Afridi towards the Centre, armed forces and bureaucracy.
Governor Kundi also requested that the prime minister provide KP’s due share in the forthcoming National Finance Commission award.
 
 

Earlier, the prime minister directed relevant ministries to accelerate the integration of private-sector proposals into a unified industrial policy.
“The government seeks to translate expert recommendations into actionable reforms without delay,” he said while presiding over a meeting of a private-sector committee on industrial development.
PM Shehbaz welcomed proposals from the business community aimed at increasing investment.
“The business community has diligently prepared comprehensive proposals for industrial development, which are commendable,” he said, adding that an implementation plan would be formulated after a careful review.
He instructed that the proposals should be merged with recommendations from other economic sectors.
Federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Jam Kamal Khan, Ahad Khan Cheema, Ali Pervaiz Malik, Advi­sor to the PM Muh­am­­mad Ali, Minister of State Bilal Azhar Kayani, Special As­­sistant Haroon Akhtar, and ind­ustrialists included in the Indu­s­trial Working Group led by Saqib Shirazi attended the meeting.

• Security personnel authorised to act as magistrates for offences
ISLAMABAD: The interior ministry on Friday approved the deployment of the Pakistan Army and civil armed forces for security in 13 national and provincial assembly constituencies, where by-elections are scheduled to take place on Sunday (tomorrow).
A notification issued by the interior ministry, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said the approval followed requests from Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The civil armed forces will be deployed as “2nd-tier responders (standby/quick reaction)”, while the troops of Pakistan Army will be deployed as “3rd-tier responders (quick reaction force)” from Friday to Nov 24 (Monday).
The civil armed forces will be deployed as “second-tier responders (standby/quick reaction),” whereas the troops of the Pakistan Army will serve as “third-tier responders (quick reaction force)” from Friday through Nov 24 (Monday).
The exact numbers will be determined by home departments and the ECP based on ground assessments.
The constituencies where the by-elections are taking place include NA-18 Haripur, NA-96 Faisal­ab­ad-II, NA-104 Faisalabad-X, NA-143 Sahiwal-III, NA-185 D.G Khan-II, NA-129 Lahore-XIII, PP-73 Sar­go­dha-III, PP-98 Faisalabad-I, PP-115 Faisalabad-XVIII, PP-116 Faisal­abad-XIX, PP-203 Sahi­wal-VI, PP-269 Muzaffar­garh-II, and PP-87 Mianwali-III.
ECP notification
A separate notification issued by the ECP stated that, under Article 218(3) of the Constitution, the commission was responsible for organising and conducting elections and ensuring that they were held honestly, fairly, and in accordance with the law, with safeguards against corrupt practices.
“The ECP, in exercise of its power under Article 220 of the Constitution and all other powers enabling it in that behalf, has requisitioned the services of Pakistan armed forces/civil armed forces in terms of Article 245 of the Constitution,” it read.
“The forces so deployed are empowered to exercise powers under section 4 and 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, for the duration of their deployment … in aid of civil power subject to law enforced in Pakistan,” it added.

• Israeli military admits to killing 13 Palestinians in a Lebanon refugee camp
JERUSALEM: Israeli occupation forces killed at least eight Palestinians on Friday, including two teenagers who were shot dead in the occupied West Bank, while the Israeli military also confirmed it had killed 13 Palestinians in its Tuesday’s strike on a refugee camp in southern Lebanon.
The Palestinian health ministry said that two teenagers were martyred overnight in the town of Kufr Aqab. “The young man Amr Khaled Ahmed Al-Marbou, 18, and the boy Sami Ibrahim Sami Mashayekh, 16, were martyred by occupation forces’ gunfire in the town of Kufr Aqab near Ramallah,” the ministry announced in a statement.
The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that its medics transported two victims from Kufr Aqab during the night, describing one with a “very serious live bullet injury” and the second with a “live bullet injury to the chest.”
 


Oday al-Shurfa, a friend who witnessed the killing of Marbou, told AFP that the pair were on the street when Israeli forces opened fire during a raid. He said Israeli soldiers shot them without provocation.
Shurfa stated that Marbou was hit “in the chest, in the heart. He collapsed and was martyred on the spot,” insisting his friend was not participating in any clashes or throwing stones.
 
 

The town of Kufr Aqab, though technically part of illegally annexed east Jerusalem, is cut off by Israel’s separation wall, depriving its residents of basic municipal services from either Jerusalem or the Palestinian Authority.
In the besieged southern Gaza Strip, the Israeli army said its forces killed five Palestinians on Friday. The killings took place in an area of southern Gaza under Israeli military control, east of the so-called Yellow Line.
Israeli military used “immediate threat” to justify the killings. The same pretext has been repeatedly used by the Israeli military to legitimise its brutality, even as Palestinian resistance groups have affirmed a halt to their activities in Gaza since a ceasefire was announced.
Separately, a Gaza hospital official told AFP that another Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire near Khan Yunis.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military confirmed on Friday that its strike on the Ain al-Helweh refugee camp in southern Lebanon earlier in the week killed 13 Palestinians, whom it claimed were “Hamas terrorists.”

• Dollar sales to banks drop to $3bn in 10 months
KARACHI: The country has lost an estimated $600 million to illegal crypto transactions, a development that has sharply reduced the flow of dollars into the banking system as people buy dollars from exchange companies and route them into cryptocurrencies through unlawful channels.
“Last year, during the first 10 months of the calendar year, we sold banks about $4 billion, which fell to $3 billion during the same period this year. These disappeared dollars were mostly invested in crypto currencies,” said Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan Chairman Malik Bostan.
 
 

He said people buying dollars from exchange companies are depositing them in their foreign currency (FCY) accounts, from where they withdraw the dollars and purchase cryptocurrencies through illegal means. During Jan-October this year, Pakistanis retained about $400m in their FCY accounts, while $600m left the country with no trace.
The State Bank recently issued a circular instructing both banks and exchange companies not to provide cash dollars; instead, they must transfer the amount directly into the customer’s FCY account for deposit purposes.
Exchange companies now either issue cheques or directly transfer funds into customers’ FCY accounts. Mr Malik said these deposited dollars are then withdrawn from banks’ FCY accounts and invested in cryptocurrencies.
Dollar sales to banks also dropped during the first four months of the current fiscal year, despite tight controls on borders with Afghanistan and Iran. Data shows that exchange companies sold $280m in July this year ($333m in 2024); $163m in August ($295m in 2024); $186m in September ($214m in 2024); and $244m in October ($297m in 2024). Total sales to banks during July-Oct 2024 were $1.139 billion, which fell to $873m in the first four months of 2025 — a decline of 23 per cent.
State Bank data shows that commercial banks’ dollar holdings increased from $4.180bn in January 2025 to $4.625bn, an increase of $425m.
The country has faced a serious shortage of dollars for years and was close to default in 2023. After receiving an IMF bailout, the government and the State Bank imposed restrictions on imports to reduce trade and current account deficits, while launching a crackdown on illegal trading and dollar smuggling. Illegal trading is now largely under control, but this new trend of crypto investments could undermine policymakers’ efforts to save dollars and reduce reliance on foreign exchange loans.
Meanwhile, the government is preparing to enter the international financial market with new bonds, as well as the Chinese market with Panda Bonds. Currently, the State Bank’s foreign exchange reserves stand at about $14.551bn, and the bank expects reserves to reach $17bn by the end of FY26.
Higher remittance inflows have allowed the central bank to make payments for debt servicing and other obligations while still maintaining more than $14.5bn in reserves.
Currency experts believe the IMF will release the expected $1.2 billion, which would further boost the SBP’s reserves.

• Can’t let ‘our people be killed indiscriminately’
• Scheduling of planned Turkish delegation’s visit in connection with Pak-Afghan conflict still awaited
ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.
“The onus of delay in the reopening of the border crossings rests with the Afghan Taliban regime,” Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said at a weekly media briefing.
Pakistan and Afghanistan’s bilateral trade, estimated at $1.6 billion to $1.8bn in 2023-24, with key border gateways like Torkham and Chaman handling most of the traffic, has been suspended since mid-October, following deadly clashes between Pakistani forces and Taliban fighters.
This suspension is estimated to be costing Afghan traders an estimated $2.5 million a day.
 


The impasse has pushed Kabul to increasingly rely on Iranian routes, including Chabahar, while risking the erosion of Pakistan’s roughly $1bn in annual transit fees in addition to its own trade losses.
Mr Andrabi said Pakistan had closed border crossings and suspended all trade because of “the support being extended to Fitna-al-Khawarij [FAK] and Fitna-al-Hindustan [FAH] terrorist elements by the Afghan Taliban regime”.
FAK is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­i­stan, while the Balochistan Liberation Army and other militant groups based in the province have been designated FAH to highlight India’s alle­ged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
‘Economic pain’
The FO spokesperson said Islamabad understood the economic pain caused by the closures but described the security threat as “existential”.
“If you recall, on November 10 and 15, the trade posts were actually attacked from Afghanistan. So, either we get ourselves killed, or we undertake a very risky trade. What is the choice?” he added.
“Carrying out trade has become risky. So, with respect to trade, the position remains the same as I outlined last week.”
Mr Andrabi said Islamabad had for years attempted to insulate trade from security tensions but that patience had run out.
“From 2022, 23, 24 and the mid of 25, we segregated trade and security. But then there is a threshold of patience. I think that threshold of patience has been crossed,” he continued.
 
 

The FO spokesperson noted that Islamabad could not allow trade to continue as if it were a “licence to kill Pakistanis from Afghan soil”.
He rejected suggestions that trade losses should override security concerns. “Can you put a price tag on a human life, a Pakistani life?” he said.
“Consider the people whose father, children, mother have been killed in these terrorist attacks. Can we convince them that look, let these killings continue because we are having an X amount of dollars of trade with Afghanistan?”
Regional projects
He also warned that major regional infrastructure projects including the Turkmen­istan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline and the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000) depended on a shift in the Taliban’s conduct.
“The success of all these projects also depends on the Taliban regime halting its support and abetment of terrorist outfits operating from Afghan soil,” he said.
Calling this a central “denominator” of ties, Mr Andrabi said the Afghan Taliban must stop backing groups such as FAK, FAH and their affiliates, and prevent Afghan nationals from carrying out attacks inside Pakistan.
“We are cognisant of the losses to Pakistani traders, who are suffering,” he said. “But now we cannot let our people be killed indiscriminately.”
Turkish delegation
The spokesperson said the scheduling of a planned Turkish delegation’s visit in connection with the Pakistan-Afgha­nistan conflict was still awaited, despite Ankara’s announcement earlier this month that senior officials would travel to Islamabad for renewed mediation efforts.
The third round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, held under the Turkish-Qatari initiative, ended without an agreement on Nov 7 in Istanbul, leaving the ceasefire fragile amid continued TTP attacks.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later announced on Nov 9 that a high-level delegation, including Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin would visit Islamabad the following week to help secure a lasting ceasefire and work towards reopening trade routes.
Pakistan welcomed Ankara and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
“This visit has not taken place. It is being scheduled. The travel schedules of ministers take time to firm up,” Mr Andrabi said.
 
 

He rejected suggestions that Islam­abad’s lack of cooperation was causing delays.“The delay should not be attributed to any non-cooperation from Pakistan,” he said.“Whether there is any non-cooperation from the Afghan Tali­ban regime, I am not aware of it.”
The FO spokesperson said it was premature to comment on other mediation proposals, including those from Russia and Iran.
“Many states have offered mediation, and we appreciate the support of our friendly and brotherly countries,” he said.
“It is too early to comment on any specifics or other mediation offers. We will respond once we receive them.”

• Provinces, Centre to give 10-minute briefings on fiscal positions
• Terms of reference cover distribution of five key federal tax categories
• Commission to debate cost-sharing for provincial, national, transnational projects
• PM expected to engage with leadership of key allies before formal sitting
ISLAMABAD: After yet another rescheduling, the federal government has convened the inaugural meeting of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) on Dec 4 to set the housekeeping framework for subsequent technical, financial and legal discussions on horizontal and vertical resource sharing among the federating units.
According to notices sent to the provinces, the first NFC meeting, to be presided over by Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, will take up three agenda items. It will begin with general discussions on “strategy for deliberations on the 11th NFC award, including proposed formation of sub-groups for deliberations on thematic areas, etc”.
This will be followed by 10-minute presentations each by the four provincial governments and the Ministry of Finance on their respective fiscal positions. The commission will finally set the schedule and timelines for future NFC meetings, most likely to be held in all federal and provincial capitals, until the conclusion of its deliberations.
 
 

Sources told Dawn that the finance ministry had earlier issued notices to the provinces for the first meeting on Dec 3 along with the agenda, but the date was changed the same day to Dec 4.
The 11th NFC was constituted on Aug 22 to finalise a new award for sharing federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces.
The first meeting was originally scheduled for Aug 27, then delayed to Aug 29 for unspecified reasons. This, too, was postponed on the request of the Sindh government due to flood-related engagements. The session was later rescheduled for Nov 17, then Nov 18, and again deferred at the desire of the Prime Minister’s Office.
Headed by Finance Minister Aura­n­gzeb, the NFC comprises the four provincial finance ministers and four non-statutory members, one from each province.
The terms of reference set out in Clause 2 of Article 160 require the commission to recommend the distribution of the net proceeds from five major tax categories between the federation and the provinces. These include taxes on income, including capital value tax and corporation tax, but excluding taxes on income consisting of remuneration paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund.
Also on the list are taxes on the sale and purchase of goods imported, exported, produced, manufactured, or consumed; export duties on cotton and such other export duties as may be specified by the president; excise duties; and any other taxes as may be specified by the president.
The notification also seeks to make recommendations on grants-in-aid by the federal government to the provinces.
The new NFC is also required to deliberate issues relating to the sharing of financial expense incurred or to be incurred by the federation in respect of subjects falling within the provincial domain; expenditure sharing by the federation and/or the provinces in respect of transnational matters; and financial requirements for national projects to be jointly funded by the Centre and the provinces.
 
 

In line with suggestions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Centre wants to secure provincial burden-sharing in expenses for increasingly frequent natural calamities, certain horizontal health programmes and major dams, highways and motorways. It has also been calling for an end to the existing population-based incentive and its replacement with criteria based on social-sector performance and the activation of local governments.
The NFC will also be required to recommend grants-in-aid by the federal government to the provinces, set out the powers and conditions governing federal and provincial borrowing, and assess and allocate resources to meet expenditures related to the governments of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the newly merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (erstwhile Fata).
Under the 7th NFC award, announced in 2009 and enforced for 15 years rather than the five-year constitutional term, the provincial share in the divisible pool was raised to 57.5pc from about 47pc. This later increased to around 59pc after special allocations to Balochistan, KP and Sindh on various grounds, reducing the federal share to 42.5pc.
In subsequent years, however, the Centre imposed a petroleum levy of about Rs1.5 trillion and secured roughly Rs1.5tr in cash balances from the provinces, effectively tilting the financial balance back in its favour.
On their part, the provinces failed to meet their 7th NFC commitment to increase their own revenue contribution by 0.5pc of GDP every year. A similar pledge by the Centre to raise its revenue by one per cent of GDP annually also remained unfulfilled.
For the current year, the federal government has already revised down its economic growth forecast by up to 0.7 percentage points to 3.5pc owing to flood-related damages.
Various quarters, including the finance ministry, the armed forces and the IMF, have been calling for a rebalancing of the transfer of a larger chunk of divisible pool resources in the Centre’s favour.
The Constitution, however, stipulates that provincial shares under each NFC award cannot be reduced. The award must be agreed upon by consensus among the five parties, i.e., the Centre and the four provinces.
Provincial governments receive their horizontal shares based on population, poverty, revenue collection and inverse population density. Under the current formula, Punjab receives 51.74pc, Sindh 24.55pc, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 14.62pc and Balochistan 9.09pc.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to engage with the political leadership of key allies on the NFC before the formal sitting, although he has no official role in the commission, the sources said.
The revision of NFC parameters was originally part of the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, under which the Centre sought to reduce provincial shares and take back some devolved subjects such as education and population.
However, the federal government later stepped back in a political bargain with its main coalition partner, the PPP, to prioritise amendments relating to the armed forces and the judiciary. Nevertheless, the prime minister has been hinting at continuing dialogue with the PPP on the NFC.

FCCP Registrar Muhammad Hafeezullah Khan inaugurated the desk on the premises of the Islamabad High Court (IHC). “The establishment of this desk marks a significant step toward enhancing public facilitation and improving access to judicial services,” says a handout issued by FCCP.
At the inauguration, the desk received two fresh cases, marking the commencement of its operational functions.
The desk has been established to serve multiple purposes, including filing of new cases for FCCP, providing information and assistance to litigants, lawyers and the general public and receiving applications for attested copies of judicial records.
 
 

Before the setting up of the information desk, the lawyers were facing difficulty since they had no idea where to file petitions or appeals.
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, who graced the inauguration, acknowledged the initiative as a historical milestone in strengthening judicial outreach and administrative efficiency.
The FCCP also issued an official notification regarding the court’s working hours, ensuring clarity and accessibility for all stakeholders. It stated the federal court was committed to improving service delivery, transparency and ease of access for litigants across the country.
The appeal against the SHC in a family property dispute was filed by Ghulam Shah Abbasi in person, seeking prevention of harassment and protection of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
The appellant pleaded before the federal court to set aside the Sept 8 decision of the SHC that had disposed of the case on the grounds that the matter pertained to a private civil dispute. He also requested the FCCP to order the Sindh government for providing due protection and restrain his family members from harassment and bodily harm.
The matter revolves around a family dispute over inherited properties left by deceased father of the petitioner, which is a three-storey residential building with shops in Hyderabad.
The petitioner claimed that he asked for his legal share in the inherited properties left behind by his deceased father Noor Muhammad Abbasi who died on July 22, 2003 but the family members became his enemy, which according to him was the root cause of dispute.
The appellant claimed that he was “deceitfully” called by the respondent relatives at Hyderabad for settlement and giving his share from the inherited properties left by his deceased father but when he reached at Citizen Colony Gate at Hyderabad he was allegedly abducted and later tied up and illegally confined for 15 days in the Drugs Addicted Ward of M/s MK (Majnu Khan) Hospital allegedly to “fabricate and generate” his false statement.
He also alleged that he was being intimidated and harassed by the Commissioner, Sindh Revenue Board, Karachi. On April 29, 2024, the appellant said, a complaint was lodged with Arambagh police station.

RESCUERS search for survivors after an explosion at a chemical factory.—Courtesy Rescue 1122

• Factory owner, staff held
• Probe body formed on CM’s directive
• Labour unions blame govt
TOBA TEK SINGH: Twenty people, including seven members of the same family, lost their lives and seven others were injured in a massive steamer explosion apparently due to gas leak at a glue factory in Faisalabad on early Friday morning.
The explosion at the Crystal Chemical Factory also destroyed four neighbouring industrial units and nine houses in the Malikpur locality of Faisalabad.
Rescue workers and police shifted the dece­ased and the injured, incl­uding three critically inj­ured, to the burn unit of Allied Hosp­ital. The victims aged between one year and 62 years, according to officials.
In the meantime, the crime-scene unit and forensic unit of police collected evidence from the site, while the factory owner, Qaiser Chughtai, along with administrative staff allegedly went into hiding for some time.
 
 

While expressing grief over the loss of lives, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif extended condolences to the bereaved families and sought a report on the incident from Com­missioner Raja Jahangir Anwar.
Subsequently, the commissioner formed a five-member inquiry committee and sought a report to determine responsibility for the incident.
Govt negligence blamed
National Trade Union Federation Secretary-Gen­eral Nasir Mansoor, Labour Qaumi Movement Chairman Baba Latif Ans­ari, and Haqooq-i-Khalq Party Chief Farooq Tariq, in separate statements, blamed the government negligence for loss of lives.
While expressing concern over the tragic deaths of labourers and citizens, they said the government was responsible for negligence that allowed factory owners to endanger the lives of workers and residents by failing to adopt safety measures.
Owner held, FIR registered
Later, the Mansoorabad police arrested the factory owner and registered a case against him and others under the Anti-Terrorism Act, Pakistan Penal Code and Explosive Substances Act on a complaint of Sub-Inspector Ehtesham Abbas.
According to police, factory owner Qaiser Chughtai, manager Bilal Ali Imran, and six others were booked in the case, which was registered under Section 7 of the ATA; Sections 302, 324, 336-B, 440, 147, and 149 of the PPC, and Sections 3 and 4 of the Explosive Substances Act.
Later, factory manager Bilal Ali Imran, cook Khalid, and two workers, Zain and Atta Muhammad, were also taken into custody.
 
 

The FIR alleged that residents had repeatedly warned the factory owner and management not to store dangerous flammable chemicals in the factory, but the management continued to store them while throwing caution to wind.
The roofs of four factories — including the glue factory — and nine houses in the adjacent Shahab Town collapsed due to the powerful blast.
Victims identified
According to police, 20 people died in the incident. Most of them have been identified. It also stated that seven others were injured.
The deceased included seven members of the same family namely Shafiq, 62, his wife, Maqsooda, 55, their son Irfan, grandchildren Muqaddas, 13, Rehan, 12, Muhammad Ahmed, 10, and Azan, 4.
Also, electrical engineer Ashiq Hussain, and his three sons Obaid, 24, Omar, 22, and Bilal, 20, died under the debris when the roof of their house collapsed.
Residents of the same street, Rashid’s wife Fakhra, 40, their one-year-old son, Ali Hasnain, and two daughters Maham, 4 and Jannat, 3, also died under the rubble. The two brothers who died in the nearby embroidery factory, Waqas, 25, and Saim, 23, were residents of Shamsabad locality on Chak Jhumra Road. A worker of the affected factory, Fazal, also died.

The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited-built Tejas jet crashed at about 2:10pm local time.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Videos circulating on social media showed the aircraft failing to recover from an aerial maneuver and bursting into a ball of flames after impacting the ground as onlookers watched in shock. A plume of smoke billowed from the crash site as emergency vehicles sped towards it.
The incident happened on the last day of the Middle East’s biggest airshow, which features a flying display each afternoon. Hundreds of people were watching from a grandstand, while the apron was packed with planes, helicopters and other hardware on static display.
In September, India signed a $7 billion order for 97 upgraded Tejas Mk1A fighter jets to replace its Russian MiG-21 fleet after decades of use.
In a post on X, the Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed the death of the pilot in the incident.
 






“An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at Dubai Air Show, today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident,” said the post.
“IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief. A court of inquiry is being constituted to ascertain the cause of the accident,” it added.
Footage of the crash showed the fighter executing a low roll before crashing in flames about a mile (1.6 kilometres) from the show site.
The UAE aviation authority was not immediately available to comment on whether it would lead a local investigation. The Indian embassy said it was in touch with UAE authorities. Experts stressed it was too early to say what caused the crash.
GE, the engine manufacturer, said in a statement that it was ready to support the investigation.
‘Oil leak’ controversy
Earlier this week, social media was abuzz with posts claiming that the Indian fighter jet was ‘leaking oil’ while parked on the tarmac. Pictures showed shopping bags placed beneath the Tejas to collect the leaking liquid.
Some posts claimed the leak continued on the second day of the international air show. However, there was no official comment on the topic by the Indian government or the armed forces.
The Press Information Bureau (PIB) of India, in a post, claimed that it was a “routine draining process, not a technical malfunction”.
The bureau added that it was part of the “standard pre-flight procedure to remove condensation, which naturally forms as part of the aircraft’s cooling system”.
 






The Tejas, meaning “brilliance” in Hindi, is a domestically designed and built fighter jet that was commissioned into the Indian Air Force in 2016. The aircraft has been beset by design and other challenges and was once rejected by the Indian Navy as too heavy.
 






The biennial airshow is being held at Dubai’s Al Maktoum International Airport from November 17-21.
The show, according to its website, brought together over 1,500 exhibitors, 200 aircraft across flying and static displays, 12 conference tracks, and 450 global visionaries.
India had been gauging interest from potential foreign buyers at the week-long airshow, a major arena for global arms and airliner markets and well-known for bold displays making use of wide vistas of airspace.
Friday’s accident was the first on record for the world’s third-largest airshow, after Paris and Britain’s Farnborough. Airshow accidents were common in the 1970s, but have become rare at the top aerospace events as safety restrictions were tightened in recent decades.
This is the second known crash of the fighter jet, which is powered by General Electric (GE) engines. The first crash was during an exercise in India in 2024.
The Tejas Mk-1A fighters are crucial for India’s efforts to bolster its air force’s depleting fighter squadrons and replace ageing jets in the face of China’s growing military strength and support for arch-rival Pakistan.
The IAF expects to operate a fleet of almost 220 Tejas fighters and its advanced Mk-1A variants over the next decade after HAL completes the pending orders.
The rollout of the fighter has been delayed due to slow deliveries from GE of 99 engines ordered in 2021, of which only four have arrived so far. GE has blamed supply chain issues following Covid-19.

Washington has presented Kyiv with a 28-point plan that would require Kyiv to give up additional territory, scale back the size of its military and forever abandon hope of joining the Nato alliance.
Ukraine’s European allies said they had not been consulted over the plan and scheduled an urgent phone call to discuss the situation. Britain and Germany said their leaders would take part.
Zelensky’s office did not say whether he would join in.
US officials said the plan was drafted after consultations with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, a close Zelensky ally who served as defence minister until July.
“This plan was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of President Zelensky’s administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelensky,” a senior US official said on Thursday.
But Umerov said on Friday he had not discussed the plan’s terms, much less approved them.
“During my visit to the United States, my role was technical organising meetings and preparing the dialogue. I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure,” he wrote on Telegram.
After meeting a visiting US delegation on Friday, Umerov said Kyiv would not accept a plan that violates its sovereignty.
‘We are ready for constructive, hard work’: Zelensky
Zelensky, who met a US Army delegation on Thursday, has acknowledged receiving the plan but has not commented directly on its contents.
“Our teams — Ukraine and the USA — will work on the points of the plan to end the war,” the president wrote overnight on Telegram. “We are ready for constructive, honest and prompt work.”
The Kremlin, which has so far been cautious in public, said Russia had not received anything official from the United States about a 28-point peace plan for Ukraine.
Kyiv should make a “responsible decision” and do it now, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Russia’s demands spelt out, Kyiv’s left vague
The plan, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, includes terms that Ukrainian officials have previously dismissed as tantamount to surrender after their soldiers fended off a full-scale Russian invasion for nearly four years at huge cost.
It would require Ukraine to withdraw from territory it still controls in eastern provinces that Russia claims to have annexed, while Russia would give up smaller amounts of land it has captured in other regions.
Ukraine would be permanently barred from joining the Nato military alliance, and its armed forces would be capped at 600,000 troops. Nato would agree never to station troops there.
Sanctions against Russia would be gradually lifted, Moscow would be invited back into the G8 group of industrialised countries, and frozen Russian assets would be pooled in an investment fund, with Washington given some of the profits.
One of Ukraine’s main demands, for enforceable guarantees equivalent to the Nato alliance’s mutual defence clause to deter Russia from attacking again, is dealt with in a single line with no details: “Ukraine will receive robust security guarantees”.

A US delegation in Kyiv was expected to brief European embassies there on its contents later on Friday. European countries are now funding Ukraine’s defence alone after US President Donald Trump cancelled financial support.
“We have always said [the] for any plan to work, it needs to be with Ukraine and the Europeans on board,” the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said in Brussels.
Trump, who returned to office this year vowing to quickly end the war, has accepted some of Russia’s justifications for its 2022 invasion of its neighbour while also expressing some impatience with Moscow.
Last month, he cancelled a proposed summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and imposed sanctions on Russia’s two main oil companies, a step not taken by his pro-Ukrainian predecessor Joe Biden.
The full force of those sanctions was due to come into effect on Friday, Washington’s deadline for foreign buyers of Russian oil to wind down purchases.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff had quietly worked on the plan for about a month and that Trump supports it.
“This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after five years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,” she said.
The acceleration in US diplomacy comes at a time when Ukrainian troops are on the back foot on the battlefield and Zelensky’s government has been undermined by a corruption scandal. Parliament fired two cabinet ministers on Wednesday.
Ukrainian forces repelled Russia’s initial assault on Kyiv in 2022, but their attempted counteroffensive failed in 2023.
With the war’s fourth winter approaching, Russian troops occupy almost one-fifth of Ukraine and have been grinding slowly forward along a 1,200-kilometre front line while bombarding Ukrainian energy supplies.
Russia says it has taken control of the city of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine and most of Pokrovsk in the east, its first big prizes in nearly two years. Kyiv denies losing control of those cities but has acknowledged that Russia is advancing.</p><small>2025-11-21 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/212240154994c49.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956525/ttap-pti-stage-demonstrations-against-27th-amendment-across-kp-and-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP, PTI stage demonstrations against 27th Amendment across KP and Punjab</strong></a><br><p>The PTI and the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday staged demonstrations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab in protest of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the mistreatment of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail.
Concurrently, the PTI and TTAP staged a protest in Karachi, where police detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the demonstration’s scheduled venue.
In KP, the demonstrations were staged on the directives of the PTI’s KP President Junaid Akbar, after the TTAP made the decision to march. They were held at the district level, where charged PTI workers chanted slogans against institutions while holding portraits of the party founder.
In Peshawar, dozens of PTI workers held a protest outside the Peshawar Press Club, which was addressed by Provincial Minister for Local Government Meena Khan Afridi, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Sher Ali Arbab and the PTI’s Peshawar district president Irfan Saleem.
 






In his speech, Afridi said that Imran has presented two options to the leadership of TTAP.
“The first option is to hold negotiations with the powers that be to sort out all outstanding issues,” he said, adding that if the negotiations failed, the second option would be peaceful protest across the country.
 
 

He assailed the powers of immunity granted through the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which defines that the president and military leadership cannot be prosecuted.
“Immunity is un-Islamic, unethical and in violation of traditions,” he said.
“The 1973 Constitution was a social contract between the masses, the state, government and institutions, which ended with the 27th Constitutional Amendment.”
He urged the Insaf Lawyers Forum to challenge the 27th Amendment and stage a protest against it with the support of the public.
Saleem added that the party’s struggle for the supremacy of the constitution, the rule of law and human rights would not stop till achieving their goals.
He slammed security agencies for allegedly detaining Pashtoon Tahafuz Movement (PTM) workers following the conclusion of the grand jirga at the KP Assembly on November 12.
“Only the elected people have the right to rule Pakistan, while those imposed on the nation have no rights and are ruling the country illegally.”
Demonstrations in KP’s districts
In Swabi, PTI workers claimed that the incumbent federal government has been working for the establishment since coming to power through a fraudulent election.
The party staged a protest on Swabi-Jahangira road in Tordhir against the 27th Constitutional Amendment, claiming that it was passed to strengthen “powerful personalities” instead of common people.
 






Speaking on the occasion, MNA Shahram Khan Tarakai said that terrorists have never been tried in the courts of Islamabad, but PTI leaders have been tried there to stop them from serving the people.
Meanwhile, in Mohmand’s Mian Mandi Bazar, PTI workers staged a large protest against the recently-passed Amendment, calling it a “direct assault on Pakistan’s constitution, judicial subjugation and extension scheme”.
Party workers, led by district leaders including MNA Sajid Khan and MPA Muhammad Israr, waved black flags and chanted “Withdraw the 27th Amendment” and “Long Live the Constitution”.
 






“The 27th Amendment is a dangerous conspiracy against the nation’s constitution. It was passed to block the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf from the elections,” claimed MNA Khan.
MPA Israr said in his address, “The mistreatment of Imran Khan’s sisters the day before yesterday is beyond tolerance. The establishment wants to completely dismantle the PTI. “
He added that through Form 47, the rulers are stripping away judicial independence and hollowing out national institutions.
In Battagram, the PTI, led by Battagram chapter president Niaz Muhammad Khan Trand, staged a protest on the Karakoram Highway. The demonstration featured party workers holding placards with slogans against the federal government.
Trand stated that Pakistan was founded in the name of Islam, emphasising accountability for all actions. He criticised the PML-N government for “placing itself above the law through the 27th Amendment”, which he deemed unacceptable.
 






He further claimed the amendment aimed “to conceal the government’s mismanagement, corruption and administrative failures”.
Niaz accused the PML-N government of attempting to sideline PTI, its leadership, and workers, asserting that PTI remains the most popular and acceptable party in Pakistan.
Meanwhile, in Bajaur, scores of PTI workers and supporters attended the demonstration in the Sewai area of War Mamund tehsil, where they chanted slogans against the PML-N-led federal government and its allies while waving party flags.
The protesters said that the 27th Amendment was nothing but an attempt to further destroy the judiciary system in the country.
Protests staged across Punjab
In response to the protest call by the PTI and the TTAP, the PTI’s Chief Organiser in Punjab, Aliya Hamza, also instructed her party’s ticket holders to join the movement.
All party ticket holders, even at the union council level, were instructed to wear black bands, hold pro-democracy and judiciary placards and take out rallies in their areas, she said in a message posted on X.
 






By evening, aside from small protests, no big gatherings were reported.
Hamza posted on X that the protests had been peaceful, with ticket holders, lawyers and the party’s Punjab chapter protesting outside their tehsil courts against the 27th Amendment and the unethical treatment of Imran’s sisters.
“Participants held protest placards and staged a peaceful demonstration,” she wrote.

By-polls are due in NA-18 (Haripur), NA-96 (Faisalabad-II), NA-104 (Faisalabad-X), NA-143 (Sahiwal-III), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan-II), NA-129 (Lahore-XIII), PP-73 (Sargodha-III), PP-98 (Faisalabad-I), PP-115 (Faisalabad-XVIII), PP-116 (Faisalabad-XIX), PP-203 (Sahiwal-VI), PP-269 (Muzaffargarh-II) and PP-87 (Mianwali-III) on Sunday.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had sent letters to the federal secretaries of defence and interior on Thursday, requesting them to deploy civil armed forces/army to allow peaceful conduct of polling and also to take other appropriate measures to protect the lives of election officials, voters and the public at large.
An order, available with Dawn, issued today from the interior ministry said the government authorised the deployment of “sufficient strength” of civil armed forces as second-tier responders on standby in quick reaction force (QRF) mode only and the Pakistan Army as third-tier responders in QRF mode under Articles 220 and 245 of the Constitution.
It added that the troops were empowered to exercise powers under Sections 4 and 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, from Saturday to Monday.
“The exact number of troops will be worked out by the respective home departments and Election Commission of Pakistan in consultation with concerned stakeholders on the basis of on ground requirements/assessment,” the order said.
Faisalabad DMO fines Rana Sanaullah, son-in-law
Separately, Faisalabad District Monitoring Officer Muhammad Murtaza Malik fined Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and his son-in-law, Rana Ahmad Sheheryar, candidate for PS-116, for failing to comply with the code of conduct for the by-polls.
The DMO’s order said a notice was served to Sanaullah today for violating the code of conduct, but he failed to comply and participated in Shehryar’s election campaign by addressing a public gathering at Nawaz Sharif Park, which was broadcast on electronic and social media.
The DMO imposed a Rs50,000 fine on him, saying the matter would be referred to the ECP on failure of payment.
The same fine was imposed on Shehryar for failure to provide a reply to Sanaullah’s participation in his election campaign.</p><small>2025-11-21 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/211708508da479c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956506/fo-says-ex-pm-hasinas-death-sentence-internal-matter-bangladesh-fully-capable-of-addressing-own-issues' target='_blank'><strong>FO says ex-PM Hasina’s death sentence ‘internal matter’, Bangladesh ‘fully capable’ of addressing own issues</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Friday said that the recent death sentence for former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina was an “internal matter” for the country and that its people were fully capable of solving their own issues.
A Bangladesh court had sentenced Hasina to death on Monday, concluding a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year.
The ruling came months ahead of parliamentary elections expected to be held in early February.
Addressing his weekly press briefing today, Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said several queries were received regarding the development, on which he said: “This is an internal matter of Bangladesh. The people of Bangladesh are fully capable of addressing their issues in accordance with their own democratic and constitutional processes.”
 


Hasina was found guilty of ordering lethal force by a tribunal in the capital Dhaka, 15 months after resigning and fleeing to India in the face of a student-led uprising that killed hundreds or more.
 
 

The verdict by the International Crimes Tribunal — a court that Hasina set up to try war crimes from Bangladesh’s 1971 war for independence from Pakistan — marked a dramatic turn for a political career that began when she avoided death during the 1975 coup because she happened to be in Europe.
After the sentence was handed down, the Bangladesh government had told India that failure to return her would be a highly unfriendly gesture and an affront to justice.
“Under the existing extradition treaty between the two nations, this is a binding obligation for India,” Bangladesh’s foreign ministry had said in a statement.
But all previous efforts so far to persuade New Delhi to send her back have faltered.
New Delhi said it was committed to “the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country. We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end”.
The development also came amid a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
FO condemns targeting of Kashmiris in wake of Delhi blast
Andrabi issued a statement condemning the recent wave of arbitrary arrests and detention of people in India-occupied Kashmir after a bomb blast in New Delhi.
“Pakistan remains gravely concerned about the persistent and serious human rights situation in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.
“The prevailing policies, marked by widespread detentions, arbitrary arrests, and extensive restrictions on fundamental freedoms, continue to amount to collective punishment of the occupied Kashmiri population.”
Andrabi added that reports of Kashmiri youth being profiled based on their identity and faith “further heighten these concerns”.
“India continues its efforts to alter the demographic character of the occupied territory and to erode the religious, cultural, and social heritage of the Kashmiri people,” the statement added.
“These measures appear to form part of a deliberate strategy to suppress the legitimate aspirations of the Kashmiri population.”
Andrabi added that thousands of Kashmiri youths remain missing, while political representatives remain in custody. He said that these actions cannot undermine the Kashmiri people’s “enduring commitment to realising their internationally recognised right to self-determination”.
“Pakistan calls upon the international community, including the United Nations, the Human Rights Council and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, to take full cognisance of the grave human rights situation in IIOJK,” the statement read.
The FO requested that international bodies urge India to take immediate remedial measures, ensure accountability for documented violations and allow international human rights organisations to conduct independent and impartial assessments.
“A just, peaceful, and lasting resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, remains essential for durable peace and stability in South Asia,” the statement concluded.</p><small>2025-11-21 17:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/212149460dc3392.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956521/13-terrorists-killed-by-security-forces-during-operations-in-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>13 terrorists killed by security forces during operations in KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 13 terrorists during two separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Friday.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in the statement that a joint intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in the Pahar Khel area of Lakki Marwat district, conducted by security forces and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, ten khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement read.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)
The CTD said in their statement earlier today that two key commanders were among the terrorists killed in the IBO, which was launched at 7:30am.
“During the operation, 10 terrorists were killed, including two key commanders of the Teepo Gul group: Commander Niaz Ali, known as Akasha and Commander Abdullah, known as Shipunkoi,” the CTD said, adding that five terrorists were wounded, and one facilitator was arrested in the IBO.
In a separate IBO conducted in Dera Ismail Khan district, three terrorists were killed by security forces, according to ISPR.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from [the] killed Indian sponsored khawarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians,” the military’s media wing said.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as [the] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
Earlier this week, the ISPR said that 38 terrorists were killed in four separate IBOs conducted over a period of three days in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in terror incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-21 16:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/21202843b34139f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956517/police-detain-protesters-heading-to-karachi-press-club-for-ttaps-protest-against-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Police detain protesters heading to Karachi Press Club for TTAP’s protest against 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi police on Friday detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the venue of a scheduled protest by the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), held as part of countrywide demonstrations against the recently passed 27th Constitutional Amendment.
All roads leading to the Karachi Press Club (KPC) were closed by the police after buses and other heavy vehicles were parked to block access. Contingents of female police personnel were also deployed.
Some protesters were detained as they attempted to reach KPC. PTI Sindh spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar told Dawn that “more than two dozen protesters” were detained near the KPC.
 






Also detained was civil society activist Alifya Sohail, not part of the TTAP protest, who was initially taken to the Artillery Maidan Police Station, where her phone was taken from her and she was not permitted to contact anyone.
She was subsequently moved to the Women Police Station situated on Sharae Faisal.
 






No case was registered against her, nor was there any written complaint against her.
Sohail has been consistently covering civil society protests, enforced disappearances and activities of rights group Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) in Karachi for several years.
 






Journalists and human rights activists called her arrest a serious attack on press freedom and demanded her immediate release.
The police claimed later in the day that all detainees were released.
 






Tehrik-i-Numandagi Awam protest
The protest organised by the Tehrik-i-Numandagi Awam brought together civil society members, grassroots activists, and lawyers who collectively condemned and rejected the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
It marked the launch of the platform, which is “a national movement formed to restore the Constitution, defend fundamental rights and re-establish the people’s mandate,” as per a press release issued by the group.
It was held amid heavy police deployment outside the KPC, where contingents of police could be seen carrying batons.
Lahore-based academic Dr Ammar Ali Jan, speaking to Dawn, assailed the 27th Amendment, calling it an “affront” to democracy.
Jan stressed that the “Constitution is a contract between the people and the state,” noting that with the passing of the 27th Amendment, the state was blocking all avenues of “resistance to the system”.
“Where would a common person go to get justice when you block all legal paths?” he questioned.
Decrying the amendment, one of the participants, Samrina Hashmi, expressed her frustration over the current state of affairs while speaking to Dawn.
“I am 65 years old. I am so frustrated. When will I see my country flourish? We have been fighting all our lives against martial law, dictatorship. It seems we are going back to 1958,” she remarked, in an apparent reference to the military coup staged by General Ayub Khan in 1958.
Organiser Riaz Ahmed told Dawn that the amendment was a “question mark on the state of our judiciary”.
He called for the annulment of the 26th and the 27th amendments.
On the matter of resistance against the amendment, Ahmed told Dawn that “there was solid momentum” building against it.</p><small>2025-11-21 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/21185617817f4f1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956513/abeyance-of-indus-waters-treaty-presents-real-threat-to-regional-stability-dar-tells-eu' target='_blank'><strong>Abeyance of Indus Waters Treaty presents ‘real threat’ to regional stability, Dar tells EU</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday reiterated that the “illegal and unilateral” step to hold the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) in abeyance is a “real threat” to regional stability while addressing the Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum Roundtable in Brussels.
India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
Speaking at the EU forum in Belgium’s capital today, Dar emphasised that water must be a source of cooperation “and not weaponised for politics”.
“We believe that durable peace in South Asia cannot be achieved without a peaceful resolution of decades-old Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and aspirations of Kashmiri people,” Dar said.
On the subject of Afghanistan, the foreign minister said the country “remains a consequential relationship for Pakistan and the regional stability”.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have also come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism.
“We desire a peaceful, stable, friendly, connected, and prosperous Afghanistan. We urge the Afghan Taliban regime to act responsibly, honour their commitments, and work towards rooting out terrorism from its soil,” Dar restated.
With reference to Israel and Gaza, DPM said the situation in the Middle East “impacts us all directly”.
“Pakistan commends efforts of President Trump, along with eight Arab Islamic countries, including Pakistan, leading to the signing of the peace agreement in Sharm el-Sheikh, heralding a ceasefire,” he said.
“The ongoing atrocities in Gaza and violations of the peace agreement must end, as well as the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands,” he added.
“Our foreign policy is grounded in the criticality of a credible, time-bound political process consistent with relevant [UNSC] resolutions, leading to the establishment of an independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital,” Dar stressed.
The foreign minister also spoke on the conflict in Ukraine, which he pointed out has disrupted energy and food markets, “with real consequences for people around the globe”.
He said that Islamabad’s position on the conflict is anchored in the UN Charter. “We hope for a peaceful resolution of this conflict at the earliest. The model of cooperation adopted by the [EU] offers many lessons for the international community, proving that inclusivity and interdependence are the surest foundations of peace and prosperity.”</p><small>2025-11-21 16:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/21113858ad4369b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956429/at-least-19-killed-several-injured-in-gas-explosion-at-faisalabad-factory-police-arrest-owner' target='_blank'><strong>At least 19 killed, several injured in gas explosion at Faisalabad factory; police arrest owner</strong></a><br><p>At least 19 people were killed and several others injured on Friday as a result of a gas explosion at a factory near Faisalabad’s Malikpur area, with the owner arrested later in the day as well.
An initial statement by Rescue 1122 said the incident took place early in the morning after the boiler of the factory exploded, causing the collapse of the building and nearby structures.
However, the rescue service later attributed the explosion to a gas leak, which was also confirmed in the statement issued by Faisalabad Commissioner Raja Jahangir Anwar’s office.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered on the state’s behalf by the police and mentioned 20 dead, with 19 named victims, and seven injured.
City police spokesperson Muhammad Tariq confirmed to Dawn that the Mansoorabad police had arrested the factory owner.
The statement by the commissioner’s office said no boiler was present in the factory, adding that four factories were operating in the Malikpur area. “A fire erupted in one of the factories due to gas leakage and engulfed the other factories as well.”
Seven houses in the area were also affected, the statement said. According to Rescue 1122, the explosion caused the roof of the factory and those of adjacent houses to collapse.
The statement by the commissioner’s office said that 17 bodies were pulled out from the rubble.
It said the injured were taken to Allied Hospital, and three were discharged after first aid while three were admitted to the burn unit.
It added that a five-member inquiry team was being constituted to probe the incident.
The statement said that the rescue operation at the site had been completed and the clearance process was under way. The situation was being monitored, it added, further quoting Commissioner Raja saying that “we share the grief of the heirs of those killed in this unfortunate accident”.
An earlier statement by Rescue 1122 detailed the rescue operation at the glue factory, saying that it was carried out under the supervision of the district emergency officer, and more than 20 ambulances and fire tenders took part in it.
It also said that the Faisalabad Control Room had received a call about the explosion at the glue factory at 5:28am.
Videos of the rescue work shared by Rescue 1122 showed workers combing through the rubble of buildings and looking for survivors.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz expressed grief over the loss of lives in the incident, a statement issued by her office said. It said she extended condolences to the bereaved families and sought a report on the incident from the Faisalabad commissioner.
Meanwhile, Punjab Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar had directed that Rescue 1122, the fire brigade and all related agencies be provided full support.
In a statement, he said that police officers and officials should continue rescue operations to find people buried underneath the rubble. He also directed traffic police to ensure easy access to the site of the incident for ambulances and other rescue vehicles.
National Trade Union Federation (NTUF) Secretary General Nasir Mansoor expressed concern over the “tragic deaths of labourers” in the incident and expressed solidarity with their families, a press release issued by the labour organisation said.
It quoted Mansoor as saying: “Factories have turned into death [traps] for labourers and industrialists are doling out death certificates.” He further accused governments and the labour department of “criminal negligence”.
“The Punjab government is directly responsible for the labourers’ death,” he said, according to the press release.
The NTUF stressed that safe working conditions should be prioritised and demanded Rs3 million be given in compensation to the family of each labourer killed in the incident. The organisation also called for the provision of complete and free medical treatment for the injured.
Last year in April, a dozen workers were injured in a steam boiler explosion at a textile mill in Faisalabad. Rescue 1122 reported that as a result of the blast, not only did fire break out in the factory, but the roof of a hall also caved in.
FIR
The FIR was registered at the Mansoorabad Police Station on the complaint of Sub-Inspector (SI) Ehtesham Abbas under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of a common object), 302 (premeditated murder), 324 (attempt to murder), 336B (causing hurt by use of corrosive substance) and 440 of the Pakistan Penal Code; Sections 3 (punishment for causing explosion likely to endanger life or property) and 4 (punishment for attempt to cause explosion or for making or keeping explosive with intent to endanger life or property) of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
SI Abbas said he reached the spot and contacted the rescue teams to save people, requesting help from locals to aid the operation as well.
It said that the owner of the factory, the factory manager and the employees used dangerous chemicals and flammable substances in containers, due to which there was fear among locals who had also previously raised complaints to no avail.
“Many deaths have occurred due to the explosion of containers filled with these same dangerous chemicals and flammable substances,” the FIR said, naming 19 people and one unknown person among the dead, while seven were injured.

“In case of illegal disappearance, departmental action will be initiated against the flight attendant,” Khan said.
Missing PIA crew members, particularly in Canada, have been reported in the past, too.
Last year in October, a cabin crew member was reportedly gone missing while on duty. The missing crew member, based in Islamabad, had disappeared during a layover in Toronto.
Similarly, a 47-year-old PIA steward was reportedly gone missing in Canada in March 2024.
In February 2024, another member of the airline’s cabin crew was reported missing while on duty. The member had arrived in Toronto on PIA flight PK-782 from Islamabad but failed to report for duty on the return flight, PK-784 to Karachi.</p><small>2025-11-21 15:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2119515250e49a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956519/ozempic-wegovy-users-who-suffered-vision-loss-compensated-by-danish-govt' target='_blank'><strong>Ozempic, Wegovy users who suffered vision loss compensated by Danish govt</strong></a><br><p>Four people in Denmark who developed serious eye conditions after using popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic are entitled to compensation, an independent body ruled on Friday.
More than 40 people had sought reimbursement after they said they had developed a serious eye condition as a result of using one of the drugs, both made by Novo Nordisk, according to the Danish Patient Compensation Association.
The condition, NAION (non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy), is a lack of blood supply to the optic nerve, which can lead to a loss of vision.
The association said that it had ruled on five cases so far, and found four people who merited compensation.
“It’s unfortunate for the patients who have been affected by the side effect. NAION is a serious condition that causes permanent and incurable damage to vision,” the association’s director, Karen-Inger Bast, said in a statement.
Bast added that the cases were difficult to assess, given that it was a new medicine and the patients were already at increased risk of developing NAION.
In total, the four patients would receive 800,000 kroner ($123,000), but the association noted that the amount could increase depending on the impact the condition could have on their lives going forward, for instance, if it affects their ability to work.
Medical compensation in Denmark is generally paid out by health authorities.
Last year, the Danish Medicines Agency asked a European medical watchdog to review a Danish study that showed a link between semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — and NAION.
In June, that watchdog — the PRAC (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee) — concluded that NAION was a “very rare” side effect of semaglutide, affecting up to 1 in 10,000 users.
Novo Nordisk said it had reviewed the decision by the Danish Patient Compensation. In a statement sent to AFP, the drugmaker noted that following PRAC’s findings, patient leaflets for all semaglutide products had been updated to include NAION as a “very rare” reaction to the drugs.
But it said the “benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains favourable”.</p><small>2025-11-21 14:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/211939507d5b897.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956515/south-africa-accepts-huge-rate-of-violence-against-women-is-national-disaster' target='_blank'><strong>South Africa accepts huge rate of violence against women is national disaster</strong></a><br><p>South Africa said on Friday the rate of violence against women in the country was a national disaster, as thousands protested to highlight the problem ahead of this weekend’s G20 summit of world leaders.

The country has one of the world’s highest rates of gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF), leading to deaths five times higher than the global average, according to the United Nations’s gender equality organisation UN Women.

In one of dozens of “lie-in” protests countrywide, thousands of people dressed in black lay on the ground for 15 minutes at an event in Johannesburg’s city centre, just a few kilometres (miles) from the venue where G20 leaders will meet on Saturday and Sunday.

Organisers said the action was to honour the 15 women murdered every day in South Africa.

A 2022 government survey found that one in three South African women had experienced physical violence, and almost 10 per cent had faced sexual violence.

More than 10,700 cases of rape were reported to police in the first three months of 2025, but the real numbers are expected to be much higher.

“I’m here standing for not only myself but my younger sisters, my siblings and every woman in South Africa,” said one of the protesters, 23-year-old Lefika Jonathan.

The government’s disaster management said that after evaluating the “persistent and immediate life-safety risks posed by ongoing acts of violence”, it had concluded that GBVF met the “threshold of a potential disaster”.

This made the issue a priority for the executive branch of government and “all organs of state”, it said.

“All we want is justice,” said another protester, 19-year-old student Nomhle Porogo.

She hoped the timing of the protest meant “those in higher positions can hear our cries”. But she was unimpressed by the decision to wait until South Africa was in the international spotlight to classify the problem a disaster – a longstanding demand from women’s rights groups.

“For them to declare it a national disaster when it suits them and in front of our visitors because they want to make our house look clean for visitors…is an injustice,” she told AFP.</p><small>2025-11-21 14:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/21192810fb25be8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956516/newly-formed-ajk-cabinet-assigned-portfolios-by-pm-rathore' target='_blank'><strong>Newly formed AJK cabinet assigned portfolios by PM Rathore</strong></a><br><p>Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore on Friday allocated portfolios to his 18 ministers and two advisers, two days after the formation of his cabinet.
According to an official notification, the senior-most minister, Mian Abdul Waheed, retained the department of law, justice, parliamentary affairs and human rights, which he had also held in the previous coalition government.
Sardar Javed Ayoub was assigned forests, wildlife, fisheries and the Muzaffarabad Development Authority; Syed Bazil Ali Naqvi was given health and population welfare; Javed Iqbal Budhanvi received food; and Nabila Ayoub was allocated the portfolio of the Kashmir cause, arts and languages.
The portfolios of works and communications (C&W), local government and rural development and finance and inland revenue also went to the PPP loyalists, Sardar Ziaul Qamar, Chaudhry Amar Yasin and Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, respectively.
Yasin is the son of PPP AJK President Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, who was overlooked for the office of prime minister in the recent change.
Most recent entrants to the PPP retained the portfolios they had held in the Chaudhry Anwarul Haq–led coalition government.

Deevan Ali Chughtai — elementary and secondary education
Malik Zafar Iqbal — higher education
Chaudhry Arshad — energy and water resources
Chaudhry Muhammad Rasheed — Power Development Organisation
Yasir Sultan — physical planning and housing
Chaudhry Akhlaq —revenue, stamps and evacuee property
Faheem Akhtar Rabbani — tourism and archaeology

Arshad and Sultan are the brother-in-law and son, respectively, of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood.
Sardar Muhammad Hussain, a new entrant into the PPP who previously held population welfare, was assigned social welfare, women development, zakat and usher.
Muhammad Rafique Nayyar and Chaudhry Ali Shan Soni — who were not part of the previous coalition setup — were allotted religious affairs and auqaf and agriculture, animal husbandry, irrigation, dairy development and small dams, respectively. Both had joined the PPP slightly earlier than the other newcomers.
Among the advisers, Fahad Yaqoob was given trade and industry, labour, sericulture and the Government Printing Press, while Sardar Ahmad Saghir received sports, youth and culture.
Yaqoob is the son of senior PPP legislator and former president Haji Yaqoob Khan, while Saghir — who had also served as adviser in the Mr Haq–led government — is the son of MLA Shahida Saghir, who recently joined the PPP.
Contrary to speculation that the information department would go to Nayyar, the prime minister retained the portfolio with himself.
Rathore was sworn in as the 16th prime minister of AJK on Tuesday.
The oath-taking ceremony was held a day after PPP’s Rathore was announced as the new AJK premier after Chaudhry Anwarul Haq was ousted through a vote of no-confidence (VoNC) in the region’s legislative assembly.
The oath was administered by AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar at the President’s House in Muzaffarabad. The speaker performed the duty on behalf of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood, who reportedly could not travel to the regional capital owing to his health issues.</p><small>2025-11-21 14:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2118105401694cc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956514/karachi-residents-face-acute-water-shortage-amid-frequent-ke-power-failures' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi residents face acute water shortage amid frequent KE power failures</strong></a><br><p>Karachi’s residents continued to face a worsening water crisis on Friday due to repeated electricity outages by K-Electric (KE), which have disrupted the city’s water pumping operations
According to the spokesperson for the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), the city’s crucial K-3 pumping station experienced a major electric breakdown late last night, and the fault had yet to be resolved.
The spokesperson said the station had also faced a significant breakdown on Tuesday, with electricity restored only a day ago after a 41-hour delay.
Just hours later, the electric cable fault reappeared, forcing the station to shut down again. The station had been temporarily shut down on Monday to fix technical issues, but problems persisted.
The breakdowns have caused an estimated total loss of 335 million gallons of water, severely affecting the supply across Karachi. Areas such as North Nazimabad, Gulberg Town, Gulistan-i-Johar, Scheme 33, various blocks of Gulshan-e-Iqbal, New Karachi, Saddar and Clifton are among those experiencing severe shortages.
Earlier incidents at the Dhabeji pumping station on November 5, 11, 13 and 15 due to cable faults also resulted in prolonged electricity interruptions and worsened the city’s water shortage.
KWSC officials stated that despite all administrative and technical efforts, the lack of consistent electricity supply continued to impact pumping operations.
They urged KE management to prioritise the immediate and stable restoration of power to pumping stations to ensure that the water supply to Karachi was quickly normalised.</p><small>2025-11-21 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/211618423f1526e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956498/7-killed-in-attack-on-peace-committee-office-in-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>7 killed in attack on peace committee office in Bannu</strong></a><br><p>Seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district, police said on Friday.
Police officials told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Talib’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives.
In their complaint to the police, the victims’ family has maintained that the attack was a result of a family feud. However, police say the family has taken the stance to avoid another potential attack carried out in retaliation.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Havaid police station under Sections 302 (punishment for intentional murder), 324 (attempt of intentional murder), 149 (every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common objective) and 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The FIR said that the suspects barged into the victims’ baithak (guesthouse), opened fire on them and fled. Three suspects were nominated in the FIR, which said they were accompanied by other armed men and led by a terrorist commander.
According to the complainant, named Abdullah, there was enmity between his family and the suspects over the matter of a murder.
Peace committees, or village defence committees, were formed to assist law enforcement agencies in defending KP areas against terror attacks. These also include former militants, often referred to as ‘good Taliban’.
Peace committee officials in KP have been targeted by terrorists in the past as well.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “strongly condemned” today’s attack, state-run APP reported.
The prime minister expressed “deep grief and sorrow” over the loss of precious lives in the attack, which he said was carried out by “Fitna-al-Khawarij”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term designated by the state for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP).
APP, citing an official statement, reported that PM Shehbaz prayed for the “elevation of ranks of the departed souls in jannah (paradise) and for patience for their families”.
He directed relevant authorities to identify those responsible and ensure they received due punishment, the report said.
“Such cowardly acts, aimed at sabotaging peace efforts, expose the evil intentions of the Fitna-al-Khawarij to create unrest in Pakistan. These cowardly actions cannot, at any cost, weaken the resolve of the people.
“The entire nation stands united to defeat anti-state elements,” the statement quoted him as saying.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack “carried out by *Fitna-al-Khawarij”,* a statement issued by his office said.
“He expressed deep sorrow over the loss of life in the attack,” the statement said, adding that he also extended condolences to the bereaved families.
The statement quoted him as saying: “This cowardly attack of terrorism is a nefarious attempt to undermine peace and stability. Such cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken the high morale of the people. The state and the nation are standing united against enemies of peace.”</p><small>2025-11-21 13:30</small></div><hr>
