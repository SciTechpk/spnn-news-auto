Several Indian media outlets quoted official sources on Wednesday as saying that Mr Modi would visit China for the summit, which was planned ahead of the rising tensions with the US.
In response to Indian media reports, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Friday that China welcomed Indian Prime Minister Modi to the SCO summit at Tianjin.
“We believe that with the concerted effort of all parties, the Tianjin summit will be a gathering of solidarity, friendship and fruitful results, and the SCO will enter a new stage of high-quality development featuring greater solidarity, coordination, dynamism and productiveness.”
Guo was quoted by the Global Times, a Chinese newspaper seen as close to the Communist Party, as saying that leaders of over 20 countries, including all member states of the SCO and heads of 10 international organisations, would attend “relevant events”.
The SCO summit will be the largest gathering in scale since the establishment of the SCO, he added.
On Wednesday, India Today and several other media outlets reported that Mr Modi plans to attend the SCO summit in Tianjin.
“If the visit materialises, it will mark the Indian prime minister’s first trip to China in seven years. Although the news has not yet been confirmed by the official authorities of China and India, it has drawn widespread attention from the international community as soon as it was released,” Global Times said in a commentary.
It quoted US magazine The Diplomat as commenting that “the trend in the past decade has seen the two neighbours embracing each other and then falling out … the time has come again for them to explore yet another round of engagement”.
Together, China and India account for over one-third of the world’s population, and both economies and their global influence are on the rise.
“At this crucial juncture, the trajectory of China-India relations carries even more reasons to capture global attention,” the Global Times said.
“Observers have noted that despite lingering differences and disputes between China and India, there have been signs of warming in their bilateral relations.”
Following the 2020 border clash, China-India relations went through a long period of frostiness, severely impacting political trust, economic ties and people-to-people exchanges.
Fresh restart
In October last year, the successful meeting between the Chinese and Indian leaders in Kazan set the tone for a fresh restart in bilateral relations. At all levels, both countries have been upholding the important consensus reached by the two leaders — namely, that “China and India are each other’s development opportunity rather than threat, and cooperation partner rather than competitor”.
Anchoring on development as the greatest “common denominator”, the two sides have continued to meet half way and maintain the momentum of progress.
Since June, India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar have visited China.
Currently, various previously suspended bilateral mechanisms are being resumed or are in the process of restarting, the Chinese newspaper said.
 
 

“Both sides have also vowed to not let the border issue become an obstacle to overall bilateral relations. In the area of people-to-people exchanges, the resumption of Indian pilgrimages to Mount Gang Rinpoche and Lake Mapam Yun Tso, in south-west China’s Xizang autonomous region, as well as the reinstatement of tourist visa issuance for Chinese citizens travelling to India, have all sent out positive signals.
“Both sides also hope to seize the opportunity of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties to achieve greater progress in China-India relations.
“If Modi visits China this time, it will present another favourable opportunity to consolidate the positive momentum in China-India relations,” the newspaper said.

Following the CCD raid, the MPA, who is also the parliamentary secretary in Punjab, called the police emergency helpline “15” and lodged a report against the CCD in-charge, the SHO and others.
According to sources, after the raid, matters took a turn as the MPA openly came out in defence of his employees.
The MPA claimed that the CCD raided his farmhouse with 30 officials in police uniform and 15 in plain clothes. He said four office boys were present in the house, while two other persons were at the gate.
The MPA alleged that CCD officials tortured Hamza, took cash, and took away three employees from the house.
Meanwhile, the SHO Chontra and the duty officer reached the spot after receiving the police emergency call. Official sources said the CCD team conducted the raid to arrest a highly wanted suspect in a kidnapping case involving the making of an objectionable video, which had been registered against him by a private citizen.
They added that the matter was brought to the notice of the MPA, and he was asked to surrender or present his farmhouse in-charge to the police, as a case had been registered against him under the Anti-Terrorism Act.
 
 

However, the suspect was not produced or handed over, the police said.
On Friday, the MPA’s spokesperson issued a statement along with videos of the raid, saying the CCD raided the farmhouse without conducting any investigation.
“Entering the house of any citizen without investigation and without reason is hooliganism and mischief. We reject the illegal and immoral activities of the CCD,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson further alleged that the CCD staged the raid to gain cheap publicity. He said guards from registered companies were deployed on security duty at the farmhouse, and looting cash under the pretext of a search amounted to robbery.
Later, the MPA filed a formal complaint with Regional Police Officer Babar Sarfraz Alpa, claiming that CCD officials had taken away Rs50 million from his farmhouse.

The neighbours have been at loggerheads since a terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam sparked a brief war and saw the cricketing relations between the two nations nose-dive.
Recently, two World Championship of Legends fixtures between the two countries were called off as the India Champions players decided not to play against their Pakistan counterparts.
The Asia Cup was originally scheduled to be staged in India but was shifted to the UAE due to tensions between the two countries.
India and Pakistan have been drawn in the same group at the Asia Cup. With a Super Four phase and a final to follow, it is possible they could face each other three times in Dubai between September 14 and 28.
 
 

And with just over a month remaining before the start of the tournament, ECB Chief Operating Officer Subhan Ahmed has suggested that it is highly unlikely that the two teams would avoid playing each other in the Asia Cup.
“We can’t make any guarantees, but comparing the Asia Cup against a private event like the WCL is not a like comparison,” Subhan was quoted as saying by The National newspaper.
“When decisions to play in the Asia Cup are taken, government permissions are taken in advance. That has definitely been done before arriving at the decision of announcing the schedule for the countries. So hopefully we won’t be in a situation as there was at the WCL.”

Nawaz and Hussain Talat formed a sixth-wicket partnership of 104 not out to rally the visitors in the day-night affair, with game two on Sunday and the concluder on Tuesday.
West Indies went 280 all out with Evin Lewis leading the way on 60 from 62 balls with three sixes and five fours while Shai Hope added 55 and Roston Chase contributed 53.
Needing 281 to win, Pakistan got 53 runs from Mohammad Rizwan before he was bowled lbw by Shamar Joseph in the 38th over with the visitors still 101 runs shy of victory, setting the stage for heroics by Nawaz and Talat.
Nawaz struck for six on the second ball of the 49th over and blasted the winning shot to the boundary off the final delivery by Joseph, giving Pakistan the victory with seven balls to spare.
In all, Nawaz reached 63 on 54 balls with three sixes and five fours while Talat finished on 41 from 37 balls with one six and four fours.
 


Pakistan won the toss and sent the hosts in to bat first, a choice that paid quick dividends when Brandon King was taken for four on the fifth ball of the opening over, bowled by Shaheen Shah Afridi — his first of four wickets — and caught by Babar Azam off stump.
Lewis exited on the last ball of the 19th over, bowled by Saim Ayub and caught by Afridi.
West Indies captain Hope was bowled by Afridi and caught by Rizwan on the second ball of the 41st over, leaving the hosts on 200 for five.
Romario Shepherd was sent off on four on the last ball of the 43rd over.
Chase made the third half-century for the West Indies with a boundary but went out on the next ball, caught by Azam and bowled by Naseem Shah, who also bowled out Gudakesh Motie and Jediah Blades on the last two Pakistan deliveries.

“After instituting applications for the termination of the plea bargain (deal appr­o­­ved in August 2020) betw­een Zain Malik and NAB, the references against the accused have been reverted to the preliminary  stage,” observed Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, a member of the  three-judge SC bench that had taken up the appeal against the Aug 4  short order of the Islamabad High Court.
As the IHC in its short order allowed NAB to go ahead with the auction of the six attached properties, the anti-graft watchdog sold one property and received conditional bids for two other properties, at a combined value of Rs2.27 billion.
However, the auction of three remaining properties was shelved for want of qualifying bids.

Three-member bench to hear Bahria Town appeal on regular basis from 13th

The SC decided that the appeals by Bahria Town would be fixed before any available three-judge bench of the apex court for regular hearing from Aug 13.
 
 

In its appeal, the Bahria Town contended that the IHC short order of dismissing its plea against the auction was bad in law and facts as it suffered from misreading and non-reading of the record and applicable legal provisions.
Both the Aug 4 order of the high court and the May 23 order of the accountability court were without lawful jurisdiction and in blatant violation of Section 88 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which does not authorise attachment of properties belonging to third parties, the SC was apprised.
The appellant argued that the IHC and the accountability court also failed to distinguish between the assets of the accused and those owned by a separate and independent juristic entity.

• Observers say others may take advantage if largest opposition party chooses to ‘sit out’ race for coveted offices
 

Omar Ayub

THE announcement by the custodians of both houses of the parliament — declaring the offices of opposition leaders vacant — and the PTI’s apparent decision to not nominate any other party member for the two coveted parliamentary posts, could lead to another political crisis.
Political observers believe that it will be another “strategic and political mistake” by the PTI if it doesn’t nominate new opposition leaders in the Senate and the National Assembly, even if on a temporary basis.
They believe that a failure to fill these posts will not only provide the government an opportunity to establish a complete hold over parliament, but would also allow them carte blanche when it comes to appointments to key constitutional offices.
Hours after an official announcement from the Senate Secretariat declared the seat of Opposition Leader Shibli Faraz “vacant”, and a similar pronouncement regarding the disqualification of Omar Ayub Khan from the National Assembly, the PTI declared it would not nominate new opposition leaders and would challenge the decision in a court of law.
Following the move, Omar Ayub Khan told Dawn he would file a contempt application, as declaring his seat vacant was a clear violation of a recent Peshawar High Court (PHC) order, which had restrained the ECP from proceeding with his disqualification.
 
 

“They cannot invite names for the leaders of the opposition in both houses because the PHC has clearly ordered that such a step cannot be taken. Moreover, other opposition parties do not have [the] strength to get an opposition leader elected. As the PTI is the largest opposition party in both houses, it cannot be deprived of [the right to have its] opposition leaders,” he explained.
Similarly, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser termed the development “disappointing”, saying that it betrayed haste on the government’s part.
“Currently, there is a sham democracy in the country… the government can do anything,” Mr Qaiser said sarcastically when asked what the party would do if the speaker nominated someone from, say, the JUI-F — the second largest opposition party in both houses.
According to Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, who heads the Pakistan Institute for Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), there is no timeframe specified for the election of the opposition leader, but the assembly rules suggested that he/she should be nominated as soon as possible, as they are assigned certain key constitutional functions, including consultation over the names of the next chief election commissioner, and members of the ECP.
 

Shibli Faraz

“A vacancy in the office will impair parliamentary work as the leader of opposition has to represent the opposition in the Business Advisory Committee, which decides daily priorities and schedule of parliamentary business,” he said.
“A lack of the opposition representation in this important committee will negatively impact the quality of parliamentary proceedings,” Mr Mehboob noted.
According to the rules, the speaker is supposed to fix a date by which members of the opposition have to submit the name of the leader of the opposition along with their signatures.
The speaker, after verifying the signatures, will declare the member who has the greatest numerical strength as opposition leader, he said.
“Irrespective of the validity of the conviction and disqualification of the leaders of opposition, their offices should be filled as soon as possible,” he said.
The PTI, he said, should join this exercise, because even “if it doesn’t join, the remaining opposition members will submit the name and someone will be appointed as opposition leader.”
 
 

He said the PTI should not forget how the government had previously managed to appoint a friendly opposition leader Raja Riaz.
Talking to Dawn, Mudassar Rizvi of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) recalled that during the 2014 sit-in outside parliament, PTI MNAs had resigned en masse — a decision that put them at a disadvantage.
Even after the disqualification of its legislators, the PTI was still the largest party in both houses, he said, and should therefore keep the opposition leader offices to maintain its strength.
Anything else would be a “political blunder”, and some other party could get its hand on all the important positions, despite having less representation than the PTI.
Senior journalist MB Soomro, who has been covering parliamentary proceedings for over two decades, also termed the present situation “alarming”, and pointed out that the country’s largest legislature, the Punjab Assembly, was also without an opposition leader after the disqualification of Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar.
He recalled how Maulana Fazlur Rehman was nominated opposition leader in the NA during the Mushar­raf regime, even though the combi­ned strength of the PPP and PML-N — who were part of the Alliance for Restoration of Demo­cracy at the time — was greater than the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal alliance.
At the time, he said, the speaker had used his discretionary power to nominate the opposition leader.
Since then, however, the rules have changed, and if such a situation arises again, it would be an “unethical move”, even if it is constitutionally valid.
Given the party position in the assemblies, Mr Soomro said the PTI could easily retain these offices in both houses of the parliament, provided it joined the race. The JUI-F only has 10 MNAs and seven senators, so there seems to be no justification to hand the party these key offices in the present scenario.
In his view, the PTI should put forward nominations for these offices. If the grapevine is to be believed, he said, the name of PkMAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai was already being whispered as a potential replacement for Omar Ayub in the National Assembly.

The weeklong trekking is part of the celebrations to mark the first successful ascent to the peak 75 years ago. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Culture and Tourism Authority (KPCTA) is organising the events.
Of the women trekkers, two belong to Chitral, while the rest was drawn from all the four provinces of Pakistan and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Fauzia Bibi, the board member of KPCTA, and president of tours’ operators association, Chitral, Syed Harir Shah saw the trekkers off.

A separate team of climbers plans to summit the highest peak of Hindukush range

Addressing a gathering on the occasion, Fauziz Bibi said the events would go a long way in inculcating in people of Chitral the passion of mountaineering.
She said the initiative would also attract foreign and national mountaineers to Terich Mir and its neighbouring 7,000-metre plus peaks to promote ecotourism.
The group will reach Shagrom, the last village of Terich Valley, before starting the trekking expedition formally towards the base camp situated at an altitude of 5,500 metres.
 






On Wednesday, an expedition of Pakistani climbers had also left Chitral city to the peak, which is also known as ‘roof of Chitral’.
The team consisted of Sarbaz Khan and Sherzad Karim from GB, Akmal Naveed and Shamsul Qamar from Chitral, Umar Arshad Khan, Major Atif of Pakistan Army, and Dr Naveed.
Akmal Naveed, the youngest member of the team, told Dawn that history was being created as it was for the first time that Pakistani climbers were trying to summit the highest peak of Hindukush.
Omar Arshad Khan, director KPCTA and a member of the team, said for the first time, the provincial government had taken a major step to promote adventure tourism.
He said on the instructions of the chief minister, helicopters would be kept on stand-by at the Chitral Airport to provide rescue services promptly and timely in case of an emergency.
“Special mountaineering equipment for the expedition has been purchased from Nepal and China, which will be available to the climbers in future,” he said.
“No matter whether the mission remains successful or not, its main objective is to promote mountaineering in Chitral and make the local people well conversant with climbing,” he said.
Arshad Khan said earlier, two groups had successfully returned after trekking to the Trich Mir base camp.
Chitral assistant commissioner Mohammad Aftab Munir said it was a milestone in the history of ecotourism of Chitral as the expedition of local people would pave the way for major achievements in the field and promote tourism.
He said potential of tourism would be exploited to its full in the aftermath of the celebrations.

The seventh session of negotiation between Jirga members and TTP leaders was held on Friday. Sources claimed that the terrorists, living among civilian population in Bajaur tribal district, were involved in sabotage and other crimes.
They said that the chief minister and security officials asked tribal elders to expel foreign terrorists, mostly Afghans, or vacate the area for one or two days for an operation against terrorists.
While promising the continuation of operation against terrorists “at all costs,” the chief minister and security officials called for efforts to minimise collateral damage.
Security sources said the government’s direct talks with terrorists or their facilitators was out of the question until the latter surrendered. They said the ongoing tribal jirga was a logical step to ensure the maximum public safety ahead of any action.
 
 

The sources, however, said both the state and residents were opposed to any compromise with terrorists. They said that the authority to conduct armed operations against terrorists rested with the state.
Meanwhile, the seventh round of talks between Bajaur Amn Jirga members and terrorist leaders concluded in Lowi Mamund tehsil here on Friday evening.
Jirga head Sahibzada Haroon Rashid didn’t update the media about the outcome of the negotiations. However, there is a high likelihood of the Jirga sharing “new developments” with the media shortly.

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told reporters that Trump signed separate deals with both Armenia and Azerbaijan on energy, technology, economic cooperation, border security, infrastructure and trade. No further details were provided.
The agreement includes exclusive US development rights to a strategic transit corridor through the South Caucasus, dubbed the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity.”
US officials said the agreement was hammered out during repeated visits to the region and would provide a basis for working toward a full normalisation between the countries.
Neither the joint declaration due to be signed nor the separate bilateral agreements with the US were released.
 


It was not immediately clear how the deal being signed on Friday would address thorny issues such as the demarcation of shared borders and Baku’s demand for a change in Yerevan’s constitution, which includes a reference to a 1989 call for the reunification of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, then an autonomous region within Soviet Azerbaijan.
Officials briefing reporters skirted over the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh — a mountainous Azerbaijani region that had a mostly ethnic Armenian population — broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia.
 
 

Both Armenia and Azerbaijan won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Azerbaijan took back full control of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2023 in a military offensive, prompting almost all of the territory’s remaining 100,000 Armenians to flee to Armenia.
US officials highlighted the opportunities presented for both countries and US investors through creation of the new transit corridor, which will allow greater exports of energy and other resources.
“What’s going to happen here with the Trump route is, this isn’t charity. This is a highly investable entity,” said one senior administration official, adding that at least nine companies had in recent days expressed interest in operating the transit corridor, including three US firms.
Safer and prosperous
Under a carefully negotiated section of the documents signed on Friday, Armenia plans to award the US exclusive special development rights for an extended period on a transit corridor that will be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, and known by the acronym TRIPP, the officials told Reuters this week.
Trump would sign a directive to set up a negotiating team to work out details for how to operate the corridor, with initial commercial negotiations to begin next week, one of the officials said.
“The losers here are China, Russia and Iran. The winners here are the West,” one of the officials said.
 
 

“Both countries that have been in conflict for 35 years … are looking and talking about full peace with each other tomorrow.”
“It’s being done, not through force, but through commercial partnership … with these two countries,” the official said.
“The joint declaration that we’re going to see signed today is the first-ever peace declaration signed bilaterally by the two countries since the end of the Cold War.”

He was speaking at the oath-taking ceremony of the Umerkot Bar Association here on Friday.
Describing the saying: “Justice delayed is justice denied” as absolutely correct, he declared that a court failing to deliver justice serves no purpose. Mentioning the cases where justice was delayed for decades, he gave a couple of examples: “One woman waited for 71 years for a decision on her inheritance case and another person’s case relating to an accident was decided after 24 years”.
He condemned use of influence by feudals and bureaucrats and observed that some judges were compromising their integrity to appease the powerful.
Justice Panhwar said judges must act with courage, and not fear, and warned them that betraying the oath undermines public trust.

Says ‘they compromise their integrity to appease the powerful’; regrets how three bars, some judges and police backed accused in journalist Nasrullah Gadani’s murder case

Highlighting systemic corruption, he referred to the case of journalist Nasrullah Gadani’s murder, and noted that lawyers from three bars, police and even some judges defended the accused.
 
 

He criticised misuse of the Dispossession Act, meant to protect the poor, and pointed out that it was now being used to harass them.
He also pointed to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) where, he recalled, judicial decisions had led to loss of life. He wondered: “Whose judges we are … people’s or the elite’s?”
Justice Panhwar also lamented societal hypocrisy, observing that in Pakistan, people pretended to be virtuous while acting otherwise. He urged judges to engage with communities directly, saying: “We must stop isolating ourselves and see how people live.” Sharing his feelings with the audience, he remarked: “Sometimes I wonder whether we are judges or bandits”.
Touching upon social issues, he debunked claims of “forced conversions” and pointed out that 90pc of girls running away from their homes happened to be from Muslim families, and not minorities. This, however, signals a broader societal failure to protect women, he said.
 
 

He also noted a lack of shelters for the girls and women vulnerable to injustice, and said this segment is denied education and inheritance rights, particularly in marginalised communities like the scheduled castes.
While criticising judicial system’s inefficiency, he cited the example of Mirpurkhas courts which ‘disposed of’ 319 out of 320 cases within a week, and remarked that it was a ‘formality’ rather than ‘justice’. How could police deliver, he wondered.
Justice Panhwar expressed the view that upper Sindh’s ‘dacoit culture’ and lower Sindh’s ‘drug epidemic’, particularly in Umerkot district, had paralysed the system.
He revealed that one Sukkur SSP had admitted his helplessness in controlling crime, and said he responded [to his statement] by saying that “If we can’t act, we should resign and go home.”
Justice Panhwar accused the Umerkot police of focusing on extortion, instead of curbing crime. “Crime surged under a former sessions judge,” he deplored.
 
 

He said that the Cooperative Housing Society Act was meant for protecting rights of farmers and labourers, not for developing housing schemes. It was designed to empower the working class through loans and by encouraging collective forums, he added.
Justice Panhwar concluded with a warning: “Our rulers tell lies, our institutions tell lies, and people also have stopped speaking the truth. If we don’t change ourselves, then the system will collapse.”
Justice Jan Ali Junejo of Sindh High Court, Tharparkar Sessions Judge Abdul Waheed Sheikh, Umerkot Sessions Judge Abdul Qudoos  Memon, Advocate Yousif Laghari, Mir Pervez Talpur, President of the SHC Bar Association (Mirpurkhas) and Sindh Bar Council members Nand Kumar Goklani and Sher Mohammad  Wassan were among the prominent figures who attended the ceremony.

• Another piece of legislation allows 19 and 20 grade officers to be appointed as chairmen of boards, despite MQM-P’s dissent
KARACHI: In a display of cross-party harmony, the Sindh Assembly on Friday unanimously passed a bill, paving the way for a fresh framework to govern the perks and privileges of its members.
The Sindh Assembly Members (Salaries and Allowances) Bill 2025, presented by Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Zia ul Hasan Lanjar, is aimed at replacing the existing law with “a more structured approach” overseen by a newly constituted Parliamentary Committee.
Under the bill, the Speaker will establish the Parliamentary Committee through an official gazette notification.
The committee’s membership will be determined by the Speaker based on proportional representation, ensuring fair representation. The committee will be empowered to oversee and recommend MPAs’ salaries and allowances, with its recommendations binding on the government.
Under the newly passed bill, key provisions include a consolidated salary for an MPA as determined by the committee, alongside a range of allowances such as sumptuary, house rent, utilities, daily, conveyance, subsidy, accommodation, and travelling and mileage allowances.
Additionally, the Leader of Opposition will receive a salary, allowances, and privileges equivalent to those of a Provincial Minister.
Chairpersons of various parliamentary committees will be eligible for multiple allowances but are limited to using one government vehicle during their tenure, with petrol and maintenance allowances provided.
They must return the vehicle within three days of leaving office.
Meanwhile, lone Jamaat-i-Islami MPA Muhammad Farooq, who is in Saudi Arabia and not part of the PA proceedings, told Dawn his partywas against the increase in lawmakers’ salary as it would be a burden on the provincial exchequer.
He said that the current salary of an MPA is Rs152,000 and after the passage of this bill it would become Rs575,000.
Bureaucrats can head educational boards
During the session, the parliamentary affairs minister also presented the Sindh Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Anti-Terrorism Sindh (Amendment) Bill 2025, both approved by a majority vote.
Regarding the education boards amendment, Mr Lanjar explained that the original 1972 ordinance equated the board chairman’s post to grades 20 and 21, but the new bill allows officers of grades 19 and 20 to be appointed as chairmen of boards.
The minister said that the bill is aimed at paving the way for more officers to be appointed in the education boards.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Qaimkhani supported the need for better board management but criticised what he called the lack of “consideration” for his party’s suggestions.
The MQM-P lawmaker proposed sending the bill back to the committee for further discussion, a suggestion Lanjar opposed.
The speaker put it to a vote, and the house approved the bill by majority of votes.
Earlier, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon praised police force for safeguarding law and order, and protecting life and property of citizens.
Speaking during the session, Mr Memon addressed the long-standing criticism and ridicule faced by the police.
“When we seek a target for blame, the police are an easy choice,” he remarked. “Yet, we rarely reflect on the constable who endangers his life daily for a modest wage, only to face criticism instead of appreciation.”
He praised the Sindh Police for their “exemplary service” since 2008, noting their “historic success in restoring peace” under a democratic government.
He said once-dangerous areas, where residents avoided venturing out after dark, have now returned to normalcy, crediting the force’s efforts.
He lauded their courage in tackling terrorism, citing the Karachi airport attack where then-Inspector General Iqbal Mahmood led the response in plain clothes.
Later, the house was adjourned to Monday.

Although embarrassed Indian officials have been denying the ‘mediatory’ aspect of the ceasefire and pretending that Pakistan ‘begged’ for one during the DGMOs’ talks, the message was clear — India’s denials notwithstanding, Pakistan had established its air superiority and the US had played a role in the ceasefire.
The debate in India’s Lok Sabha was equally telling as the main opposition party, Congress, tore apart the Modi government’s entire modus operandi when it launched Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. Therefore, it turned out to be a joust between the opposition and the government to score brownie points and address their respective domestic constituencies, rather than focusing on the India-Pakistan war. However, Donald Trump’s repeated assertion that he mediated between Pakistan and India became the main bone of contention.
 
 

There is a lull between Pakistan and India, but Mr Modi calls it a ‘pause’ in Operation Sindoor, implying that New Delhi may resume military operations against Pakistan. For Pakistan, India’s action of holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance and blocking water to Pakistan would be tantamount to an act of war. Both sides have drawn the battle lines, creating an explosive situation with potentially serious consequences. Unfortunately, there is no viable mechanism that can intercede between the two countries to maintain peace, a challenge that is becoming increasingly serious for the two nuclear states.
In the past, whenever India and Pakistan went to war, they employed mediating approaches to cool tensions, and the senior generation on both sides exercised a calming effect. However, with time, this window of opportunity is closing; at least this is the impression that informs the present environment between the two countries.
The generational gap has emerged as a significant factor in creating distance between the two countries; the new generation is unaware of their shared past and remains susceptible to the poisonous narratives each side feeds to its populace. In doing so, both are getting sucked into a potentially destructive exercise in one-upmanship. The social media debate between Gen Z in the two countries is reflective of this cancerous menace. The cumulative impact, if unchecked, would be the annihilation of adversaries with no remorse. Mutual hatred, powered by AI, will lead to immeasurable consequences.

In the past, whenever India and Pakistan went to war, they employed mediating approaches to cool tensions.

What are the remedies available to the two countries to pre-empt a future conflagration? While many attempts have been made in the past to address the thorny issues, and there were occasions when the two could have reached an agreement, something or the other would happen to mire them in a Sisyphean dilemma (recall Siachen in 1992 and Musharraf’s four-point formula).
Nevertheless, the two neighbours, with mutually assured destruction capabilities, cannot afford to remain disengaged or ignore each other. While the Modi government may be loath to engage Pakistan in a meaningful way, it cannot ignore Pakistan if India is interested in peace and stability in the region — the four-day war was ample proof of Pakistan’s resilience and prowess.
 
 

Despite discouraging vibes and the Hindutva dispensation’s chokehold on the country’s narrative, the ground realities leave little option for the Indian establishment but to continue the stalemate or alter the ground situation from a military perspective.
The following steps are worth trying out in order to address each other’s concerns:
First, the role of Track II has always been important in defusing tensions or at least providing an opportunity to understand each other’s point of view, adjust positions, and try to evolve a common language to iron out differences. The hard-line positions adopted by the two governments have created a significant vacuum that requires immediate reconsideration. Influential voices representing major stakeholders on both sides should meet in a Track II format to attempt to break the stalemate. A dialogue among think tanks in the two countries can also be explored.
Second, the two countries should consider exchanging high commissioners without further delay, restore the hotline between the foreign secretaries, earnestly implement the CBMs already agreed upon by the two sides, initiate action to resume bilateral trade and work on religious tourism.
 
 

Third, the issue of terrorism should be resolved comprehensively, with the two countries addressing each other’s grievances. The national security advisers of the two countries should chart out the future course of action.
Fourth, there is a three-way competition in which Pakistan and China are on one side, and India on the other, leaving the latter isolated and vulnerable in a two-front situation. This dilemma can be resolved through a trilateral mechanism between Pakistan, China and India. Such an arrangement already exists between China, India and Russia, although it is currently dormant. Recently, Afghanistan and Pakistan met through Chinese mediation to resolve their issues, with a positive outcome. This would require a change in mindset to prioritise dialogue as equals and eschew the pretence of hegemony.
The above proposals may not be new, but they merit serious consideration. Here, India will have to realise that its rhetoric of ignoring Pakistan or making it ‘irrelevant’ has backfired, as evidenced in the four-day skirmishes and international support for Pakistan’s narrative based on transparency and its offer of neutral inquiry in the Pahalgam incident.
Mr Modi will have to shun brinkmanship and his ‘new normal’ for Pakistan, which has proven twice (Balakot and the recent four-day war) that it has the capacity and will to take India head-on. Hence, for India, repeating tried and failed tactics would be counterproductive. The best course is to strive for a détente for the good of the two neighbours and the region.

The strong inflow came amid concerns from commercial banks, which had protested the reduction in incentives. However, bankers dealing in foreign exchange said the cuts would not materially affect the flow of remittances, adding that banks still stand to make substantial profits. “Remittance flows are expected to continue at last year’s pace unless disrupted by unforeseen circumstances,” one banker said.
Pakistan received a record $38.3bn in remittances during FY25, reflecting a robust 27pc year-on-year increase. The inflows provided ample dollar liquidity to the market, with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) emerging as the largest buyer, reportedly purchasing around $9bn from the open market during the year.
SBP data showed that July’s inflow of $3.214bn was 5.6pc or $192m lower than the $3.406bn received in June. Despite this dip, market sentiment remained upbeat.

$3.2bn received in July; experts raise alarm as reliance on remittances grows

However, currency dealers and banks reported a shortage of dollars in the open market, even in the presence of high remittance inflows. While authorities have denied any such shortage, importers and the general public have reportedly struggled to access dollars with ease.
 
 

For FY26, the SBP has modestly raised the remittance target to $40bn, reflecting continued optimism about overseas inflows. The government and SBP remain confident that growth in remittances will sustain through the year.
Among source countries, the strongest growth was recorded from EU nations, with remittances surging 21pc to $424.4m in July. Saudi Arabia remained the largest contributor, sending $823.7m — up 8.4pc year-on-year. Other key inflows included $665m from the UAE, $450.4m from the UK, and $296m from other Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
Conversely, inflows from the United States declined by 10.2pc to $269.6m. Despite the encouraging figures, some economists remain concerned about Pakistan’s growing dependence on remittances. Independent analyst Atif Ahmed cautioned that relying heavily on workers’ remittances to shore up foreign exchange reserves is risky.
“Global dynamics are changing rapidly, especially amid shifting trade relationships and evolving US tariff policies. Remittance flows cannot be guaranteed in the long run,” he said, adding that the government’s failure to boost exports remains a structural weakness.

• Approximately 128,000 new connections still pending
ISLAMABAD: After two years of contraction, electricity consumption surged between 35 per cent and 58pc in the final quarter of FY25, driven by increased industrial demand. The Power Division on Friday attributed this recovery to the return of captive power users to the national grid, improvements in macroeconomic indicators, and recent reforms in the power sector.
The division expressed optimism that this trend would help break the cycle of rising electricity tariffs by widening the consumer base and distributing fixed capacity charges more effectively. Officials noted that declining industrial consumption in previous years had narrowed the demand base, raising the average cost per unit and worsening tariff pressures.
Recent figures show industrial consumption increased by 58.8pc in April, 47.4pc in May, and 35pc in June compared to the same months of FY24. The Power Division said this growth, largely due to captive power users shifting back to the grid, would help reduce average electricity tariffs over time by enhancing economies of scale.
The government’s recent negotiations with power producers and a gradual shift away from inefficient captive generation have contributed to the turnaround. The Power Division reported that around 280 captive users had returned to the grid during the April-June quarter, with more expected to follow.
 
 

According to Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco), B4 category industrial sales surged by 183pc following the integration of about 200MW of captive generation. Gujranwala Electric reported a 35pc rise in industrial sales, with 20pc growth seen in the final quarter alone. Hyderabad Electric also saw a 75pc increase in industrial sales compared to the same period last year.
Lahore Electric (Lesco) said B3/B4 industrial sales jumped from 996 million units to 1,600m units. Lesco also recorded a 9pc rise in residential consumption, credited to anti-theft operations. Multan Electric (Mepco) reported the return of 152MW of captive load, while Peshawar Electric saw improved sales due to both captive power return and the Rs7.7 per unit tariff cut announced by the prime minister in March.
Tribal Electric cited court-mandated reconnections of industrial consumers for its sales growth. However, Qesco reported a decline in agricultural sales, mainly due to increased solarisation. Sukkur Electric experienced a 22pc drop in industrial sales and noted it has only 11 captive connections, limiting sales growth.
Overall, the Power Division said that out of 583 captive power users (with a cumulative load of 2,034MW), 281 had rejoined the national grid, contributing around 700–750MW of load. This transition helped raise industrial sales from 336 million units to over 600m units in the last quarter of FY25.
In parallel, the division informed the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) that power purchases by distribution companies (Discos) rose by only 0.35pc compared to reference tariff projections, while industrial sales increased by around 46pc.
Despite the improved performance, the Power Division revealed that approximately 128,000 new connections are pending across Discos — including 500 industrial connections — representing a total load of 1,070MW. Most of these pending cases are in Fesco, Mepco, Gepco, and Iesco jurisdictions.
Addressing concerns over rising debt servicing costs, the division clarified that no new surcharges have been imposed. Lifeline consumers remain exempt, while protected consumers pay only Rs0.43 per unit. A Rs3.23 per unit surcharge applies to other consumer categories. The government will continue this debt servicing surcharge for the next three years to repay Rs1.275tr in fresh loans taken to clear outstanding dues to power producers. Total circular debt stood at Rs2.393tr at the end of FY25.

• Spokesperson hints that Pakistan will continue US-Iran messaging role
ISLAMABAD: Although a UN Security Council travel ban is widely thought to be behind the cancellation of a planned visit by Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to Islamabad, the Foreign Office on Friday hinted that “procedural issues” had hindered the trip.
“There are certain procedural issues we are working through,” Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan told reporters at the weekly media briefing when pressed about media reports on Muttaqi’s aborted trip.
Mr Muttaqi was expected in Islamabad on August 4, continuing the recent high-level contacts initiated by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Kabul earlier this year, a move that led to a thaw in ties. The rapprochement was brokered by China.
However, the spokesperson clarified that no official dates had been confirmed for the Afghan foreign minister’s visit, so there was “no question of cancellation or postponement”.
 


However, diplomatic sources told Dawn that the United States had blocked a UN Security Council exemption that would have allowed Mr Muttaqi to travel to Pakistan.
As the Afghan foreign minister is under international sanctions, he requires special approval from the UN sanctions committee for any foreign travel. According to the source, Washington delayed its decision until the last moment and ultimately refused to grant the waiver, scuttling the trip.
As a key player in the UN Security Council, US holds significant sway in the 1988 Sanctions Committee, which manages sanctions like travel bans, asset freezes, and arms embargoes targeting Taliban-linked individuals and groups under UNSC Resolution 1988 (2011). It is believed the US blocked the waiver for Taliban’s FM to visit Pakistan, driven by worries about their growing ties with China.
US has often clashed with China and Russia at the committee, who advocate for more lenient exemptions, creating tensions within the committee’s efforts to promote stability in Afghanistan.
Mr Khan said that both Kabul and Islamabad are working to address the matter and added, “Once these procedural matters are resolved, we look forward to welcoming the Afghan foreign minister to Pakistan.”
When asked whether Washington had blocked Muttaqi’s visit to Pakistan at a recent briefing, a State Department spokesperson had simply responded with: “We do not comment on rumours”.
Iran mediation
The spokesman also confirmed that Pakistan was helping defuse tensions between the United States and Iran for the sake of the region’s stability.
“We want stability in the neighbourhood, and Iran is a very critical element of the stability in the region,” Mr Khan said. Pakistan’s mediation appears to have continued after Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s two-day visit to Islamabad last weekend.
 
 

Although officials did not publicly acknowledge Pakistan’s role during the trip, both Washington and Islamabad had confirmed such efforts earlier.
Notably, after the visit, Foreign Minister Dar held a phone conversation with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, further fueling speculation that Pezeshkian may have conveyed messages to Washington.
In an interview with China’s Phoenix Television during Pezeshkian’s visit, senior Iranian foreign ministry official Saeed Khatibzadeh said Tehran was in no hurry to engage with the United States and warned it would respond strongly if Washington maintained its “aggressive stance.”
He made it clear that Iran would not engage in direct or indirect talks without sufficient guarantees for productive talks.
An Iranian diplomat in Tehran confirmed to Dawn that Khatibzadeh’s remarks reflected the government’s official position.
Explaining Pakistan’s involvement, Mr Khan said Iran is “a very important country in the region” and that Pakistan would “do all what we can to bring tensions down and work for stability and a diplomatic solution to problems”.
“We have been doing that and will continue to do that,” the spokesman asserted, signalling the intended continuation of the role.

The additional 25pc marks a sharp escalation in Washington’s trade offensive against New Delhi, which is a member of several US-led economic and security alliances. The trigger appears to be India’s continued purchase of cheap Russian oil and its reluctance to open its market to American agricultural products. The move makes India the most heavily taxed US trading partner in Asia. Globally, it joins Brazil at the top of the Trump administration’s tariff list.
 
 

Unless New Delhi can broker a breakthrough in the ongoing trade talks before the new levies take effect later this month, the impact on India’s economy can be severe. Moody’s estimates that India’s real GDP growth could drop by 0.3 percentage points from its current forecast of 6.3pc for the fiscal year ending March 2026.
A BBC report notes that nearly all of India’s $86.5bn in annual goods exports to the US could become commercially unviable if the tariffs remain in place, with Indian exporters warning they cannot absorb more than a 10-15pc increase in tariff costs. India’s hopes of expanding bilateral trade with the US from $190bn to $500bn now appear unrealistic.
However, the consequences of the move go beyond India’s export sector. The levies risk derailing India’s ambition to develop its manufacturing base, particularly in sectors such as electronics. Japanese brokerage firm Nomura likens the effect to a ‘trade embargo’, warning of a sudden stop in affected export flows. In the long term, the fallout may extend to investment flows.
When commercial and other factors dim a country’s appeal as a manufacturing hub, it is inevitable that others will step in to fill the vacuum. The question then arises: will Pakistan’s trade benefit from the high tariffs imposed on India’s import? In theory, yes. Pakistan’s exports to the US face lower tariffs than countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh. And the development could open up space for manufacturers, particularly in textiles and clothing.
 
 

In practice, however, the odds are stacked against us. Pakistan remains constrained by chronic dollar shortages, an unfriendly business climate, policy unpredictability, an underdeveloped industrial infrastructure, and high costs of doing business driven by expensive energy and limited access to raw materials.
Pakistan may want to benefit from this opening in the American market and attract FDI in export-oriented industries but without acting quickly to implement serious policy reforms, cut red tape, ensure policy stability and build investors’ confidence regarding the security of their capital, it will not be able to do so.
The global supply chain shift — accelerated by President Trump’s tariffs — is already underway. Without credible policy reforms, Pakistan can only watch from the sidelines.

The ministry said the shortfall, from April 24 to June 30, was in overflying revenue and was lower than the reported Rs8.5bn. The closure followed India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty on April 23.
From the very next day, Pakistan withdrew overflight permission for all Indian-registered aircraft and those operated, owned, or leased by Indian carriers.
The measure affected 100 to 150 Indian aircraft daily, cutting transit traffic by almost 20 per cent. In 2019, a similar closure led to an estimated Rs7.6bn ($54m) revenue loss, compared to $100m previously reported.

Islamabad airport airspace to close daily for two hours until Aug 14

The ministry apprised the parliament that such decisions, under the jurisdiction of the federal government, were issued through Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) and carried strategic and diplomatic weight to safeguard civilians, protect infrastructure, and allow military planning.
Sovereignty, defence
“While financial losses occur, sovereignty and national defence take precedence over economic considerations,” the statement read.
The PAA’s average daily overflight revenue in 2019, before tensions, was $508,000, compared to $760,000 in 2025.
 
 

The ministry made it clear that the amounts reflected “revenue shortfalls, not overall financial losses”, and noted that overflight and aeronautical charges remained unchanged, demonstrating resilience and avoiding tariff hikes or government bailouts.
Pakistan’s airspace is open to all except Indian airlines and aircraft till last week of August after the ban was extended twice on a monthly basis. Similarly, Pakistani carriers remain banned from Indian airspace. “When safeguarding sovereignty and security, no price is too high,” the ministry reiterated.
Islamabad flights
Separately, Islamabad International Airport’s airspace will be closed daily for two hours until August 14 for operational reasons, according to NOTAM A0510/25. Departures and arrivals will be halted from ground level to FL210, affecting flights to Lahore and northern areas.
The airspace will remain closed from 11am to 1pm.
On Friday, the temporary closure caused minor delays, with hundreds of passengers facing changes to their travel plans. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said all immigration counters were fully staffed and operational, processing 2,847 passengers from 12 international flights in three hours.
A sudden schedule change led to many passengers departing at the same time. FIA Immigration completed screening and clearance in line with regulations and pledged to maintain efficient services while continuing efforts against human trafficking and wanted suspects.

The Thursday’s statement, which contradicted earlier reports that a Putin-Zelensky meeting was a prerequisite for the summit, came after Trump gave Moscow until Friday to reach a ceasefire or face fresh sanctions.
But asked by reporters in the Oval Office if that deadline still held, Trump did not answer clearly. “It’s going to be up to (Putin),” Trump said. “We’re going to see what he has to say.”
Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has been pressuring Moscow to end Russia’s military assault on Ukraine.
 



Russian president updates Xi on talks with Washington

The Kremlin said on Thursday that Putin was set to attend a summit with Trump in the “coming days,” but the Russian leader essentially ruled out including Zelensky.
Zelensky, meanwhile, insisted that he had to be involved in any talks.
When Trump was asked if Putin was required to meet Zelensky before a summit, the US president said simply: “No, he doesn’t.”
Putin has named the United Arab Emirates as a potential location for the summit, but this was not confirmed by Washington.
Meanwhile, Putin called his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to update him on the latest US-Russia talks on the Ukraine conflict, the Kremlin said on Friday.
Putin informed Xi about “the main results of his conversation on August 6 with US special envoy Steve Witkoff,” while Xi expressed support for a “long-term” solution to the conflict, the Kremlin said, days before an expected summit between Putin and US President Donald Trump.
Next week?
The summit would be the first between sitting US and Russian presidents since Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva in June 2021.
Three rounds of direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul have failed to yield any progress towards a ceasefire. The two sides remain far apart on the conditions they have set to end the more than three-year-long conflict.
Trump and Putin last sat together in 2019 at a G20 summit meeting in Japan during Trump’s first term. They have spoken by telephone several times since January.
Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said that “next week has been set as a target date,” adding that both sides have agreed the venue “in principle,” without naming it.
However, Washington later denied that a venue or date had been set.
 
 

“No location has been determined,” a White House official said, while agreeing that the meeting “could occur as early as next week.”
Tens of thousands of people have been killed since Russia launched its military offensive on Ukraine in February 2022.
Russian bombardments have forced millions of people to flee their homes and have destroyed swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine.
Putin has resisted multiple calls from the United States, Europe and Kyiv for a ceasefire.

ISLAMABAD/JERUSALEM: Israel’s new plan to “take control” of Gaza City sparked outrage from the international community, with Pakistan warning that the planned occupation was merely a front for Tel Aviv to expand its “genocidal” military campaign against Palestinians.
The plan, approved by PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet, comes amid growing international concern has been growing over the suffering in Gaza — where a UN-backed assessment has warned that Israel’s blockade of aid is causing a famine — and concerns for the safety of prisoners still held by Hamas.
Under the newly approved plan to “defeat” Hamas, the Israeli army “will prepare to take control of Gaza City while distributing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population outside combat zones”, Netanyahu’s office said Friday.
Earlier, Netanyahu had said Israel planned to seize complete control of the Gaza Strip, but did not intend to govern it.
He told Fox News on Thursday that Israel wanted to maintain a “security perimeter” and to hand the Palestinian territory to “Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us”.
Netanyahu’s office said the cabinet had adopted “five principles”, including Gaza’s demilitarisation and “the establishment of an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority”.
The main campaign group for prisoners’ families also slammed the plan, saying it amounted to “abandoning” the captives.
Hamas on Friday said the “plans to occupy Gaza City and evacuate its residents constitutes a new war crime”.
It warned Israel that the operation would “cost it dearly”, and that “expanding the aggression means sacrificing” the hostages held by militants.
Pakistan’s reaction
Reacting to the Israeli plan to occupy Gaza, Pakistan’s Foreign Office warned that this would only intensify the humanitarian catastrophe in the territory and undermine international peace efforts.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also lambasted it as a “dangerous escalation”.
“We strongly condemn the Israeli cabinet’s approval of a plan to take illegal and illegitimate control of Gaza City. This tantamounts [sic] to a dangerous escalation in an already catastrophic war against the people of Palestine,” the prime minister said in a post on X.
 






He added that the expansion of military operations will only worsen the already existing humanitarian crisis and derail any prospect for peace in the region.
“We must not lose sight of the root cause of this ongoing tragedy: that is, Israel’s prolonged, illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. As long as this occupation endures, peace will remain elusive,” the premier added.
The Foreign Office statement said it “condemns in the strongest possible terms the reported Israeli plan for a complete military takeover of Gaza”.
“This not only represents yet another flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, but also the occupying power’s intention to further expand its ongoing genocidal military campaign.”
The statement urged the international community to “ensure an immediate end to Israeli impunity and its genocidal military campaign; take concrete measures for the provision of unimpeded humanitarian supplies to millions of Palestinians in dire need; and hold Israel accountable for its heinous crimes.”
Separately, at a weekly media briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said the Gaza crisis remains central to Pakistan’s diplomacy.
“Issue of Gaza is in the hearts of our people. We have made Pakistan’s principled diplomatic position on the subject abundantly clear,” he said, noting that the deputy prime minister recently chaired a special briefing on the Middle East situation at the United Nations in New York.
International backlash
The plan also triggered swift criticism from across the globe, with China, Turkey, Britain and the UN’s rights chief as well as numerous Arab governments issuing statements of concern.
 






UN human rights chief Volker Turk said the plan must be “immediately halted”.
Israel should instead allow “the full, unfettered flow of humanitarian aid” and Palestinian armed groups must unconditionally release hostages, he added.
“The Israeli government’s decision to further extend its military operation in Gaza must be reconsidered,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on X.
 






European Council chief Antonio Costa also criticised the plan, warning “such a decision must have consequences” for EU-Israel ties.
“This action will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the release of the hostages,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, adding that it would “only bring more bloodshed”.
 






“Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory,” a foreign ministry spokesperson told AFP.
“The correct way to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to secure the release of hostages is an immediate ceasefire.”
Staunch Israeli ally Germany, meanwhile, took the extraordinary step of halting military exports out of concern they could be used in Gaza.
Chancellor Friedrich Merz said it was “increasingly difficult to understand” how the Israeli military plan would help achieve legitimate aims.
“Under these circumstances, the German government will not authorise any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice,” he added.
The Saudi foreign ministry said that Riyadh “categorically condemns its persistence in committing crimes of starvation, brutal practices, and ethnic cleansing against the brotherly Palestinian people”.
A statement issued by the Royal Court said King Abdullah condemned a move “which undermines the two-state solution and the rights of the Palestinian people”.
Egypt’s foreign affairs ministry also said it condemned the plan “in the strongest possible terms”.

An Airbus A-319 arrived at the Quetta International Airport at 09:15pm, and after a stay of over two-hours, departed for Zah­edan, the capital of Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province, at 11:30pm with 75 passengers on board.
Initially, the Iran Air will operate one flight per week between Quetta and Zahedan, with the frequency potentially incr­easing based on passenger demand. 
A ceremony was held at the Quetta airport to mark the occasion, which was atte­nded by the counsel gen­eral and officials of the Iranian Cons­ulate in Quetta, a number of people from the business community and representatives from the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
Quetta airport man­ager Waheed Shah, terminal manager Ismail Khoso, and the chief security officer of ASF were present to see off the passengers. 
Last month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that Pakistani pilgrims will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for Arbaeen due to security concerns. 
In his social media post, Naqvi said, “After extensive consultations with the Min­istry of Foreign Aff­airs, Balochistan Gove­­­r­nment and security age­­n­cies, it has been dec­ided that Zaireen will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road for Arbaeen this year.”

Trump on Wednesday imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi’s continued imports of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations after trade talks reached a deadlock. The new import tax, set to come into place in three weeks, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc — among the highest levied on any US trading partner.
While the rupture in US-India ties was abrupt, there have been strains in the relationship. Delhi has repeatedly rebutted Trump’s repeated statements that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after four days of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Trump also hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.
The two leaders spoke over the phone at the insistence of Trump on the sidelines of June’s G7 summit in Canada, which Modi attended as a guest. The call lasted 35 minutes.
“PM Modi told President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had said of the talk. “Talks for ceasing military action happened directly between India and Pakistan through existing military channels, and on the insistence of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi emphasised that India has not accepted mediation in the past and will never do,” he said.
Bloomberg reported today that “tensions came to a head” between the two leaders in the call with Trump’s repeated claiming of credit and India’s downplaying of the matter.
“Modi felt like he needed to set the record straight in the call after his aides discovered that Trump planned to host a lunch the following day at the White House for Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir,” the report cited officials in New Delhi familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak about confidential discussions.
“While India had no problem if Trump met Pakistan’s civilian leaders, hosting Munir was seen as giving legitimacy to a military that Modi’s government accuses of supporting militant groups, they said. Wary that Trump would look to orchestrate a meeting between Munir and Modi, the Indian leader turned down an invitation to stop by the White House on the way back from Canada, they said, adding that he was also committed to visiting Croatia,” the report said.
It added that since the phone call, “India saw a shift in tone from the White House after that phone call, according to the officials in New Delhi” despite the US not making a direct request for Modi to acknowledge Trump’s role.
“Once Trump began publicly attacking India, they added, it was clear the episode marked a turning point in the broader relationship,” the report said.
Modi said a day ago he would not compromise on the agriculture sector.
For New Delhi, one of the main sticking points in trade negotiations has been Washington’s demand to access India’s vast agricultural and dairy market. India has remained steadfast about its labour-intensive agricultural sector, unwilling to risk angering farmers, a powerful voting bloc.
“We will not compromise with the interests of our farmers, our dairy sector, our fishermen,” Modi said during a speech at a conference in New Delhi, his remarks widely seen as his first public response to the tariffs.
“I know I will have to pay a personal price for this, but I am ready for it,” he added, without giving further details.
In February, Trump said that he found a “special bond” with Modi when he visited Washington — complimenting Modi as being a “much tougher negotiator” than he was.
Successive US administrations have seen India — the world’s most populous nation and fifth-largest economy — as a key partner, with like-minded interests in the face of powerful China.
India and neighbouring China have long been intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.
Now, India is bracing for a bumpy ride, as the US is its largest trading partner, with New Delhi shipping goods worth $87.4 billion in 2024.</p><small>2025-08-08 18:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08233206f2a3739.jpg?r=233215' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929563/putin-calls-xi-modi-and-other-foreign-leaders-ahead-of-planned-meeting-with-trump' target='_blank'><strong>Putin calls Xi, Modi and other foreign leaders ahead of planned meeting with Trump</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to the leaders of China, India and three ex-Soviet states on Friday in a flurry of calls to brief them on his contacts with the United States about the war in Ukraine.
Putin met US President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow on Wednesday, after which the Kremlin said a summit between Putin and Trump could take place as early as next week. No venue, date or agenda have been announced.
Trump, pressing for an end to the 3.5-year war, had set a deadline that expires on Friday for Russia to agree to peace or face new sanctions on Moscow and countries that buy Russian exports. China and India are the biggest buyers of Russian oil.
China’s President Xi Jinping told Putin in a phone call that China is pleased to see Russia and the US maintaining contact and improving ties to advance a political resolution of the Ukraine crisis, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.
China is a major backer of Russia in its confrontation with the West, as well as Russia’s biggest trading partner. Putin is due to visit China in September for events marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two.
The Kremlin said that Putin also discussed his talks with Witkoff with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump this week announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods to penalise New Delhi for its purchases of Russian oil.
“Had a very good and detailed conversation with my friend President Putin. I thanked him for sharing the latest developments on Ukraine,” Modi said in a post on X.
 






On Thursday, Putin spoke with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who expressed South Africa’s “full support to peace initiatives that will end the war and contribute to a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine”.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, met Putin in Moscow on Thursday and Putin said the UAE was a possible venue for the Russia-US summit.
Russia, China, India, South Africa and the UAE are all members of the BRICS group of countries which Moscow sees as a counterweight to US political and economic dominance.
Putin on Friday also discussed the outcome of Witkoff’s visit in calls with his ally Alexander Lukashenko, president of Belarus, and with the leaders of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p><small>2025-08-08 18:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08230429e0d7f88.jpg?r=230518' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929558/fia-warns-against-fake-messages-being-sent-under-its-name' target='_blank'><strong>FIA warns against ‘fake messages’ being sent under its name</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Friday warned citizens against “fake emails and WhatsApp messages” being sent in its name.
“The FIA has received reports that some unknown individuals are harassing the public by sending fake emails and WhatsApp messages in the name of the DG FIA,” a statement issued by the agency’s spokesperson, Abdul Ghaffar, read.
 






“In these fake messages, the public is being terrorised by using the name and position of DG FIA,” the statement said, adding that fraudsters put a fake stamp of “Top Secret” on these messages to make them appear authentic.
In addition, these elements are trying to present themselves as government officials by using fake and misleading names. In these messages, attempts are being made to blackmail citizens by accusing them of “cyber crimes”.
“The FIA does not send such messages to any individual through WhatsApp or email,” the agency clarified.
“The public is requested to file a complaint about any suspicious message or contact with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency, which is the authorised agency for investigating cyber crimes.”
The statement called on citizens to be wary of fake messages and never share their personal and financial information, adding that for more information, the FIA Helpline can be contacted at 1991.
Earlier this week, the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF) issued an alert this week, warning against an ongoing scam aiming to compromise WhatsApp accounts via fake calls requesting a code.
Last month, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency conducted a successful raid on an illegal call centre in Islamabad and arrested five foreign nationals, according to a press release.
Meanwhile, in May, the national Cyber Emergency Response Team issued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan had been stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures.</p><small>2025-08-08 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08222539597a258.jpg?r=222602' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929559/mqm-founder-altaf-hussain-hospitalised-again-in-london' target='_blank'><strong>MQM founder Altaf Hussain hospitalised again in London</strong></a><br><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain was hospitalised again in London on Friday after falling ill.
In a post on the party’s X account, it said: “The health of MQM founder and leader Altaf Hussain has deteriorated again, after which he has been taken to a local hospital. According to details released by the MQM Central Information Department, on Friday, Altaf Hussain’s health worsened again.
“Immediate medical attention was sought, and an ambulance was called. The doctor promptly dispatched a medical emergency team. The emergency team initially examined Altaf Hussain at his residence, after which he was shifted to a local hospital for further examination and treatment.”
The MQM Coordination Committee appealed to all workers and the public to pray for his recovery.
 






MQM London-based senior party leader Mustafa Azizabadi also confirmed the development on a post on X.
 






Hussain was hospitalised in London last month due to “severe illness”, where he underwent multiple tests.
Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.
Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third-largest party in the country.
The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.
Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.
He was in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Britain, apparently after contracting Covid-19 in February 2021.
Hussain was born on September 17, 1953, in Karachi. He obtained his early education at a public school in Karachi’s Azizabad neighbourhood, a middle-class locality in Karachi where he spent his early years and his youth. He later enrolled at the University of Karachi to study Pharmacy and graduated from the programme in 1979.
His political career began during his student years in KU when he and Azeem Ahmed Tariq founded the All-Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO).
Formed in 1978, APMSO gained a massive following within a short period of time.
In the early 1990s, the MQM chief went into exile as the government at the time conducted an operation in Karachi.
Viewed as the man who controlled Karachi from London, Hussain came under fire in May 2013 for his televised speech across Pakistan, where he allegedly demanded the separation of Karachi from the rest of Pakistan if the public mandate of his party was not acceptable to the ‘establishment’. The party later clarified, saying it was taken out of context.
However, the final undoing of the MQM, as it was known, came after Hussain delivered an incendiary speech in August 2016 in which he not only raised slogans against Pakis­tan but also called the country “a cancer for the entire world”. Hours after the speech, MQM workers had attacked the ARY News office in Kara­chi.
Authorities launched a crackdown following the speech and the MQM’s Karachi headquarters and Hussain’s residence in Azizabad were sealed. Later, Hussain’s own party leaders in Pakistan distanced themselves from him and omitted his name from the party constitution.
In October 2019, Hussain was charged with “encouraging terrorism” by British police over his speech. He was also arrested in the case earlier in 2019 but was released on bail.
After deliberations that spanned three days, a 12-member jury had returned a majority verdict in Rex (crown) versus Altaf Hussain in February 2022, acquitting the MQM founder on two counts of ‘encouraging terrorism’.
The jury found Hussain not guilty on both counts of encouraging terrorism, contrary to section 1(2) of the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006.</p><small>2025-08-08 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0821204072f272d.jpg?r=212101' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929556/pm-shehbaz-blasts-israeli-cabinets-gaza-takeover-plan-as-dangerous-escalation' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz blasts Israeli cabinet’s Gaza takeover plan as ‘dangerous escalation’</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday blasted the Israeli cabinet’s approval of a plan to occupy Gaza City as a “dangerous escalation”.
Earlier in the day, Israel’s political-security cabinet approved a plan to take control of Gaza City, nearly two years into its invasion of the Palestinian territory. The approval came hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel intended to take military control of the entire strip, American news agency Reuters reported.
“We strongly condemn the Israeli cabinet’s approval of a plan to take illegal and illegitimate control of Gaza City. This tantamounts to a dangerous escalation in an already catastrophic war against the people of Palestine,” the prime minister said in a post on X.
 






He added that the expansion of military operations will only worsen the already existing humanitarian crisis and derail any prospect for peace in the region.
“We must not lose sight of the root cause of this ongoing tragedy: that is, Israel’s prolonged, illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. As long as this occupation endures, peace will remain elusive,” the premier added.
“Pakistan reiterates its unwavering support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in line with relevant UN and OIC resolutions.”
PM Shehbaz called upon the international community to intervene urgently to bring an immediate halt to Israel’s unwarranted aggression, ensure the protection of innocent civilians, and ensure the direly needed delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.
Earlier, Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan in his weekly briefing announced that Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar officiated the send-off of the 18th humanitarian aid consignment to Gaza at a ceremony held at Islamabad International Airport today.
“Under the directives of the Prime Minister, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in close coordination with relevant partners, facilitated the dispatch of this consignment, which is the 18th shipment from Pakistan,” the FO spokesperson said.
 






The aid consignment comprised of essential supplies including dry ration packs, Meals Ready-to-Eat and medicines. The ceremony was attended by senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the NDMA, and the Ambassador of Palestine to Pakistan, he added.
This consignment brings Pakistan’s total humanitarian assistance to Gaza to 18 shipments, comprising 1,815 tons of vital relief supplies, he added, saying “This sustained support reflects Pakistan’s resolute solidarity with the people of Gaza.”
Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed 61,258 and injured 152,045 Palestinians, per the Palestinian health ministry. Bombardments have also destroyed 88 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Media Office, with Tel-Aviv facing accusations of genocide.
On Thursday, the World Health Organisation said that 99 people were now known to have died from malnutrition in the Gaza Strip so far this year, with the figure likely an underestimate.
International outrage over the humanitarian situation in Gaza has ratcheted up pressure on Israel, with UN agencies warning of famine in the devastated Palestinian territory.
Earlier in the week, Israel’s military chief had pushed back against Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans to seize areas of Gaza it doesn’t already control, three Israeli officials said, as the prime minister faced increasing pressure over the invasion both at home and abroad.
FO condemns Israeli plan for complete military takeover of Gaza
The Foreign Office, in a separate statement, condemned the Israeli plan for complete military takeover of Gaza.
“Pakistan condemns in the strongest possible terms the reported Israeli plan for a complete military takeover of Gaza,” the statement said.
This not only represents yet another flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, but also the occupying power’s intention to further expand its ongoing genocidal military campaign, the statement added.
This highly escalatory action will further aggravate the prevailing grave humanitarian situation and suffering of the civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in addition to undermining international efforts aimed at achieving peace and stability in the region, the FO said.
“Pakistan reiterates its call on the international community to ensure an immediate end to Israeli impunity and its genocidal military campaign”, the FO said, calling for concrete measures for the provision of unimpeded humanitarian supplies to millions of Palestinians in dire need, and to hold Israel accountable for its heinous crimes.</p><small>2025-08-08 16:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0819571561d2c5e.jpg?r=195758' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929551/ptis-leaders-of-opposition-in-na-senate-removed-from-posts' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s leaders of opposition in NA, Senate removed from posts</strong></a><br><p>PTI’s Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan and Opposition Leader in the Senate Shibli Faraz, were removed from their seats, according to notifications by the respective houses’ secretariats that came to light on Friday.
On Tuesday, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had disqualified the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions in cases related to the May 9 riots.
According to the notification by the National Assembly Secretariat dated August 7, “ Consequent upon disqualification and de-notification of Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan from being a member of the National Assembly (NA-18 Haripur) under Article 63 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan … the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly has become vacant with effect from August 5th, 2025.“
A similar notification for Faraz was issued by the Senate Secretariat: “Consequent upon disqualification and de-notification of Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Senator Syed Shibli Faraz, from being a member of the Senate under Article 63 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan … the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has become vacant with effect from 5th August”.
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday halted ECP from taking any action against PTI leaders Faraz and Ayub.
A notification from the ECP had said Faraz, Ayub, Kharal, Raza, MNA Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan, Gul, MPA Muhammad Ansar Iqbal, MPA Junaid Afzal Sahi and MPA Rai Muhammad Murtaza Iqbal were now disqualified under Article 63(1h) (a person shall be disqualified from being elected [if] … he has been, on conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years) of the Constitution and their seats were vacant.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
Last month, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Faisalabad senten­ced over 100 leaders and workers of the PTI, including several key opposition figures, to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the May 9 riots.
NA Opposition Leader Khan, Senate Opposition Leader Faraz, MNA Zartaj Gul, Raza, Sheikh Rashid Shafique (nephew of former interior minister Sheikh Rashid), Kanwal Shauzab, Farah Agha, Rai Haider Kharal and Muhammad Ahmad Chattha were among those sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.
Ayub had lambasted the ATC’s “bogus verdict” in a post on X, saying that he would contest it and the ECP’s disqualification in court.
He also posted a video of himself at the Peshawar High Court with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.
The ECP disqualification followed other recent disqualifications of PTI leaders and lawmakers.
On July 29, the ECP had disqualified MNA Abdul Latif from the NA-1 constituency (Upper and Lower Chitral), raising questions over the haste with which a flurry of similar decisions were taken in recent days.
On July 28, the commission had disqualified Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chatta and MPA Ahmad Khan.
On December 21 and 26 last year, a military court had sentenced over 50 PTI leaders and activists, including Imran Khan’s nephew Hassaan Niazi, to up to 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 riots.
The ATCs have been hearing May 9-related cases daily to meet a deadline set by the Supreme Court for the conclusion of trials by August.</p><small>2025-08-08 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0817575255a67f5.jpg?r=175937' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929546/security-forces-kill-33-terrorists-in-balochistans-zhob-district-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 33 terrorists in Balochistan’s Zhob district: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 33 terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on Friday, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a large group of terrorists belonging to the “Indian proxy Fitna al Khwaraj”, were trying to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border when they were detected by the security forces in the Sambaza area of Balochistan’s Zhob district on the night of August 7 and 8.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement added that the troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate, adding, “As a result of precise, bold and skilful engagement, thirty three Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell.”
A large cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was also recovered, it added.
“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and to eradicate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.

In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. In February, nearly 62 per cent of the total terrorism-related deaths in the country occurred in Balochistan.
The move came after a notification issued by the Balochistan Home Department on Aug 6, seen by Dawn.com, ordered the immediate suspension of data services until Aug 31, citing the “peculiar law and order situation” in the province.
“It is, therefore, requested to please direct the concerned authorities for suspension/closure of 3G and 4G services in the entire province … to avoid any untoward incident,” the notification read.
“The service has been suspended because they (militants) use it for coordination and sharing information,” Rind said, according to Reuters.
The suspension follows the government announcement from last month banning Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) from travelling by road from Quetta to Iran and Iraq due to national security concerns.
