The demonstration, staged outside Muzaffarabad Press Club under the aegis of Pasban-i-Hurriyat Jammu Kashmir (PHJK) — an organisation of post-1989 Kashmiri refugees — was aimed at drawing attention to the Indian occupation machinery’s brutal acts in the held territory and the enforcement of a slew of draconian laws.
Posters and banners depicting various forms of repression in occupied Jammu and Kashmir were displayed at the venue of the sit-in where participants raised slogans against India’s sham democracy and the continued subjugation of Kashmiris. 
Right to self-determination 
They demanded their internationally recognised right to self-determination, and also called on the United Nations (UN) to intervene.

Kashmiri refugees stage sit-in, urge international community to intervene 

“Down with India’s farcical democracy” and “UNO, wake up and come to our rescue” were among the slogans chanted.
Addressing the gathering, PHJK chairman Uzair Ahmed Ghazali said India’s decision of August 5, 2019 had not only stripped Kashmiris of their political status but had also deprived them of their all human, social and democratic rights.
He said thousands of Kashmiris demanding the inalienable right to self-determination had been killed in extrajudicial actions, while youths continued to be targeted in staged encounters.
“While Muhammad Maqbool Butt and Muhammad Afzal Guru were sent to the gallows despite their innocence, several Hurriyat leaders died in custody due to systematic torture,” he said.
‘Serious war crimes’
“India is a terrorist state and its savage military apparatus is using black laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, Public Safety Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act with impunity to collectively punish Kashmiris,” he added.
Mr Ghazali pointed out that sexual violence against women was being used as a weapon of war by Indian forces, resulting in thousands of widows and orphans, and added that mass graves were evidence of ‘serious war crimes’.
Other speakers said demographic changes, land seizures, curbs on religious and cultural expression and a prolonged media blackout had turned occupied Kashmir into an open prison, where residents were living under curfews and security restrictions amid a heavy troop presence.
The organisers urged the UN and the international community to take notice of the situation in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, seek independent investigations into grave violations and facilitate the implementation of UN resolutions granting Kashmiris the right to self-determination.
Prominent among those who participated in the sit-in were Ghulam Mehdi Dar, Usman Ali Hashim, Faisal Farooq Sheikh, Iqbal Yaseen Awan, Muhammad Fayaz Khan, Khawaja Muhammad Sadiq, Muhammad Younis Mir, Muhammad Aslam Inqalabi, Muhammad Ashfaq Kashmiri, Imtiaz Khan and Syed Khalid Shah.

LAHORE: The provinces have little incentive to improve the collection of three major taxes as they continue to receive an adequate share from the federal government under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, prominent officials and economic experts said on Sunday.
“The provinces are mainly collecting three major taxes — sales tax on services, agriculture income tax and property tax,” Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said, adding that they were performing “poorly” in all these areas.
He was speaking at a session titled ‘NFC, Governance and the Crisis of Money’ on the concluding day of the ThinkFest event held here.
Former finance minister Miftah Ismail opened the session as moderator and informed the participants on the distribution of funds under the NFC award.
He said 57.5 per cent of the total federal government revenues were transferred to the provinces. In addition, the federation gives one per cent of revenues to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for combating terrorism and also supports the Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan governments financially.
He said sales tax on goods was still collected by the federation, while tax on services was the responsibility of the provinces.
FBR chief Langrial appreciated the provinces for improvements in governance, including cleanliness and other development initiatives.
However, he was critical of their performance in terms of tax collection.
“I will tell you the numbers. Of the total agriculture income tax base of Rs3.7 trillion, the provinces are collecting just Rs8.4 billion,” he said.
He said property tax collection by provinces stood at only 0.08 per cent of GDP in Pakistan, compared to 5pc in Malaysia, 3pc in Indonesia and 2pc in India.
He added that per capita property tax collection in Lahore was Rs623, against Rs1,276 in Chandigarh.
“In Karachi, the per capita tax collection amounts to just Rs111, whereas in Bangalore it stands at Rs11,233,” he said.
Mr Langrial said provinces needed to collect more taxes as their revenue gap was too much, while the federation should also minimise its expenses.
Economist Savail Hussain said transfers from the federation to provinces continued rising from 2001 to 2009, but outcomes in terms of the Human Development Index (HDI), except in Balochistan, remained below the mark.
“At present, we have a public finance crisis that can only be overcome if both the federation and provinces sit together and make the NFC performance-based,” he said.
Asad Sayeed, a member of the 2009 NFC, said all stakeholders had agreed to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio to 13.5pc by 2015, but the FBR had crossed only 10pc so far.
Privatisation
In another session, speakers discussed the government’s ongoing privatisation of state-owned enterprises. The session, titled ‘Privatisation: An Easier Route or Structural Change’, was moderated by Ms Rahat Kaunain Hassan.
The speakers included Privatisation Commission Chairman Muhammad Ali and Arif Habib Group CEO Nasim Beg, while former Privatisation Commission chairman Muhammad Zubair also spoke.
Mr Beg said the consortium that recently won the bidding for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) would focus on reviving international operations and improving domestic services despite facing a massive competition.
PC Chairman Muhammad Ali dispelled the impression that valuable PIA land would be transferred to the bidder, saying only international and domestic offices would be taken over.
Mr Zubair asked why PIA was not privatised in 2023 and 2024 despite similar bid prices, and raised concerns over the recent appointment of a new chairman despite the privatisation process.

CHIEF Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja and two other Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members are set to complete one year in office after the expiry of their constitutionally-mandated five-year terms.
The terms of the three officials ended on Jan 26, 2025. Under Article 215(4) of the Constitution, appointments to these posts were required within 45 days after the positions became vacant, i.e. by March 12, 2025.
However, a proviso inserted into Article 215(1) through the 26th Constitutional Amendment allows the CEC and members to continue until their successors are appointed. The incumbent CEC and two ECP members are serving under this provision, while the process to appoint replacements has yet to begin.
For months, the delay was partly attributed to the absence of an officially notified leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, who has a constitutional role to play in the process.
With Mehmood Khan Achakzai now notified as opposition leader after a prolonged delay, attention has shifted to how soon the government initiates appointments for the new chief election commissioner and ECP members from Sindh and Balochistan.
Muddasir Rizvi of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), told Dawn that the notification of the opposition leader had removed a key procedural hurdle to initiating appointments to several constitutional and statutory offices that require mandatory consultation between the prime minister and the opposition leader.
He said such appointments included the chief election commissioner, ECP members, the chairman of the National Accountability Bureau, and the chairpersons of the National Commission on the Status of Women and the National Human Rights Commission.
Mr Rizvi said appointments to constitutional offices should be completed before posts fall vacant. While he acknowledged that the incumbents’ continuation was constitutional under the amended provision, he urged that the process for appointing successors be initiated as soon as possible. He expressed hope that the issue would be addressed through a subsequent constitutional amendment.
Ahmad Bilal Mehboob, president of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), said the process to appoint a new chief election commissioner should start forthwith and the prime minister should take the initiative.
He recalled that the process had been initiated by the prime minister but could not move forward as the then opposition leader Omar Ayub wanted the formation of a parliamentary committee on the appointments without the consultation process.
He also said an earlier draft of the 26th Amendment had included a provision for the reappointment of the chief election commissioner, which was later dropped after opposition from JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
He said Pildat had opposed the reappointment idea on the grounds that it could incentivise an incumbent to seek favour with the government of the day.
Mr Raja has faced sustained criticism from political parties and rights groups over the ECP’s handling of electoral matters, particularly around the 2024 general elections. Critics have alleged that the commission’s actions, decisions and administrative choices undermined confidence in the electoral process, while the ECP has maintained it acted in accordance with the law.
The controversy intensified after the ECP announced that general elections would not be held within the 90-day constitutional deadline following the dissolution of the National Assembly on Aug 9, 2023. More than a month later, the commission announced polls would be held in the last week of January 2024, but elections were eventually held on Feb 8, 2024.
Among issues raised by critics were delays in results, alleged discrepancies in election forms and the use of administrative officers, including assistant commissioners and deputy commissioners, as returning officers and district returning officers, roles traditionally assigned to the lower judiciary.
Talking to Dawn, PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said that his party had documented alleged anomalies in polling data. He cited polling station No. 180 of NA-130 (Lahore), claiming that the number of polled votes exceeded the number of registered voters at the station.
“PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif was declared winner from the constituency. Documents show that Nawaz Sharif secured 1,266 out of 1,825 polled votes. The number of total votes polled for the provincial assembly at the same polling station was 972. The number of voters assigned to the polling station was 1,818,” Mr Zafar said.
Mr Raja’s critics allege that the denial of the party symbol was aimed not only at disadvantaging the PTI by confusing voters, but also at allowing PTI-backed “independents” to later join the ruling coalition without risking disqualification. They also claim the move was used to deprive the PTI of its share of reserved seats.
After the 2024 elections, Mr Raja and other members of the Election Commission decided against allocating reserved seats to PTI-backed independents in proportion to the general seats they had won, instead distributing them among the ruling coalition, a decision the PTI challenged in court.
Despite a majority judgement directing that the reserved seats be returned to the PTI under the principle of “complete justice”, the ECP sought clarification and later filed a review petition, delaying implementation.
Critics say this provided the government time to pass an amendment to the Elections Act, 2017, aimed at nullifying the court ruling by barring PTI-backed independents from joining the party after the legally prescribed period.
Mr Raja’s critics have also pointed to delays in holding local government elections in Punjab and Islamabad, alleging selective enforcement. The ECP has previously cited legal and administrative constraints in relation to local polls.

Federal agents shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, less than three weeks after an Immigration and Cus­toms Enforcement (ICE) officer killed Renee Good, also 37.
While the Department of Homeland Security said Pretti carried a pistol and ammunition, cellphone footage has challenged the government’s description.
Minnesota Gov Tim Walz called the shooting “horrific” and demanded state authorities take charge.
“The federal government cannot be trusted to lead this investigation. The state will handle it, period,” Walz told a news conference.
Pretti’s parents described him as a “kindhearted soul” and disputed the official narrative.
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said in a statement. “Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked.”
Dimitri Drekonja, a colleague at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, said Pretti was a nurse working “to support critically ill Veterans.”
Political fallout spread to Was­hington, with Sen Bill Cassidy, a Republican, writing on X that the credibility of ICE and DHS is at stake.
“There must be a full joint federal and state investigation,” Cassidy wrote. “We can trust the American people with the truth.”







Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged President Donald Trump to end the immigration operation.
“This is a moment to act like a leader,” Frey said. “Put Min­neapolis, put America first in this moment — let’s achieve peace.”
The incident also drew condemnation at the Sundance Film Festival.
Olivia Wilde said the shooting was “unfathomable.” “I can’t bel­i­eve that we’re watching people get murdered in the street,” she told AFP at “The Invite” premiere.
“These brave Americans who have stepped out to protest the injustice of these ICE quote/unquote ‘officers,’ and watching them be murdered — it’s unfathomable. We cannot normalise it.” Natalie Portman became emotional as she described her feelings about a “horrible day”.
“What is happening in our country is just obscene,” she told AFP.
Gun rights advocates voiced concern over the administration linking Pretti’s legal gun possession to an intent to harm. After a federal prosecutor suggested shooting armed protesters is often justified, the National Rifle Association called the sentiment “dangerous and wrong”.
The Gun Owners of America added, “The Second Amendment protects Americans’ right to bear arms while protesting — a right the federal government must not infringe upon.”
Barack and Michelle Obama on Sunday forcefully condemned the killing of Pretti, saying in a joint statement it should be a “wake-up call” that core US values “are increasingly under assault.”
The former president and first lady blasted Trump and his government as seeming “eager to escalate the situation,” demanding they work with Walz and other local officials.

CAIRO: In another violation of the US-brokered ceasefire, Israeli troops killed two more Palestinians in the Tuffah neighbourhood in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday, and an Israeli drone wounded four others in a separate incident in Gaza City, local health authorities said. On Saturday, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians, two of them teenagers, in two drone attacks in Gaza.
Medical workers said an Israeli drone exploded on the rooftop of a multi-floor building in Gaza City, wounding four Palestinians in the street nearby.
There was no comment by the Israeli military on either incident.
Gaza has been reduced to rubble in the indiscriminate Israeli bombing.
The Gaza health ministry says more than 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed by Israeli fire since then.
It says that at least 480 people were killed by Israeli fire since the ceasefire agreement came into effect last October.
Earlier this month, Washington announced that the plan had now moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza, and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory’s administration.
Meanwhile, in Khan Younis, over a hundred people attended the funeral of a person who was killed by Israeli drone attack on Saturday, after holding special prayers in front of his white-shrouded body at the morgue in Nasser Hospital.
“They are liars, there is no ceasefire,” said Fares Erheimat, a relative of the dead man, during the funeral.
Ransom case
Israeli military said on Sunday it had launched an investigation into a soldier who reportedly fabricated a kidnapping of a Palestinian detainee and demanded ransom from his family.
The Palestinian man had been detained at a holding facility when a military police guard photographed him and sent the image to his family, falsely claiming he had been kidnapped, the Times of Israel reported.
In a separate report, Israeli Army Radio said the soldier demanded the family transfer money in exchange for his release.
Confirming the case, the military said an investigation had been launched but declined to provide details.
US envoys, Netanyahu discuss Rafah
US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reopen the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt during talks in Jerusalem, Israeli media reported Sunday.
The reports came after a newly appointed administrator for Gaza said on Thursday that the crossing would be operational in both directions next week.
Israeli news site Ynet reported, citing an unnamed Israeli official, that while the meeting between Netanyahu, Witkoff and Kushner was “positive”, Witkoff pressed Israel to reopen Rafah even before Hamas returns remains of the last Israeli prisoner believed to be held in Gaza.
According to the official, Witkoff also raised the possibility of Turkiye playing a role in Gaza’s future.
“Witkoff pushed to bring our greatest rival, Turkiye, to our border,” the official was quoted as saying.
The official also accused Witkoff of acting on behalf of Doha, saying he had “become a lobbyist for Qatari interests”, according to Ynet.
US officials’ discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the second phase of President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza were constructive, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday.
“The United States and Israel maintain a strong and longstanding relationship built on close coordination and shared priorities. The discussion was constructive and positive, with both sides aligned on next steps and the importance of continued cooperation on all matters critical to the region,” Witkoff said in an X post. The talks were held on Saturday, he said.







Published in Dawn, January 26th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-26 02:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/260741472622e82.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969086/federal-funding-for-provincial-health-schemes-ruled-out' target='_blank'><strong>Federal funding for provincial health schemes ruled out</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The federal government has decided it will not extend funding for provincial health coverage in any form, including insurance, in strict compliance with the 18th Constitutional Amendment and asked the provinces to consider providing full-fledged health insurance on a contributory basis.
The decision comes in the wake of recent engagements and approvals for extending the Prime Minister’s Sehat Sahulat Programme (SSP), valued at about Rs40 billion, to three federally administered territories: the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), launched earlier this month.
Against this backdrop, internal proposals to include the population of Sindh’s impoverished Tharparkar district under the SSP were not supported.
It was argued during meetings of the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) and the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), on the recommendation of a special committee constituted by the prime minister, that the inclusion of a single district would open the door for similar demands from other provinces, even though health is a devolved subject, documents seen by Dawn show.

Centre asks provinces to move towards contributory health insurance

At a high-level meeting chaired by the prime minister on Jan 2, the continuation of the programme beyond June 30, 2025, was approved until June 30, 2027 “for AJK, GB and ICT only”, according to a Prime Minister’s Office directive dated Jan 9, 2026.
Subsequently, the modified programme with a revised capital cost of Rs40.2bn was approved by the Ecnec “in light of the prime minister’s directive for the continuity of the programme beyond 30-06-2025 till 30-06-2027 for all permanent resident families of AJK, GB and ICT under universal health coverage (UHC) scope”.
Under an earlier decision of Ecnec of Aug 7, 2025, a special committee led by the planning minister to review the entire SSP since its inception in 2015 and way forward noted that the health programme had completed its life on June 30, 2025, after availing multiple revisions and time extensions. “There­fore, the programme should be shifted to the current budget,” the committee said.
It also directed the Ministry of National Health Services to submit a Project Completion (PC-IV) report and propose a thin structure to sustain activities and provide indoor healthcare services and protection from catastrophic health expenditures for vulnerable populations. The committee said this limited scope was in line with the programme’s original intent at the time of its launch.
The committee said that “provinces, AJK and GB should continue their own social health protection schemes for the vulnerable populations”.
The committee opposed the inclusion of “provincial districts via SSP” due to the fact that health was a devolved subject, and “if we start in one province, then there will be demand from other provinces too. Therefore, the provinces should implement their social health protection programmes for the vulnerable populations through their own budgets”.
It also cited the reduced Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), which it said was already overstretched and unable to meet even the most critical federal liabilities.
The committee, however, recommended that after conversion of the completed project to the recurrent budget, the health ministry should, with provinces, design a pilot project on an affordable basis through “claim co-payments” on the pattern of Punjab, and a roadmap towards a full-fledged Social Health Insurance (SHI) on a contributory basis should be looked into.
The original SSP was approved on Feb 7, 2018, under the Prime Minister’s National Health Programme Phase-II at a cost of Rs34bn.
It aimed to cover the entire population living below the poverty line, based on a 32.5 Poverty Means Test (PMT) score or an income threshold of $2 per day, using the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) database, with provinces contributing the secondary-care premium for their beneficiary families.
The national project exp­anded in subsequent revisions and extensions. In August 2019, all provinces except Balochistan were excluded from contributing to the priority-care treatment premium, with the federal government citing the spirit of the 18th Amendment under which both the health mandate and budgets were devolved to provinces. The programme ended on June 30, 2025.

WASHINGTON: A high-level Pakistani parliamentary delegation have urged US lawmakers this week to remove their country from a list of nations subject to str­ict immigration visa res­tri­ct­ions, calling the current classification a significant hur­dle in diplomatic relations.
Led by Senators Saleem H. Mandviwalla and Rana Mahmoodul Hassan, the delegation travelled to Washington to strengthen legislative ties and address specific bilateral concerns. Expe­rts from various sectors, inc­luding trade and business, were also part of the group.
The central focus of the dialogue was Pakistan’s inclusion among 75 nations whose citizens face heightened scrutiny and difficulties obtaining visas.
“Pakistan’s inclusion in the list of 75 countries whose nationals face visa difficulties is a serious issue,” Mr Mandviwalla said. “We hope this will soon be resolved and Pakistan’s name will be removed.”
To bolster their argument, Mr Man­dviwalla cited advice from the US amb­assador in Islamabad, who suggested clarifying to members of Congress that Pakistani Americans typically do not rely on social welfare benefits.
Dr Gholam Mujtaba, whose Pakistan Policy Institute USA organised the visit, noted that the diaspora is among the 10 most prosperous demographic groups in the United States.
“I raised this key point with the lawmakers,” Mr Mandviwalla said. “They understood our position, and after these talks, I can say with confidence that Pakistan will be removed from the list.”
The delegation met US lawmakers at the Rayburn House Office Building as part of an Inter-Parlia­mentary Group session. Rep. Estes praised the delegates for their efforts to bridge the legislative bodies. He also acknowledged Pakistan’s cooperation with peace initiatives, including early support for President Donald Trump’s Gaza Peace Board.
The delegation also met Rep. Al Green (DTX), Rep. Tom Suozzi (DNY), Rep. Josh Gottheimer (DNJ), and Rep. Laura Gillen (DNY).

 

A significant diplomatic outcome was an agreement by Green to form a Pakistan Strategic Bipartisan Cau­cus, intended to foster deeper strategic cooperation and sustained dialogue between the two nations’ legislatures.
During the meetings, the senators emphasised that their visit was strictly non-political. This distinction was made to address concerns from US officials regarding recent lobbying activities on Capitol Hill linked to supporters of former prime minister Imran Khan.
Senator Hassan noted that the delegation’s purpose was “constructive engagement, not politics”.
Beyond immigration, the officials discussed economic cooperation and Pakistan’s role in counterterrorism and regional stability. Mr Mandviwalla argued that reliance on executive channels alone is insufficient for a robust partnership.
“Relations must also thrive at the parliamentary level,” Mr Mandviwalla said. The delegation also discu­ssed economic and development cooperation, emphasising that Pakistan seeks partnership with the United States not out of weakness but as a strategic choice. The delegation concluded that these meetings mark an important step in strengthening Pakistan-US ties at the legislative level, complementing government-to-government relations and ensuring that bilateral engagement is inclusive, constructive, and sustainable.

PRESIDENT Trump shows the signed charter of the ‘Board of Peace’ in Davos.—Reuters

• Diplomats, press divided over New Delhi’s perceived reluctance to join Trump-led body• Given his propensity to paint himself as a global peacemaker, The Hindu warns US president may offer to mediate Kashmir dispute
DESPITE being invited to join the ‘Board of Peace’ by President Donald Trump, India has yet to formally get involved in the process.
Conspicuous by its absence from the Davos ceremony where 20 world leaders — including Trump and Pakistan’s PM Shehbaz Sharif — signed the board’s charter, some in India are viewing New Delhi’s reluctance through the lens of the Kashmir dispute.
President Trump says the board’s goal is to make the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza permanent and oversee an interim government in the Palestinian territory.
“This is not just for America, but for the whole world. I think we can spread it to other places. Like we did successfully in Gaza,” he had said at the time.
But there seems to be concern among some circles that if India signs up for the board — which Trump envisions as a future replacement for the United Nations — it may open up the disputed territory of held Kashmir to broader international or American scrutiny.
Although Trump has repeatedly offered to mediate on the Kashmir issue, especially in the wake of the May 2025 flare-up between the two South Asian rivals, New Delhi has firmly opposed all such overtures thus far.
According to a BBC Hindi report, the ‘Board of Peace’ is being formed at a time when the US is withdrawing from several UN organisations, raising the question of whether the board aims to render the world body irrelevant.
There is also a concern among some circles that the board will only strengthen a unipolar world, a system currently dominated by the US.
In a recent editorial on the issue, The Hindu newspaper painted Pakistan’s decision to join the board as “a warning signal to India”.
The newspaper attributed its alarm to the US president’s propensity to playing the ‘peacemaker’, having already claimed to have solved multiple regional and global conflicts during his first year in office.
“…[I]f Trump decides to include the Kashmir dispute in [his] peace plans, the Peace Board will try to resolve it. Once it joins the board, it will also be difficult for India to object to the deployment of its troops in the international peacekeeping force,” the editorial noted.
Former Indian ambassador to the United Nations, Syed Akbaruddin, recently wrote in the Times of India that the Security Council resolution has determined the term of this board is until Dec 31, 2027, and that it is obliged to report to the Security Council every six months.
This is done to ensure that this temporary arrangement does not turn into a permanent global model, he noted, adding that by contrast, Trump’s peace plan seems to have no set term and “could be used outside Gaza as well”.
He said that some UN officials are also indicating that this framework can be applied to other conflict areas.
But Ranjit Roy, who was India’s ambassador to Nepal and Vietnam, believes that it won’t be easy for New Delhi to take a decision on Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’.
“India’s dilemma has increased. Whether India accepts it or rejects it, it will have an impact. I think the risks of joining the Peace Board are high. First of all, Trump is its chairman and it seems pointless to expect justice from his transactional approach,” BBC Hindi quoted him as saying.
“It is not clear whether each country will have the same status in this,” said Roy.
“Just like in the UN General Assembly, each country has only one vote. When the Security Council approved it, it was limited to Gaza, but now that there have been changes, it could extend beyond Gaza.”
The editorial in The Hindu argued that “the rift in US-India relations and the delicate situation of trade talks may also be reasons for not rejecting Trump’s invitation at this stage. Doing so could incur Trump’s displeasure, as in the case of the French president.”

Their criticism, through press conferences, television talk shows, and public forums, centred particularly on two major policy shifts in the wheat sector: the withdrawal of the wheat support price, and the abolition of the decades-old practice of direct procurement from farmers. They warned that farmers were likely to reduce the wheat-sown area in the upcoming season in protest, as most had received prices ranging between Rs1,800 and 2,200 per 40kg — far less than their production costs and the import parity price.
Several independent experts also predicted a decline in wheat acreage, particularly in Punjab, where the government imposed district-specific wheat ceiling prices of around Rs2,800 per 40kg once prices began to rebound after a period of oversupply during harvest season. This artificial price suppression through administrative measures — quite contrary to the principles of deregulation and free market economy — hurts farmers who managed to hold their stocks for better prices.
Surprisingly, in contrast to earlier predictions, the first estimate of the 2025-26 wheat crop prepared by the Crop Reporting Service (Government of the Punjab) indicates that in Punjab — which produces 76 per cent of the country’s wheat — the crop has been sown over 16.41 million acres compared to 16.25m acres in 2024–25. This reflects an increase of 159,000 acres.

Historically, farmers have preferred wheat because most alternative crops require higher upfront investments, provide lower or uncertain financial returns, or lack developed marketing channels

The Punjab government has taken credit for this expansion, attributing it to the timely announcement of an indicative price (not a support price) of Rs3,500 per 40kg, a reduction in the price of certified wheat seeds, and an effective sowing campaign.
If the integrity of this data holds up, this raises a critical question: what is the ground reality? Have farmers once again been drawn in by government assurances — particularly the Rs3,500 indicative price — or do they simply have limited viable alternatives to wheat? There is a possibility that many farmers opted to sow wheat, anticipating that a reduction in total wheat acreage would reduce supply and lead to higher market prices this year.
In part, the answer lies in the timely announcement of an indicative price, which helped revive farmers’ confidence. However, the deeper reality is that Pakistan grows a very limited number of Kharif and Rabi crops — excluding vegetables, which have a wide range, but cannot be cultivated on a large scale due to limited domestic consumption and constrained export opportunities.
For wheat growers, alternative cropping options vary across various regions of Pakistan. For example, in the Sahiwal division, farmers can shift from wheat to potatoes, garlic, canola, mustard, and spring maize. Likewise, farmers in the Sargodha division may opt for sugarcane (a year-long crop), chickpeas, lentils, maize, and oilseeds. Similarly, in some regions, sunflowers and tobacco can replace wheat.  
Historically, farmers have preferred wheat because most alternative crops require higher upfront investments due to costly seeds and fertilisers, provide lower or uncertain financial returns compared to wheat, or lack well-developed marketing channels, particularly when grown outside their established production clusters.
In contrast, wheat requires relatively few and simple agricultural operations. It can be grown under both irrigated/rain-fed or water-scarce conditions, which makes it suitable across a wide range of agro-ecological zones. Wheat is less susceptible to pest and disease infestations and relatively more resilient to climatic variability than many alternative crops. Moreover, it is traded even in the smallest local grain markets, so farmers face minimal marketing constraints. Additionally, smallholders who rear livestock are compelled to grow wheat, as wheat straw serves as an essential fodder source.
These attributes make wheat particularly attractive to risk-averse farmers who seek ease, stability, and predictability. As such, wheat has historically remained the preferred choice for absentee landlords.
An analysis of wheat acreage trends over the past 25 years further reinforces this pattern. With the exception of the last year, the maximum year-on-year decline in wheat area was limited to 3.3pc, recorded in 2000–01 compared with 1999–2000. In contrast, during 2024–25, wheat acreage declined sharply by 5.5pc, largely due to the import of 3.6m tonnes of wheat in early 2024, coupled with the Punjab government’s abrupt refusal to procure the 2024 harvest from farmers.
In conclusion, given the limited crop alternatives available to Pakistani farmers, wheat is likely to remain the country’s dominant crop, with the risk of no more than a 5.5pc reduction in cultivated area in any given year. However, every farmer has an economic threshold, beyond which sustained losses compel a shift to alternative crops.
In light of the past two years, the government must ensure — through appropriate policy interventions and administrative measures — that the new wheat crop trades at the promised rate of Rs3,500 per 40kg, a level that covers production costs and allows at least a bare minimum margin for farmers.
Failure to honour this commitment would further erode government credibility — already weakened by unmet assurances over the last two years. On the other hand, for the country, even a 5pc reduction in wheat acreage could necessitate the import of approximately 1.5m tonnes, which requires massive foreign exchange.

A more informed and connected population trapped in economic stagnation creates fertile ground for populism, criminal and terrorist networks. Yet, with timely policy shifts that unlock sustained growth, the same awareness and connectivity could drive rapid development.
Almost universal connectivity, rapid digitisation, and access to limitless online information have dismantled the old notion that deprivation is a matter of fate. Greater public exposure to comforts online has sparked aspirations and increased awareness of wealth and income disparity and opportunity gaps. While the desire to improve life and living standards is powerful, the absence of a clear pathway for personal growth and career advancement pushes many towards shortcuts, often blurring ethical boundaries.
The latest HIES shows little progress in key social and economic indicators since the FY19 survey. Literacy rose only marginally from 60 per cent to 63pc, while the share of out-of-school children aged 5-16 declined slightly from 30pc to 28pc. 
Health outcomes improved marginally: better immunisation coverage, pre- and post-natal care, and access to skilled birth attendants helped reduce neonatal and infant mortality, yet rates remain high at 35 and 47 per thousand live births, respectively. Gains in housing quality, access to piped water and sanitation are simply limited and male employment rates have dropped.

Pakistan has become one of the region’s most digitally connected societies, yet social progress remains slow and male employment has fallen

In contrast, the survey records a dramatic surge in digital connectivity. Household internet access more than doubled from 34pc in FY19 to 70pc in FY25. Mobile phone ownership reached 96pc of households, with 98pc of urban households connected to the internet. Individual internet use rose sharply from 17pc to 57pc over the period.  
“Better-informed individuals can clearly see the gap between their living standards and those of the wealthy. This sense of ‘relative deprivation’ is a powerful source of discontent. People increasingly recognise that their circumstances are not merely the result of personal failure but stem from broader structural problems, including political patronage, unfair systems, wage stagnation, limited access to affordable education, and discrimination. This awareness fuels frustration with the existing order, replacing passive acceptance with growing resentment,” remarked an analyst anonymously.
“Despite private security and state-of-the-art safeguards at my home and factories, I don’t feel safe,” a leading business tycoon said, reflecting on Bangladesh’s 2024 youth uprising. “I fear the anger of a large pool of frustrated young people turning against those seen as successful. I don’t believe that the state could protect the elite if mob fury spills over. I‘ve already moved my family abroad and am exploring options to shift part of my business to the West.”
“I believe the risk of public backlash spiralling into an anarchic situation is real. The government must act swiftly to stabilise the economy and pursue a more inclusive growth model. The elite should also curb conspicuous consumption to avoid provoking public resentment. Businesses, meanwhile, need to abandon the practice of suppressing wages, which form only a small share of costs and are already far below global norms, and start respecting employees’ right to dignified living,” a leading businessman said privately.
However, an Islamabad-based economist questioned, “Are the HIES findings even credible? Can a sample survey truly reflect on-ground reality?” The survey, conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), covers 2,343 enumeration blocks and 32,785 households nationwide.
Defended the HIES methodology, PBS’s chief statistician, Dr Naeem uz Zafar, noted that the high mobile penetration is corroborated by the Pakistan Telecommunication Agency. He acknowledged the puzzling decline in male employment, partly reflected in gig work captured by the Labour Force Survey FY25. 
He added that while enrolment gains appear modest, improving gender parity and stronger female participation in education indicate greater human capital gains for women. Improvements in family planning and maternal, newborn, and child health indicators, he said, also point to growing awareness and better health outcomes.
A formal cabinet response on the HIES did not arrive by the deadline, but Dr Nadeem Javed, Vice Chancellor, Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, described the survey as revealing “a striking paradox”: Pakistan has become one of the region’s most digitally connected societies, with near universal mobile ownership and about 70pc internet access, yet social progress remains slow and male employment has fallen. 
He attributed this to household economic stress in recent years. While household incomes rose by roughly 97pc, household spending climbed faster, about 133pc, driven largely by higher electricity, gas and health costs. This squeezed spending on food, education and small businesses.
“Digital access on its own could not offset these pressures. Without digital work and commerce, connectivity remains a convenience rather than a livelihood,” he argued. “As recovery takes hold, policy must pivot from access to opportunity, linking connectivity with skills, online work, digital trade and small business growth to translate reach into productivity, incomes and human development,” Dr Javed added.

What once sounded like Silicon Valley evangelism is now being articulated from the very centre of global capital markets. Fink’s claim is simple but sweeping: the conversion of real-world assets into digital tokens on distributed ledgers will mark the next structural leap in finance, comparable to the shift from paper certificates to electronic settlement or from dial-up internet to broadband. Crucially, this is no longer a theoretical proposition. BlackRock itself has begun deploying capital and credibility behind the idea.
The most concrete example is BlackRock’s tokenised money-market product, known as the BUIDL fund, which invests in short-term US Treasury instruments and cash equivalents while issuing ownership in digital token form on public blockchains.
Since its launch in 2024, the fund has grown rapidly and now holds assets running into several billion dollars, making it the largest tokenised Treasury product globally. It distributes yield to investors via blockchain rails and allows near-instant settlement, even as the underlying assets remain among the safest and most conventional in global finance. For Fink, this hybrid structure illustrates his broader point: tokenisation is not about replacing traditional finance but upgrading its plumbing.

Tokenised assets today still only represent a tiny sliver of global financial markets, and participation remains overwhelmingly institutional

In his recent communications to investors, Fink has described tokenisation as the “next generation of markets”. In practical terms, this means representing equities, bonds, funds, real estate or even infrastructure assets as programmable digital units that can be transferred peer-to-peer, settled instantly, and traded continuously rather than during narrow market hours.
Smart contracts embedded in these tokens can automate compliance, coupon payments, dividend distributions and corporate actions. The promise is radical efficiency. Settlement cycles measured in days could shrink to minutes, counterparty risk could be reduced, and vast sums currently immobilised in clearing and margin processes could be released back into productive use.
The economic logic is compelling. Today’s financial system still relies on multiple layers of intermediaries, reconciliations and batch processing. Tokenisation, at least in theory, collapses these layers into a single shared ledger.
For institutional investors, this could mean lower costs and better risk management. For issuers, it could mean faster access to capital and broader investor reach. For policymakers, it offers unprecedented transparency, with every transaction recorded and auditable. It is this efficiency dividend that underpins projections by consultants and banks that tokenised real-world assets could eventually run into trillions of dollars globally.
Fink also frames tokenisation as a democratising force. By enabling fractional ownership, assets previously accessible only to large institutions or wealthy individuals could, in principle, be opened to smaller investors. A commercial building, a private credit fund or a long-dated bond could be divided into thousands of digital units, each tradable independently. This idea of “democratising yield” has obvious political and social appeal, particularly at a time when inequality and financial exclusion dominate policy debates.
Yet, between promise and practice lies a considerable gap. Tokenised assets today still only represent a tiny sliver of global financial markets, and participation remains overwhelmingly institutional. Regulatory uncertainty is a major constraint. Most jurisdictions have yet to fully define the legal status of tokenised securities, the enforceability of smart contracts, or the treatment of digital wallets under insolvency law. Without clarity, large-scale adoption will remain cautious and incremental rather than revolutionary.
There are also deeper structural concerns. While blockchain technology is often associated with decentralisation, the version of tokenisation being advanced by major asset managers risks reinforcing concentration rather than dispersing power. If liquidity pools, custody systems and compliance layers are effectively controlled by a handful of global institutions, the benefits may accrue primarily to incumbents rather than to retail investors or smaller market participants. Cutting out traditional intermediaries does not automatically make markets fairer if new gatekeepers emerge in their place.
Cybersecurity and digital identity pose another challenge. Tokenised assets are only as secure as the systems that safeguard private keys and verify ownership. High-profile hacks in the digital asset space have already demonstrated how quickly confidence can evaporate when security fails. Fink himself has acknowledged that a credible, global framework for digital identity is essential if tokenised markets are to scale safely. Without it, risks of fraud, money laundering and market abuse will remain uncomfortably high.
For Pakistani readers, this debate is not an abstract one confined to Wall Street. Pakistan’s financial markets suffer from chronic shallowness, limited product diversity and high transaction costs. In theory, tokenisation could allow Pakistani issuers to tap global pools of capital more efficiently, while offering domestic investors access to a wider range of assets. But this would require proactive regulatory engagement, investment in digital infrastructure and a willingness to rethink legacy systems. Absent that, Pakistan risks watching another global financial transformation unfold from the sidelines.
There is also a cautionary lesson. Technology alone does not guarantee inclusion or stability. Without strong governance, tokenisation could amplify volatility, facilitate capital flight, or create new forms of systemic risk that regulators struggle to understand. The history of financial innovation is littered with tools that promised efficiency but delivered fragility when misused.
Larry Fink’s advocacy matters because BlackRock’s scale gives his words weight. When the steward of nearly $14tr signals that tokenisation is not a passing fad but a strategic priority, regulators, central banks and market participants are forced to pay attention. Whether tokenisation ultimately reshapes global finance or settles into a narrower role as back-office infrastructure remains uncertain. What is clear is that the conversation has moved decisively from the margins to the mainstream. For countries like Pakistan, the question is no longer whether this future will arrive, but whether they will be prepared when it does.

Unfortunately, Pakistan has often approached market access with insufficient care. The prevailing perception equates the signing of trade agreements with economic achievement, but this is a misjudgment.
Trade agreements serve their purpose only when they enhance access to markets for products that the exporting country can produce competitively and for which there is clear demand in the importing country.
In Pakistan’s case, the absence of comparative advantage has led to underperforming agreements. While Pakistan has opened its markets quickly to imports, the resulting export growth has been modest, frequently limited to basic commodities like raw cotton — products that ideally should be processed into higher-value items domestically. Early export gains have also been eroded as major partners, such as China, extend more favourable terms to trading blocs like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).

Trade agreements reward countries with existing competitiveness; they do not serve as a remedy for those lacking it

In contrast with Vietnam
Rather than pursuing trade agreements as diplomatic achievements, Vietnam focused on obtaining market access where there was actual demand, simultaneously working to strengthen its own production capabilities and comparative advantage.
The country negotiated predictable access to some of the world’s largest consumer markets — including the US, the EU, and key Asian economies — for products it was actively developing the capacity to export, such as electronics, machinery, footwear, furniture, and advanced manufactured goods. In Vietnam, trade agreements reinforced a broader industrial strategy centred on exports; they were not used as substitutes for genuine domestic reform.
On the other hand, Pakistan often signs agreements before building a robust industrial base or sound policy. When domestic production is uncompetitive, supply chains are weak, and firms lack compliance capabilities, free trade agreements tend to favour imports over exports, leading to stagnant export growth.
Asymmetry without preparedness
The China–Pakistan Free Trade Agreement exemplifies the challenges faced by Pakistan. By granting market access to the world’s foremost manufacturing economy, Pakistan exposed its own industries without first ensuring they were competitive. Although subsequent revisions improved tariff lines on paper, many concessions were made on products that either China does not import, or Pakistan does not produce or export.
When accounting for such mismatches, the headline figure of duty-free access on 75 per cent of HS lines by 2030 drops to a practical benefit of only 23pc. As such, the elimination of tariffs is meaningless unless it applies to products Pakistan can supply at scale.
Pakistani firms struggle with high energy costs, unpredictable tax policies, fragmented supply chains, weak skills, and inadequate trade facilitation. As a result, improved trade agreements do not translate into sustained export growth, while imports continue to surge, further undermining local industry. The core issue is the lack of synchronisation between trade concessions and domestic reforms, as well as insufficient enforcement of safeguards, rules of origin, and performance benchmarks.
Real imbalance with Malaysia and Indonesia
Similar patterns emerge in Pakistan’s agreements with Malaysia and Indonesia. Concessions have largely focused on palm oil, rather than on areas aligned with Pakistan’s export strengths or the demands of partner countries.
Additionally, both Malaysia and Indonesia are obligated to prioritise Asean members, limiting the scope of genuine market access for Pakistan. Consequently, bilateral trade has grown, but mainly to the benefit of Malaysia and Indonesia. Imports have increased, while Pakistani exports have not kept pace. The reduction in import duties on edible oil, for instance, has led to cheaper imports but diminished incentives for local production.
Limited engagement with Africa
Africa, with its 54 countries, 1.6 billion people, and $3 trillion GDP, represents a major untapped opportunity. Yet, Pakistan has only established a single trade agreement in the region with Mauritius, a country of just 1.3 million people and a $16bn GDP.
In contrast, India has agreements with 17 African nations and maintains a much more significant presence. Mauritius accounts for less than 1pc of Pakistan’s total trade with Africa. Furthermore, India has six agreements with Latin American countries, while Pakistan has none.
While it would be imprudent to pursue agreements without the ability to supply competitively, there is a clear need for policies that actively promote exports.
Türkiye and the risk of repeating mistakes
Türkiye is often described as a close partner, but emotional ties do not alter economic realities. Both countries compete directly in key sectors, particularly textiles and apparel, which are central to Pakistan’s exports. Granting increased access to Turkish value-added goods, without securing meaningful reciprocal benefits, would place additional strain on Pakistan’s industrial base.
The current preferential arrangement remains limited and cautious, reflecting these challenges. Without comprehensive industrial reform and careful sequencing, expanding the agreement risks replicating the import-heavy outcomes seen in other partnerships.
Cautious expectations
Calls for a trade agreement with Vietnam should be tempered by realistic expectations. Vietnam enjoys significant advantages in cost, scale, quality, and product diversity across most manufacturing sectors. There is limited overlap between Pakistan’s export capabilities and Vietnam’s import needs, and where overlap does exist, Pakistan is seldom the more competitive supplier.
Such an agreement might offer marginal gains for niche products, but absent substantial domestic reforms, it would likely benefit Vietnamese exporters more than Pakistani ones. Vietnam’s example demonstrates that trade agreements reward countries with existing competitiveness; they do not serve as a remedy for those lacking it.
A market-access test for Pakistan
Before entering, amending, or expanding any trade agreement, Pakistan should ask: Is the agreement targeting sectors with strong demand for products that Pakistan can scale within three to five years? Have domestic barriers related to cost and compliance been addressed? Are concessions phased, protected, and linked to measurable outcomes? Is there capacity to enforce origin rules and standards effectively? And finally, are agreements periodically reviewed against export performance, with mechanisms for renegotiation if targets are not met?
Trade agreements are policy tools, not achievements in themselves. Pakistan must shift its focus from viewing free trade agreements as headline achievements to treating them as disciplined instruments of industrial policy, targeted at sectors where the country can realistically build and sustain a comparative advantage, rather than relying on perpetual protectionism.

The PTI-led KP government has repeatedly opposed military operations in the province, an issue that has created friction between the party, the centre and the establishment, with the latter accusing PTI of providing sanctuary to militants.
Speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan with Shehzad Iqbal, Jan said the 24-member Jirga, which agreed on the displacement from Tirah before the operation, was “forced” to sign.
Referring to the federal government’s statement that it had not issued any orders for the “depopulation” of Tirah, Jan said a large-scale military operation was being “imposed” rather than routine intelligence-based operations.
When asked about the Khyber deputy commissioner’s (DC) signatures, he said the DC signed the deal just to facilitate the people, because the government “knew that the people would be evacuated”.
“KP’s cabinet approved Rs4 billion for the people of Tirah, because we knew that they were going to be displaced.”
Jan insisted that the operation was permitted by the Inspector-General Frontier Crops, Core Commander and KP’s Chief Secretary, saying that “Chief Secretary is the representative of the federal government.”
“We will never be part of this military operation; neither do we support it, nor have we been taken into confidence,” he said.
He criticised that, “They [government] don’t want to curb terrorism, people have doubts about their intentions.”
“They wanted to damage KP CM Sohail Afridi’s political esteem.”
Jan further alleged that, “It is a war of narrative,” saying, “They are trying to build a new narrative.”
He reiterated that KP CM would call a Jirga on Sunday, and people would testify by themselves.
He claimed that the federal government had offered Rs17 billion for internally displaced persons, and the provincial government received this amount for three years; however, for the past three years, the KP government has received nothing.
“There are 17,000 families in total, and 12,000 of them have been registered.”
“The snowfall has made the relocation really difficult,” he said.
He further mentioned that the federal government was now running from its own narrative.
“We will call the Pashtun jirga and reveal all the facts.”
‘No large-scale military operation in Tirah’
Speaking on the same platform, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal denied any large-scale military operation in Tirah, saying, “people are relocating due to the deteriorating law and order situation, which was a provincial government’s failure.”
He recalled the federal government’s statement that was only routine intelligence-based operations in Tirah to target the terrorists’ pockets.
“The PTI government is not paying attention to ensure law and order in the province,” he said. “Law and order is a provincial subject.”
He recalled that back in 2018, the federal government had terminated terrorism from KP; however, “PTI allowed terrorists to return and get settled there.”
Iqbal blamed the PTI government for shielding Fitna Al Khawarij, the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“PTI wants to give a free hand to terrorists in KP,” he said.
The planning minister said that PTI had to choose between the terrorists and Pakistan and that the party was “trying to create a rift between the state and the people.”</p><small>2026-01-25 19:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/25235235cf1fc8f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969013/mqm-p-urges-pm-shehbaz-to-form-inquiry-committee-into-gul-plaza-inferno' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P urges PM Shehbaz to form inquiry committee into Gul Plaza inferno</strong></a><br><p>HAYDERABAD: Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Haider Abbas Rizvi has reiterated the party’s demand for the formation of an inquiry commission by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, including members from Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and others, to probe the Gul Plaza inferno.
Addressing a press conference on Sunday in Hyderabad, Rizvi said that MQM chairman Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui had also written a letter to the prime minister to seek the formation of an inquiry commission under the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act 2017.
“This commission must comprise representatives from FIA, IB, ISI, MI, NDMA and other federal bodies to find whether it is an act of subversion or an incident of fire”.
He lambasted the Sindh government and Karachi administration for throwing debris of the fire, which also included remains of the deceased, at the Meva Shah ground, saying it would “compromise forensic investigation of the tragedy”.
“It looks like evidence is being stolen, although the crime scene’s sanctity should be protected and preserved under international standards.”
“This debris includes remains of the deceased. Those were not bones and limbs of cats and dogs. They all were humans”, Rizvi said.
“Gul Plaza is a crime scene which needs to be preserved and kept intact till the inquiry is completed”, he said, adding it was not done yet. “If I use the least possible terms, then I will say that Karachi administration and the Sindh government are accused of serious criminal negligence in this case.”
Rizvi said that to make matters worse, the Sindh government had been a judge of its own cause. “You are accused in this case. You face charges of this tragedy, yet you are holding investigations yourselves. You should have asked the federal government to come clean on it and let there be a federal probe”, he maintained.
However, MQM-P leader said, it was interesting that while the government faces the charges, it would become a complainant too in the matter and then give its own verdict. “The government itself is registering FIR. Why is there so much haste in registering a first information report (FIR)? And why the debris is dumped at the Meva Shah graveyard when it includes remains of deceased”, he wondered.
“When we raise a question, you find it politicking”
He asked the government whether it could identify 83 bodies using DNA samples.
“You are not even able to perform DNA tests and seek the help of the Punjab government”, he said.
Rizvi said it was quite disappointing to say that while e-challan could be issued for not using a seat belt in Karachi, the city lacked an effective firefighting system.
He said that Karachi was not “a colony of the Sindh government”.
Former MNA said even before the Jan 17 tragedy, MQM had launched its ‘Karachi bachao’ campaign and urged people to share their civic amenities-related and other problems in their short videos, which would be channelised by MQM accordingly so that people would know the PPP government’s “achievements” in Karachi even after receiving billions under the new NFC in the last 15 years.
“Nobody knows where this huge amount is spent”, he claimed and sarcastically said that Karachi used to be Sindh’s capital, but now this ‘capital’ had been shifted to Dubai. “Everything is being invested in Dubai now.”
He questioned the PPP government’s performance, especially in the backdrop of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s long presentation to diplomats in Islamabad.
“One must understand that PPP capitalises on the Gambat hospital, SIUT (Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation) Karachi and the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD).”
MQM-P leader said people know that NICVD had been a federal institution and was performing well even then, and likewise, SIUT was a product of Dr Syed Adeebul Hassan Rizvi.
“MQM will launch the Sindh Bachao campaign, which will start from Hyderabad today (Sunday).”
‘28th Amendment’
Former MNA said MQM was actively working with the federal government over the 28th amendment in order to ensure inclusion of implementation clauses of Article 140-A in the Constitution.
He said that this was agreed upon at the time of the 26th and 27th amendment but PPP blocked it.
“MQM is demanding formation of fully empowered local governments for the entire Sindh, but PPP doesn’t want it as it believes in colonial era local government bodies and that’s why PPP and MQM were poles apart on this issue”, he told a questioner.
Raizvi said MQM believed in participatory democracy, whereas PPP’s democracy revolves around provincial and federal governments alone.</p><small>2026-01-25 19:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/25201854b6f2655.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968996/death-toll-from-karachis-gul-plaza-fire-rises-to-73-23-identified-so-far' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from Karachi’s Gul Plaza fire rises to 73; 23 identified so far</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The number of lives lost in the tragic Gul Plaza fire rose yet again on Sunday as two more bodies were recovered from the rubble, taking the death toll to 73.

The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has so far claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins. Over a week later, efforts to scour through the debris for the remains of the dead are still underway.
Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalal Shaikh told Dawn that the search operation was in the final phase and would likely be completed on Sunday night.
He pointed out that five per cent of the basement was yet to be searched, which was under debris.
The Rescue 1122 COO said that the operation was halted briefly as the district administration arranged a visit from forensic experts, who collected samples.
The search efforts were resumed when the experts left the premises.

 

In a first information report (FIR) of the incident, dated January 23, the Karachi police said the fire was an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”.
The case was registered against unknown persons as the police have not nominated anyone in the case.



Funerals held in Karachi, Sukkur
On Sunday afternoon, the funeral prayers of four individuals of a family — out of six who had come to Gul Plaza for shopping when the fire erupted — were offered at Eidgah Ground in Delhi Colony.
Saad, Kausar, Mariam and Misbah were among those identified, while two remained missing.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Dr Farooq Sattar, Jamaat-i-Islami’s Monem Zafar and PPP’s Syed Najmi Alam were among several politicians who attended the prayers.







Separately, the funeral prayer of one of the victims, Shees, was held near Kashti Chowk in the Garden area. It was also attended by residents and political leaders.
Meanwhile, Sukkur Mayor Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh attended the funeral of Mohammad Athar, a resident of Sukkur who lost his life in the incident.
According to the state-run APP, Athar, a father of two sons and two daughters, had gone to Gul Plaza to purchase necessary items for arranging Taraweeh prayers during Ramazan.
The Sukkur mayor announced that a special fund has been established to support the bereaved family, providing them with financial assistance.
‘I just want the body of my child’
Speaking to the media, grieving families recalled details of their near and dear ones still missing.
Among them was the mother of Imran Ibrahim, a married man who resided in Lyari’s Naya Abad area.
“I am coming to Gul Plaza daily, but being pushed away. I don’t want anything, I just want the body of my child,” said the grieving mother.
She said her son had been working at a crockery shop for the last three years.
Recalling events of the incident, the mother said she spoke to her son at around 10pm, who said he was working overtime and would return home at 2am.
She said all family members were asleep, assuming that her son might have returned, but they came to know in the morning that a huge fire had erupted at Gul Plaza.
The mother lamented that she is asked to go home when she visits Civil Hospital Karachi, and no one informs her about her, so when she comes to Gul Plaza.



Meanwhile, the father of another missing man, namely Hafiz Arif, told the media that he and family members have been visiting Gul Plaza for the last nine days, but no one has responded to their plight.
The father, a resident of Godhra Colony in the New Karachi area, wondered what steps the government was taking.
Sharing harrowing details of his son’s last call to him and his mother, the aggrieved father said Arif was uttering words, “Please Abu, Ami, (father, mother) save my life, as I cannot comprehend anything.”
The father recalled that they asked their son to recite the Kalma (declaration of faith).
He added that when they reached Gul Plaza on the night of January 17, they saw that fire had spread throughout the entire building.
“We would leave the place if any sign of our son was given, even remains,” said the grieving father.
Arif was the father of two children, including a 20-day-old son.
Governor visits bereaved family
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori also paid a visit to the bereaved family of Aftab, where he announced that he would sponsor the education for all four of his children.
Tessori further said that Khizar Tahneel, a builder who was accompanying him, had announced a plot for the family of each deceased person.
“It has been seven days today, but his brother’s body has not been found,” the governor said, referring to Aftab.
Addressing the Sindh government, he said, “You are having them make rounds to get the DNA report from so and so place, and the death certificate from so and so department. [Instead,] make a counter there.”
He urged the administration to deliver such documents at the doorsteps of the affected families.

 

Tessori raised questions about why the bodies were “not being recovered” and why DNA reports and death certificates were “not being issued”.
“Do we have the power or administration? Give it to us, then see how the city shines,” he said.
The governor wondered why the closed doors of Gul Plaza were not broken, noting that machinery was available to “demolish buildings” when needed.
Tessori calls for judicial commission
Tessori called for a judicial commission comprising Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, MPAs and others.
“If he is not at fault, I will hug the mayor,” he quipped.
“I am not saying anyone deliberately sparked the fire. I am only saying that fix responsibility for whose mistake or incapability it was, or who was inadequately equipped, and take them to justice.”



The MQM-P leader assailed the PPP-led Sindh government for terming questions and concerns raised over the fire as “politics”.
“Their aim is not to talk about it, as if what has happened has happened, leave it behind and wait for the next incident. And then again they will say ‘do not do politics on it’,” Tessori said.
He remarked, “Your statements reflect pride. Your statements show power, that no one can do anything to us.”
The governor also denied he had a protocol accompanying him when he visited Gul Plaza after finding out about the fire. “Be afraid of that day when I will bring out the suitcases filled with evidence,” he said.
Separately, speaking at the convocation of a seminary on late Saturday night, Tessori announced the launch of a free fire-safety training programme at the Governor’s House.
He said all associations and market organisations may contact the Governor’s House to benefit from this initiative.</p><small>2026-01-25 18:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/252224078e0e1ea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969007/bannu-peace-committee-member-killed-cousin-injured-in-targeted-attack-near-afghan-refugee-camp' target='_blank'><strong>Bannu peace committee member killed, cousin injured in targeted attack near Afghan refugee camp</strong></a><br><p>A peace committee member in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district was shot dead in a targeted killing near an Afghan refugee camp, while his cousin sustained serious injuries, the police said on Sunday.
“The incident took place at the Afghan Refugees Camp in Domel tehsil, and the victims have been identified as Khwajatullah and Naseemullah,” the police said.
“Both belonged to Gangi Khel.”
The statement added that the incident occurred when Khwajatullah and Naseemullah were at a shop in Tehsil Colony to purchase groceries.
“At that moment, two unidentified armed men arrived and opened indiscriminate fire on them,” it read.
“As a result of the firing, Khwajatullah died on the spot, while Naseemullah was injured. The injured person was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where he is currently under medical treatment.”
In his statement to Domel Police, Naseemullah stated that the attack was sudden and that they had no personal enmity or dispute with anyone.
District Police Officer Yasir Afridi said, “Investigations are underway, and all possible angles are being examined to ascertain the motives behind the incident.”
Separately, police neutralised explosive material planted by unknown terrorists on Eidgah Road in Domel.
According to a police official, the highly dangerous explosives weighed between three and four kilogrammes and were fitted with a remote-controlled device.
“Thanks to the professional expertise and prompt response of the Bomb Disposal Squad, the area was saved from a major tragedy,” he said.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.
Armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee on January 13, police confirmed.
Violence in Bannu has included attacks on police and jirga members, prompting targeted operations by police and security forces in various localities to disrupt militant networks.</p><small>2026-01-25 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/25235156f87690f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969012/indonesia-resumes-search-for-80-after-landslide-kills-10-in-west-java' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia resumes search for 80 after landslide kills 10 in West Java</strong></a><br><p>Indonesian authorities resumed search-and-rescue efforts for 80 people missing after a landslide killed 10 in a residential area of West Java province.
The landslide early on Saturday was triggered by heavy rains starting the day before, which the weather agency warned could continue for a week in the province and several other regions.
Resident Dedi Kurniawan, 36, said it was the first big landslide he had witnessed in Pasir Langu village in a hilly area of the province about 100 km (60 miles) southeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
“Sometimes we have only small floods from the nearest river, but this time (the landslide) came from the forest,” he told Reuters.
Rescuers were hampered on Saturday as unstable terrain and rain hindered them from deploying heavy machinery, Kompas TV reported, citing authorities.
There were multiple reports of floods in West Java, including Jakarta. The floods have caused residents in heavily impacted areas to evacuate to higher ground or unaffected places.
The landslide occurred two months after cyclone-induced floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra killed 1,200 people, destroyed homes and displaced over a million residents.</p><small>2026-01-25 18:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2510234104e7354.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968991/armed-forces-federal-govt-have-not-issued-any-orders-for-depopulation-of-tirah-information-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Armed forces, federal govt have not issued any orders for ‘depopulation’ of Tirah: information ministry</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Information has said that neither the armed forces nor the federal government has issued any orders for the “depopulation” of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah Valley, where residents have been vacating their houses amid concerns about a planned military operation against militants.
“The government has taken notice of misleading claims in circulation regarding alleged ‘depopulation’ from Tirah Valley on the orders of the army.
“These assertions are baseless, malicious, and driven by ulterior motives aimed at creating alarm among the public. No directive has been issued for the depopulation of Tirah by the federal government and the armed forces,” a post on the ministry’s X account said on Sunday.







The ministry further maintained in its statement that law enforcement agencies had been routinely conducting “targeted, intelligence-based operations, strictly against terrorist elements, with full care to avoid disruption to civilian life, for which no migration is needed or being undertaken”.
“It may be noted that the local population is increasingly concerned over the presence of khawarij (a term that the state uses for terrorists) and desire peace and stability in Tirah,” the ministry said.
It recalled that the KP government’s Relief, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Department had issued a notification for the release of funds — reportedly Rs4 billion — on December 26, 2025.
The ministry said the purpose for the release of the funds was stated to be the “anticipated temporary and voluntary movement of population from certain localities of Tirah (Bagh)”. Moreover, the ministry continued, the provincial department had also “requested the facilitation of advance preparedness and relief-related arrangements, including transportation, food support, cash assistance, and establishment and management of transit and registration points”.
It further quoted the notification as stating that “the deputy commissioner, Khyber (where Tirah is located), has further conveyed that the proposed voluntary movement reflects the views and preferences of the local population, articulated through a representative jirga convened at the district level, taking into account seasonal, logistical and contextual considerations, as well as a on-camp based modality”.
“Hence, any stated position of the provincial government or their officials being conveyed to the media that the said migration has anything to do with the armed forces is false and fabricated, given with mala fide intent to gain political capital and, unfortunately, malign security institutions and, therefore, highly regrettable,” the ministry’s statement said.
While the ministry’s statement does not specifically refer to any statement by the KP government or its officials in particular, it comes against the backdrop of the PTI-led provincial government distancing itself from the developments in Tirah.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also reiterated the clarification while speaking to reporters in Kot Momin later in the day.
He asserted that people “relocate voluntarily” every year when the winter weather gets harsh.
Stressing that any operations conducted are intelligence-based and “area-specific”, Tarar said, “Those elements giving the impression that it is a forced evacuation are giving a wrong impression and spreading misinformation.”
Asked about the objections raised by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, Tarar advised him to “pay attention to the public’s issues”.
“Establish Safe City [project], CTD force and forensic labs, make people’s lives easier, improve law and order, counter terrorism,” the minister said. “Put all resources to use is my advice to him.”
PTI reacts
KP CM Afridi has repeatedly voiced his opposition to military operations, objecting to “decisions taken behind closed doors”.
He particularly mentioned Tirah in a post on social media platform X on January 15, alleging that the decision of “operation in Tirah and forced displacement of people was taken behind closed doors”.
The CM further alleged that “terrorism has been foisted on us” and “people are being forcibly displaced due to a military operation, the decision for which was taken behind closed doors”.
Following today’s statement by the Ministry of Information, he said it would lead to “conflict between the provincial government and institutions and the Centre”.
Addressing a rally in KP’s Barikot, he said, “Whatever little trust among ourselves is no more. It is my order that from now onwards, I direct my government that from now onwards, all our correspondence with any institution or the federal government will be in writing and its evidence [will be kept]” so that they don’t walk back.
“They impose decisions taken behind closed doors and walk back when the damage is done.
“They issued a notification [sic] that the people of Tirah are relocating voluntarily. So, I now announce that coming Sunday, I will call a jirga of the Afridis and ask them whether they left willingly or were expelled.
“And if it emerges that the [ministry’s statement] is a lie, I will personally take my people back to Tirah,” he said.
“If this statement is not withdrawn or an apology is not issued within the next two days, I will call a jirga of the Afridis followed by one of the Pakhtuns,” he added.
Separately, the PTI’s KP chapter posted on X that the federal government’s assertion that people had been relocating from Tirah voluntarily was “ridiculous”.
“Who would leave their home willingly while taking into account the weather conditions, extreme cold and snowfall?” the party questioned.
It said that “security and government officials had asked for holding a jirga of tribal elders, which decided that people should relocate to prevent collateral damage during an operation by security forces”.
“Some people left willingly, and those who stayed back were expelled forcefully,” the party alleged.
Displacement from Tirah
Tribal elders from the restive valley had agreed to the vacation of houses by its residents from January 10. The agreement was reached on December 20, 2025 after weeks of talks with security and administration officials.
Sources in a 24-member jirga that negotiated the agreement regarding displacement with the district administration had told Dawn at the time that all residents would vacate the Tirah valley by January 25, 2026, paving the way for the military operation against all proscribed terrorist groups currently holed up in the valley.
The federal government’s clarification today comes on the same day as the reported deadline of January 25 for evacuation.
Earlier this week, the Khyber district administration had suspended the evacuation process in view of the heavy snowfall, asking families to refrain from travelling to Bara until Friday evening due to the inclement weather. Meanwhile, heavy snowfall and a snowstorm had left scores of displaced families stranded on the road, following which a rescue operation was launched.

As snow, freezing rain and dangerously frigid temperatures swept into the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Sunday, the number of power outages continued to rise. As of 10:47am EST (8:47pm PKT) on Sunday, more than 850,000 US customers were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us, with at least 290,000 in Tennessee and over 100,000 each in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana. Other states affected included Kentucky, Georgia, Virginia and Alabama.
More than 10,200 US flights scheduled for Sunday were cancelled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Over 4,000 flights were cancelled on Saturday.
Washington, DC’s Ronald Reagan National Airport said airlines had cancelled all flights at the airport on Sunday.
Delta Air Lines on Sunday said that it intended to operate on a reduced schedule “subject to real-time frozen precipitation and afternoon storm conditions.”
The airline had adjusted its schedule on Saturday, with additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the East Coast, including in Boston and New York City, and said it would move experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports.
The National Weather Service’s latest forecast for Sunday through Monday morning calls for heavy snow from the Ohio Valley to the Northeast, including up to 18 inches in New England. Much of the Southeast and parts of the Mid-Atlantic are expected to get rain and freezing rain.
Forecasters predicted “bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills” from the southern plains to the Northeast in the wake of the storm, bringing “prolonged hazardous travel and infrastructure impacts.”
Federal, State govts declare emergencies
Calling the storms “historic,” President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia.
“We will continue to monitor and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.
Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared weather emergencies, the Department of Homeland Security said.
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, at a news conference on Saturday, warned Americans to take precautions.
“It’s going to be very, very cold,” Noem said. “So we’d encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together.”
The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorising the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centres and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.
On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorise grid operator PJM Interconnection to run “specified resources” in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits.
US electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts.
Dominion Energy, whose Virginia operations include the largest collection of data centres in the world, said if its ice forecast held, the winter event could be among the largest to affect the company.

On January 11, as the cold wave gripped the province, the education minister announced to revise school opening timings for two weeks, ending today (Sunday). The schools were directed to open at 9am instead of the earlier timings.



According to a notification, “The timings for all public and private educational institutions under the administrative control of the School Education and Literacy Department shall continue till February 4.”
As per the directives, the schools across Sindh will continue to open at 9am till the 4th of next month.
Last week, the Education Deparment had issued warning letters to several schools for “completely ignoring” the government’s directives regarding the new school timings.
An Education Department official also warned that all private schools were obliged to follow the directives.
Meanwhile, the school’s administration and parents were seen in disarray over the revised timings due to the protracted school hours and routine adjustments.</p><small>2026-01-25 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/251833316838643.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969003/pmd-warns-of-road-closures-landslides-in-upper-parts-of-country-urges-tourists-to-remain-extra-cautious' target='_blank'><strong>PMD warns of road closures, landslides in upper parts of country, urges tourists to remain ‘extra cautious’</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has warned against road closures and landslides from January 26 to 27 in the country’s upper parts due to heavy snowfall, advising citizens to remain “extra cautious”.
In a statement, the Met Office said that in the next couple of days, “heavy snowfall may cause road closure/slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Chitral, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galliyat, Neelum valley, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli, Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Nushki, Harnai and Zhob.”
It further cautioned that there was a “possibility of landslides/avalanches in hilly areas of upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir” during the period.
The PMD advised tourists to “remain extra cautious and avoid unnecessary travel during the next two days.”
Heavy snowfall, avalanches and landslides have brought life to a standstill across KP, Balochistan, GB and Azad Kashmir (AJK), blocking roads, stranding travellers and disrupting electricity and relief operations amid freezing temperatures.
On Friday, at least nine members of a family were killed when a snow avalanche buried their house in Chitral.
’Cold winds likely in most parts of country’
According to the Met Office, “The western system is likely to affect southwestern Balochistan from tonight (Sunday) and grip the western and upper parts of the country from Monday.”
Setting off today, “mainly cold and dry weather” was expected in most parts of the country, while “very cold and partly cloudy” in upper KP, AJK and GB, the Met office added.
“Cold winds are also likely in most parts of the country,” it said. “However, partly cloudy weather with rain-wind/thunderstorm and snowfall is likely in southwestern Balochistan.”
For tomorrow, it also forecasted cloudy weather with intermittent rains, thunderstorms, and snowfall in KP, Kashmir, GB, Balochistan and upper Punjab. “Heavy falls with moderate to intense snowfall” were likely to hit hilly areas, the PMD added.
Furthermore, rains and thunderstorm was also likely in South Punjab and upper Sindh on Monday, the Met Office said.
Roads blocked, power disrupted in Shangla after snow
Meanwhile, life in KP’s Shangla has been at a standstill for the fourth consecutive day as most key and link roads have been blocked to traffic, and power supply has been disrupted across the district.

Upper parts of the district had received up to four feet of snow in the recent spell of snowfall, which was termed the heaviest snowfall in 13 years by residents.
The snowfall caused road blockades and suspension of power supply, paralysing the local routine life.
Residents say that most major and link roads, including the Bisham-Swat and Alpuri-Puran roads, have been closed to all types of traffic for the fourth day since the snow blanketed the area.
Local Jamaat-i-Islami leader Dayan Ghafar told Dawn that life has been “completely disrupted” in the Puran tehsil as all entry and exit routes of the district remained blocked due to heavy snowfall.
He further said power supply poles and transformers had collapsed in more than 20 places alone in the Puran tehsil.

Mazhar Ali, a resident of Lilownai village, told Dawn that their link road has been closed for all sorts of traffic, confining them to their houses.
He said the KP Communication and Works Department had started work on snow removal, but they were taking time because there was massive snow on the roads and limited machinery was available withthe district administration.
Meanwhile, the Chakesar Tehsil administration said in its statement that four roads had been cleared for traffic on Sunday and work on others continued.
However, the residents of Shangla demanded that the elected representatives — including MNA Amir Muqam, his son Senator Niaz Ahmad Khan, and his brother, KP Assembly Opposition Leader Ibadullah Khan — come forward and play their due role in rehabilitation work.</p><small>2026-01-25 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2519064221233d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969005/pcb-announces-player-auctions-for-upcoming-pakistan-super-league-on-feb-11' target='_blank'><strong>PCB announces player auctions for upcoming Pakistan Super League on Feb 11</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Sunday announced that the player auction for the 11th edition of Pakistan Super League (PSL) will be held on February 11.
Earlier this week, the PCB had announced that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.
On Sunday, the cricket board conducted a detailed workshop for the upcoming PSL player auction at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, which was presided over by PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and attended by representatives from all eight franchises, PSL officials, and members of the T20 World Cup squad.
During the workshop, the management shared a detailed presentation on the mechanics of the retention and the auction process and consulted with all the participants, the PCB said in a press release.







“It was agreed that the HBL PSL Player Auction will take place on Wednesday, 11 February.”
The PCB further revealed the base prices of the players, saying that “auction price and minimum incremental bids for the players were to be in Pakistani Rupees”.
The base price of the top bracket was set at Rs42 million, Rs22m, Rs11m and Rs6m.
The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:

Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m
Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m
Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m
Rs15m for bid amounts above Rs42m

“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.







It added that the squad composition would be a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”. The number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size. It would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.
Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.
The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”
“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.
PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.
“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”
“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.
While hailing the major shift from draft to auction, Naqvi said, “The Player Auction model is a landmark step for the HBL PSL, offering players better financial opportunities through an increased salary purse and a transparent acquisition process, while making the league more competitive and attractive.”
The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8. It was announced that PSL’s 11th edition would be held from March 26 to May 3, 2026.</p><small>2026-01-25 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2512005596c5692.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968995/babar-shaheen-to-play-for-pakistan-in-t20-world-cup-haris-rauf-left-out' target='_blank'><strong>Babar, Shaheen to play for Pakistan in T20 World Cup; Haris Rauf left out</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) left out express pacer Haris Rauf from the 15-man squad named on Sunday for next month’s ICC T20 World Cup jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka, although former captains Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi were named.
The announcement was made in a press conference by PCB High Performance Director and member of the men’s national selection committee Aqib Javed, who was speaking alongside skipper Salman and white-ball head coach Michael James Hesson at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.
Rauf finished with 20 wickets in the Big Bash League (BBL) in Australia, but selector Javed said he doesn’t fit in the combination.
“Rauf has played a lot of cricket for Pakistan, but we kept conditions in Sri Lanka in mind while selecting the squad,” Javed told a press conference in Lahore.
Rauf is also the highest wicket-taker for Pakistan in T20I cricket with 133 in 94 matches.







Among the players, Salman, Faheem Ashraf, Khawaja Mohammad Nafay, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Sahibzada Farhan and Usman Tariq have received their maiden mega-event call-ups to the Pakistan squad, PCB said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Abrar Ahmed, Babar, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Nawaz, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Shaheen, Shadab Khan and Usman Khan have played in at least one or more editions of the tournament since 2021, the statement added.
In the 20-team tournament, each team is set to play four group games before the Super Eight and Knockout Stage, all between February 7 and March 8.
Pakistan are also set to face Australia in a three-match T20I series at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore on January 29, 31 and Feb 1, with the preparation camp starting today, the PCB statement said.
Babar and Shaheen were also named in Pakistan’s squad for the three-match series after being dropped from the T20I series against Sri Lanka last month.
When asked during the presser about Babar’s inclusion in the World Cup squad despite “not meeting international standards”, Javed said he has been “the most consistent batsman”.
On Thursday, Babar announced that he would miss the remainder of the Big Bash League in Australia since he had been recalled to Pakistan for a national team camp ahead of the T20I series with Australia.
Salman, on being asked if Pakistan stood to gain an advantage similar to “the way India did during the previous ICC Champions Trophy, as all their matches were in the UAE,” the captain admitted that Pakistan did have an advantage this time. However, he maintained that winning depended on whether the team played well.
“India won because they played good cricket. If we do the same, we will win as well,” Salman said.
Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India played all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
As per the compromise, Pakistan are set to play all their matches at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, though PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday their participation was still not confirmed.
Salman further said that “in the past three tournaments, the team had not performed well”.
He continued: “When you play a world cup, it is always going to be tough[..] you can not stay relaxed in any situation [..] it will be challenging, and we are both ready and excited for it”.
When asked “why Muhammad Rizwan was not chosen to be in the squad despite having more experience in Sri Lanka than Babar,” Javed said, “You have to take into account the batting composition of your team — both the coach and captain think that babar can play a vital role in the team — so it does not mean that one is being given a chance and the other is not, we have to look at how the team can have a more competiteive batting line up”.
He went on to say that the argument had “no logic”.
“You have to look at who fits better in the squad and which player can make the team better,” he added.
Head coach Hesson, responding to a question about the inclusion of Khawaja Nafay and Usman Khan as the wicket keepers despite Nafay’s “inexperience, and Usman’s “poor performance”, maintained that “Usman Khan has been exceptional since he has come back in the squad”.
“His wicket-keeping has probably been better than expected,” Hesson said.
He continued: “As for Khawaja Nafay, we looked at Sahibzada Farhan as the backup keeper, but unfortunately, he became a bit vulnerable to injury with the extra load from a keeping perspective. That was something we did not want to risk”.
The head coach stressed that Farhan was a “big player” for the team.
“The fact that we would have to put him in a difficult situation forced our hand a little bit […] that is where Nafay came in as a power player,” the head coach said.
“We are very comfortable with the two keeping options we have,” he added.
Salman, in response to a question over whether Babar’s “performance was a cause for concern”, said that the player’s performance “has not been as bad as you people portray it to be, his performance in the Big Bash did not go well, but it was in different conditions”.
“I think since his comeback, he has been performing well in the T20s and all that matters to me is that he performs well for Pakistan,” the captain added.
Detailing the batting plan, the captain said that “other than the openers, the rest of the line can only be decided given what the situation is”.
“In T20, other than openers, you have no idea what situation you will find yourself in,” he added.
Speaking about the line-up, Javed maintained that it was the same squad “which had been in continuity for the past three to four series”.
“It is not like we have formed a special or different team for the World Cup. However, different conditions are always taken into account, and changes can be made,” he said.
Head coach Hesson, talking about Rauf’s exclusion from the squad, said, “Firstly, when we decided to take three seamers to Sri Lanka, there were obviously going to be some unlucky seamers, and Waseem Junior, Ahmed Daniyal, and Haris Rauf are three that were certainly considered, but there was no spot unfortunately”.
He said that the three seamers included in the squad — Shaheen Shah Afridi, Salman Mirza, and Naseem Shah — “can bowl in all three phases of the game”.
He added: “In previous World Cup tournaments, we have always taken an extra seamer because conditions have dictated that, whereas in this situation we haven’t gone down that path”.
Detailing Babar’s role in the squad, the head coach stated, “We see a very different role for Babar than what you have in the BBL”.
“Babar Azam has a lot of other skills to offer,” he said, recalling that the decision to add Babar was also taken “to complement the other players we have”.
“We know what a world-class player he is and how flexible he can be, depending on what the team requires,” he added.
Asked about a potential boycott of the World Cup by Pakistan, following a statement made by the PCB chief, Javed said that their role was limited to selecting the team.
“Ultimately, it is up to the government to decide, and we will wait for their decision,” he said.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On January 25 (Sunday), security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Panjgur District of Balochistan, on [the] reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan.”
Fitna al Hindustan is a state-designated name for the Balochistan-based terror groups allegedly supported by India to target military personnel in Pakistan.
The statement said that during the conduct of the operation, the security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an “intense fire exchange, three Indian sponsored terrorists were eliminated.”
Among the killed was a local terrorist commander, Farooq alias Soro, the ISPR said.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.”
It stated that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, adding that the security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue their counter terrorism campaign at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country under the vision of “Azm e Istehkam”.
In 2025, despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militancy, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies.
Earlier this month, four terrorists were killed by security forces during an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district.</p><small>2026-01-25 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/25164919eecfa07.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969002/minneapolis-shooting-what-the-videos-show' target='_blank'><strong>Minneapolis shooting: What the videos show</strong></a><br><p>Video footage of the moment immigration agents shot dead a 37-year-old nurse in Minneapolis on Saturday appears to contradict Trump administration claims that the man was a violent aggressor who sought to “massacre” federal law enforcement officials.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after the shooting said Alex Pretti had “approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun” and “violently resisted” when they attempted to disarm him.
Administration officials did not say whether Pretti had the gun in his hands at the time.
Video shared widely by US media, which AFP has not verified, however, shows Pretti with a phone in his hands, filming agents in a snow-lined street and directing traffic.
After an agent shoves a woman protester to the ground on the sidewalk, Pretti steps in between them and is sprayed in the face by a chemical irritant.
The agent then pulls Pretti to the ground and several officers struggle to detain him on the icy roadway.
Seconds later, as an officer in grey appears to pull something from Pretti’s waist while Pretti is bent forward on his knees with multiple officers on top of him, agents open fire.
They shoot his motionless body several times from a distance after initially dispersing. At least 10 gunshots can be heard in the footage.
In one clip, a man can be heard saying, “Where’s the gun?” as Pretti is motionless on the ground.
DHS, after the shooting, posted on X a photo of the handgun purportedly found on Pretti.
The department said it looked “like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”







But Pretti’s parents in a subsequent statement denounced what they called “sickening lies” from the Trump administration.
“Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs,” they said.
“He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down, all while being pepper-sprayed.”</p><small>2026-01-25 12:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2515471239f65a3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969001/eu-council-president-arrives-in-india-to-seal-trade-pact' target='_blank'><strong>EU council president arrives in India to seal trade pact</strong></a><br><p>European Council president Antonio Costa arrived in India on Sunday, as the EU and New Delhi seek to seal a free trade pact, capping nearly two decades of negotiations between the economic behemoths.
Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen are chief guests for this year’s Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi on Monday before an EU-India summit on Tuesday, where they hope to shake hands on the accord, described as the “mother of all deals”.
“President Costa is in New Delhi for the 16th EU-India summit taking place on Tuesday,” the EU Council said on X.







“The summit will be an opportunity to build on the EU-India strategic partnership and further strengthen collaboration across key policy areas.”
India, the world’s most populous nation, is on track to become the world’s fourth-largest economy this year, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections.
While the EU eyes India as an important market for the future, New Delhi sees the European bloc as an important source of much-needed technology and investment to rapidly upscale its infrastructure and create millions of new jobs for its people.
“We are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement,” Leyen said ahead of the summit.

 

Bilateral trade in goods reached €120 billion ($139bn) in 2024, an increase of nearly 90 per cent over the past decade, according to EU figures, with a further €60bn ($69bn) in trade in services.
The pact would be a major win for Brussels and New Delhi as both seek to open up new markets in the face of US tariffs and Chinese export controls.
“The EU and India are moving closer together at the time when the rules-based international order is under unprecedented pressure through wars, coercion and economic fragmentation,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said on Wednesday.
Negotiations, however, are still ongoing with talks focusing on a few sticking points, including the impact of the EU’s carbon border tax on steel exports and safety and quality standards in the pharmaceutical and automotive sectors, according to people familiar with the discussions.
New Delhi, which has relied on Moscow for decades for key military hardware, has tried to cut its dependence on Russia in recent years by diversifying imports and pushing its own domestic manufacturing base. Europe is doing the same vis-à-vis the United States.</p><small>2026-01-25 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/251423278e0c773.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999/bangladesh-absence-from-t20-world-cup-a-sad-moment-for-the-game-international-cricketers-association' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh absence from T20 World Cup a sad moment for the game: International Cricketers’ Association</strong></a><br><p>The absence of Bangladesh from next month’s T20 World Cup is a sad moment for the game and should serve as a call for stakeholders to work towards uniting the sport, not dividing it, the International Cricketers’ Association said on Sunday.
Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the 20-team showpiece on Saturday following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.
“The withdrawal of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup, and resulting absence of a valued cricketing nation from cricket’s pinnacle international T20 event, is a sad moment for our sport, the Bangladesh players and fans, and one that requires deep reflection,” World Cricketers’ Association (WCA) Chief Executive Tom Moffat said in a statement.
“Rather than allowing division or exclusion to take hold, we call on the games’ leaders to work with all stakeholders, including governing bodies, leagues and players, to unite the sport, not divide it.”
The events underline the current tension in South Asian cricket.
India’s fraught relations with Pakistan prompted the ICC to broker an arrangement allowing them to play at a neutral venue when their neighbour hosts a global tournament.
Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India played all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
As per the compromise, Pakistan are set to play all their matches at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, though the Pakistan Cricket Board chief Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday their participation was still not confirmed.
“The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi, who is also the country’s interior minister, told reporters.
Moffat said the WCA had become increasingly concerned by agreements not being honoured in the sport and by a lack of meaningful consultation with players and their representatives.
“It also highlights significant issues with the game’s existing operating model at the global level,” he added.
“These issues, if continued to be left unaddressed, will weaken trust, unity, and ultimately the health and future of the game we love.”
Former Pakistani captain and all-rounder Shahid Afridi said on the replacement of Bangladesh by Scotland that he was “deeply disappointed” by ICC’s “inconsistency”.
“As a former international cricketer who has played in Bangladesh and in ICC events, I’m deeply disappointed by today’s ICC’s inconsistency. It accepted India’s security concerns for not touring Pakistan in 2025, yet appears unwilling to apply the same understanding to Bangladesh.
“Consistency and fairness are the foundation of global cricket governance. Bangladesh’s players and millions of its fans deserve respect — not mixed standards. The ICC should build bridges, not burn them,” Afridi said in a post on social media platform X.







Former Pakistani batsman Mohammad Yousaf expressed similar views, saying: “Very sad to see a cricket-loving nation like Bangladesh being deprived of cricket due to security concerns not being addressed.
“When similar concerns were raised earlier, a neutral venue was approved. Standards cannot change from country to country. ICC must act as the International Cricket Council, not appear to serve the interests of any single board. Fairness and consistency are the foundation of global cricket.”

Forecasters said snow, sleet, freezing rain and dangerously frigid temperatures would sweep the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Sunday and into the week.
Calling the storms “historic,” President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia.
“We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.
‘Crippling to locally catastrophic impacts’
Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared weather emergencies, the Department of Homeland Security said.
“We do have tens of thousands of people in affected states in the South that have lost power,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on Saturday.
“We have utility crews that are working to restore that as quick as possible.”
The number of outages continued to rise. As of 2:44am EST on Sunday, some 230,000 US customers had no electricity, the bulk of them in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Tennessee and New Mexico, according to PowerOutage.com.
The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorising the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centres and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.
On Sunday, the Department of Emergency issued an emergency order to authorise grid operator PJM Interconnection to run “specified resources” in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits.
The National Weather Service warned of an unusually expansive and long-duration winter storm that would bring widespread, heavy ice accumulation in the Southeast, where “crippling to locally catastrophic impacts” can be expected.
Weather service forecasters predicted record cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills descending further into the Great Plains region by Monday.
As of 10:21pm EST, more than 4,000 US flights scheduled for Saturday had been cancelled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.
More than 9,400 US flights originally set for Sunday also have been cancelled.
Airlines, grid operators scramble to prepare
Major US airlines warned passengers to stay alert for abrupt flight changes and cancellations.
On Saturday, Delta Air Lines continued to adjust its schedule and made additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the East Coast, including in Boston and New York City.
It added it was relocating experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports.
JetBlue said that as of Saturday morning, it had cancelled about 1,000 flights through Monday.
United Airlines said its weather preparations included proactively cancelling some flights in places with the worst weather.
US electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts.
Dominion Energy, whose Virginia operations include the largest collection of data centres in the world, said if its ice forecast held, the winter event could be among the largest to affect the company.
Noem, at a news conference about US government preparations for the storm, warned Americans to take precautions.
“Its going to be very, very cold,” Noem said. “So we’d encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together.”</p><small>2026-01-25 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/250758087e36711.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968951/three-charged-in-uk-over-attacks-on-imrans-aide' target='_blank'><strong>Three charged in UK over attacks on Imran’s aide</strong></a><br><p>LONDON: British counter-terrorism police have charged three men in connection with a series of “highly targeted” attacks against Pakistani dissidents living in the United Kingdom, including a former adviser in the Imran Khan government.
The alleged assaults took place in Cambridgeshire and Buckinghamshire between Dec 24 and 31 and were directed at two prominent supporters of the jailed former Pakistani prime minister. Counter-terrorism police took over the investigation from local forces, citing the deliberate and targeted nature of the incidents.
One of the victims, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, a former accountability adviser in Mr Khan’s cabinet, said he was brutally assaulted at his home after an attacker confirmed his identity. He told British media that he had been punched repeatedly and is now in hiding, fearing for his and his family’s safety.
On Friday, police confirmed that three British nationals had been charged. Karl Blackbird, 40, and Clark McAulay, 39, face charges of conspiracy to cause actual bodily harm in relation to separate incidents. A third man, Doneto Brammer, 21, has been charged in connection with the attack on Akbar’s home and faces additional charges, including possession of a prohibited weapon and conspiracy to commit arson.
All three appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Saturday.
Several other suspects have been arrested during coordinated raids across London, the Midlands and Essex and later released on bail. Police said the investigation remains ongoing and that detectives are keeping an open mind regarding motive and possible links between the attacks.

ISLAMABAD: The Privatisation Commission announced on Saturday that the outsourcing operation for the country’s three major airports — Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi — will move to an open bidding mode following a high level of interest from various investors.
The commission said the shift from a government-to-government (G2G) mode to open bidding aims to generate a competitive process wherein all domestic and foreign investors will have a level playing field to participate in the bidding process.
According to a commission statement, the envisaged competitive process priorities inclusivity by welcoming participation from all eligible entities, including those from partner nations, while affording equal opportunities to local and foreign investors.
This approach is designed to promote transparency and fair competition, deliver the most advantageous results for Pakistan’s economy and reinforce relationships with international partners, the commission said.
The government has been actively considering options for Islamabad International Airport, Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport and Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport through appropriate modes, including management contracts and long-term commercial concessions.
As part of this strategy, the Islamabad airport has been included in the active privatisation program, consistent with the ongoing process for the airports at Karachi and Lahore.
This follows constructive dialogue with entities from partner nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia, as well as other international stakeholders.
The commission noted that the primary objectives are to enhance efficiency, improve service delivery, maximise revenue generation, upgrade infrastructure and attract private sector investments. These efforts align with the nation’s economic vision to cultivate collaboration to modernise the aviation sector.
Roosevelt Hotel
Separately, the Privatisation Com­m­ission has invited technical and financial proposals for the appointment of a financial adviser for the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, aiming to secure a joint venture for mixed-use development of the elite Manhattan property owned by the Pakistan government.
According to the commission’s website, proposals can be submitted by Feb 16. The government intends for the transaction regarding the Roosevelt Hotel to be completed in one year.

 

The commission intends to offer the property for setting up a joint venture project through the “best suited transaction structure and mode of privatisation”.
The appointed financial adviser will be tasked with conducting market sounding to validate investor interest in the hotel.
The adviser must identify potentially interested parties and assess the level of interest in the transaction structure options covered in the transaction structure report and recommendations of the earlier financial adviser.
Additionally, the financial adviser will develop and implement an effective marketing strategy with the approval of the Privatisation Commission.
This includes developing and implementing a plan for introducing the Roosevelt’s site and projecting its image to bolster its value, “enabling expression of interest in the property from prospective investors”.
The adviser will also be required to arrange meetings with potential investors in order to develop a better understanding of investor profiles and the investment climate.
Located in midtown on Madison Avenue, the Roosevelt Hotel is the only real estate entity on the government’s privatisation program.
The 19-storey property is considered among the elite hotels in Manhattan, comprising 1,025 rooms with a covered area of over 600,000 square feet. It is wholly owned by PIA Investments Ltd (PIAIL), which is owned and managed by the Pakistan government.
