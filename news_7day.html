The Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah. However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, earlier announced it would organise the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid.
The rally was a part of the KP CM’s four-day visit to Sindh, who is leading his party’s street mobilisation movement.
“I am deeply grateful to all Pakistanis and the people of Sindh for honouring us with enormous respect and esteem,” CM Afridi said while addressing a huge crowd near Mazar-i-Quaid late on Sunday night.







“We can never forget the respect we received from the people of Sindh. But you all must not forgive the Sindh government for the disrespect they have shown towards the Sindhi cap and Ajrak,” the PTI leader added.
“We will not allow anyone to steal our mandate, to snatch our rights, or to further keep our leader Imran Khan sahib in prison wrongfully,” Afridi said.
The KP CM said: “Those who used to say ‘we will end PTI’ and who were thinking that Imran Khan’s politics will be eradicated, they should come here and see these youngsters here.
“They should consider that these people have come for only a jalsa, then what will happen the day my leader (Imran Khan) issues a formal call for a street movement,” he added.
“You must stand prepared against this oppression and fascism. Whenever my leader issues a call, we will act as per his wishes,” the PTI leader said.
Afridi reiterated his claims of the Sindh government “leaving us stranded on deserted roads in the dark of the night” while returning from Hyderabad to Karachi.
However, a provincial minister refuted the claims, saying that a police accompanied the KP CM on his way via the “safest routes”.
“Shelling was also done at our sisters, children, workers here […] all routes were blocked, police baton-charged [supporters],” CM Afridi claimed in his brief address.
The chief minister further alleged that “they (authorities) also damaged the media’s vehicles”.
Afridi said the Sindh government “repeated” what its Punjab counterpart had done when he visited Lahore last month, calling both governments “fake”.
“God willing, our next stop will be Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and we will continue the same momentum in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” CM Afridi announced.
The KP CM also raised slogans of “every chowk is D-Chowk”.
Earlier at 7:44pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh said CM Afridi’s convoy was facing delays “due to obstructions at various places, and the public’s affection, welcomes and responses at numerous places”.
At around 9pm, Sheikh said the KP CM would reach the venue in five minutes, and lashed out at the Sindh police and government for their actions. At around 10:30pm, he shared footage of the caravan at Numaish Chowrangi, where Afridi also addressed the crowd.







The PTI also shared visuals of the welcome accorded to the party caravan by their supporters in Baldia Town and Ittehad Town‘s Khyber Chowk.







A short while before that, the PTI said the Sindh police had “attempted to prevent” CM Afridi’s convoy from moving forward, but the party leaders “had the path reopened with the help of party workers”.
The video showed party leaders, including Shafiullah Jan, speaking to the police before the convoy’s vehicles were allowed to move ahead.







The PTI also shared videos of hundreds gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah, with supporters chanting “Jiye Imran” and “Tera yaar, mera yaar, Qaidi No. 804”.







In a video recorded while on his way to the venue, Afridi said his convoy would reach Mazar-i-Quaid after going through Baldia Town, Keamari, Banaras Chowk, Golimar and Gurumandir so PTI supporters could join the caravan.
Former MNA Faheem Khan said, “Ten of our vehicles were intercepted. But no worries; I am reaching the rally venue with another vehicle equipped with a sound system.”







In a statement on X, the PTI hailed the public for its “historic display of public power and expression of love for Imran Khan”.
“Despite all the fascism, violence, arrests and obstructions by the Sindh government through its police, thousands of people have gathered inside and around Karachi’s Bagh-i-Jinnah and on the surrounding streets at the moment,” it said.
“This is the scene that serves as a clear message to those with fascist mindsets that public power cannot be stopped by walls and batons,” the PTI asserted.
“This gathering is a renewal of the pledge that we are ready to give every sacrifice for Imran Khan, Pakistan, true freedom, supremacy of the Constitution and law, independence of the judiciary, and our basic rights.”







Shelling, roadblocks at venue: PTI
Shortly after 4pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared a video on X wherein a woman said police have resorted to shelling at party supporters at “Mazar-i-Quaid’s garden”.







Video footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed multiple police vans at Bagh-i-Jinnah and cops employing shelling, with people gathered there retaliating by pelting stones.



Another video shared with Dawn showed dozens gathered at an unknown location, with people pushing aside containers that had been placed to block a route.

The Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) — an ally of the PTI under an opposition alliance — also said its leader Allama Sadiq Jafri and others had reached “Jinnah Ground”, possibly referring to Bagh-i-Jinnah.







PTI spokesperson Mohammad Ali Bozdar told Dawn that police had blocked roads and were not allowing party workers to enter Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the government had previously allowed the party to hold the rally.
He reiterated his allegation that police had blocked roads in various areas and were preventing PTI workers from reaching the new venue of Mazar-i-Quaid’s VIP gate as well.
Bozdar said CM Afridi would pay his respects at the mausoleum and later on, he would address party workers from a truck, the arrangements for which had been completed.
‘Attack’ on mediapersons
Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took notice of an “attack“ on Aaj News’ vehicle near Gurumandir Chowrangi.
He also directed the East district senior superintendent of police (SSP) to immediately provide details on “police action”.
“Miscreant elements will be dealt with firmly. We will not let anyone sabotage law and order,” Lanjar asserted.
The minister said the perpetrators would be arrested by tracing them using the modern monitoring system.

In a statement, PTI’s Bozdar also condemned the attack on mediapersons and said action should be taken if someone had “attacked the media”.
“The PTI’s workers are peaceful. No one is allowed to take the law into their hands,” he stated. “The media is the public’s voice; attacks on media will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he added.
The board members of Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the “attack of a charged crowd on media; violence against journalists, cameramen and staff; and damage caused to DSNGs”.
“How can this group declare themselves pro-democratic after attacking the media?” said a joint statement by KUJ President Ejaz Ahmad and others.
“What message did they try to convey by targeting the media?”
The KUJ demanded that the Sindh government trace the perpetrators through CCTV footage and bring them to justice.
The Crime Reporters Association (CRA) also strongly condemned the vandalism incidents, adding that there was a “clash between political workers and police” during coverage at Bagh-i-Jinnah.
“Media representatives busy in fulfilling their duties got caught in the middle of this chaos and were targeted, while the vehicles (DSNGs) and equipment of many media houses were damaged,” the CRA stated.
Sindh government spokesperson Sadia Javed, in a statement, said there were “attacks on multiple news channels’ vehicles and pelting”. The vehicles of GNN and Aaj News were among those damaged, while a worker of Channel 5 was reportedly assaulted.
In his statement, PPP Karachi General Secretary Rauf Ahmed Nagori alleged that PTI workers “vandalised citizen vehicles during their protest”.
Pictures showed cops with batons detaining multiple individuals at Numaish Chowrangi as PTI supporters gathered to make their way to Bagh-i-Jinnah.
PTI changes rally venue
The PTI had initially planned to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah, and the PPP-led Sindh government had even issued a no-objection certificate for it despite objections from the PML-N.
But the party blamed the Sindh administration for “wasting their time” and announced that the public meeting would now be held in front of the Quaid’s mausoleum.

In a video statement, Sheikh criticised the Sindh government for allegedly blocking the rally. He recalled that Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani had welcomed the KP CM at the Karachi airport and presented a Sindh cap and Ajrak to him.
“Was that a pretence?” he questioned, slamming the Sindh government for its “shamelessness”.
On the party’s decision to hold a gathering outside one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid, he said, “Holding a rally at a public gate does not block any route.”
Sheikh alleged the NOC for the rally had been deliberately delayed, further questioning that when the Sindh government had granted permission for the rally, “why was our vendor beaten and made to flee?”
He decried that the PPP was no longer late prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s party.







“Police brutality and blocking of roads cannot dampen the morale of the people,” PTI Karachi President Raja Azhar said in a statement, adding that the rally would prove to be the “public’s referendum against cruelty”.
Similarly, party member Faheem Khan urged people to participate in the rally and termed the alleged blocking of roads “an attack on the rights of the people”.
Late on Saturday, Sheikh said that while the PTI had announced Mazar-i-Quaid as the venue as the NOC had not been issued by then, the party had again decided to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah after getting the permission.







PTI alleges arrests at Bagh-i-Jinnah
Separately, the PTI alleged that authorities had raided Bagh-i-Jinnah, subjected its workers to violence and also arrested several of them.
Party spokesperson Bozdar, while speaking to Dawn, alleged that when workers reached Bagh-i-Jinnah around 2am on Sunday for rally arrangements and preparations, around 15 to 20 police mobiles reached the spot and law enforcement personnel resorted to baton-charge. They detained over a dozen PTI workers, he claimed.
At around 2:30am, PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui posted on X that the Sindh government wasted their time as the deputy commissioner East had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) on Saturday evening at 6:30pm.
“The public power witnessed in Karachi yesterday has frightened them; they can’t decide what to do now. The people of Karachi will be at the Mazar-i-Quaid public gate at 2pm with our guest, the chief minister of KP, Sohail Afridi. We will hold a public meeting at the VIP gate at 2pm,” she stated.
But the Sindh home minister warned of strict action if any public meeting was held on the road. “No one is allowed to challenge the writ of the government,” Lanjar said in a statement.
In one of her posts at around 4:30am, Siddiqui said that containers had been parked around Jinnah Ground and police personnel were present at the site in large numbers.







In another post, she alleged police had “attacked” Bagh-i-Jinnah, arrested several PTI workers, and their belongings had been confiscated.







Similarly, Sheikh said in a post on X at around 2:30am that “this fascism against peaceful workers was unfortunate. The PPP and Sindh government, which harp about democracy, should feel ashamed“.







In other posts, he decried the alleged police raid at Bagh-i-Jinnah and claimed PTI workers had been subjected to violence.







PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, speaking to the media at Karachi Press Club today, decried the “barbarity” that PTI members had been subjected to.
“Cars were smashed, and two dozen members have been detained unlawfully. A lawyer of ours was detained this morning at Bagh-i-Jinnah. It is cordoned off by police right now,” he said, adding that the PTI had the NOC for the rally.
“So the rally will happen,” he asserted.
In response to a Dawn query, police sources denied detaining any PTI workers this morning and said they just removed them from Mazar-i-Quaid. The sources said police took action to disperse the party workers, alleging that they had blocked a main road.
The sources also said that while there would be no restriction on the movement of KP CM Afridi, PTI workers would not be allowed at Mazar-i-Quaid.
KP CM claims routes blocked from Hyderabad to Karachi
Earlier on Sunday, CM Afridi claimed in a post on X that “upon my return from Hyderabad, all routes for me and my entire team have been blocked. For the past four hours, I’ve been switching between different routes. At 4:23am, we’ve now set off toward Karachi on a deserted road“.
“The Sindh government is not only playing with my life but also with the lives of my team members,” he said, warning that the precedent of such treatment being meted out to the CM of one province in other provinces would “prove highly detrimental in the near future”.
“Pakistan belongs to all of us. Do not spread hatred here to such an extent that it becomes impossible to return from that point. Fake democratic forces are not leaving any stone unturned in this. This is extremely shameful,” he said.







However, Hyderabad SSP Adeel Chandio told Dawn that “no obstruction was created in the convoy and rally of KP CM in Hyderabad until he left the city”. “And he left the city safely,” he added.
Later, in a video message shared on PTI’s X account, the CM said: “We reached Karachi around 7:15pm […] We will definitely hold a rally today. It took us seven and a half hours to reach Karachi from Hyderabad.
“They had blocked the route at different places and we were compelled to travel on a deserted route. This was tantamount to putting my and my team’s lives at risk, as anything could have happened there.”
He urged Karachiites to come out for the rally today, adding that “they (the Sindh government) are afraid of the rally, but it will be held”.







Raja also posted on X that he had reached Karachi from Hyderabad after “seven hours, driving through jungles in the CM KPK’s vehicle”.
“Motorway closed. The fascist state lost its nerve after seeing the massive response of the people, given two days of freedom and human dignity,” he said.







PTI not abiding by assurances, claims Sharjeel Inam
From the Sindh government, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon maintained that his provincial government had warmly welcomed Afridi and provided him with complete security.
“The post of chief minister is a constitutional post and constitutional posts have been fully respected,” he said in a statement, maintaining that the PTI was in constant touch with the Sindh government.
He then accused the opposition party of “not abiding by the assurances” it had given, but did not specify any guarantees.
“It was clearly said on the very first day that they are allowed to hold a rally. It is inappropriate to make allegations against the Sindh government despite this,” he said, maintaining that no one had stopped the PTI from holding a rally in the ground.
However, the manner in which rallies and processions were being taken out on the roads was causing severe traffic disruption and common citizens were facing difficulties, he said.
“Karachi is a metropolitan city; traffic problems arise here even when a few hundred people gather,” he said. “We want the KP chief minister to complete his visit in a peaceful manner.”
He said that PTI workers should not take the law into their own hands and should follow the guidelines given by the government. The movement of common people should not be affected and violation of laws should be avoided, he added.
Memon said a security alert had also been issued regarding the rally, and a security plan had been devised.
“Unfortunately, the security plan is not being followed,” he claimed, further maintaining that complete security had been provided by Sindh police in connection with the rally.
“In view of security concerns, the instructions of the Sindh government should be followed, and only routes allocated by the government should be used,” he said.
Memon claimed that the route designated for the PTI in Hyderabad had not been followed and they took a route of their own choice.
“It is not correct to say that the convoy of the chief minister of KP was stopped on its return from Hyderabad,” he said. “The place where the convoy faced difficulty is the National Highway Authority bridge, where traffic congestions are frequent.”

The officers would be deployed on Sunday and Monday to bolster the safety of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol officials already in Minnesota, Noem said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” programme.
Some 2,000 federal officers have already been dispatched to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in what DHS has called its largest operation ever.
The new deployments were scheduled to begin even as more than 1,000 rallies were planned nationwide this weekend to protest the federal government’s deportation push and Wednesday’s fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an ICE officer.
Minnesota officials have called the shooting unjustified, pointing to bystander video they say showed Good’s vehicle turning away from the agent as he fired.
Noem and other US officials have maintained that the agent acted in self-defence because Good, a volunteer in a community network that monitors and records ICE operations in Minneapolis, drove forward in the direction of the agent who then shot her, after another agent had approached the driver’s side and told her to get out of the car.
In a separate Sunday appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Noem said other video footage showed Good protesting ICE agents at other locations earlier on Wednesday morning, but did not say if or when it would be publicly released.
Minnesota authorities on Friday said they were opening their own criminal investigation into the incident, after some state law enforcement officials said the FBI was refusing to cooperate with state investigators.
White House Border Security Czar Tom Homan said on “Fox News Sunday” that he wanted to let the investigation play out, but that he “truly believe that officer thought his life was in danger to take that action.”</p><small>2026-01-11 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1123044908746a3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966385/religious-ministry-organises-second-training-session-for-haj-2026-pilgrims' target='_blank'><strong>Religious ministry organises second training session for Haj 2026 pilgrims</strong></a><br><p>Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony on Sunday organised the second phase of the training session for Haj 2026 pilgrims at the Haji Camp in Islamabad.
According to the ministry’s spokesperson, the primary objective of this programme was to “provide comprehensive awareness regarding the various stages of the pilgrimage, necessary precautionary measures, and the obligatory acts (Faraiz and Wajibat) of Haj and Umrah,” the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
During the session, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Umar Butt, briefed the participants on administrative matters, departure procedures, and accommodation in Makkah and Madinah.
Master Trainer Tanveer Asghar provided technical training on the methods of performing Haj and Umrah, highlighting the religious obligations.
The event was attended by the Director of Haji Complex Islamabad, Qazi Sami-ur-Rehman, Deputy Director Hakim Khan Khattak, and other senior officials.
“Pilgrims were advised to improve their physical fitness by walking two to three kilometres daily. Essential travel documents, including the original passport, computer national identity card (CNIC), flight ticket, visa copies, and vaccination cards (for meningitis, flu, and polio) must be kept ready,” the report said.
A strict warning was issued against carrying prohibited items such as narcotics, naswar, cigarettes, and unverified medicines, it added.
The ministry has made the Pak Haj App” mandatory for all pilgrims to access flight schedules, accommodation details, and group information.
Furthermore, the procedure for remote biometric verification via the “Saudi Visa Bio” app was explained in detail, the APP said.
For those arriving directly in Madinah, the stay will range from three to eight days before proceeding to Makkah.
In Makkah, approximately 250 buildings have been arranged for accommodation, with a 24-hour free shuttle bus service available to transport pilgrims to the Haram Sharif.
The session covered the pillars of Umrah (Ihram, Niyyat, Tawaf, Sa’i, and Halq/Qasr) and the three Faraiz (obligatory acts) of Haj: Ihram, Wuquf-e-Arafat, and Tawaf-e-Ziyarat. The Wajibat (essential acts), such as the stay at Muzdalifah, Ramy al-Jamarat (stoning the devil), Qurbani (sacrifice), and the Tawaf-i-Wida were also explained.
Due to expected extreme weather, pilgrims were instructed to use umbrellas, spray bottles, and ORS to prevent heatstroke.
In case of emergencies, they were advised to contact the Saudi helpline 937 for medical assistance and 911 for security matters.
The Ministry of Religious Affairs urged the pilgrims to maintain discipline, patience, and compassion throughout the sacred journey, the report said.
The session concluded with a detailed Q&A segment, where officials and trainers addressed specific concerns regarding administrative and travel arrangements, ensuring the pilgrims are fully prepared for their journey.
In July 2025, the federal cabinet formally approved the Haj Policy 2026, outlining key procedural, financial, and logistical measures for the pilgrimage season. The following month, the government started accepting Haj applications.
The Kingdom has allocated a total quota of 179,210 pilgrims for Pakistan — 119,210 under the government scheme and 60,000 for private operators, according to the ministry.

God has blessed me with way too much for me to complain about anything.“I always look back at my whole journey with a lot of grace, a lot of gratitude in my heart, and I feel proud about it.”

NZ openers frustrate India
Earlier, India won the toss and elected to field, factoring in dew conditions for the second innings, but New Zealand’s openers Devon Conway (56) and Henry Nicholls (62) frustrated the hosts with a commanding 117-run opening stand.Harshit Rana provided the breakthrough, striking twice in consecutive overs to dismiss both openers and apply the brakes on New Zealand’s scoring rate.The middle order failed to capitalise on promising starts, with only Daryl Mitchell making a significant contribution, while skipper Michael Bracewell was run out from a direct hit by Shreyas Iyer.Mitchell blazed his way to 84 with five boundaries and three sixes before being trapped leg-before to Prasidh Krishna while attempting another big shot. Kristian Clarke’s unbeaten 24 helped New Zealand add 50 runs in the final five overs to reach 300.
Kohli and Gill build parnership
India’s chase got off to a rocky start when opener Rohit Sharma fell for 26, but Kohli and captain Shubman Gill steadied the ship with a crucial 118-run partnership.“I’m not thinking about the milestones at all. If we were batting first today, I would have probably gone harder. Even with the chase, because there was a total on the board, I had to kind of buckle down and play the situation,” Kohli added.Gill contributed a patient 56 but fell shortly after receiving treatment on his back before Jamieson (4-41) then turned the match on its head with a devastating spell.He removed Ravindra Jadeja in the same over as Kohli before clean-bowling Iyer for 49, his off stump knocked out of the ground as India slumped to 242-5.Enter Rana, who counter-attacked brilliantly and was fortunate to survive a dropped catch at long-on when on 12. He made New Zealand pay, scoring 29 before being caught behind, keeping India in the hunt.With pressure mounting and India needing to maintain a run-a-ball rate, KL Rahul held his nerve to guide the hosts home with an unbeaten 29, sealing victory with two fours and a six in the penultimate over.The victory gives India a 1-0 lead in the series ahead of the second game in Rajkot on Wednesday.</p><small>2026-01-11 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1113502775e6cce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966374/irans-parliament-speaker-qalibaf-warns-us-and-israel-of-retaliation-if-iran-is-attacked' target='_blank'><strong>Iran’s parliament speaker Qalibaf warns US and Israel of retaliation if Iran is attacked</strong></a><br><p>Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, speaking in parliament on Sunday, warned the United States and Israel against “a miscalculation”, saying that Tehran will retaliate if it is attacked.
“Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards.
With the country’s government facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022, Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if force is used on protesters.
Authorities intensify crackdown
The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices. Authorities accuse the US and Israel of fomenting unrest. Iran’s police chief Ahmad-Reza Radan said security forces had stepped up efforts to confront “rioters”.
The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday.
Footage posted on social media on Saturday from Tehran showed large crowds marching along a street at night, clapping and chanting. The crowd “has no end nor beginning,” a man is heard saying.
In footage from the northeastern city of Mashhad, smoke can be seen billowing into the night sky from fires in the street, masked protesters, and a road strewn with debris, another video posted on Saturday showed. Explosions could be heard.
Reuters verified the locations.
State TV aired footage of dozens of body bags on the ground at the Tehran coroner’s office on Sunday, saying the dead were victims of events caused by “armed terrorists”.
Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing for the possibility of any US intervention.
An Israeli military official said the protests were an internal Iranian matter, but Israel’s military was monitoring developments and was ready to respond “with power if need be”.
An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment.Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June last year, which the United States briefly joined by attacking key nuclear installations.
Iran retaliated by firing missiles at Israel and an American air base in Qatar.
Iran denounces ‘rioters and terrorists’
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a TV interview, said Israel and the US were masterminding destabilisation and that Iran’s enemies had brought in “terrorists … who set mosques on fire …. attack banks, and public properties”.
“Families, I ask you: do not allow your young children to join rioters and terrorists who behead people and kill others,” he said, adding that the government was ready to listen to the people and to resolve economic problems.
Alan Eyre, a former US diplomat and Iran expert, thought it unlikely the protests would topple Iran’s ruling establishment.
“I think it is more likely that it puts these protests down eventually, but emerges from the process far weaker,” he told Reuters, noting that Iran’s ruling elite still appeared cohesive and there was no organised opposition.
Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for security personnel killed in protests.
State TV said 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan and that six more were killed by “rioters” in Kermanshah in the west.
Us ready to help, says Trump
Trump, posting on social media on Saturday, said: “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!”
In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of US intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source present for the conversation.
Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, said Trump had observed Iranians’ “indescribable bravery”. “Do not abandon the streets,” Pahlavi, who is based in the US, wrote on X.
Netanyahu, speaking during a cabinet meeting, said Israel was closely monitoring developments. “We all hope that the Persian nation will soon be freed from the yoke of tyranny,” he said.
Pakistan embassy in Tehran establishes crisis cell
The Pakistan embassy in Tehran has established a crisis management unit to facilitate its citizens, Pakistan’s envoy to Iran Mudassir Tipu said on X.
The post had a list of contact numbers that may be “maybe reached round the clock for assistance”.

“I personally apologise if something [unpleasant] happened somewhere, as this should not happen,” Shah said during Geo News’ programme ‘Naya Pakistan’.
’’He is the chief minister of a province and whatever we did, the welcome and all, was in respect of the people of KP as he had their mandate,“ the PPP leader added.
Asked about the apparent change in the Sindh government’s attitude, Shah highlighted that the guests were “welcomed and taken care of”. He explained that the PTI sought permission to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah “even though it falls under the federal government’s jurisdiction”.
He acknowledged that the PTI “adopted the proper procedure” to seek a no-objection certificate (NOC), which he said also caused delays. Then, the minister said, the issues arose when the NOC got delayed by about 1-1.5 hours, and the PTI announced that they would “hold the rally on a road”.
Shah added that the Sindh government had even offered the PTI to connect their vendors to them if the preparations were lacking.
The minister then pointed out CM Afridi’s “certain” statements, including one about President Asif Ali Zardari’s politics.
“There are no differences. Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari sahib and President Asif Ali Zardari sahib are our PPP, the Sindh government. There is one stance,” he said.
Shah added that if President Zardari did not wish so, the PTI guests would not have been welcomed at the airport or facilitated. He said the PTI started making harsh statements, which also upset party members who noted the criticism despite offering them support.
Asked about the police action against PTI workers at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the early hours of Sunday, Shah said an enquiry was underway about what caused it.
He said the PTI was being urged to arrange the setup in the ground, but they were insistent on holding a gathering on the road.
Responding to him on the same show, senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser said, “We felt that Sindh’s people and government respect democracy and […] they respect their opponents.”
He acknowledged that the PTI had differences with the PPP and concerns about it. “In our opinion, the illegitimate government in power right now is so because of their support,” he said.
“The legislation that they are doing. [Criticising it] is our stance. It is our democratic right to have whatever stance we want,” Qaiser stressed.
He added that the PTI had expected the PPP, which is Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s party, to respect democratic values.
“Will this attitude continue? Is this democracy? […] Tell me, what unlawful [incident] has occurred over the past two days?“ Qaiser asked. He stressed the vendors needed two to three days to make arrangements at the venue, adding that there was “no lighting” at Bagh-i-Jinnah and that the Sindh government would be responsible for any unfortunate incident.
On CM Afridi’s claims about his convoy being forced to take dangerous routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad, Shah said: “He had complete protocol, and as per the security threat issued, he was brought via the safest routes.
“Those were the safest routes, and police protection was with him,“ the PPP leader asserted.
“How could he have returned if there were pickets and if roads were blocked?” Shah asked rhetorically.
“As per the reports the administration has given, this protocol was adopted for their security and safety,“ the minister replied to a question about the police pickets set up.
When asked about the contradictory stances, Qaiser responded: “You and he both understand what is happening from where. Will a democratic political party take instructions in this manner? Will we not have a say?”
He further said that the PTI respected the PPP, adding: “Even if you say that we criticised Zardari sahib, that is our democratic right.”
On reports of shelling at Bagh-i-Jinnah earlier in the day despite the NOC, Shah said, “Something unpleasant happened there.”
He pointed out the welcome accorded to CM Afridi on Friday, asking if it would have been given “if there were some instructions from somewhere”.
Shah denied that the PPP “changed its strategy” because of the PML-N reportedly being criticised for its attitude towards the KP CM during his Lahore visit.</p><small>2026-01-11 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/112128478411331.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966382/egyptian-teenage-sensations-orfi-zakaria-clinch-karachi-open-squash-titles' target='_blank'><strong>Egyptian teenage sensations Orfi, Zakaria clinch Karachi Open squash titles</strong></a><br><p>World junior champions Amina Orfi and Mohamad Zakaria cemented their status as one of the best squash players as they clinched the championship title at the Karachi Open on Sunday in front of a packed court that cheered on the two Egyptian teenagers on their path to victory.
World number three Orfi was up against Malaysia’s Sivasangari Subramaniam, who she demolished 3-0 to take an expected victory with a scoreline of 11-8, 11-2, 11-7.
“The final is never an easy match,” the 18-year-old said after her 38-minute match that saw her win her fourth title of the season.
“Me and Siva have played several times this season, I know how dangerous she is; I just have to prepare in this sport very well.
“Thanks to the fans for supporting us, they’ve built the atmosphere and it made me happy to see the crowd here today cheering for both of us,” Orfi said.

Her compatriots stayed true to saving the best for last as Zakaria and Aly Abou Eleinen put on a show for the crowd in a dazzling 100-minute match.
The first game saw Eleinen prevail 11-9 after a series of minutes-long rallies that saw the two slipping on their own sweat.
Zakaria was trailing Eleinen 7-3 in the second game but finally found his rhythm and won 11-9 against his 26-year-old opponent, despite a break in play for a cut on his knee to be attended to by courtside medics.
Victory belonged to Zakaria in the third game as well – or so he thought. He had removed his protective eyewear and exited the court but Eleinen had already called for a player review that proved inconclusive. The two were neck-and-neck in the lengthy game that lasted 27 minutes before Eleinen switched gears and won 14-12 in a brutal, high-quality rally that delighted the crowd on Sunday evening.
Both players seemed tired by the time the fourth game rolled around, but Zakaria took the game 11-7 to level the score 2-2.
Eleinen was cramping up in the fifth game that saw Zakaria pull ahead, but not before hitting three costly errors. He nevertheless finished strong to seal his victory 11-7, not once, but twice. Another player review from Eleinen at the final point saw the referee shushing the crowd that cheered for Zakaria’s championship win.
The seconds ticked by, Zakaria had already dropped his racket and glasses to the floor and was waiting for a verdict when the referee upheld his decision that saw Zakaria win the biggest title of his career so far.
“I made it to the fifth game and I wasn’t tired, so I’m most impressed with my physical side this time because I’ve worked really hard on it,” Zakaria said after the match.
“I just won my first gold level event at 18 so I’m over the moon,” the ginger-haired teenager said to applause from the crowd.
“I grew up playing with Aly in Alexandria, so this was a proud moment for us to be playing a major final together,” Zakaria said.
Speaking to Dawn after the final, Eleinen echoed the same sentiment of Zakaria, “who I consider my younger brother.
“I’m eight years older but we grew up together and it’s amazing to see him doing so well,” Eleinen said of the teenager, who achieved his career-best ranking of 11 just last month.
“We always dreamed of playing major finals together, and today is hopefully a good step towards more battles that people can enjoy, and I’m sure people back home are proud of us.”</p><small>2026-01-11 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/11200534ba4c16d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966379/punjab-forensic-science-laboratory-report-confirms-may-9-arson-attacks-part-of-well-planned-conspiracy-by-pti-azma' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory report confirms May 9 arson attacks part of ‘well-planned conspiracy’ by PTI: Azma</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Minister for Information and Culture, Azma Bokhari, on Sunday said in a statement that the incidents involving arson attacks on Radio Pakistan building, toll plazas, and ambulances by the PTI in Peshawar on May 9, 2023, were part of a “well-planned conspiracy, and irrefutable evidence has now surfaced in the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory report.”
On May 9, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
“The planning was carried out by the same elements involved in the violence, and their statements — including those of Murad Saeed — are on record,” she said.
Bokhari added that evidence related to the May 9 incidents had already been presented before the nation earlier, but the “PTI leadership, true to its past conduct, chose to deny facts and fabricate false narratives.”
“Lying is not merely a habit of PTI; it has become a chronic disease from which they appear unwilling and unable to recover,” she remarked.
The minister emphasised that the individuals who stormed Jinnah House and engaged in vandalism were not ordinary people, but official office bearers and ticket holders of PTI.“
Despite this, a persistent false narrative was promoted, branding the events as a so-called ‘false flag operation’, she said, noting that even the party’s founder had publicly stated that he would apologise if incontrovertible evidence emerged.
“Yet, despite evidence surfacing repeatedly, there has been no remorse or acceptance,” she said.
Bokhari further stated that the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory was among Asia’s most credible forensic institutions and that the report —  which was dispatched on December 23 and  a copy of which is available with Dawn — included a complete forensic analysis of the Peshawar incidents, supported by videos and photographic evidence.
“It clearly documents the torching of Radio Pakistan, attacks on multiple toll plazas, and the burning of ambulances — all of which constitute grave criminal acts,” she said.
The PML-N stalwart categorically stated that all this evidence was admissible in any court of law, and those involved in rioting, vandalism, and damage to state property will be brought to justice.
“The politics of abusing, intimidating, and blackmailing the state through lies will no longer be tolerated,” Bokhari concluded. “The law will take its own course.”</p><small>2026-01-11 15:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/11195738a537845.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966380/india-proposes-requiring-smartphone-makers-to-share-source-code-with-govt-in-security-overhaul' target='_blank'><strong>India proposes requiring smartphone makers to share source code with govt in security overhaul</strong></a><br><p>India has proposed requiring smartphone makers to share source code with the government and make several software changes as part of a raft of security measures, prompting behind-the-scenes opposition from giants like Apple and Samsung.
The tech companies have countered that the package of 83 security standards, which would also include a requirement to alert the government to major software updates, lacks any global precedent and risks revealing proprietary details, according to four people familiar with the discussions and a Reuters review of confidential government and industry documents.
The plan is part of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to boost the security of user data as online fraud and data breaches increase in the world’s second-largest smartphone market, with nearly 750 million phones.

 

IT Secretary S. Krishnan told Reuters that “any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind”, adding it was “premature to read more into it”.
A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.
Ongoing tug of war over govt requirements
Apple, South Korea’s Samsung, Google, China’s Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian industry group that represents the firms, did not respond to requests for comment.
Indian government requirements have irked technology firms before.
Last month, it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security cameras over fears of Chinese spying.
Xiaomi and Samsung — whose phones use Google’s Android operating system — hold 19 and 15 per cent, respectively, of India’s market share and Apple 5pc, Counterpoint Research estimates.
Among the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code — the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.
The Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to “avoid malicious usage”.
“Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,” said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.
The security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.
Companies say source code review, analysis ‘not possible’
Smartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China’s request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and US law enforcement has also tried and failed to get it.
India’s proposals for “vulnerability analysis” and “source code review” would require smartphone makers to perform a “complete security assessment”, after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and analysis.
“This is not possible … due to secrecy and privacy,” MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters.
“Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.”

 

MAIT asked the ministry last week to drop the proposal, a source with direct knowledge said.
The Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones.
Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.
MAIT’s document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone’s battery and seeking government approval for software updates is “impractical” as they need to be issued promptly.
India also wants the phone’s logs — digital records of its system activity — to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.
“There is not enough room on device [sic] to store one-year log events,” MAIT said in the document.</p><small>2026-01-11 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1114032306a3d84.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966363/bride-and-groom-among-8-dead-in-explosion-at-islamabad-house-12-others-injured-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Bride and groom among 8 dead in explosion at Islamabad house, 12 others injured: officials</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: At least eight people died, and 12 others were injured in an explosion at a house in Islamabad’s Sector G-7/2 during wedding festivities on Sunday, officials said.
The officials said the deceased also included the bride and the groom.
According to Pak­is­tan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) spokesperson Dr Aneeza Jalil, six bodies and 11 injured people were brought to the hospital, where the injured were being provided medical treatment.
She told Dawn that an emergency was imposed in Pims after the incident on the directives of Executive Director (ED) Dr Rana Imran Sikander.
One of the injured was being treated at the hospital’s burns centre as he had sustained 20 per cent burn injuries, she said.
Dr Aneeza later told Dawn that nine of the 11 injured had been discharged, and among the two at the hospital, the condition of one was “unstable”.
The victim would have to undergo surgery, she added.
Meanwhile, Islamabad Additional Deputy Commissioner (General) Sahibzada Yusuf reached the site of the incident after the explosion on the directives of Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon.
He said while speaking to the media that at least four houses had been damaged by the explosion and confirmed that the deceased included the bride and the groom.
Moreover, he told media persons that apart from the bodies and injured taken to Pims, two other bodies and an injured person were taken to the Capital Hospital.
The explosion occurred at a wedding venue, where guests were also present, he said, adding that all those trapped had been rescued from the rubble by means of “advanced technology”.
The rescue team was conducting further checks using specialised equipment, ADC Yusuf said, further stating that an inquiry had been ordered to determine the exact cause of the explosion. However, he added, the incident seemed to be that of a cylinder explosion.
Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa also spoke to the media and said the explosion appeared to be a result of a gas leak.
“So far, we have concluded that this explosion occurred due to a gas leakage,” he said. “Nonetheless, we will carry out an independent probe into it. We‘ve received instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office to launch a proper inquiry and find out the reasons as to why this incident happened.”
When asked about compensating the victims’ families, Randhawa said, “It’s not possible that there would be any delay in compensating them. However, the verification process may take four to five days.”
He added that one of the houses had been completely destroyed in the explosion, and arrangements had been made for the dead bodies to be brought to a ground near the site of the incident. They would then be taken to a graveyard, he said.
Hanif Masih, the father of the deceased groom, said while speaking to the media that his son’s wedding was held on Saturday, and they had reached home the night before.
“At the time of the incident (explosion), I was present at home but sleeping in a separate room adjacent to the house. I woke up after hearing a loud explosion and rushed to the place of the incident, but by that time everything had already been destroyed,” he said.
He said apart from his son and daughter-in-law, his sister-in-law was also among the deceased, and his daughter and other family members were admitted to the hospital.
Masih excused himself from speaking any further, saying that he was overcome with grief.
A statement issued by the Senate Secretariat said that Senate Chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani had expressed grief over the incident that took place “during a wedding”.
He expressed sorrow over the loss of lives and extended condolences to the families of the deceased.
“This is a heart-wrenching incident that turned celebrations into mourning for a family,” the statement quoted him as saying, adding that he expressed concern over gas cylinder explosions.
“Such incidents demand that relevant departments fulfil their responsibilities seriously and ensure safety measures,” he said, stressing the need for an effective strategy to curb the “unsafe use of gas cylinders”. In this connection, he called for ensuring compliance with laws and educating the public about safety measures.
PM Shehbaz expresses grief, orders probe
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief over the loss of precious lives, prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and expressed condolences to the bereaved families.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), PM Shehbaz directed the federal minister for Health, the secretary of health, and the administration of Pims to remain on high alert and ensure that quality medical facilities were provided to the injured until their recovery.
He also directed the secretary Interior to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter and submit a detailed report to determine the causes of the incident and assign responsibility.

There have been no signs of Russian or Chinese ships or submarines around Greenland in recent years, the FT said, citing two senior Nordic diplomats with access to NATO intelligence briefings.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The White House and NATO did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
It is simply not true that the Chinese and Russians are there. I have seen the intelligence. There are no ships, no submarines, the FT quoted one senior diplomat as saying.
Another Nordic diplomat said claims that waters around Greenland were crawling with Russian and Chinese vessels were unfounded, adding that such activity was on the Russian side of the Arctic.Trump has repeatedly said Russian and Chinese vessels are operating near Greenland, a claim Denmark disputes. He has not provided evidence to support it.Trump said on Friday the US must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to prevent Russia or China from occupying the strategically located and mineral-rich territory.“The image that’s being painted of Russian and Chinese ships right inside the Nuuk fjord and massive Chinese investments being made is not correct,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said earlier this week.Vessel tracking data from MarineTraffic and LSEG show no Chinese or Russian ship presence near Greenland.Greenland’s assembly said late on Friday it would bring forward a meeting to discuss its response to US threats to take control of the island.Trump’s renewed push for Greenland, after US military intervention in Venezuela, worries many of the island’s 57,000 inhabitants, whose widely held goal is to eventually become an independent nation.</p><small>2026-01-11 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1113420245aebcf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966372/us-says-carried-out-large-scale-strikes-against-is-in-syria' target='_blank'><strong>US says carried out ‘large-scale’ strikes against IS in Syria</strong></a><br><p>US and allied forces carried out “large-scale” strikes against the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group in Syria on Saturday, the US military said, the latest response to an attack last month that killed three Americans.
US Central Command (Centcom), which oversees American military forces in the region, said multiple strikes “targeted ISIS throughout Syria,” using an acronym for the terrorist group.







Centcom’s post on X did not give specifics on where they took place.
Grainy aerial video accompanying the post showed several separate explosions, apparently in rural areas.
The strikes were part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched “in direct response to the deadly ISIS attack on US and Syrian forces in Palmyra,” Centcom said.

 


Two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter were killed on December 13 after a lone gunman — whom Washington described as an IS militant — ambushed them in Palmyra.
Syria’s interior ministry later said the gunman was a member of the security forces who had been set to be fired for extremism.
“We will never forget, and never relent,” US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Saturday in a post on X, replying to the Centcom statement.







The United States and Jordan carried out a round of strikes last month in response to the Palmyra attack, with Centcom saying at the time that “more than 70 targets” had been hit.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, later reported those strikes killed at least five IS members, including a cell leader.
On January 3, Britain and France announced joint strikes targeting an underground facility they said IS had likely used to store weapons.
The US personnel targeted in Palmyra were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the international effort to combat IS, which seized swaths of Syrian and Iraqi territory in 2014.
The IS members were ultimately defeated by local ground forces backed by international air strikes and other support, but the IS still has a presence in Syria, especially in the country’s vast desert.
US President Donald Trump has long been sceptical of Washington’s presence in Syria, ordering the withdrawal of troops during his first term but ultimately leaving American forces in the country.
The Pentagon announced in April that the United States would halve the number of US personnel in Syria in the following months, while US envoy for Syria Tom Barrack said in June that Washington would eventually reduce its bases in the country to one.
Syria govt forces detain 300 Kurds, evacuate 400 fighters from Aleppo
Meanwhile, Syrian government forces evacuated more than 400 Kurdish fighters from the last district in Aleppo to fall to the army and detained 300 Kurds, an interior ministry official told AFP on Sunday.
Kurdish forces said the combatants were evacuated “through the mediation of international parties to stop the attacks and violations against our people in Aleppo”.
The two sides clashed in Aleppo city earlier this week, after negotiations to integrate the Kurds into the country’s new government stalled.
The ministry official, who requested anonymity, said that 419 fighters, including 59 wounded and an unspecified number of “killed” were transferred from the Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood to the Kurds’ de facto autonomous zone in the northeast.
An AFP correspondent saw buses filled with men leaving Sheikh Maqsud under escort by government forces during the night.
The official added that 300 other Kurds, including fighters, have been arrested.
On Saturday, an AFP correspondent saw dozens of young men in civilian clothing seated on the ground and guarded by security forces, before they were transported to an unknown location.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP that 300 “young Kurds” had been arrested, stating that they were “civilians, not fighters”.
In the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli in the northeast, hundreds of people gathered for the arrival of the wounded, according to AFP correspondents on the ground.</p><small>2026-01-11 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/11105801cffbac2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966362/israels-recognition-of-somaliland-an-act-of-political-aggression-says-dar-at-oic-moot' target='_blank'><strong>Israel’s recognition of ‘Somaliland’ an act of ‘political aggression’, says Dar at OIC moot</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Sunday that Pakistan believed the recognition of the so-called “Somaliland” as an independent state by Israel was an act of “political aggression that sets a perilous precedent, threatening peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea region, and beyond”.
Dar said this while addressing the extraordinary session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers in Saudi Arabia.
His statement follows a joint statement by the OIC, which initiated its 22nd extraordinary session in Jeddah on Saturday. The moot has been convened against the backdrop of Israel recognising Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, with Soma­liland’s president, Abdira­hman Mohamed Abdul­lahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
Later, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”.
Dar expressed Pakistan’s “unwavering support for the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia” in his address today.
“We strongly condemn the illegal and unlawful recognition by Israel of the Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia and the subsequent unwarranted and highly provocative visit of its foreign minister to Somaliland,” he said.
He added that Pakistan also voiced its firm support for Somalia and condemned Israel’s actions during the UN Security Council’s briefing on the issue.
“We identify this development as a direct assault on Somalia’s internationally recognised borders, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law,” Dar said.
“The principle of state sovereignty and territorial integrity constitutes a peremptory norm of international law from which no deviation or derogation is permitted.”
Dar called the internationally-recognised borders of Somalia “sacrosanct and inviolable” and said that the Somaliland region remained an “integral, inseparable and inalienable part of Somalia”.
“No external actor has either the legal standing or the moral authority to alter that fundamental reality,” he said. “Any act, statement or recognition thereof by a state or an external entity regarding any part of the Federal Republic of Somalia should therefore be considered null and void, producing no political or legal effects.”
He added, “We believe that such recognition of an integral part of a sovereign state is not a diplomatic act, but an act of political aggression that sets a perilous precedent, threatening peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea region, and beyond.”
The foreign minister added that Pakistan joined the group of OIC countries in “unequivocally rejecting the unlawful Israeli move” through the joint statement released in the immediate aftermath of the supposed Israeli recognition of Somaliland.
The joint statement termed the recognition of “parts of states” a violation of the cardinal principles of international law and the UN Charter and noted the Israeli action’s potential “serious repercussions” for the Horn of Africa region, the Red Sea region and for international security as a whole, he said.
“The OIC and the wider international community’s firm rejection of this unlawful overture by Israel is, therefore, vital so that the impudent Israeli act does not set a precedent for other countries,” Dar added.
He said that the developments in the region were “particularly alarming at a time when Somalia is demonstrating encouraging and tangible progress on its political and institutional trajectory”, pointing out that the Federal Republic of Somalia had made notable strides in national reconciliation, constitutional reform and the revitalisation of state institutions.
“Positive trends in the financial sector, particularly the efforts related to economic legislation and the move towards an inclusive one-person-one-vote election, represent important steps towards consolidating Somalian democracy and stability,” he added.
“These gains reflect a Somali-owned and Somali-led path towards political reconciliation and cooperation,” he said.
“This positive momentum must be protected and reinforced, not sabotaged and undermined by actions that risk fragmenting the country and reversing hard-earned progress across the entire milieu of national indicators.”
In addition, he said that Pakistan also recognised the sacrifices and resilience of the Somali people and its security forces in thwarting the consistent threat posed by Al-Shabab and its affiliates.
“Israel’s brazen recklessness undermines regional and international efforts aimed at combating terrorism in a region beset with this challenge.
“It also opens the door to the creation of fragile environments susceptible to infiltration and exploitation by extremist groups, thereby negatively impacting regional and global security,” the foreign minister said, adding that in this context, continued support for Somalia’s security and stabilisation efforts remained “indispensable”.
“At this pivotal juncture, when Somalia is focused on defeating extremism, any action that deflects attention, weakens cohesion or fuels division is profoundly irresponsible,” Dar said.
He said that Pakistan fully aligned itself with the OIC’s call “for all states and organisations to refrain from any form of formal, semi-formal, or informal engagement with the authorities of Somaliland”, and to ensure that any engagement strictly respected the sovereignty and unity of Somalia.
“Pakistan categorically rejects any proposal or plan aimed at the forced displacement of Palestinians and linkages of Somaliland region of Federal Republic of Somalia with any such illegal action,” he added.
“Any action that advocates or implies the displacement or relocation of Palestinians not only violates international law but also undermines the prospect of a just and lasting peace in the region.”
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast support for the Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for self-determination, saying that the only path to lasting peace and stability lay in the realisation of an “independent, contiguous and sovereign” state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders and with Al-Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
Dar added that as a “frontline supporter” of the UNSCR 2803 and the “Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict”, Pakistan reiterated the intention to contribute to its successful implementation thereof, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the ceasefire, bringing an end to the conflict in Gaza, to secure a “dignified life” for the Palestinian people who had endured prolonged humanitarian suffering, and leading to a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.
“As a non-permanent member of the UNSC, Pakistan will continue to work with the OIC and Arab partners to mobilise global support for the Palestinian right to self-determination, justice and peace,” he said.
On the topic of India-occupied Kashmir, the foreign minister said that the unresolved dispute remained the “primary source of conflict in South Asia and a nuclear flash point”.
He stressed the urgent need for renewed and concerted efforts under the UN auspices to secure a “just, lasting, and peaceful resolution of the dispute“, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
Dar also appreciated the “strong, unwavering and consistent support that the OIC has always afforded to our Kashmiri brothers and sisters”. Nevertheless, he urged the OIC to step up its efforts to support a just resolution of the dispute.
Dar called upon the OIC and the broader international community to “speak with one voice” and firmly reject all actions that undermined Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
“This meeting today is a resounding manifestation of our collective solidarity with Somalia against a blatant transgression of its sovereignty by a decidedly unconscientious actor,” he said.
“On our part, Pakistan remains resolutely committed to standing with the government and people of Somalia as the country continues its advances towards continued peace and progress.”</p><small>2026-01-11 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/69630a701f0e2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966330/karachi-flyovers' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi flyovers</strong></a><br><p>FLYOVERS are being demolished all over the world because they are considered ugly and they break the openness of the city. The space they occupy is being turned into parks and recreational areas. This is being done through spatial reorganisation of the city, and by realising that building them is the most expensive way of trying to solve traffic-related issues.
When Karachi flyovers were first planned, there were professionals and civil society members who pointed out that they would solve traffic problems at non-rush hours. But at rush hours, they would increase them considerably. And today, conditions at rush hours at various nodes have become much worse than earlier — not only because of an increase of cars.
I can give a few examples of what has happened in the West, as I am sure that some readers are acquainted with the places I am going to mention. These projects are part of a larger city strategy to reclaim public space.

 

In the US, the Waterfront Park in Oregon is on a demolished freeway, and so is the West Side Highway in New York. Meanwhile, many US cities have proposals to remove elevated highways, converting them into public spaces, such as the Hudson River Park.
Similarly, France has turned expressways and elevated roads in Paris into green areas and pedestrian precincts. In the UK, too, in a number of areas, elevated highways have been demolished, creating public spaces, better environmental conditions and neighbourhood open spaces. This has also become a policy for the future.
Many of these areas, such as the Hammersmith flyover, which Karachi residents use on the journey to Heathrow on their way back to Pakistan, are also set to be demolished. However, the city most active in replacing flyovers and expressways with public space is Seoul in Korea. In the past decades, it has demolished some 18 flyovers and converted them into public spaces. Seoul hopes to achieve neighbourhoods where the dominance of automobiles and concrete structures is replaced by an environmentally friendly city. Seoul has a population of 10.26 million.

Flyovers have not solved the city’s problems.

Let’s come back to Karachi, which has built 43 flyovers in the last two decades. The FTC flyover opened to traffic in October 2004. It cost Rs109.4 million. Taking this as an average, the cost of these flyovers works out to around Rs5 billion, not taking inflation into consideration. They have not solved Karachi’s problems, and most of them were unnecessary, even to the then head of the traffic engineering bureau of the KDA, who was of the opinion that the decision to build the flyovers was not a technical but a political one.
As proof of this, there is the issue of the Gurumandir traffic management problem. Five roads converge at Gurumandir. A complex system of flyovers was envisaged for this and supported by the then president. The approximate cost worked out to Rs300m. However, the problem was solved very effectively by a traffic management and engineering solution with no flyovers, at a fraction of the calculated cost. Many professionals also feel that the flyovers help us in spending the loans that we take from IFIs.

 

Apart from aesthetics, the negative spaces created under the flyovers could have been used for public use (such as sports activities, parks for low-income communities, women’s toilets) instead of charity dastarkhwans and disorganised car parks. These are very large spaces, and with proper planning and no flyovers, they can still be used for public use. I am not advocating for their demolition, but for a public use of the spaces under them, and in future, the location of flyovers being decided on technical considerations and not for political and financial favours.
The cost of flyovers is added to by unnecessarily painting them with various motives of questionable aesthetic design. All over the world, most flyovers are finished in grey concrete so that the world of automobiles and buildings stands out in contrast, and the cost of repainting them periodically does not arise. The Lyari Expressway is 16.5 kilometres long. It is painted on both sides. The cost of this exercise works out to nearly Rs20m. It will have to be periodically painted, costing a huge financial loss to state agencies.
It is hoped that the lessons learned by the rest of the world are taken into consideration in the future, along with the points that have been raised in this article, when designing the location and deciding on the necessity of having a flyover. As a result, large volumes of land parcels can be used for the benefit of the majority of the people of the city, and not inappropriate and expensive solutions for the benefit of its elite.

Illustration by Abro

The sentiment that ‘revolution was just around the corner’ serves as a poignant distillation of the 1960s ‘counterculture’ zeitgeist. It was a unique historical moment, where global currents of youthful middle-class dissent converged to create a sense of inevitability that the old order was about to collapse.
There is a distinct sense of melancholy attached to this sentiment today, stemming from the fact that the revolution never actually materialised. The capitalist structures and political hierarchies that drew the fire of youthful protestors proved resilient.
The survival of the status quo was largely due to the durability of the modern state. When pushed hard, governments effectively reinforced their ‘law and order’ platforms, a strategy that successfully appealed to a more cautious general public. They prioritised stability over radical change, allowing the state to reassert control.
Capitalism demonstrated a remarkable capacity to co-opt the rebellion. Instead of being dismantled by the ‘rebellion’, the market absorbed it, rapidly transforming the potent symbols of revolution into mass-produced commodities. This allowed individuals to buy the aesthetic of a revolutionary without ever actually threatening the financial institutions that issued them loans and credit.
However, despite the political failures of the era’s uprisings, they did usher in some social shifts. As noted by the American sociologist Todd Gitlin, while the movements of the 1960s failed to topple governments, a “cultural revolution” effectively took root, fundamentally altering how society perceives authority, gender roles, racial dynamics and environmental stewardship.

From the counterculture of the 1960s to today’s ‘Gen Z revolutions’, mass uprisings have repeatedly failed to dismantle power because the modern state has learned how to absorb dissent, co-opt its language and rebrand itself without changing its core

But it is also true that the state gained a sophisticated understanding of how to manage dissent energised by middle-class youth. In the decades that followed, governments learned to neutralise modern, youth-led uprisings by absorbing their energy.
According to the American political scientist Christian Davenport, the evolution of state power since the 1970s has seen a sophisticated shift toward the “professionalisation of state survival”, moving away from blunt, reactive force in favour of nuanced containment. Modern states now prioritise strategies of co-optation and absorption, expertly identifying the leaders and aesthetic language of youth movements to bring them into the fold.
One way of doing this is by inviting activists into ‘advisory’ committees. This aids the state to effectively dissipate radical energy through institutionalisation. The state then allows for symbolic concessions, such as the resignation of a single unpopular official. This satisfies the activists’ immediate hunger for change but without threatening the underlying power structure. The most recent example in this regard is Bangladesh.



This management of dissent extends into the digital realm as well. The initial advantage held by youth activists in this area has been increasingly eclipsed by state-directed information management. And anyway, the digital landscape often gets flooded with a clutter of noises, so much so that a movement’s core message becomes diluted or misunderstood by the wider public.

 

Most post-1970s movements have taken on a bourgeoisie character. Therefore, the state strategically exploits the socio-economic stakes that the activists have in the existing system. Dissent has become the specialised vocation of the bourgeoisie. This is why it fails to achieve the critical mass necessary for systemic change. This is why, in most cases now, the state often treats dissent as a pressure valve to be managed.
The 1974 ‘Carnation Revolution’ against a fascist regime in Portugal is remembered as a popular uprising. It really wasn’t. According to the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, it was a ‘top-down’ transition initiated by the military. It was a coup d’etat. By leading the change from within, the rebel officers ensured that the transition remained institutional and controlled, effectively neutralising the more revolutionary working class elements.
This pattern, what Harvard University political scientist Tarek Masoud calls “decapitation without dismantling”, defines the subsequent ‘revolutions’ of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. In these instances, high-visibility, youth-led middle class protests succeeded in removing unpopular leaders, yet the underlying state machinery and power structures remained largely untouched.
These uprisings functioned as pressure valves. Examples include 2003’s ‘Rose Revolution’ in Georgia, 2004’s ‘Orange Revolution’ in Ukraine, 2011’s ‘Arab Spring’ (2011), 2022’s ‘Sri Lankan Aragalaya’ and last year’s uprisings in Bangladesh, Nepal and Madagascar. The newest trend in this regard are the so-called ‘Gen Z Revolutions.’
These cases prove that, unless an uprising targets the entire administrative and economic infrastructure, the state will simply rebrand itself while maintaining the old power dynamics. Targeting the entire infrastructure hasn’t happened since the revolutions in France (1789), Russia (1917), China (1949), Cuba (1958), Nicaragua (1979) and Iran (1979).

 

The American historian Crane Brinton established a rigorous “fever chart” for true revolutions, requiring a progression from the collapse of the old regime to a “Thermidor”, or the consolidation of an entirely new order. In contrast, most modern uprisings fail to reach this final stage. Learning from the upheavals of the 1960s, the state no longer tries to simply crush dissent. It manages it. By allowing an unpopular figurehead to be removed, the state provides a psychological victory to the protesters.
Uprisings in this regard are better described as pressure valves than revolutions. When the media labels these events as ‘revolutions’, it misses the fact that the underlying power structure is often stronger the day after the uprising than it was the day before.
Pakistan is an excellent example of this. The power structure actually grew stronger after the May 9, 2023 uprising staged by the supporters of the now jailed populist Imran Khan. Such events function as pressure valves because they provide an outlet for the energy of middle-class youth. But this energy fails to crystallise into an actual revolution.
The so-called ‘Gen Z Revolutions’ will also eventually be absorbed back into the systems they ‘fought’. The old machinery will re-assert itself, often rebranding the same power under the new, popular language of the ‘revolution’.
Nevertheless, while the term ‘pressure valve’ might suggest a failure to achieve total victory, this mechanism is arguably more vital to the long term health of a nation than a ‘Thermidorian’ revolution. The true danger of a systemic overthrow is the almost inevitable descent into a reign of terror or a vacuum of power that invites civil war, economic collapse, and permanent instability. Therefore, the preservation of certain deep-rooted instruments of the state are necessary for the survival of the nation.
By allowing pressure valves, these instruments allow for a change without destroying the hardware of the state. A society can move towards reform more effectively through incremental institutional change than through a total rupture that risks leaving the society in a state of permanent chaos.

The phenomenon is not limited to the big powers’ actions on the global stage but is mirrored by developments in the region and even within countries, with domestic politics being shaped by the ‘might is right’ principle, if it can be called a principle. The resultant scenario is scary to say the least.
This must be the reason that some of the ‘rattled’ middle-ranking economic-military powers are now forging alliances and concluding pacts so that their collective strength or power enables them to better negotiate the challenges and come out relatively unscathed from the reshaping of the world that seem underway. Let me get into the specifics.
The US-backed Israeli attack started against the around two million Palestinians in the tiny and largely defenceless Gaza Strip ostensibly triggered by the October 2023 Hamas attack. It has continued, despite the murder of thousands of civilians including children, in the face of worldwide demonstrations and calls for an immediate ceasefire by international institutions such as the UN. (In fact, the US sanctioned International Criminal Court judges and its prosecutor examining war crimes charges against Israeli leaders.)

Against the international backdrop, Pakistani foreign policy has so far delivered well.

But the October Hamas attack was only an excuse, as before the brutal Gaza bombing campaign was over, Israel also attacked Lebanon, annexed more of the Syrian Golan Heights and not just attacked Iran itself but also sucked in the US to bomb Iranian nuclear sites (by this time Donald Trump had moved into the White House).

 

This was the beginning of the reshaping of the Middle East, the move towards the realisation of the ‘Greater Israel’ dream. Those still defiant and seen as obstacles were attacked too like the Houthis in Yemen; allies were encouraged to increase their influence and footprint in non-Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen from sites overlooking the Red Sea water routes in the southwest to the northeast of the country.
The fighting in Sudan and the Israeli recognition of Somaliland across the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa are aimed at the same strategic objective: to have oversight of shipping routes south of the Suez Canal whether for transport of oil or other essential supplies.
But in the power game, even states with smaller militaries can apply economic levers effectively to be heard. And this assumes greater significance in the ‘transactional’ Trump era. So when the Israelis attacked targets on Qatari soil, it was seen as an overreach by even those countries in the region which restricted their reaction to lodging verbal protests during the Gaza genocide.
It also brought home the truth that American bases and troops on their soil were not there for their protection but served US interests and were there to project US power. This led to a flurry of activity and saw a defence pact inked between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Now a Bloomberg report suggests, citing unnamed sources, that Turkiye may join the pact too.
Of late, Saudi Arabia has reasserted its power and re-established itself as the main backer of forces in the non-Houthi parts of Yemen, bombing and evicting the South Transitional Council from areas the latter had taken over from the Saudi-backed Yemeni government in Sanaa after rebelling from the governing coalition.
Zooming out of the region, we can see the US reviving the Monroe Doctrine (Trump has rechristened it the ‘Donroe doctrine’) and applying it to Venezuela, after kidnapping its president and his spouse on the flimsiest of charges, some of which were amended between their snatching in Caracas and their indictment a day later in New York City.
Trump says the US will “run Venezuela” now, having left the regime in place, after an apparent deal with interim president Delcy Rodríguez and will sell their oil to who he likes but the country itself cannot sell oil, for example, to China, Cuba and Russia.
Donald Trump is also making similar noises about ‘hitting’ other South American countries, such as Colombia and Mexico, whose leaders do not conform to his (far) right-wing worldview. He also keeps repeating his desire to take over Greenland one way or another. Given the collapse of the rules-based order and US military might, who knows what he does next.
No different is the use of military power by Russia to make inroads into Ukrainian territory. Ukraine is a country that gave up its nuclear arsenal after the collapse of the Soviet Union primarily on account of US security guarantees.

 

Now under Trump, the US is telling Ukraine to pretty much forget about its lost territory and do a peace deal with Russia. It has nearly halted all military aid to Ukraine and also told Nato states in Europe that they must step up their defence spending dramatically because the leader of the so-called Free World is done underwriting their defence.
Against this backdrop, one must say, Pakistani foreign policy has so far delivered well with the three major world military powers the US, China and Russia seemingly onside, along with the well-resourced Gulf states. With Pakistan responding robustly and effectively to an Indian attempt to project power in South Asia by missile attacks on Pakistani soil without legal justification in May last year, Islamabad’s stock has risen in the world.
With the rules-based order becoming more of an irrelevance, Pakistan too appears to be taking inspiration from how domestic dissent particularly over Gaza has been handled in the US and Europe. Perhaps, Pakistan feels that when established democracies can get away with it, why shouldn’t a hybrid government? The answer is some distance away. The old order may be crumbling but what will rise from its ashes is still to take concrete shape.

Once again, it involves India, which has been intent on throwing its weight around. This time, though, it is getting a taste of its own medicine.
Less than a month before the Twenty20 World Cup is set to be played in India and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh have cited security reservations over travelling to India. The Bangladesh Cricket Board is, instead, in a discussion with the International Cricket Council about playing its matches in Sri Lanka.

 

Its concerns have been triggered on account of worsening Dhaka-New Delhi ties and the recent events related to its fast bowler Mustafizur Rehman.
Mustafizur had been signed by the Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders, only for the Board of Control for Cricket in India to ask the team to release him due to “recent developments”. The move sparked a furore in Dhaka, which banned the broadcast of the IPL in the country and asked the ICC to shift its World Cup matches from India.
Its argument is that when India cannot ensure Mustafizur’s safety, the only Bangladeshi played snapped up in the IPL auction, how can it guarantee the security of the entire team.
The World Cup, beginning on Feb 7, is set for geopolitical strains again after Pakistan-India tensions eased with an arrangement which sees both teams play their matches at neutral venues during tournaments held in either country.
Pakistan will play their World Cup games in Sri Lanka, just like India played their Champions Trophy matches in the UAE last year. India has cited security concerns for not sending its team to Pakistan. Now, it has to address Bangladesh’s similar concerns.
It is imperative for the ICC, led by former Indian cricket supremo Jay Shah, to make an impartial decision instead of forcing Bangladesh to play in India.

“Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. “The USA stands ready to help!!!”
The president later repeated the message in other posts as well while US media reported that Washington was mulling potential strikes against Iran.
Iran has witnessed waves of protests since late December, triggered largely by a sharp decline in the value of the Iranian rial and worsening economic conditions. The demonstrations began on Dec 28 near Tehran’s Grand Bazaar and later spread to several other cities.
On Friday, Trump said Iran was “in big trouble” as unrest grew, adding that the United States was “watching very closely” and warning Iranian authorities against using lethal force against protesters.
Iranian officials have accused the United States and Israel of fomenting the unrest, warning that security forces and the judiciary “will show no tolerance whatsoever toward saboteurs“.
On Saturday, Trump also reposted comments by US Senator Lindsey Graham on his Truth Social platform. In the post on X, the South Carolina lawmaker warned Tehran that its actions against protesters would not go unanswered.
Trump also reposted a Fox News report claiming that a protester had climbed the Iranian embassy in London on Saturday, torn down the current regime’s flag and hoisted a pre-revolutionary symbol.
Meanwhile, US media reports suggested the Trump administration was weighing tougher options. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration had held initial discussions on potential strikes against Iran.
The New York Post separately reported that Washington may carry out preliminary strikes on selected targets, though it did not specify when or which targets could be involved.
Separately, a retired US Navy officer urged the administration to expand support for Iranian protesters in cyberspace. Vice Admiral Robert Harward, a former deputy commander of US Central Command, called on Washington to establish new State Department initiatives to help Iranians gain access to secure virtual private networks (VPNs).
“Approximately 86 per cent of Iranians use VPNs to bypass government restrictions and online surveillance,” Harward wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News, arguing that expanded access to secure VPNs during internet disruptions would allow protesters to organise and communicate “more safely.”
Harward also urged the administration to draw up a target list of Iranian government entities involved in repressing free speech and violating human rights, including military command-and-control centres, cyber police headquarters and morality police facilities.</p><small>2026-01-11 05:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966329/troubling-events' target='_blank'><strong>Troubling events</strong></a><br><p>DARKNESS has descended over next-door Iran, where widespread, violent protests refuse to abate, posing the most serious governance and security challenges to the government in recent memory. With a nearly complete communications blackout in place, it has been difficult to obtain verifiable information from the country, and with various global powers taking increasingly assertive positions in the ongoing unrest, it is almost impossible to discern facts from propaganda in international reportage on Iran’s unfolding crisis.
We do know that, on Saturday, the Iranian army issued a statement saying it would safeguard strategic infrastructure and public property, while urging Iranians to “thwart the enemy’s plots”. Clearly, things have reached a point where the protests are being seen as a national security threat.
Inflammatory rhetoric from American leaders, including the US president, has not helped and, indeed, may have put Iranians in greater jeopardy by fanning paranoia.

 

There have been concerning reports of state buildings being set on fire, and both protesters and security forces being killed in clashes. Educational institutions have reportedly been closed in the worst-affected areas.
The current situation represents a dramatic escalation from about two weeks ago, when the protests had begun in response to soaring inflation. The agitation gradually turned political, with the protesters calling for the leadership to step down, expressing dissatisfaction in violent ways.
It bears remembering that Iran has been subjected to crippling sanctions for decades, most recently over its nuclear programme. Yet, despite facing extreme adversity, the Iranian leadership and, indeed, its people, have clung to their sense of national pride and refused to let others dictate terms to them.

 

It seems that the war with Israel last year left the country weakened. How this challenge is navigated will be a test for the Iranian people.
There is, of course, much for Pakistan to be concerned about, given that Iran is an adjacent neighbour and also a ‘brotherly’ nation. The uprising there cannot simply be considered an internal matter. Given the actors involved and the global forces seeking an opening, Pakistan must remain wary of how things unfold, as it will want to avoid any situation that brings another global conflict to its doorstep.
That said, this remains a matter for the Iranian people to resolve. The ruling class must identify and accept its mistakes, and move to address them decisively and transparently. It must win back the trust of those protesting or accommodate their demands to avoid a further meltdown. Meanwhile, the Iranian people must remain wary of those exploiting their divisions while posing as friends. Ultimately, a nation must decide what is best for it by itself.

KARACHI: Banks received 30 per cent fewer US dollars from exchange companies in the first half of the current fiscal year, according to official data.
Exchange companies sold about $1.4 billion to banks during July-December FY26, compared with around $2bn in the corresponding period of FY25, reflecting a decline of nearly 30pc.
Exchange companies are required to sell surplus foreign currency in the banking market. However, they are also allowed to sell dollars to individuals for specific purposes.
“The customers bought about $1.2bn in six months from exchange companies, kept $400m in bank accounts and the remaining $800m is not traceable,” said Malik Bostan, Chairman of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).
The untraceable $800m is believed to have been used for purchasing virtual currencies. Trading in virtual currencies remains unregulated in Pakistan, though the State Bank is working on a framework to regulate cryptocurrency transactions.
The government has expressed support for cryptocurrency trading and is willing to legalise it with the assistance of the State Bank. Selling dollars to the general public is not straightforward, as exchange companies typically issue cheques for encashment through banks or directly transfer dollars into buyers’ bank accounts instead of providing cash.
Data show that currency sales to banks have been on a declining trend from June to December 2025. The highest inflow was recorded in June, when banks received $408m.
At the start of FY26, sales stood at $279m in July, falling sharply to $163m in August. They recovered to $187m in September, rose to $243m in October, dipped slightly to $238m in November and increased again to $271m in December.
Despite rising remittance inflows this year, dollar sales by exchange companies to banks have declined.
“Special apps available on websites are attracting dollars from Pakistan. The current US dollar rate offered by these apps is around Rs292, which is highly attractive for dollar holders,” Mr Bostan said, adding that these platforms guide holders either to sell at these rates or invest in cryptocurrencies.
Exchange rate outlook
“The latest liquidity profile of the SBP shows aggregate short positions of less than $2bn, broadly in line with the IMF’s target, and suggests that reserve accumulation has not been driven by buy-sell swaps but by mopping up excess liquidity from the interbank market,” said Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark.
The current trajectory implies a potential breach of the Rs280 to a US dollar; however, with the real effective exchange rate at 104.8, competitiveness already appears stretched. In this context, the central bank should resist a decisive break below Rs280, preferring stability over signalling strength, particularly as import demand gradually recovers and longer-dated external pressures remain unresolved, he said.
“For now, the dollar-rupee parity is likely to remain range-bound, with two-way movement increasingly coming into play,” he added.

ISLAMABAD: At a time when the federal government is grappling with its own fiscal shortfall, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has raised concerns that revenue transfer shortfalls from the centre during the first half of 2025-26 have jeopardised the province’s ability to meet its annual budget surplus target, as agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The provincial government further warned that the delayed and reduced federal transfers are exerting significant pressure on its finances, particularly impa­cting the delivery of essential services in the merged districts of the former Federally Admini­stered Tribal Areas (Fata).
The issue was formally raised in a two-page letter from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Adviser on Finance to the Chief Minister, Muzammil Aslam, to Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb. The letter followed weeks after newly appointed Chief Minister Sohail Afridi publicly accused the federal government of withholding the province’s rightful share from the divisible pool.
The provincial government said that the budgeted surplus of Rs157 billion for the current fiscal year was based on the assumption that federal transfers would be released in full and on schedule. Any delay or shortfall in these transfers, the letter warned, directly undermines the province’s ability to uphold fiscal discipline and achieve its agreed surplus target.
The scale of the problem was most visible in the merged districts.
The KP government allocated Rs292bn for the merged districts in 2025-26, including Rs143bn for current expenditures, Rs50bn under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP), Rs40bn for the Annual Development Programme (ADP), Rs43bn as the province’s estimated 3 per cent share of the NFC award, and Rs17bn for temporarily displaced persons (TDPs).
However, actual federal releases during the first half of FY26 amounted to just Rs56bn, only 19pc of the total allocation. Provincial officials have warned that this shortfall has significantly constrained development activity and severely disrupted essential public service delivery in some of the country’s most historically neglected regions.
According to Mr Muzammil, despite limited federal support, the provincial government has continued to sustain development through its own resources. The province released Rs26.4bn under the AIP, even though it received no federal funding under this head.
Similarly, against federal releases of just Rs9.8bn, the KP government provided Rs16.4bn from its own budget to maintain development momentum, despite growing fiscal imbalances. For current expenditures in the merged districts, provincial spending has reached Rs63bn, while federal transfers stood at only Rs46bn, leaving a funding gap of Rs17bn.

 

The concerns now extend beyond the merged districts, as shortfalls in federal transfers continue to undermine KP’s fiscal stability. Releases under straight transfers have fallen sharply below target, only Rs19bn has been received so far against the annual allocation of Rs115bn, representing just 17pc of the total.
Moreover, shortfalls in divisible pool tax transfers have further strained the province’s finances. KP’s share in federal tax assignments for the first half of FY26 was projected at Rs643bn, including the 1pc share for the war-on-terror. However, actual receipts amounted to only Rs567bn — resulting in a shortfall of Rs76bn.
The shortfall is also pronounced in Net Hydel Profit (NHP) payments. Against a budgeted amount of Rs106bn for FY26, the federal government has released only Rs18bn during the first half, just 17pc of the expected disbursement.
These mounting revenue pressures have coincided with unavoidable spending obligations. The KP government incurred Rs28bn on flood response and rehabilitation efforts, along with an additional Rs7bn on support for TDPs. Officials warn that these unplanned expenditures have further squeezed the province’s already limited fiscal space.
The KP government has cautioned that if federal releases continue at the current pace, achieving the budgeted surplus of Rs157bn will become increasingly complex. It has called for urgent corrective measures, stressing the need for timely and predictable federal transfers in line with budgeted assumptions to stabilise provincial finances and protect public service delivery, the letter added.

Netanyahu has said Israel should not be reliant on foreign military aid but has stopped short of declaring a firm timeline for when Israel would be fully independent from Washington.
“I want to taper off the military within the next 10 years,” Netanyahu told said. Asked if that meant a tapering “down to zero”, he said: “Yes.”
Netanyahu said he told President Donald Trump during a recent visit that Israel “very deeply” appreciates “the military aid that America has given us over the years, but here too we’ve come of age and we’ve developed incredible capacities.”
In December, Netanyahu said Israel would spend $110bn on developing an independent arms industry to reduce dependency on other countries. The US and Israeli governments had signed a memorandum of understanding for the 10 years through September 2028 that provides $38bn in military aid, $33bn in grants to buy military equipment and $5bn for missile defence systems.

Netanyahu says Israel has developed ‘incredible capacities’ and has come of age militarily

Israeli defence exports rose 13 per cent last year, with major contracts signed for Israeli defence technology including its advanced multi-layered aerial defence systems.
US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Israel supporter and close ally of Trump, said on X, “We need not wait ten years” to begin scaling back military aid to Israel.







“The billions in taxpayer dollars that would be saved by expediting the termination of military aid to Israel will and should be plowed back into the US military,” Graham said. “I will be presenting a proposal to Israel and the Trump administration to dramatically expedite the timetable.”

The severe cold has reduced gas supply in several areas, causing serious difficulties for residents trying to keep their homes warm. The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) has been implementing loadshedding in Quetta and surrounding areas from midnight to 5am.
People in Kalat, Mastung, Ziarat, Pishin and several other areas are also facing similar gas shortages amid the ongoing cold spell.
However, residents say many localities in the provincial capital and its outskirts are not receiving gas properly even outside these hours. “We are getting gas for a very limited time without any timetable,” Mehmood Khan, a resident of the Sariab area, told Dawn, adding that the situation worsened after winter rain and snowfall on the mountains surrounding the Quetta valley.
Several localities in the main city area are also facing low or no gas supply from SSGC as temperatures plunged to between minus five and minus seven degrees Celsius. “We have no option but to purchase gas cylinders to keep our houses warm and for cooking,” Mansoor Ahmed, a resident of the posh Samungli Housing Scheme, said.
Amid the worsening situation, residents of the Sariab area, who have been facing the most severe gas shortages, staged a protest against low gas pressure and prolonged supply suspensions. Protesters burned tyres and erected barricades, blocking the road and bringing all types of traffic to a complete halt.
The protest came during an intense cold spell, with citizens facing severe hardship due to reduced gas pressure. The temperature in Quetta dropped to minus three degrees Celsius, while in Kalat it plunged to minus eight degrees Celsius.
Over the past several days of extreme cold, people in Quetta and surrounding areas — particularly the elderly, women and children — have been suffering because of gas shortages and outages.
Protesters said they had repeatedly informed SSGC officials about the low gas pressure, but no action was taken. In response, residents blocked the main Sabzal Road by burning tyres and placing obstacles, demanding the immediate restoration of adequate gas supply.
They said gas pressure in Killi Ferozabad and adjoining areas had dropped significantly, compounding their difficulties during the harsh winter.

According to a statement issued on Saturday, the apex court reiterated that institutional integrity, discipline, and strict adherence to prescribed procedures were non-negotiable, particularly in matters relating to official conduct and the administration of justice.
In disciplinary proceedings concluded under the Supreme Court Establishment Service Rules, 2015, Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi imposed ma­­jor penalties on three offi­cers of the SC’s Karachi registry.
The penalties were im­­posed for serious lapses in administrative respo­nse, including delayed reporting, failure to seek timely written directions, and delays in reconstructing judicial records from available digital copies, resulting in institutional concern.
Disciplinary proceedings were also concluded against an officer of the SC Lahore registry, following a complaint re­­po­rted through the anti-corruption hotline.
A major penalty was imposed on account of transparency-related issues.
“The Supreme Court underscores that while welfare and career progression of the members of staff is a priority, nevertheless transparency and compliance with established procedures are indispensable to the credibility of judicial institutions,” the statement read.

In a statement, the representative body of healthcare professionals said the “unannounced and aggressive entry of FBR teams into private healthcare facilities — particularly across Punjab — has reached an intolerable level of harassment”.
Such measures threaten the very fabric of healthcare delivery in the country, said PMA Secretary General Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro in a statement. “The PMA highlights that recent raids, which forced the immediate suspension of Outpatient Department (OPD) services, are not merely administrative issues; they constitute a direct interference in patient management and a violation of the sanctity of life-saving institutions,” according to the statement.
It said the presence of enforcement officials in clinics “creates an atmosphere of fear, causes psychological distress to patients, and disrupts surgical teams”.

Association claims such measures threaten fabric of healthcare delivery

“Tax collection must never come at the cost of human life. Doctors are not ‘traders,’ and hospitals are not ‘retail outlets’. The private sector serves over 70pc of Pakistan’s population. Treating healthcare providers as commercial vendors is a gross misinterpretation of a noble profession,” he stated.
“While we respect the rule of law, audits should be conducted through documented, professional channels not through ‘commando-style’ raids that victimise healers. This targeted victimisation discourages professional excellence and pushes our brightest medical minds to seek opportunities abroad,” it claimed.
The PMA said the doctors were ready to comply with taxation, provided there was accountability for how that money would be spent. “We demand that the tax collected from the sweat and toil of healers not be squandered on the luxurious lifestyles of the ruling elite,” he stated.
It called upon the PM and the finance minister to take immediate notice. “We demand an immediate cessation of these aggressive tactics,” Dr Shoro stated.
He warned that if the FBR does not immediately halt the ‘harassment’, the PMA will be forced to take the final, definitive step of a nationwide suspension of services. “The responsibility for any resulting healthcare crisis will rest solely on the shoulders of the FBR and the relevant authorities,” he added.
In December 2025, the FBR deployed Inland Revenue Service (IRS) officers to the premises of commercial hospitals and clinics, marking a shift toward on-site monitoring. The initiative gained momentum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.
Official figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan’s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns.
Of the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns.

The statement came after Trump repeated that Washington was “going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not”. European capitals have been scrambling to come up with a coordinated response after the White House said this week that Trump wanted to buy Greenland and refused to rule out military action.
“We don’t want to be Ame­ricans, we don’t want to be Danish, we want to be Gre­en­landers,” the leaders of five parties in Greenland’s parliament said in a joint statement.
“The future of Greenland must be decided by Greenlanders.”

US president asserts Russia or China may occupy Greenland if America doesn’t

They said no other country could meddle in this. “We must decide our country’s future ourselves — without pressure to make a hasty decision, without procrastination, and without interference from other countries,” they underscored.
Julius Nielsen, a 48-year-old fisherman in the capital Nuuk, said: “American? No! We were a colony for so many years. We’re not ready to be a colony again, to be colonised”.
A Danish colony until 1953, Greenland gained home rule 26 years later and is contemplating eventually loosening its ties with Denmark. Many Greenlanders remain cautious about making this a reality.
“I really like the idea of us being independent, but I think we should wait. Not for now. Not today,” Pitsi Mari, who works in telecoms, said.
“I feel like the United States’ interference disrupts all relationships and trust” between Denmark and Greenland, said Inaluk Pedersen, a 21-year-old shop assistant.
The coalition currently in power is not in favour of a hasty independence.
The only opposition party, Naleraq, which won 24.5pc of the vote in the 2025 legislative elections, wants to cut ties as quickly as possible but it is also a signatory of the joint declaration. “It’s time for us to start preparing for the independence we have fought for over so many years,” said MP Juno Berthelsen in a social media post.
According to a poll published on Saturday by Danish agency Ritzau, more than 38pc of Danes think the US will launch an invasion of Greenland under the Trump administration.
Denmark and other European allies have voiced shock at Trump’s threats on Greenland, a strategic island between North America and the Arctic where the US has had a military base since World War II.
‘Crucial for US security’
Trump says controlling the island is crucial for US national security given the rising military activity of Russia and China in the Arctic.
“We’re not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland. That’s what they’re going to do if we don’t.
So we’re going to be doing something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult way,” the US president said.
Both Russia and China have increased military activity in the region in recent years, but neither has laid any claim to the vast icy island.
Greenland has also attracted international attention in recent years for its vast natural resources including rare earth minerals and estimates that it could possess huge oil and gas reserves.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an invasion of Greenland would end “everything”, meaning the transatlantic Nato defence pact and the post-World War II security structure.

LAHORE: The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) has appealed to the people to take to the streets on Feb 8 to oppose “fascism, restore the Constitution, and safeguard the country’s sovereignty”.
“Those playing with the Constitution of Pakistan are a security risk,” TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai said while speaking to journalists at the Lahore Press Club on Saturday.
Mr Achakzai invited people from all walks of life to join the movement for the restoration of the Constitution and to take to the streets on Feb 8, marking the second anniversary of the February 2023 elections. “If we do not come out on the roads to stop fascism, restore the Constitution and the country’s sovereignty on Feb 8, we will all be responsible for Pakistan’s downfall,” he warned.
Flanked by TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Haqooq-i-Khalq Party chief Ammar Ali Jan and Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Mr Achakzai said powerful quarters had blocked the natural process of leadership development through suppression, leading to internal crises. Unlike other countries, he said, courts had even snatched a political party’s election symbol.
Referring to PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif, the TTAP chief said the former PM had tried to follow the constitutional path but was sidelined and punished with a 10-year forced exile.
Expressing hope that history would forgive him, Mr Achakzai said he had conveyed to Mr Sharif and would also speak to incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan that the next democratic government should honour judges who did not surrender to pressure and instead resigned from their positions, by conferring upon them the title of “Heroes of Democracy”. He said such judges should eventually be restored all the privileges they had given up in their struggle to uphold the Constitution, judiciary and courts.
Responding to a question, Mr Achakzai said Pakistan could approach the United Nations to convene a round-table conference involving Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and China to discuss issues and find solutions. “No country alone can find and implement solutions,” he added.
Allama Nasir Abbas said the “powerful” were blocking all avenues for reform and denying people their right to protest. “If the powerful block all ways to bring reforms, the people will rise to dismantle the oppressive system,” he warned. He said the martial laws imposed by Gen Ziaul Haq, Gen Pervez Musharraf and the current “undeclared martial law” were responsible for abrogating the Constitution.
Calling on people to join the movement, he said the TTAP had been launched to restore the Constitution and empower citizens to claim their due rights.
Ammar Ali Jan formally announced his party’s decision to join the TTAP movement for the restoration of the Constitution and democracy. He lamented that parliament had been rendered dysfunctional, the judiciary weakened and the media shackled. He said the country’s GDP was stagnant, more than 40 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line, educated and skilled youth were leaving the country, while a few companies were earning billions of dollars in profits.
He said the people of Pakistan had the right to decide who should represent and rule them, rather than having state institutions decide the fate of the country and its citizens. “Those who work within their defined responsibilities will earn respect and honour from the people,” he said, adding that those who crossed their limits would face resistance and chaos.
Former senator Khokhar said people’s lives had been ruined by the suppression of opposition. “When you push the opposition against the wall, people themselves rise and assume the role of opposition,” he said, citing the example of Azad Kashmir, where an elected government was deposed.
Later, a TTAP delegation, led by Mr Achakzai and Allama Nasir Abbas, visited Minar-i-Pakistan and spoke to journalists. Local authorities allowed the delegation to enter the historic site but barred its workers and supporters who chanted slogans against the Punjab government.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Achakzai called on the people to take to the streets on Feb 8 to stand against oppression and fascism and restore true democracy, as envisaged in the Lahore Resolution. He said anyone who suspends or alters the Constitution is liable to punishment under Article 6.
Allama Nasir Abbas said the delegation had come to Minar-i-Pakistan to send a message that the country belongs to its people, and that everyone must come forward to save it from the clutches of oppressors. He asserted that the fascists would ultimately be defeated by the people of Pakistan.
Mustafa Nawaz Khokar said the Punjab government had effectively turned Iqbal Park into a “no-go area” for the public on weekends, noting that the Pakistan Day Resolution was passed at the park.
The TTAP leaders also chanted slogans like “Hum zulm mitanay niklay hein, aao hmaray saath chalo”.
The TTAP delegation also met people on city streets in the night and urged them to join the movement, close shops and observe a wheel-jam on Feb 8. They also distributed pamphlets prepared by the PTI Punjab across city streets, roads and at people’s residences.
The delegation also visited Mazar-i-Iqbal and Bibi Pakdaman to pay homage.

The committee will visit Peshawar and, in coordination with public representatives, review the progress of these schemes.
According to the PM Office Media Wing, the premier met political representatives from KP and assured them about timely completion of ongoing Centre-funded development projects in the province.
He stated that the federal government was fully aware of the problems faced by the people of KP and taking tangible steps, within its jurisdiction, to ensure sustainable solutions to those issues. A detailed discussion was also held on the overall political situation in the province and the challenges faced by the public. Matters related to public welfare, development projects and governance were discussed as well.
‘Lack of governance’
The participants informed the prime minister that the provincial government had completely failed due to a lack of governance.
They said the provincial government had no clear policy regarding health, education, infrastructure or public welfare and was paying little attention to resolving public issues.
The PM urged public representatives to prioritise the resolution of public problems, adding that he had recently distributed laptops, on merit, among male and female students across KP in Haripur.

Major Iranian cities were gripped overnight by new mass rallies denouncing the Islamic Republic, as activists on expressed fear that authorities were intensifying their suppression of the demonstrations under the cover of an internet blackout.
The two weeks of protests have posed one of the biggest challenges to the Iranian authorities, although Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed defiance and blamed the United States.
Following the movement’s largest protests yet on Thursday, new demonstrations took place late Friday, according to images verified by AFP and other videos published on social media.
This was despite an internet shutdown imposed by the authorities, with monitor Netblocks saying early on Saturday that “Iran has now been offline for 48 hours”.







The blackout has sparked fears among activists that authorities are now violently cracking down on the protests, with less chance that the proof will reach the outside world.
According to a report by the Iran Human Rights Activists News Agency, the death toll in the protests rose to 65, Anadolu reported.
The report added that protests took place in 512 locations in 180 cities in all 31 provinces, resulting in the deaths of 50 protesters, 14 law enforcement and security officials, and one government-affiliated civilian.
Demonstrations also left dozens injured and 2,311 detained. The injuries were largely caused by pellet shots and plastic bullets, according to the report.
Authorities have not issued a statement about those killed or injured.
Amnesty International said it was analysing “distressing reports that security forces have intensified their unlawful use of lethal force against protesters” since Thursday in an escalation “that has led to further deaths and injuries”.
Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi warned on Friday that security forces could be preparing to commit a “massacre under the cover of a sweeping communications blackout”, and said she had already received reports of hundreds of people being treated for eye injuries at a single Tehran hospital.
Norway-based Iran Human Rights group has claimed that at least 51 people have been killed in the crackdown so far, but warned the actual toll could be higher.
Iranian authorities are using the “most blatant tools of repression”, prize-winning filmmakers Mohammad Rasoulof and Jafar Panahi said, pointing to the internet blackout.
“Experience has shown that resorting to such measures is intended to conceal the violence inflicted during the suppression of protests,” they added.
‘Seize city centres’
In Tehran’s Saadatabad district, people banged pots and chanted anti-government slogans as cars honked in support, a video verified by AFP showed.
Other images disseminated on social media and by Persian-language television channels outside Iran showed similarly large protests elsewhere in the capital, as well as in the eastern city of Mashhad, Tabriz in the north and the holy city of Qom.
In the western city of Hamedan, a man was shown waving a Shah-era Iranian flag featuring the lion and the sun amid fires and people dancing.
In the Pounak district of northern Iran, people were shown dancing round a fire in the middle of a highway. It was not possible to immediately verify the videos.
Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted Shah, hailed the “magnificent” turnout on Friday and urged Iranians to stage more targeted protests on Saturday and Sunday.







“Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centres,” Pahlavi said in a video message on social media.
‘Big trouble’
Pahlavi, whose father Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was ousted by the 1979 revolution and died in 1980, added he was also “preparing to return to my homeland” at a time that he believed was “very near”.
Authorities say several members of the security forces have been killed, and Khamenei, in a defiant speech on Friday, lashed out at “vandals” and accused the United States of instigating the protests.
State TV on Saturday broadcast images of funerals for several members of the security forces killed in the protests, including a large gathering in the southern city of Shiraz.
Iran’s army said in a statement that it would “vigorously protect and safeguard national interests” against an “enemy seeking to disrupt order and peace”.
National security council chief Ali Larijani said in comments broadcast late Friday that “we are in the middle of a war”, with “these incidents being directed from outside”.
US President Donald Trump again refused on Friday to rule out new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic Republic in June.
“Iran’s in big trouble. It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,” Trump said.
Protester replaces flag at Iranian Embassy in London
A protester briefly replaced the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran at its London embassy with a former flag, flown before 1979, during a demonstration today, witnesses told AFP.
A video posted to social media showed a man on the balcony of the embassy, near Hyde Park, replacing the country’s current flag with one used during the rule of the ousted shah to cheers from hundreds of demonstrators below.
The flag — tri-coloured, with a lion and sun, surrounded by a wreath and crown — was a ceremonial one used in Iran before the 1979 revolution. It stayed in place for several minutes before being removed, witnesses on site told AFP.

“Democracy for Iran. Shah Reza Pahlavi. Justice for Iran,” chanted the demonstrators, referring to the son of the late shah of Iran who now lives in the United States. Some also held placards reading “Free Iran”.
“I’m here to support Iranians, my loved ones inside Iran — they’ve been protesting for two weeks today,” said one demonstrator, Taraneh, 33, who declined to give her last name.
“The internet has been shut down … We get very little information from inside Iran,” she added. “But, you know, people are still in the streets. They’re being attacked.“</p><small>2026-01-10 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1016083840d5374.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966198/cold-weather-prompts-punjab-sindh-to-change-school-schedules' target='_blank'><strong>Cold weather prompts Punjab, Sindh to change school schedules</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat on Saturday announced that the government decided to extend winter vacations in all public and private schools across the province till January 19, citing the extremely low temperatures expected in the coming days.
The decision comes a day after Hayat rebuffed rumors and fake news on social media regarding the extension of holidays and maintained that schools would reopen on Jan 12.
The education minister, however, created a poll on his X account, asking people if schools and colleges should reopen from Jan 12 or 19. The majority of the users voted for Jan 19.







In the latest post today on X, Hayat wrote: “In view of the prolonged severe winter spell and the forecast of extremely low temperatures in the coming days, and on the advice of PDMA, the Government of Punjab has decided to extend winter vacations until January 19.”



Meanwhile, in a separate notification, the Punjab Higher Education Department stated that winter vacations for higher educational institutions were extended from January 10 to January 16 due to the severe weather.
“All colleges (public and private) shall re-open on Monday, January 19, 2026, resuming [the] full/normal week for all classes,” the notification, available with Dawn, read.
It added that BS 4-year programmes would continue to function and all examinations would be held as per the notified schedules of boards and universities.



The Punjab government had announced winter vacations for all public and private schools and colleges from December 22 to January 10.
Earlier in the week, a fake notification claiming to have been issued by Punjab’s School Education Department went viral on social media, spreading confusion among parents and students.
The notification claimed that “due to severe weather conditions,” the vacations had been extended until January 17, and that schools would reopen on January 19.
Sindh govt changes school timings until Jan 26
The Sindh government today notified new school timings in the province due to the prevailing cold weather.
A weather advisory from the Met Office forecast cold and dry weather over most districts in Sindh, with a minimum temperature of 9º Celsius and a maximum of 25ºC.“Moderate to dense fog is likely to persist over Sukkur, Rohri, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Shaheed Benazirabad, Dadu, Larkana, Tando Jam, Mohenjodaro and surrounding areas,” the advisory read.
According to a notification from the Sindh government, available with Dawn, all private and public educational institutions would open from 9am on January 12 (Monday) until January 26.



The changes to school timings would apply to educational institutions “under the administrative control of the school education and literacy department”, the notification read.
The decision was made after Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah consulted Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah. While schools will open at 9am, school closure times will remain the same.</p><small>2026-01-10 17:16</small></div><hr>
