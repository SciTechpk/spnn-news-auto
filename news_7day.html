<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22193856147a7fb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943920/tiktok-us-to-hold-copy-of-algorithm-secured-by-oracle-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>TikTok US to hold copy of algorithm, secured by Oracle: White House</strong></a><br><p>Tech giant Oracle is set to provide security for a US version of TikTok’s algorithm, the White House said on Monday, under a deal for the sale of the Chinese-owned app’s American operations.
The proposal moves TikTok’s US operations into a new joint venture based in the United States, a senior White House official told reporters, adding that the entity would involve a “majority-American board of directors.”
Oracle, in turn, is expected to serve as a security provider.
 
 

The agreement provides that a copy of TikTok’s content recommendation algorithm be brought into the US joint venture system, the official said.
“It’s going to be fully inspected and retrained by the security provider on US user data, and then it’s going to be operated by that US entity,” the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Washington has forcefully sought to take TikTok’s US operations from the hands of the Chinese parent company ByteDance over national security reasons.
Under President Donald Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, Congress passed a law to force ByteDance to sell its US operations or face a ban of the hugely popular platform.
US policymakers, including Trump in his first presidency, have warned that China could use TikTok to mine data from Americans or exert influence on what they see on social media.
On Monday, a US official said the algorithm would be “continuously monitored” to ensure it is “not being unduly influenced.”
The latest updates came after Trump hailed progress Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping on issues including TikTok after both leaders spoke by telephone for the second time since Trump’s return to the presidency.
Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week, declaring that the terms of the TikTok deal meet US national security needs, the US official said Monday.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News over the weekend that “there will be seven seats on the board that controls the app in the United States, and six of those seats will be Americans.”
Trump separately added that media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his eldest son, Lachlan, could be among the investors who will take control of TikTok in the United States.
Trump’s TikTok deal will satisfy 2024 law requirements, official says
Meanwhile, Trump will sign an executive order later this week that declares that a deal to divest TikTok’s US operations from its Chinese owner ByteDance will meet requirements set out in a 2024 law, a White House official said.
The US is confident that China has approved the deal and does not plan further talks with Beijing about its details, the official told reporters on a conference call, but added that additional paperwork is required from both sides to approve the deal.
The official added that the valuation of TikTok’s US assets will be “many billions of dollars.” The US government will not take a board seat or get a golden share in the new entity that will own TikTok US, but it is unclear if the US government will get payments as a condition of approval.
ByteDance will own less than 20 per cent while TikTok US will be controlled by a mix of its existing US and global firms as well as a significant number of new investors who have no affiliation with ByteDance, the official said.
The full slate of investors is not yet finalized, but will include major firms like Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake.
Trump said on Sunday that media mogul Lachlan Murdoch and business leaders Larry Ellison and Michael Dell would be involved as US investors in a proposed deal to keep TikTok operating in the United States.
Trump is trying to keep the short video app with 170 million US users from being banned after Congress passed a law that ordered it shut down by January 2025 if its US assets were not sold by the owner ByteDance.
Trump has delayed enforcement of the law through mid-December amid efforts to extract TikTok’s US assets from the global platform, line up American investors and ensure that the new ownership qualifies as a full divestiture needed under the 2024 law.
Trump’s executive order will include a new 120-day enforcement pause to allow the investors and ByteDance to close the agreement, the official added.
Last week’s progress toward a deal on TikTok marked a rare breakthrough in months-long talks between the world’s two biggest economies that have sought to defuse a wide-ranging trade war that has unnerved global markets.</p><small>2025-09-22 17:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22195615fa6184f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943918/khokhar-to-file-appeal-as-sc-registrar-returns-plea-seeking-fixation-of-cases-against-26th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Khokhar to file appeal as SC registrar returns plea seeking fixation of cases against 26th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar on Monday announced he would challenge the Supreme Court (SC) registrar’s decision to return his petition, which sought the court’s intervention to fix the hearing of pending petitions contesting the 26th Constitutional Amendment before a full bench.
“This amounts to undermining and closing the doors of justice. Will file an appeal,” Khokhar said on X.
 






The 26th Constitutional Amendment takes away the SC’s suo motu powers, sets the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowers a special par­liamentary committee to nominate the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges.
Invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the apex court for the enforcement of fundamental rights under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, Khokhar had pled the apex court on September 4 for the immediate fixation of the pending challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full court, in compliance with the Oct 31, 2024, decision of the judges’ committee under the 2023 Practice and Procedure Act — which called for fixing challenges to the 26th Amendment before a full court.
However, the registrar returned the petition in a September 19 notice to Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, the advocate-on-record for the petitioner, saying that Khokhar had “not pointed out as to what questions of public importance in the instant case are involved with reference to enforcement of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, so as to directly invoke jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution”.
The notice further said Khokhar was invoking the SC’s extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 184(3) for the “redressal of an individual grievance, which is not permissible” in terms of a prior judgment reported as 1998 SCMR 793, “Zulfiqar Mehdi. Vs. PIA, etc”.
“Ingredients for invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of this court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution have not been satisfied.
“Notice issued to the respondents is not properly drawn as it is not mentioned therein that for what purpose this constitution petition is being filed before this court,” the notice said, adding that multiple prayers were made in one constitutional petition.
Last month, CJP Yahya Afridi had ignored the decision made last year by a committee, constituted under the Practice and Procedure Act 2023, to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment of the Constitution before the full SC.
Since October 2024, multiple petitions have been filed with the SC challenging the amendment, contending that it “abrogates, repeals, alters and destroys the basic features of the Constitution” and “violates” fundamental rights.</p><small>2025-09-22 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/222119137983ddd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943894/nashra-inspired-pakistan-women-make-easy-work-of-south-africa-in-final-pre-world-cup-odi' target='_blank'><strong>Nashra-inspired Pakistan women make easy work of South Africa in final pre-World Cup ODI</strong></a><br><p>Nashra Sandhu-inspired Pakistan made easy work of South Africa with a 6-wicket win in their final one-day international (ODI) in the lead-up to the Women’s World Cup on Monday.
The left-arm spinner ended up with career-best figures of 6-26 as the Proteas were skittled out for 115 within 26 overs at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore — before the Women in Green chased it down with 19 overs to spare.
South Africa rested key players, including the player-of-the-match from their last encounter — Tazmin Brits — who had scored a mammoth unbeaten 171 in the match on Friday.
Nashra had spoken to Dawn.com ahead of the Green Shirts series against Ireland, where she shared her cricketing journey.

The Green Shirts were bowling first after losing the toss in their third and final ODI of the series.
Proteas skipper Laura Wolvaardt called the coin toss correctly at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore and chose to bat first.
Eyman Fatima made her debut for the Green Shirts and spin all-rounder Syeda Aroob Shah returned to the side.
 






Nashra started her six-wicket haul by dismissing Proteas’ Sune Luus, and the South African never recovered as she ran through the inexperienced batting line-up.
She was adjudicated player-of-the-match for her tremendous performance with the ball on a track which was a typical Lahore wicket.
Sidra Amin top-scored for the Women in Green again with an unbeaten 50 that anchored the innings after some early jitters.
 






In the second ODI on Friday, the Women in Green were all set to chase South Africa’s daunting 313-run total, but fell 25 runs short.
A spectacular knock by Sidra Amin, who became the first Pakistani batter to score consecutive centuries, brought them close, but in the end, the Duckworth-Lewis method adjusted 313-run target was a step too far.
 
 

Setting a mammoth score to chase after the Proteas batters ruled the roost in the first innings, Sidra stepped up again under the Gaddafi Stadium lights to score a sublime hundred — but failed to close the chase.
The Proteas had sailed to an easy victory over Pakistan after chasing down a target of 256 to win by eight wickets in the first ODI of their series in Lahore on Tuesday.
The ODIs were all staged at the Gaddafi Stadium, with the first ball of all matches bowled at 3:30pm.
Pakistan’s 15-member squad is captained by Fatima, while Laura Wolvaardt leads the visiting side. In the build-up to the series, Pakistan held a two-week pre-series camp in Lahore, which included practice sessions and scenario-based matches.
The squad featured one uncapped player, Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland in Dublin in August.
 
 

The series provides both sides with an opportunity to finalise preparations for the eight-team World Cup, set to take place from September 30 to November 2 in India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka.
Head-to-head, in 28 ODI matches, South Africa had an upper hand against Pakistan, but the last time both sides met, Pakistan defeated South Africa by eight wickets in the ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 series fixture at the National Stadium in Karachi on Sept 14, 2023.

India romped home on Sunday with a six-wicket win, chasing down the 172-run target with ease in their second high-intensity encounter against Pakistan in the tournament.
Pakistan rode on a brilliant 45-ball 58 from opener Sahibzada Farhan but managed 171-5 after romping to 93-1 in 9.3 overs.
 


Speaking at the pre-match press conference on Monday, before Pakistan clash with Sri Lanka tomorrow, the opener said: “We are confident that we will face India again in the final (of the Asia Cup).”
Speaking about his celebration after he scored his half-century against India, he said: “I hardly celebrate after a 50. It was a spontaneous thought to celebrate that way — I don’t care for what people are making of it.”
He added that Fakhar’s role from the other end gave him confidence to play his shots.
 
 

In Pakistan’s last match against India, the bitterness between the  two sides — which started with India’s refusal of customary handshakes in the first encounter — had continued as Abhishek Sharma at the post-match ceremony said: “Today (Sunday) it was very simple, the way they (Pakistan) were coming (at) us for no reason, I didn’t like it at all, and this is the only way I could give [an answer] with my bat.”
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking after the match, had said, “We are yet to play the perfect game. We batted really well — but I think when it came to the bowling, they took the game away in the powerplay.”
Earlier, Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka by four wickets in their match in Dubai on Saturday.
The top two teams from Super Four will play the Asia Cup final in Dubai on September 28.</p><small>2025-09-22 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22155346e471f39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943869/sindh-cm-takes-notice-of-gun-attack-on-anchorperson-imtiaz-mir-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh CM takes notice of gun attack on anchorperson Imtiaz Mir in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Monday took notice of an attack last night on Metro 1 News anchorperson Imtiaz Mir in Karachi’s Malir area that injured him.
According to a statement issued by the Saudabad police station late last night, Mir was shot and injured by unknown gunmen in Malir district’s Kala Board area. “It seems to be targeted,” said the statement, adding that further investigation was under way.
CM Shah took notice of the “murderous attack on senior journalist Imtiaz Mir”, said a statement issued by the CM’s spokesperson, Abdur Rasheed Channa.
Expressing deep regret over the incident, the chief minister sought a report on the incident from Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon.
Saudabad Station House Officer (SHO) Atiqur Rehman told Dawn.com, “The journalist is admitted at the intensive care unit of [a] private hospital.”
He added that Mir sustained two bullet wounds, including one on the mouth. “He was travelling in a car, which his brother was driving, when armed pillion riders targeted him at Malir’s Kala Board,” SHO Rehman said.
 
 

Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, in a statement earlier today, condemned the attack and ordered the immediate arrest of the perpetrators. He also sought a report from the East district’s deputy IG.
“Protection of journalists and media workers should be ensured at all costs,” Lanjar was quoted as saying.
“Protection of the lives and property of citizens is the top priority of the government. The suspects should be brought to justice,” he asserted.
The police were also directed to reveal the motives behind the attack, the statement added.
 






According to a report published earlier this month by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.
In May, police in Shikarpur claimed to have killed Sheroo Mahar — a notorious dacoit nominated as the prime suspect in the murder case of senior journalist Jan Mohammad Mahar in August last year — in a drone attack in the kutcha area of the district. The journalist, who worked for Sindhi language KTN news network, was shot dead by unknown assailants who had opened fire on his car after he left his office in Sukkur in late evening hours on August 14, 2024.
In April, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) expressed concern over threats issued to journalists by supporters of a religious party.
The same month, Khairpur police claimed to have arrested five suspects allegedly involved in the murder of journalist Allah Dino Shar aka A.D. Shar, who worked for an Urdu news channel. Shar was murdered in Aliabad within the jurisdiction of Thari Mirwah police station, sparking protests by his community at press clubs across Khairpur district.
In November last year, Nadeem Ahmed, a senior reporter at 92 News TV channel, was shot at and wounded in an armed attack in Karachi’s Karsaz area.</p><small>2025-09-22 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/221617040f676bf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943886/hrcp-says-shocked-to-hear-about-civilian-killings-in-alleged-aerial-bombing-in-kps-tirah' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP says ‘shocked’ to hear about civilian killings in alleged ‘aerial bombing’ in KP’s Tirah</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said on Monday it was “deeply shocked” to hear about reports of the killing of several civilians caused by alleged “aerial bombing” in the Tirah area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and demanded a probe into the matter.
The “HRCP is deeply shocked to learn that a number of civilians, including children, have been killed, allegedly as a result of aerial bombing in Tirah, Khyber district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the organisation posted on X.
It demanded that “the authorities carry out an immediate and impartial inquiry into the incident and hold to account those responsible”.
“The state is constitutionally bound to protect all civilians’ right to life, which it has repeatedly failed to secure,” the HRCP statement read.
 






So far, no official statement sharing the details of the reported incident has been issued by the relevant authorities. Dawn.com has reached out to Khyber Deputy Commissioner Bilal Shahid and District Police Officer Mazhar Iqbal for a comment, but has not received any response so far.
Meanwhile, a senior police officer in the area told AFP on condition of anonymity that “the jets targeted four houses, which were completely destroyed”. He, however, did not say who carried out the attack.
KP Assembly Speaker Babar Swati called on the federal and provincial governments to conduct a “transparent and immediate investigation into the incident, identify those responsible, and not only provide immediate relief and compensation to the affected families but also take comprehensive measures for their rehabilitation”.
A statement uploaded on his X account said he expressed his sorrow over the “martyrdom of innocent civilians and the destruction of homes due to the bombardment by jet aircraft”.
 






Special Assistant to Chief Minister for Communication and Works Sohail Afridi also raised his voice on the matter during today’s KP Assembly session. He said the “horrifying tragedy” occurred at 2am in Tirah.
He alleged that 25 people, including women and children, were killed when “mortar and bombs were dropped” on the locals. He blamed the security forces for the incident, however, it has not yet been independently established who was responsible.
Mohammad Iqbal Khan Afridi, member of the National Assembly from Khyber, expressed sorrow over the incident in a video message in Pashto, which he shared with the media.
He said elderly women and children were killed in “shelling by jets” in Tirah and urged the people to reach the site of the incident to protest the killings.
The MNA said it was not the first time that such an incident had taken place. “The killing of civilians has become a routine.”
In a similar incident in May, 22 people, including seven children, were injured in an alleged quadcopter strike in the Wana tehsil of KP’s South Waziristan district.
Around a week earlier, four children were killed and five others were injured in a suspected quadcopter munitions drop in Mir Ali tehsil of the North Waziristan district in KP. Later, the military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

The bodies of three transgender individuals were recovered from Karachi’s Memon Goth area after midnight on Sunday, according to Edhi Information Centre. It said the bodies were found riddled with bullet holes and that the deceased were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medicolegal formalities.
The complaint was filed at Memon Goth police station on Sunday under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, registered by a transgender person who lived in the same building as the three victims, they told the complainant on Saturday evening that they were headed to Bahria Town on Super Highway.
“I tried calling them, but they did not answer. I kept calling them until 1am,” the complainant stated in the FIR. Ït was not until I opened WhatsApp that I found they were headed back to Karachi from Nagori Society in Hyderabad, when they were attacked in a forested area on the Super Highway.
“An unknown person, or persons, shot and killed them,” the complainant alleged. “I filed this complaint because unknown people killed them for unknown reasons and legal action needs to be taken.”
A research report jointly compiled this year by Blue Veins and the National Commission on Human Rights found that many transgender individuals in Pakistan experience social exclusion, including rejection by families, employment discrimination and violence, pushing them further into vulnerability.
In July, armed motorcyclists killed a transgender person in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand division. The same month, another transgender person was shot dead by unidentified persons in the Tehkal area of Peshawar.
Last year, two transgender persons were stabbed to death in Mardan by assailants, who fled the scene after committing the crime, according to the police.</p><small>2025-09-22 13:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2216540880a44f7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943906/new-polio-case-in-hyderabad-takes-nationwide-tally-to-27' target='_blank'><strong>New polio case in Hyderabad takes nationwide tally to 27</strong></a><br><p>A new polio case has been confirmed in Sindh’s Hyderabad district, taking the nationwide tally to 27 this year and total cases in Sindh to seven, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on Monday.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to a statement from the NIH, “With this detection, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 27 – including 18 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, seven from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.”
NIH added that, “Polio Eradication conducted a Sub-National Polio Vaccination Campaign in September 2025 across 88 districts of the country including Hyderabad.”
The campaign immunised “approximately 21 million children under the age of five,” NIH said.
The next polio immunisation campaign will run from October 13 to 19 and aims to target 45.5m children.
“More than 400,000 dedicated frontline polio workers will go door-to-door to ensure that every child is reached,” NIH said.
The new case comes over a week after two fresh polio virus cases were detected in the south of KP. Out of the two, one of the cases was detected in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil in a 19-month-old infant, while the other case was confirmed in an 11-month-old infant in Lakki Marwat’s Suleman Khel tehsil.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-09-22 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22170037d14e15e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943856/pm-shehbaz-departs-for-new-york-to-attend-un-general-assembly-session' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz departs for New York to attend UN General Assembly session</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif departed from London on Monday for New York, where he will lead Pakistan’s delegation at a high-level segment of the United Nations General Assembly’s (UNGA) session.
At the UNGA session, PM Shehbaz “will urge the international community to resolve the situations of prolonged occupation and denial of the right to self-determination,” particularly in India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine, an earlier statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said.
“He will also highlight Pakistan’s perspective on the regional security situation, as well as other issues of international concern, including climate change, terrorism, Islamophobia, and sustainable development.”
The FO, in its statement, said PM Shehbaz would attend several “high-level events” on the sidelines of the UNGA session, including a moot of “select” Muslim leaders with US President Donald Trump.
Further, during his visit, he will meet several world leaders and senior UN officials to exchange views on issues of mutual interest.
“He will also underline Pakistan’s resolve to work with all UN member states to uphold the UN Charter, prevent conflict, foster peace and promote global prosperity in Pakistan’s current role as a member of the Security Council,” the FO added.
Today, Pakistan’s High Commissioner in the United Kingdom Dr Muhammad Faisal and other diplomatic staff saw the PM off at Luton Airport in the UK.
 






Earlier, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reached New York and would be accompanying PM Shehbaz at the UNGA  .
“On arrival, FM Dar was received by Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, Ambassador Rizwan Saeed Shiekh, Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States and senior officials of the Mission,” the FO said on X.
 






“The DPM/FM will have a busy programme in New York. Besides accompanying the PM to his many engagements, the DPM/FM will represent Pakistan in numerous ministerial and high-level meetings and also hold over a dozen bilateral meetings with his counterparts,” the statement added.
As nearly 150 world leaders gather to mark the UN’s 80th anniversary, the global peace forum finds itself surrounded by protests and engulfed in wars.
From its inception, the unresolved question of Palestine has haunted the UN, testing both its credibility and its capacity to deliver peace.
 
 

A high-level international conference for the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution” at the UNGA, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, aims to revive support for a two-state solution.
In a break with convention, the UNGA last week voted to allow Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to address the event by video link, after the US denied him and his delegation visas to attend the meeting.</p><small>2025-09-22 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22163507705c5ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943885/fact-check-viral-video-does-not-show-indian-army-chief-admitting-to-losing-4-rafale-jets-during-may-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video does not show Indian Army chief admitting to losing 4 Rafale jets during May conflict</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple pro-Pakistani accounts on social media platform X since September 18 shared a video, claiming that it allegedly showed the Indian Army chief admitting to the loss of four Rafale Jets during the May standoff between India and Pakistan. However, the video is doctored and does not show the Indian Army chief.
Pakistan and India fought in a four-day conflict earlier in May 2025. Indian fighter jets were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force’s late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur’s Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh.
Pakistan took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29, within a 40-minute span. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat.
On Sept 18, an X account, that appears to be anti-Indian based upon its previous posts, shared a video with the following caption: “Indian Army chief once again admits of losing four Rafale Jets due to miscalculating Pakistan military’s capability. Underestimating Pakistan was the biggest mistake of Indian politicians.”
The transcription of the video is provided below:
“On the 7th, we attacked nine terrorist targets between 1am and 1:30am. You know, there were operations in Balakot before this. We kept saying that we have killed them, they are successful, but there was no evidence, satellite imagery or photographs.
But now, what we were doing, why did we do it at 1:30 am? We thought that the Pakistani air force must be sleeping, and no one would know what we have attacked in Pakistan. But they all came to know. Our four Rafales fell, but we have learned a lot.
Now, we will remain alert even at night, that Pakistan is watching us all the time. The biggest thing is that this is learning.”
The post gained 59,600 views.
The same post was also reshared by multiple users on X, as can be seen here, here, here,  here, and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the military conflict between India and Pakistan.
Observing the video showed inconsistencies, such as the words not matching the lip-syncing, the tone of the speaker and the background noise after the 28-second mark.
The audio of the video was tested on forensic tool DeepFake-Total, which detected potential manipulation from the 27.5-second mark.
 


A keyword and reverse image search showed that the individual in the video was not Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi, the chief of army staff, but Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan, the highest-ranking individual in the Indian Army.
A reverse image search also yielded the original video of CDS Chauhan interacting with schoolchildren at Raj Bhavan in Ranchi on Sept 18, as posted by Indian news agency ANI News on X.
 






The transcription of the video’s first minute, corresponding with the viral video, is provided below:
“The first thing is, you must have read everything else, there has been a lot of discussion in the newspapers.  On the 7th, we attacked the nine terrorist targets between 1am and 1:30 am. You know, there were operations in Balakot before this.
We kept saying that the operations in Balakot were successful, but there was no evidence or satellite imagery or photographs. But now, what we were doing, why did we do it at 1:30 am? That is the darkest and most difficult. Taking satellite imagery, photographing it, collecting evidence.
Still, we did it at 1 or 1:30 am. Why was that?  There were two reasons.  First, we had confidence in our capabilities. That if we do it at night, we can take satellite imagery at night as well. And the second important thing was that we wanted to avoid civilian casualties.”
As can be seen in the transcription, he does not mention the downing of four Rafale jets by Pakistan, nor does he say any of the secondary claims made.
The doctored part begins at the 6-second mark of the viral clip and features a voiceover starting precisely at the 34th second until the 54th second of the original speech.
Alongside ANI, many other mainstream Indian media outlets reported the interaction of CDS Chauhan, but none mentioned any of the statements in the video circulating online, as can be seen in reports by The Times of India, The Hindu and India Today.
Pakistani news outlets also did not report the statements, which they would otherwise be expected to as happened when CDS Chauhan first admitted on May 31 to the downing of Indian jets without specifying the number.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows the Indian Army chief admitting to losing four Rafale Jets during the May 2025 conflict is false. The video is doctored and does not show the Indian Army chief but Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan.

India’s second win over Pakistan at the T20 tournament padded their head-to-head record in the format to 11-3 against the Green Team, with one match tied.
Pakistan still has a lead in the overall record against India across all three formats with 88 wins against India’s 79 victories.
Played against the backdrop of lingering tensions between the two nations in the wake of their military conflict in May, there were no handshakes between the players once again.
“According to me, if two teams play 15-20 matches and if it is 7-7 or 8-7, then that is called a rivalry,” Suryakumar told reporters.
“But 13-0, 10-1. I don’t know what the stats are. But this is not a rivalry anymore.”
Defending champions India dropped four catches during the match, and Suryakumar said they would address the issue ahead of their next Super Four fixture against Bangladesh on Wednesday in Dubai.
The Green Shirts will play their next match against Sri Lanka on Tuesday.
 
 

“The fielding coach has sent an email to the boys, who had butter fingers, to appear before him at his office,” the middle-order batter added.
“But this happens, it is a part of the game. I am okay with it because it happened in the first game itself, and we have more crucial games to go.”
The top two teams of the Super Four stage will move into the final on September 28.</p><small>2025-09-22 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/221510353a2acbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943893/china-says-combating-malicious-content-in-2-month-social-media-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>China says combating ‘malicious’ content in 2-month social media crackdown</strong></a><br><p>China’s top internet regulator announced on Monday a sweeping two-month crackdown on social media, vowing to combat content containing “malicious incitement of conflict” and “negative outlooks on life such as world-weariness”.
Beijing requires social media companies to moderate content on their platforms, with posts strictly controlled to avoid anything deemed to be too subversive, vulgar, pornographic or generally harmful.
The notice from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) follows announcements of penalties this month against three popular digital platforms, which it said had neglected content management duties.
On Saturday, the CAC said it would carry out “disciplinary and punitive measures” against micro-blogging platform Weibo and short video platform Kuaishou, accusing them of highlighting celebrity news and “undesirable” content.
The announcement followed similar action taken by the CAC on September 11 against the Instagram-like Xiaohongshu, known as Rednote in English.
 
 

Authorities have not specified what punitive actions are being taken against the three platforms.
The two-month campaign — whose start date was not specified in Monday’s statement — aims “to regulate the malicious incitement of conflict and the promotion of violence and vicious currents”, the CAC said.
The statement then listed specific online issues authorities hope to tackle in the crackdown.
They include “exploiting social hot spots to forcibly associate identity, region or gender with other information, stigmatising and hyping them”.
In practice, this could mean a clampdown on posts about discrimination. In July, local officials in eastern Zhejiang province warned comedians against stirring up gender discord through stand-up routines that joked about the battle of the sexes.
Other problems targeted by the campaign include disseminating “rumours” about the economy, finance, social welfare and public policy.
Weibo has previously warned against posting “pessimistic” views about the economy, social media users told AFP in late 2023.
 
 

Monday’s notice also mentioned “maliciously interpreting social phenomena, unilaterally exaggerating negative individual cases and exploiting them to promote negative outlooks on life such as world-weariness”.
That could be seen as a reference to “lying flat” or “letting it rot” culture  widespread phrases used by young Chinese to describe lifestyles that snub gruelling work culture in favour of taking it easy.
The crackdown aims to “foster a more civilised and rational online environment”, the statement said.</p><small>2025-09-22 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2214305994da0f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943888/pakistans-floods-leave-lasting-scars-on-its-children' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s floods leave lasting scars on its children</strong></a><br><p>Azan “has seen everything. He knows his parents are gone. He just doesn’t yet understand how to live without them.”
Shams ur Rehman is talking about his nine-year-old nephew Muhammad Azan, who has been staying with him and his family in Buner, a district in north-western Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Azan’s parents, as well as his three brothers, were killed when flash floods tore through the valley in the middle of August.
Also in Buner, 17-year-old Qadir Ahmed has to carry another burden. On 15 August, his family house collapsed in the floods. “The water carried away my mother… now, I must look after my [four] younger brothers and sisters.”
Not long ago, Ahmed passed his matriculation exams and aspired to go to college. Now, suddenly, he has to step in as the head of the family. “My education has stopped,” he says. “It is very difficult to take care of my siblings after losing our home and our mother.”
Pakistan has been experiencing unprecedented floods and landslides. The country’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reports that since late June, more than 1,000 people have been killed, with nearly 1,100 left injured due to monsoon-related disasters. Around half of all deaths have been in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where nearly 4,700 homes have been destroyed or damaged.
The floods have not spared other parts of the country. In Punjab, several major rivers faced large swells due to historic levels of rain in mid-August. Water discharges from across the Indian border have also contributed to villages and farmlands becoming submerged. More than two million people have been evacuated and outbreaks of skin- and water-borne diseases are expected. In the northern administrative territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, entire valleys have been cut off due to landslides, and more than 3,000 displaced people are staying in temporary camps. In Sindh, southern Pakistan, at least 150,000 people had been evacuated to safer areas as of 12 September.
Ahmed and Azan’s experiences are just two examples of how the floods in Pakistan are devastating the lives of children and causing trauma with long-lasting impacts.
Trauma without treatment
In Khalti village in Gilgit-Baltistan, Waseem Akram, a teacher, saw his private school shut down in mid-August when floods washed away houses and caused landslides that blocked roads. “Children are not going to school. They don’t have books, uniforms or shelter. Their behaviour has changed; they show anger, fear or silence,” he says, adding: “Many may drop out entirely.”
Muhammad Sohail, media coordinator for Rescue 1122, a government emergency service for disaster rescue, says that at present, Pakistan’s disaster response is focused only on physical rescue. “But mental health is just as important.”
He notes that systematic trauma care is practically unavailable. “Some officers are trained in Psychological First Aid, but there is no long-term counselling for children… This gap leaves scars that last for years.”
Fariha Sheikh is a social worker volunteering with the collection and distribution of food, period kits and other supplies in flood-hit villages on the outskirts of Sialkot and Narowal districts in Punjab, eastern Pakistan. She observes that children have been one of the most vulnerable groups. “Families are displaced, many of them living under open skies or in temporary shelters… kids from the villages have lost everything,” she says.

Some officers are trained in Psychological First Aid, but there is no long-term counselling for children… this gap leaves scars that last for years

“You can see the fear and uncertainty in their eyes… their normal life has just been snatched away,” she adds, noting that many are experiencing panic attacks.
Through her volunteer work, Sheikh has encountered children who have lost their parents. “It’s heartbreaking. Some kids don’t even fully realise what has happened, but they know their parents are not there anymore,” she says.
Added to these devastating upheavals are the physical dangers and changes they face. “Children are falling sick because of dirty water [from the floods] and a lack of food, and schools are either destroyed or being used as shelters,” Sheikh notes.
The trauma faced by children experiencing floods are exacerbated by the dangers they face from poverty, displacement and school closures. In Punjab alone, over 700,000 children have been affected by disruption to their education, with more than 2,900 schools forced to shut down due to the floods as of mid-September, according to The Nation.
Unicef warned in the aftermath of Pakistan’s 2022 floods that the longer schools remained closed, the higher the risk of impacted children dropping out, which then increases the likelihood of them being forced into child labour and marriage.
When policies fail children
Amid the tragedy is the question of Pakistan’s lack of preparedness for such extreme weather. According to Yasir Darya, founder of environmental consultancy Darya Lab and the Karachi-based Climate Action Center, institutional failures have caused disasters to become even deadlier.
He highlights how early warning mechanisms planned after the 2022 flood did not come to fruition, and blames poor governance.
“Communities remain cut off and unprotected,” he says. “It is a societal crisis as much as a climate one.”
These failures mean greater devastation from extreme weather and climate events, which will continue to severely impact children’s mental health.

We don’t just need rations; we need proper houses, schools, hospitals, libraries and recreational spaces so children can feel normal again

Earlier this year, researchers coined the term “Environmentally driven Adverse Childhood Experiences (E-ACEs)” to refer to severe stressors children may face when exposed to prolonged, recurring or intense extreme weather and climate events. These can cause toxic stress similar to that seen in children experiencing abuse or neglect.
The researchers caution that repeated experiences with floods, displacement and family separation may impair their brain development and increase their vulnerability to long-term health risks. They also refer to climate-related adverse childhood experiences as a humanitarian crisis of the 21st century that particularly impact children of low- and middle-income countries such as Pakistan, where more people are being displaced.
Despite the clear need to protect children from climate change impacts, they remain largely absent from climate policies.
Analysis published this year by the Early Childhood Development Action Network (ECDAN) found that of the 10 countries expected to have the largest populations by 2100, only six, including Pakistan, mention children or youth in their national climate policies. And even these largely fail to address the specific needs of young children. In the case of Pakistan, references to children in its policies only focused on child mortality rates without addressing broader early childhood development needs, including the sustained provision of nutrition, education and healthcare during climate shocks.
In northern Pakistan, families such as those of Azan and Qadir see few signs of such planning. Displaced communities receive food and tents lasting just days, while education is disrupted for months, they told Dialogue Earth.
Beyond survival
Akram, the teacher, stresses that aid should not be limited to emergency tents and food, but focused on rebuilding, as young flood survivors need stability in their lives. “We don’t just need rations; we need proper houses, schools, hospitals, libraries and recreational spaces so children can feel normal again,” he says. “Otherwise, these children will lose their futures.”
Sheikh, the social worker, echoes these concerns, saying: “[Children] need food, clean water, medicines, but also safe spaces and care. Their mental and emotional state matters as much as their physical survival. For a child, losing home and safety is too much to carry.”
As the water begins to recede in parts of Pakistan, families returning to their homes look to the significant task of rebuilding. For many impacted children, the trauma they have experienced is evident. Azan now clings tightly to his uncle during storms.
Unless there is rapid investment in adaptation and trauma care, as well as the inclusion of children in national climate adaptation policies, Pakistan is at risk of raising a generation characterised not by its potential, but by its losses.

Hours-long clashes took place between PTI workers and the Islamabad police on March 18, 2023, when former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the FJC to attend a hearing in the first Toshakhana case, in which he was later arrested in August that year and has been behind bars since then.
The same day, the Punjab police personnel had entered Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore, which had also been the venue of a chaotic stalemate between the cops and the PTI just days before.
ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over today’s hearing. Advocate Sardar Masroof Khan, Amna Ali and others appeared as the legal team for the PTI leaders, while Advocate Sardar Muhammad Razzaq was present as former Punjab chief minister Parvez Elahi’s counsel.
 
 

The judge issued a bailable arrest warrant for Qaiser, ordering that he be produced before the court.
The judge accepted the applications seeking exemption from appearance for Elahi, former finance minister Asad Umar and PTI’s Shibli Faraz, who was recently disqualified from his role as the Senate opposition leader.
Subsequently, the judge adjourned the proceedings till October 6.
The case, registered at the Counter-Terrorism Department police station under Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997, had also named Imran.
A letter had been written to the law ministry about the proceedings against the ex-premier and a response was awaited.
ATA case over Federal Judicial Complex violence
As of March 22, 2023, the Islamabad Police had arrested a total of 316 PTI supporters for allegedly attacking police officers and causing chaos outside the FJC.
 
 

The case had also invoked sections 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc), 395 (punishment for dacoity), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage to amount of one hundred rupees), 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The first information report (FIR) named 18 people involved in causing damage to the FJC, 22 others involved in causing damage in the FJC’s parking area and lighting up fires, and 19 others involved in allegedly injuring police officials. It also mentioned that stones, lighters and bottles filled with petrol were recovered from some of them.</p><small>2025-09-22 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/220059347f690f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943714/buscaro-raises-2m-to-tackle-tricky-mobility-sector' target='_blank'><strong>BusCaro raises $2m to tackle tricky mobility sector</strong></a><br><p>Venture capital is starting to trickle back into Pakistan. In the latest round, mobility startup BusCaro raised $2 million last week, bringing its total funding to $3.5m.
The round was led by UAE-based Daman Investments, with participation from US/Saudi Cartography Capital, New York’s Epic Angest, UK’s Wahed Ventures, the Aga Khan Development Network’s Accelerate Prosperity, and a mix of angel investors.
BusCaro, which offers shared commute services, was born in late 2022 — a time that could not have been less propitious for mobility startups. The world was emerging from the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war had triggered a global crisis, Pakistan was reeling from floods, and the local mobility sector was collapsing. Airlift and Swvl had folded, and Uber had exited Pakistan. What was once the hottest space had suddenly become a no-go zone.
That’s when Maha Shahzad, former general manager of Swvl, launched BusCaro — putting its first bus on the road just a day after Swvl shut down.
The journey since then has been anything but smooth. Ms Shahzad says she received over 400 rejections before securing the game-changing $160,000 in the first year of operations that set the fledgling startup on its current growth path. Today, BusCaro claims to process more than 900,000 monthly bookings and is on track to hit $8.6m in annual revenue by December. But scaling up has brought its own financial headaches.
The financing conundrum
“Equity financing is the least of my problems — and that’s true for most founders,” says Ms Shahzad. “Working capital is the main bottleneck.”
BusCaro operates an asset-light, tech-first model: it doesn’t own vehicles, operates out of co-working space Collabs, and has no land or collateral to borrow against. Its topline is too large to qualify as a small or medium enterprise, and even if it did, the Rs5m lending cap would be far too little. As a result, BusCaro is forced to turn towards venture for day-to-day financing.
“Startups raise equity to fuel high-octane growth. It’s ridiculous that we need to raise it for working capital,” Ms Shahzad says. Despite being fully incorporated, with a strong credit history, a portfolio of formal clients willing to provide guarantees, and credit lines from major fuel companies such as Total and Parco, BusCaro still struggles to raise financing against its invoices, underscoring the challenges faced by the tech-based private sector.
Getting the model right
So what is BusCaro doing differently, where others with deeper pockets failed?
The steep hike in petroleum prices, the economic downturn, and the drying up of global financing made it impossible to sustain business models like Airlift and Swvl’s, which prized growth over profitability by subsidising services. When the economic tides turned worldwide, venture capitalists were no longer handing out blank cheques for costly customer acquisition; instead, they required startups to prioritise early breakeven over just chasing revenue growth.
However, according to BusCaro, it secured positive unit economics from the outset — in simple terms, each ride cost less to provide than the revenue earned from fares. And while its fares are correlated to fuel prices, a shared commute remains cheaper than a solo ride.
Unlike its predecessors, BusCaro has not subsidised its per-seat fare. This balance was achieved by driving aggregation across two verticals: business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C).
On the B2B side, BusCaro partners with institutions. Sometimes, employers subsidise a percentage of the commute cost as an employee perk; in other cases, BusCaro provides the option of shared transport if enough employees aggregate demand.
For B2B2C, it works with facilitators like housing societies or co-working spaces to pool commuters at pick-up points. This approach slashes customer acquisition costs and creates positive unit economics. With 80 clients onboard, about 60pc of BusCaro’s business comes from B2B, and 40pc from B2B2C, including its parent-facing app.
That app has also opened up a niche market: school commutes. A couple of decades ago, school vans were everywhere; today, parents are left scrambling for reliable options. BusCaro’s app enables parents and schools to track rides in real-time, with manual check-in and check-out options for minors. It’s a problem, Ms Shahzad believes, that has significant potential — not just in Pakistan, but across the GCC, especially for working mothers.
Startup burn
Not that BusCaro is profitable. Currently, it burns about $15,000 a month, with a -2.8 per cent EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation] — almost entirely due to additional tech spend. With Ms Shahzad mentioning the 36pc interest rate BusCaro has faced, the debt financing alone would add up to a hefty expense, pushing the bottom line deeper into the red — a problem that eventually led its previous cohort to their exit.
But demand is outpacing supply. “My pipeline is 5x to 6x more than what I can fulfil right now,” Ms Shahzad claims. And the logic seems simple: shared commute outside of public transport will always be the cheapest way to move people. However, for the bottom line to come out of the red, the company will need a topline growth of 28pc.
From non-air-conditioned 80-seater buses to air-conditioned Corollas, BusCaro offers options across price points, with an average blended fare of Rs130 per ride — more economical than most alternatives. It currently operates in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and nearby cities.
Safety has also been a differentiator, BusCaro claims. With nearly 19m bookings since its inception, BusCaro claims zero reported harassment cases. The nature of shared rides, where 70pc of passengers are women and children, inherently lowers the risk, although the company also vets its drivers.
While speaking to Dawn, Ms Shahzad has a simple piece of advice for startups struggling to raise capital: don’t get caught up in FOMO. “A few years ago, everyone was rushing into fintech. Now it’s AI. Instead, solve the boring problems on the ground — and do it while staying unit positive.”</p><small>2025-09-22 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22130934b8c27df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943879/89-terrorists-arrested-over-3-months-across-punjab-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>89 terrorists arrested over 3 months across Punjab: CTD</strong></a><br><p>The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) has arrested 89 terrorists in 940 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) launched across Punjab over the past three months, the department said in a statement on Monday.
There has been a recent uptick in terror attacks in Pakistan over the past year. The CTD regularly carries out operations to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence.
During the three months, 14 terrorists were arrested in Lahore, 14 in Rawalpindi, seven each in Faisalabad and Bahawalpur, six each in Jhang and Sargodha, five in Sahiwal, four from Gujranwala and three each from Bahawalnagar and Gujrat, the statement read.
“Of the arrested terrorists, 55 belong to Fitna al Khawarij, five are from ISIS (Islamic State), and two each are from Al-Qaeda, Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Jeay Sindh,” the statement added.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khawarij to refer to terrorists of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to the CTD, items seized during the raids include 20.2 kilogrammes of explosive material, 85 detonators, 183 feet of safety fuse wire, 717 pamphlets belonging to a banned organisation, magazines, detonating cord, mobile phones and cash.
The CTD added that 87 criminal cases have been registered against the arrested suspects, and investigations are underway.
“The arrested individuals had been planning attacks on important buildings in several cities,” the statement read. “CTD Punjab remains vigilant and committed to the ‘Safe Punjab’ objective. We will spare no effort to bring terrorists and anti-state elements to justice.
“In related security activity during the current week, local police and security agencies carried out 13,521 combing operations, checked 552,692 people, arrested 1,131 suspicious persons, registered 1,061 FIRs (first information reports) and achieved 906 recoveries.
Earlier this week, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CTD neutralised three terrorists, including an Afghan national, during an IBO carried out in Khyber district.
Two of the three militants killed during the IBO were involved in a suicide bombing in Peshawar, which led to the deaths of a sub-inspector and a constable.
A statement issued by the CTD said that the department conducted the operation based on the reported presence of Fazal Noor, a commander of the banned militant group Islamic State Khorasan Province and his group members in the Ali Masjid area of the district.</p><small>2025-09-22 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68d0789cdabe4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943780/pakistan-to-begin-rabi-with-record-levels-of-stored-water' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to begin Rabi with record levels of stored water</strong></a><br><p>• Reservoirs hold more than 13.1MAF water, 99pc of peak capacity
• Tarbela reaches full conservation level of 1,550 feet; Mangla nearly filled to brim
• Chashma Barrage also attains record storage level of 649 feet; officials expect minimal water shortage in Rabi season; wheat to benefit most
ISLAMABAD: After many years, Pakistan will begin the upcoming Rabi season with healthy carryover water storage of more than 13 million acre feet (MAF) in reservoirs, which may partially offset agriculture output losses caused by floods in the outgoing Kharif season.
“We expect water situation in Rabi season to be normal after many years”, said an official, adding that any shortage “will be minimal, bearable and manageable”. He noted that, after many years, we are also hopeful of having a reasonable carryover into the next Kharif season.
While Tarbela Dam reached its peak conservation level of 1,550 feet last month and has remained there, Mangla Dam is struggling at 1,239.6 feet as of Sunday night against its maximum conservation level of 1,242 feet, as river Jhelum flows remained low throughout the Kharif season.
As a result, Mangla’s storage was reported at 7.1MAF on Sunday night, compared to its maximum storage capacity of 7.277MAF. Officials, however, were not very hopeful about filling Mangla Dam to its capacity, as conservation was building very slowly with only 18,800 cusecs of inflow. Almost half of this (around 9,000 cusecs) was being released to Upper Jhelum Canal for drinking water needs. Mangla would require another 100,000 cusecs to attain maximum conservation, which appeared unlikely in the remaining nine days of the season.
Mangla storage had peaked at 1,233.25 feet at the end of Kharif 2023 and 1,224 feet in 2024. This meant that the country’s largest reservoir could not go beyond 5.9MAF last year, while it has already crossed 7.1MAF this year.
On the other hand, Tarbela Dam peaked to 1,548 feet in 2023 and 1,549 feet in 2024, compared to 1,550 feet this year. Chasma Barrage also attained its peak storage capacity of 649 feet this year, compared to 645 feet in 2023 and 646 feet last year.
As such, total storage has already crossed 13.1MAF, almost 99pc of the peak capacity of 13.3MAF. Last year, the storage had touched 11.388MAF. At present, all rivers are flowing at normal levels, except for medium floods at Kotri Barrage and Ganda Singhwala in the Sutlej River.
Given the reasonable quantities of water still in the irrigation system after the floods, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) has not yet scheduled meetings of its technical and advisory committees, as the provinces have not sought fresh allocations for water discharges.
 
 

Normally, both committees meet in the last week of September when provinces place indents for the first 10 days of Rabi.
Officials, however, cautioned that heavy sand deposits have been reported across farmlands due to the prolonged standing floodwaters in Punjab’s plains — unlike the usual fertile deposits that accompany floods. They said it was too early to predict the condition of agricultural lands until these areas are cleared of standing water.
Meetings of Irsa’s technical and advisory committees will be called once the floodwaters recede. An official said Sindh province usually places indents for Rabi crops, but this has not been the case this year, as it is still dealing with the flood situation.
Around 24MAF of water has already flowed into the sea since the beginning of the Kharif season on April 1 — almost double the combined storage capacity of the two major reservoirs — Tarbela and Mangla.
The total water requirement for Rabi crops, under the Water Apportionment Accord of 1991, is about 37-38MAF with the carryover from Kharif, water availability is expected to be close to 35-36MAF, along with river flows over the next six months.  The 1991 Water Accord empowers Irsa to determine water availability in the country and allocate the provinces’ share twice a year — for Kharif and Rabi seasons. Rabi season runs from Oct 1 to March 31, with wheat being largest crop. Other Rabi crops include gram, lentil, tobacco, rapeseed, barley and mustard.

Starmer’s “global talent task force” is working on ideas to attract the world’s best scientists, academics and digital experts to the UK in a bid to drive economic growth, the report said, citing people briefed on the discussions inside Number 10 and the Treasury.
The idea of cutting visa costs to zero is for people who have attended the world’s top five universities or have won prestigious prizes, an official told the newspaper.
According to the report, the reforms were being discussed in Number 10 and the Treasury before the Trump administration announced its decision to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas, which are widely used by US tech companies, from Sunday.
 
 

The US decision, however, has put “wind in the sails” to those pushing for changes to Britain’s high-end visa system, aiming to spur growth ahead of the November 26 Budget, a person involved in the UK discussions told FT.
Britain’s global talent visa application costs 766 pounds ($1,030), with partners and children paying the same fee.

Residents and Rescue 1122 officials said the incident occurred on the main Khar-Nawagai Road in the Khazana area within the jurisdiction of Lowi Sam police station.
They told Dawn that Mir Azam Khan, 45, was heading to his home in Khazana Dag area when unknown assailants opened fire on him, leaving him critically injured.
Amjad Khan, district emergency officer of Rescue 1122, said the injured was shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Khar, where the doctors pronounced him dead upon arrival at the hospital’s emergency.
No one claimed responsibility for the incident.
Soon after the murder, several ANP leaders and workers also took to the social media to condemn the killing.
ANP local chapter president Gul Afzal Khan, deputy general secretary Sadiq Akbar Jan, provincial joint secretary Shah Naseer Khan, Sheikh Jan Zada, and party’s local MPA Mohammad Nisar Khan condemned the killing of Azam Khan, who was additional general secretary of ANP Khar tehsil.
The ANP leaders demanded the early arrest of those responsible for the incident.
Meanwhile, ANP provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain and general secretary Hussain Shah Yousafzai also condemned the killing and called his murder failure of the government to ensure safety and security of people.
In a post shared on ANP’s official Facebook page on Sunday evening, both the leaders expressed concerns and sorrow over the murder of Mr Khan.
They noted that the incident occurred near a police post.
They mentioned that earlier, Maulana Khan Zeb was also killed by unknown assailants in Bajaur, but the killers still remained at large, showing the government’s failure to maintain peace in the region.
“We urge the government to immediately arrest those involved in both the killings.“

At least 88 minors were among the initial count of 216 taken into custody on Sunday as police deployed water cannons and deafening sirens against crowds of mostly young, rock-throwing protesters.
Manila City Mayor Isko Morena said a 12-year-old boy was the youngest detained.
Thousands of Filipinos rallied in Manila on Sunday to vent their anger over a ballooning scandal involving bogus flood-control projects believed to have cost taxpayers billions of dollars.
 


The scandal has seen numerous lawmakers implicated and the leaders of both houses of Congress step down from their positions during an investigation.
But Sunday’s street battles, which saw multiple police vehicles set ablaze and the windows of a precinct headquarters shattered, threatened to overshadow demonstrations that had been filled with families, activists, clergy and politicians.
“So far, none of them are saying the reasons behind their actions or if somebody paid them to do it,“ regional police spokesperson Major Hazel Asilo told AFP.
“As soon as we know their affiliations, we can know if they were part of the protesters or if they were just causing trouble,” she added.
According to a statement released on Monday by the Department of Health, about 50 people were brought to a single Manila hospital following the clashes.
Another police spokesperson, Major Philipp Ines, said 93 officers had been injured on Sunday, while adding the number of arrested could yet rise as people were still being processed.
Rage over the so-called ghost infrastructure projects has been mounting in the Southeast Asian country since President Ferdinand Marcos put them centre stage in a July state of the nation address that followed weeks of deadly flooding.
 
 

The Department of Finance has estimated that the Philippine economy lost up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2bn) from 2023 to 2025 due to corruption in flood control projects.
Greenpeace has suggested the number is actually closer to $18bn.
The Philippines on Monday was expecting heavy flooding once more as Super Typhoon Ragasa bore down on the country’s northernmost provinces.

• Responsibility for Pakistan, Afghanistan shifted to WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region
• Report terms Pakistan’s claims of progress from 2021-23 ‘likely by-product of Covid prevention measures’
ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan reports 26 new polio cases this year, the global polio monitoring board has issued a stark warning that efforts to eradicate the disease are failing.
After 37 years and $22 billion invested, the world has reached an “inflection point” where, traditional methods offer diminishing returns, the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) on polio said in its latest report.
The ‘glass mountain’ of polio eradication has proven unclimbable through conventional methods, it says, calling for fresh thinking and unambiguous country ownership to achieve success.
In a letter to World Health Organisation Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, IMB Chair­man Sir Liam Donaldson said the report, titled ‘The Glass Mountain’ arrives at a critical juncture.
“The confluence of persistent viral transmission, unprecedented geopolitical disruption, and severe financial constraints has created conditions that fundamentally challenge the programme’s survival and success,” Mr Donaldson wrote.
He noted that early optimism in 2023 has been replaced by the “stark reality of resurgence,” as historical reservoirs of the virus — a reference to Pakistan and Afghanistan — have been reinfected.
The IMB, which works on behalf of international donor agencies, said that fresh thinking, institutional courage, strategic realism, and unambiguous country ownership were the only paths to success.
The board identified several “systemic intractable weaknesses” hobbling the programme, including “performance-blind funding mechanisms that provide resources regardless of outcomes; fragmented integration approaches that fail to leverage synergies with essential immunisation; lack of country ownership and transactional behaviour; and accountability systems that generate reports rather than consequences.”
To address these deep-rooted issues, a fundamental shift in strategy and accountability is proposed.
 
 

The IMB has suggested moving responsibility for stopping wild poliovirus in Pakistan and Afghanistan to the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional (EMRO) Ministerial Polio Subcommittee.
This, Mr Donaldson argued, could combat the persistent “perception that polio eradication is something ‘the West wants’ rather than a regional priority,” potentially reducing community hostility, boycotts, and security threats that have resulted in the deaths of polio workers and police officers, especially in Pakistan.
This proposal has now been formalised, as the polio oversight board adopted the 2026 GPEI Action Plan on Sunday.
In a post on X, Hanan Balkhy, the regional director for WHO-EMRO said the coming low transmission season offers the best chance to stop wild poliovirus in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Mr Donaldson’s letter also pointed to a dramatically altered geopolitical landscape, citing major disruptions to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
“The United States withdrawal from WHO, the dismantling of USAID, and the severe curtailment of CDC’s global health mandate represent the most significant disruption in GPEI history,” Sir Donaldson stated.
It also noted that since the report was finalised, there had been two serious monsoon-related floods in  different parts of Pakistan, an earthquake in Afghanistan, a child malnutrition crisis in  Borneo and a potential peace settlement in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, which have changed the operating landscape for polio.
Pakistan’s claims challenged
The report also challenges Pakistan’s recent claims of progress. While Islamabad asserts it had interrupted polio transmission from 2021 to 2023, the IMB said this was likely an inadvertent result of Covid restrictions, that were “hostile to poliovirus spread”, rather than an outcome of programmatic improvements.
The operating environment for polio is constantly shifting. After the IMB meeting and as  the report was being finalised, there were: two serious monsoon-related floods in  different parts of Pakistan, an earthquake in Afghanistan, a child malnutrition crisis in  Borno and a potential peace settlement in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
A Pakistani polio expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, agreed with the IMB’s assessment, highlighting an absence of accountability, innovation, and integration.
“Interestingly, as usual, government’s ownership despite PM’s intense engagement has been questioned,” the expert said. “This IMB report questions the money and time spent against the targets and in midst of virus circulation and resurfacing has questions the viability of the program.”
As a solution, the expert suggested “shifting the management and ownership in real sense to the government, restructuring the program, integrating with EPI and holding the chronic poor performers to account at the high level can address the issues”.

•  Says any project in Karachi should be executed through local agencies
KARACHI: The municipal leadership of Karachi has challenged the authority of the federal government by questioning the role of its Pakistan Infrastructure Development Company Ltd (PIDCL) in the urban development projects, insisting that all such initiatives in Karachi should fall under the city’s municipal jurisdiction.
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), backed by the PPP-led Sindh government, has halted the federally funded Rs6 billion project of the Green Line Bus extension, citing the PIDCL’s failure to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from municipal authorities before restarting the work.
After the abolition of the Pakistan Works Department, the federal government assigns uplift works to the PIDCL, established under the Companies Act, 2017, in different parts of the country.
The work on the Green Line extension was restarted more than nine years after its ground-breaking around two weeks ago.
However, the construction between the Numaish intersection and the Municipal Park near Jama Cloth Market was stopped by Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab last week, citing “procedural violations”.
KMC officials said that an NOC was not issued “in perpetuity”, and the PIDCL was required to secure a fresh approval for the work on the BRT extension phase.
In a statement, the mayor also presented a demand of rehabilitation of infrastructure, which was damaged during the construction work of the first phase of the project completed more than three years ago.
He said due to the negligence and mismanagement of “other institutions”, citizens of Karachi and the KMC continued to bear the brunt of criticism and inconvenience.
However, the situation is far more complex. In a conversation with Dawn, Karachi Mayor Wahab spoke openly, expressing his desire to completely exclude the PIDCL from the city’s infrastructure development works.
“Yes, absolutely,” he responded without hesitation when asked if he wished to “minus” the PIDCL from Karachi’s development projects.
“Any project in Karachi — regardless of whether it’s funded by the federal government — should be executed through local agencies,” Mayor Wahab asserted.
“If a project pertains to a town, then the respective of town administration should handle it. If it concerns the city as a whole, we [KMC] will take responsibility. We are the ones answerable to the people — they come to us with questions. Most of them don’t even know who the head of PIDCL is.”
The mayor said he had the full backing of the Sindh government in perusing this policy.
He added that he had even raised concerns over the slow progress of the Red Line BRT project, which is being executed by the provincial administration.
“But there’s a difference,” he explained. “I’m part of the advisory body overseeing the execution of the Red Line BRT. I raise questions in meetings, I demand explanations, and I get a clear picture of what’s happening. But when it comes to the PIDCL-led Green Line project, I’m completely in the dark — yet I’m still held accountable and face public criticism.”
As the city administration sticks firm to its demands, the federal government appears to be little impressed over the objections raised by the mayor on the extension of the Green Line BRT project. It has not formally responded to the KMC’s concerns despite passage of several days after suspension of the work.
A source privy to the situation said that the PIDCL officials made an immediate contact with the mayor when the work was stopped.
It was decided between the two sides that they would sit together on Friday last to sort out issues.
“But since then no meeting has been held,” said the sources. “The federal authorities now believe that the matter lies between the Karachi mayor and the contractor. As for the NOC, the PIDCL is already in possession of one issued by the KMC in October 2017, rendering the current argument over the NOC irrelevant,” they added.

LAHORE: The Sutlej River continued to maintain a med­ium-level flood at Ganda Singh Wala and Sulemanki headworks on Sunday, with authorities monitoring its steady rise as waters inundated areas across Lodhran, Multan and Bahawalpur districts.
According to a Provincial Disaster Management Auth­ority (PDMA) report, the river flowed at 95,000 cusecs at Ganda Singh Wala and 82,000 cusecs at Sulemanki, with the latter volume expected to reach Jalalpur Pirwala within the next day or two, potentially raising water levels further in already affected regions.
Meanwhile, flood levels in the Chenab and Ravi rivers were reported as normal, with key readings showing 43,000 cusecs at Marala, 38,000 cusecs at Khanki Headworks, and 37,000 cusecs at Qadirabad on the Chenab, while the Ravi recorded flows of 7,000 cusecs at Jassar, 9,000 cusecs at Shahdara, and 28,000 cusecs at Head Sidhnai.
The Sutlej River water has been continuously rising since Sunday morning and inundating the flood-affected areas in Lodhran, Multan and Bahawalpur.
The water is passing from three to four breaches on the Noraja Bhutta embankment and rising around the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5) from Jhangra in the Bahawalpur district to Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil in the Multan district.
As the water level started receding in the Chenab River, the people from the western side of Jalalpur Pirwala had started returning to their villages.
In Alipur tehsil of Muzaffargarh district, the government was making efforts to fill the breaches on dykes and roads damaged by floods. A temporary bridge was constructed at Seetpur Road and opened for the public in Alipur. Repair work was also started to fill dykes in Kul Kanwal, Khairpur Saadat, basti Azeem Shah and Sultanpur-Khairpur Road.
 
 

The M5 motorway remained closed for a ninth consecutive day due to flood damage at six locations, with motorway police implementing diversions at Shah Shams and Uch Sharif interchanges.
Motorway police spokesperson confirmed that the M5 in Multan would remain closed for now due to flood-related damage.
He said that floodwaters have affected the motorway at six different locations and authorities were actively working to prevent further damage by filling cracks with stones.
National Highways and Motorway Police said traffic from Multan to Sukkur was being diverted from Shah Shams Interchange to G.T. Road, with re-entry at Uch Sharif, while vehicles from Sukkur to Multan were diverted from Uch Sharif to G.T. Road and allowed to rejoin at Sher Shah Interchange.
NHA General Manager Kashif Nawaz told Dawn that four of six lanes had been damaged at some points but denied reports of a complete washout. “Some interchanges are still underwater and traffic cannot be allowed until safety is ensured,” he added.
Multan Commissioner Amir Karim Khan inspected the old flood embankments of Jalalpur Pirwala and the affected motorway section, declaring the old embankments safe. At Noraja Bhutta, he identified four breaches and directed the Irrigation Department to expedite repairs to prevent ponding along the motorway.
The commissioner also visited relief camps, met affected families and instructed departments to improve facilities. He confirmed that floods had disrupted repair work on a damaged Sui gas pipeline.
The Multan district administration said emergency repairs of flood-hit roads and electricity infrastructure had begun.
Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said heavy machinery and special teams had been deployed to assess damages, restore link roads and drain water. A door-to-door survey would soon begin in affected areas, while medical teams were conducting disinfection and health interventions.
Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Hussain Pirzada said the government was taking all measures to protect Jalalpur Pirwala, with technical committees monitoring embankments.
Punjab Agriculture Sec­retary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo visited relief camps to review arrangements for livestock feed and urged owners to move cattle to dry areas, provide clean water and seek veterinary care.
Over 3m rescued
The National Disaster Mana­ge­ment Authority (NDMA) said on Sunday that more than 3.02 million people have been rescued in nearly 5,800 operations since June 26.
According to the latest figures, 3,020,130 individuals have been evacuated in 5,768 rescue operations carried out with the coordinated efforts of the NDMA, provincial authorities, the Pakistan Army and other agencies.
Punjab accounted for the largest share with 2.81m rescues in 4,749 operations, followed by Sindh with 184,011 in 753 operations. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 14,317 rescues, Gilgit-Baltistan 1,027, Azad Jammu and Kashmir 940, Islamabad 49, and Balochistan 19.
The NDMA said that at least 1,006 people lost their lives due to torrential rains and flash flooding, including 275 children, 568 men and 163 women.
KP recorded the highest number of fatalities with 504 deaths, while Punjab reported 304, Sindh 80, Balochistan 30, Gilgit-Baltistan 41, AJK 38 and Islamabad nine.
Another 1,063 people have been injured nationwide, among them 321 children, 450 men and 292 women. Punjab again bore the heaviest toll with 661 injured, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 218 and Sindh with 87.
The NDMA said 273,524 relief items have been distributed so far, including tents, blankets, ration bags, food packs, hygiene kits and safe drinking water. Additional supplies such as solar panels, de-watering pumps and generators have also been provided.
Since June 26, authorities have established 1,690 relief and medical camps in flood-hit areas. Of these, 741 medical camps have treated 662,098 patients, while 949 relief camps have provided shelter and services to 152,252 people.
The floods have destroyed or damaged 12,569 homes, killed 6,509 livestock and left communities struggling with displacement and shortages of essential resources.
Infrastructure losses include 239 bridges and nearly 2,000 kilometres of roads. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa suffered the worst damage with 52 bridges and 437km of roads lost, followed by AJK with 94 bridges and 201km of roads damaged.
Gilgit-Baltistan repor­ted damage to 87 bridges, Balochistan three, and Islamabad three. Sindh recorded no bridge damage but reported losses to seven kilometres of roads. The Islamabad Capital Territory also experienced damage to three bridges.

Twelve people have died in the past 24 hours while 740 new patients have been hospitalised with the mosquito-borne disease, the directorate general of health services said on Sunday. 
Dengue has killed at least 179 people and infected nearly 42,000 nationwide so far this year.
Children are increasingly crowding into hospital wards, many arriving with high fever, rashes, and dehydration. Some develop severe complications.

Changing weather patterns are worsening the outbreak, entomologists say

Entomologists say changing weather patterns are worsening the outbreak. The monsoon is stretching longer than usual, creating standing water almost everywhere, said Kabirul Bashar, a zoology professor at Jahangirnagar University. “This prolonged wet season is giving mosquitoes more time and space to breed, and it is intensifying the outbreak.”
Bangladesh’s rapid urbanisation, poor waste management, and stagnant water at construction sites have further expanded mosquito breeding grounds.
With hospitals under strain and infections climbing steadily, doctors fear the crisis will deepen in the coming weeks.
Children are more vulnerable to rapid fluid loss and shock, which makes severe dengue extremely dangerous for them, said physician ABM Abdullah, urging parents not to ignore early symptoms like a persistent fever or bleeding gums.
The worst year on record for Bangladesh was 2023, when dengue killed 1,705 people and infected more than 321,000. 
Experts fear that without stro­nger preventive measures such dea­dly cycles will continue.
