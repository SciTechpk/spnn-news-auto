The appeal was filed on Saturday, two days before the Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s (JCP) meeting to appoint chief justices to at least three high courts on July 1.
In its judgement anno­unced on June 19, the Supreme Court’s Const­itutional Bench, had held by a majority of 3-2 that the transfer of three judges to IHC from Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan high cou­rts was within the framework of the Constitution.
The Constitutional
Ben­ch had also partially sent the matter to the president to determine seniority amongst judges, based on their service records.
Now, IHC’s justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz, who originally challenged the transfers, have filed an intra-court appeal (ICA) against the June 19 judgement.
The ICA, jointly moved by senior counsel Muneer A. Malik and Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, urged the court to set aside the order in the interest of justice.
While the appeal is heard, the Supreme Court should grant an interim relief against the judgment, the applicants pleaded.
The five judges have requested the Supreme Court not to consider justices Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Muhammad Asif as judges of IHC until they take fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194 Justice Dogar is also the acting chief justice of IHC.
The appeal contended that Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act 2010 only provides for the appointment of judges to the IHC from other provinces but makes no reference to transfers.
 
 

The appeal contended that the June 19 order impermissibly reads in “permanent” in Article 200(1) and (2) of the Constitution when no such language was contained in the provision.
The appeal pleaded that the constitutional bench had misunderstood the provisions of Article 200 by reading sub-article (1) in isolation from other provisions of the article by not holding that transfers envisioned in Article 200(1) were only for a temporary and time-specified period.
The order also failed to interpret of articles 200 and 175A, without scuttling and undermining the powers of JCP under Article 175A of the Constitution, the appeal argued adding the independence of judiciary does not allow bestowing onto the executive a much more expansive power than what the text of Article 200 and the foundational principles of constitutional law can bear.
The concept of federalism also mandates that the provincial authority’s role in the permanent filling of vacancies of judges must not be usurped, it added.
The June 19 judgment had partially remanded the matter to the president to determine the seniority after examining the service record of the transferred judges as soon as possible, including the question of whether these transfers were permanent or temporary.
The powers of the president under Article 200(1) are two distinct provisions dealing with different situations and niceties and neither do they overlap nor override each other, the verdict explained, adding the transfer by the president by means of Article 200 cannot be construed as a fresh appointment, the judgment had held adding the powers of transfer conferred to the president by the framers of the Constitution cannot be questioned on the ground that if the posts were vacant in IHC then why they were not filled up by JCP through fresh appointments.

• Accuse ‘establishment-backed elements’ of taking advantage of situation
• Vow to hold joint press conference to dispel impression of rift
ISLAMABAD: The recent dec­ision of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on the reserved seats has dealt a serious blow to the opposition Pak­istan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), which is already emb­roiled in numerous challenges, including internal disunity.
Background briefings revealed a complete lack of trust among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other’s sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding Imran Khan’s messages.
Despite having doubts about loyalties, the party leaders, however, were found united in their support for Imran Khan’s leadership, hoping that the issues would be resolved once Mr Khan was freed from jail.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, considered a close confidant of Mr Khan, had initially declared that he would not get the budget passed from the provincial assembly without consulting Imran Khan.
However, the swift and somewhat hasty passage of the KP budget without his meeting with Mr Khan further exposed fissures within the party ranks, as evident from statements of various PTI leaders and members, who questioned each other’s loyalty to the incarcerated party boss.
 
 

The statement by Aleema Khan, Imran Khan’s sister, about a “minus-Imran” formula sparked a heated debate within political and journalistic circles, as well as within the PTI, with some party leaders questioning the decision-making process.
Many senior party members believed that the party was facing a crisis-like situation due to a “communication gap” and the leadership’s failure to hold regular meetings with the jailed leader.
Another senior leader suggested that Aleema Khan’s statement was emotional and provided an opportunity for Maryam Nawaz to criticise the party.
Communication gap
According to prominent PTI leader Asad Qaiser, all the issues were due to a communication gap as the political leadership had no contact with Imran Khan.
“We remain unaware if the party’s patron-in-chief has really said it or not,” said Mr Qaiser, who served as the National Assembly speaker under the PTI government.
Mr Qaiser said that presently, only lawyers had been meeting with Mr Khan, and each of them had their own interpretation. He also mentioned the sisters of Mr Khan, claiming that they simply conveyed the message as they  heard. “I have no doubt but every person can understand the message as per his/her understanding,” he said.
During his conversation with Dawn, Mr Qaiser, without naming anyone, stated that some of the “friends of the PTI” were also responsible for the impression regarding rift within the party.
The former speaker said that they had decided that all the party leaders would hold a joint press conference in which they would give a clear message that “there is no rift within the party”.
Another senior leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, also endorsed Mr Qaiser’s view, stating that the major issue was that the leadership was not being allowed to meet Mr Khan.
“The lack of communication has been triggering the confusion. Moreover, there can be differences of opinion within political parties and no one can stop it,” the PTI leader said.
He also dubbed the reports about internal rifts in the party as part of “a disinformation campaign”.
“We have conducted an inquiry and reached a conclusion that there are five persons who have been running at least 25 social media accounts which are being used to create a negative impression about the PTI,” he claimed.
He admitted that there was frustration among the leaders and workers due to the “ongoing state oppression” and crackdown on the party for the last three years as well as the possible convictions of some party members and activists in the May 9 and Nov 26 cases.
‘Establishment-backed elements’
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said some of the “establishment-backed elements” were taking advantage of the situation caused by miscommunication within the party.
“There are some paid people who have been criticising the party. However, we have decided to address the communication gap,” said Mr Akram.
“We have decided to hold physical meetings, instead of Zoom [virtual]meetings, to avoid chances of wrong interpretations,” he said.
Mr Akram termed the consensus over the leadership of Mr Khan a “positive sign”, stating that everyone in the party knew that “they cannot survive without the founding chairman”.
He emphasised that the party was united behind Mr Khan’s leadership and acknowledged that rifts within parties were normal.
“Rifts within parties are quite normal, as I have heard old PPP and new PPP, Zardari group and Bilawal group, Hamza group and Maryam group, and the rift between Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif,” he said in an effort to downplay the situation being faced by his party.
Fawad Chaudhry, former information minister in the PTI government, attributes the issues to the party’s lack of experienced leadership.
“Those taking decisions have limited experience, and the grouping in KP started in 2011,” he said, suggesting the formation of a committee to meet opposition parties and launch a movement to secure Mr Khan’s release.

He said this during a meeting with the airline’s chief executive, Air Vice Marshal Amir Hayat, who requested fresh diplomatic support to remove the long-running flight ban.
Mr Hayat appreciated the foreign minister’s continued support in helping to remove the ban on PIA flights to various countries.
He noted that compliance work begun under the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition government of 2022-23 enabled both PIA and the Civil Aviation Aut­hority (CAA) to satisfy Inte­rnational Civil Avia­tion Organisation aud­itors, paving the way for the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to lift its own suspension in November 2024.
Flights to the UK and Europe were halted in June 2020 after then aviation minister told parliament that roughly one-third of the country’s com­m­ercial pilots held “dubious” licences — a statement made in the aftermath of the May 22, 2020, crash of Flight PK8303 in Karachi, which claimed 97 lives.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority suspended PIA’s operating permit on June 30 that year, mirroring EASA’s action a day earlier.
 
 
;

Regulators cited systemic failures in licensing oversight and airline safety management. The grounding deprived PIA of one of its most lucrative long-haul markets and cost nearly 40 billion a year in lost revenue, according to government records presented in parliament.
After three years of remedial work — ranging from re-validation of pilot credentials to overhauling safety protocols — EASA reinstated PIA’s Third-Country Operator authorisation on Nov 29, 2024.
Earlier this year, the carrier resumed flights to Paris and plans to add further European destinations this summer.
Power sector meeting
In a separate development, Mr Dar reaffirmed the government’s commitment to making balanced decisions that uphold financial discipline without imposing an undue burden on the public.
Mr Dar chaired a high-level meeting to review matters related to the power sector. The meeting was attended by the ministers for power and petroleum, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, and senior officials, according to a press release issued by the Deputy Prime Minister’s Office.
Discussions centred on key aspects of the power sector, with a focus on ensuring financial sustainability and consumer protection.

• Nine children among 37 killed in military strikes across Gaza Strip
DOHA: Gaza mediators are engaging with Israel and Hamas to build on momentum from this week’s ceasefire with Iran and work towards a truce in the Palestinian territory, Qatar foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said.
Israel and Iran on Tuesday agreed to a ceasefire brokered by the United States and Qatar just hours after the Islamic republic launched a salvo of missiles towards the wealthy Gulf state, targeting the American military base hosted there.
The unprecedented attack on Qatari soil followed Washington’s intervention into a days-long war between Israel and Iran which saw US warplanes strike Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting promises of retaliation from Tehran.
In an interview with AFP on Friday, Ansari said Doha — with fellow Gaza mediators in Washington and Cairo — was now “trying to use the momentum that was created by the ceasefire between Iran and Israel to restart the talks over Gaza”.
“If we don’t utilise this window of opportunity and this momentum, it’s an opportunity lost amongst many in the near past. We don’t want to see that again,” the spokesman, who is also an adviser to Qatar’s prime minister, said.
US President Donald Trump voiced optimism on Friday about a new ceasefire in Gaza saying an agreement involving Israel and Hamas could come as early as next week.
Mediators have been engaged in months of back-and-forth negotiations with the warring parties aimed at ending 20 months of war in Gaza, with Ansari explaining there were no current talks between the sides but that Qatar was “heavily involved in talking to every side separately”.
‘The right pressure’
A two-month truce, which was agreed as Trump came into office in January, collapsed in March with Israel intensifying military operations in Gaza afterwards.
“We have seen US pressure and what it can accomplish,” Ansari said referring to the January truce which saw dozens of prisoners held by Hamas released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
The Qatari official said particularly in the context of US enforcement of the Israel-Iran truce, it was “not a far-fetched idea” that pressure from Washington would achieve a fresh truce in Gaza.
Another 37 Palestinians killed
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed 37 people in the devastated territory on Saturday, including at least nine children who died in strikes.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP 35 people were killed in seven Israeli drone and air strikes in various locations, and two others by Israeli fire while waiting for food aid in the Netzarim zone in central Gaza.
He said the dead included three children who were killed in an air strike on a home in Jabalia, in northern Gaza.
Bassal said at least six more children died in a neighbourhood in the northeast of Gaza City, including some in an air strike near a school where displaced people were sheltering.
AFP images showed mourners weeping over the bodies of seven people, including at least two children, wrapped in white shrouds and blankets at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.
Video footage filmed from southern Israel showed smoke rising over northern Gaza after blasts. Other AFP footage filmed in Gaza City showed a cloud of smoke rising from buildings after a strike.

• ISPR blames India, ‘Fitna al Khwarij’ for attack
• 14 militants killed during military operation
NORTH WAZIRISTAN / PESHAWAR: Thirteen security personnel were martyred and 16 others injured while 14 militants were killed in two separate attacks in North Waziristan district on Saturday.
The deadliest attack occurred in the Khadi Khel area of Mir Ali tehsil around 7:15am, when an explosive-laden vehicle targ­eted a Mine-Resistant Ambush Prot­ected (MRAP) vehicle belonging to the security forces’ bomb disposal unit.
Sources said the blast claimed the lives of 13 soldiers and injured 10 others. Rescue operations were launched immediately, with the injured and the bodies shifted to Bannu district. The area was cordoned off following the incident.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) described the attack as a “cowardly act” planned and orchestrated by the “terrorist state of India” and executed by its proxy Fitna al Khwarij — a term the military uses for the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to the ISPR, the suicide bomber attempted to ram a convoy, but was intercepted by the leading vehicle. In desperation, the vehicle was driven into one of the leading group’s vehicles, resulting in the casualties.
“Resultantly, 13 brave sons of soil embraced Shahadat. In this tragic and barbaric incident, three innocent civilians — two children and a woman — also got severely injured,” it said.
However, local sources said the number of civilian injuries was 14. They reported that an emergency had been declared at a hospital in Mir Ali, with all entry and exit points in the area closed.
They also said that the intensity of the blast caused the roofs of nearby houses to collapse, injuring several residents. A curfew had already been imposed in the area since 6am due to prevailing security concerns.
Following the attack, security forces launched a sanitisation operation. After an intense exchange of fire, 14 militants were killed. “The operations in the area would continue, and perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act will be brought to justice,” the ISPR added.
The martyred personnel were identified as Subedar Zahid Iqbal (aged 45) from Karak, Havildar Sohrab Khan (39) from Naseerabad, Havildar Mian Yousaf (41) from Buner, Naik Khitab Shah (34) from Lower Dir, Lance Naik Ismail (32) from Naseerabad, Sepoy Rohail (30) from Mirpur Khas, Sepoy Muhammad Ramzan (33) from Dera Ghazi Khan, Sepoy Nawab (30) from Quetta, Sepoy Zubair Ahmed (24) from Naseerabad, Sepoy Muhammad Sahki (31) from Dera Ghazi Khan, Sepoy Hashim Abbasi (20) from Abbottabad, Sepoy Muddasir Ejaz (25) from Layyah, and Sepoy Manzar Ali (23) from Mardan.
Security officials pointed fingers at Afghan nationals for the attacks on security forces. “Afghans have infiltrated there in hundreds and they are playing havoc with everything on earth,” a senior security official said.
The ISPR reiterated the military’s resolve to eliminate “Indian-sponsored terrorism” from the country, adding that “such sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further reinforce our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs”.
Asood-al-Harb, a group linked to the banned Hafiz Gul Bahadur network — which has increased attacks in the region — claimed responsibility for the Mir Ali bombing.
Suicide attack
In a separate incident, a suicide attacker on a motorbike targeted a security convoy in the Saidgai area of Ghulam Khan tehsil near the Pak-Afghan border, leaving six security personnel injured.
Three of them were critically wounded and shifted to Bannu after initial treatment in Miramshah, sources said. No official statement from ISPR on the Ghulam Khan incident was issued at the time of reporting.
Cop martyred
Meanwhile, in another attack in Peshawar, a cop posted at Hashtnagri police station was martyred after unidentified motorcyclists opened fire on him in the Shahpur area on Saturday.
The officer, Constable Shahenshah, was en route to duty when he was attacked near Shah Ji Abad graveyard, the city police said in a statement.
The constable’s funeral was held at the Peshawar Police Headquarters and was attended by Inspector General of KP Police Zulfiqar Hameed, CCPO Peshawar Qasim Ali Khan, SSP Operations Masood Ahmad, senior military officials and the martyr’s family members.

In Karachi, four people lost their lives in two separate accidents on Saturday.
According to officials, two of them were killed when a roof collapsed in Lyari while two others died of electrocution.
More rainfall
Heavy rainfall continued across the country on Saturday, with the prediction for similar weather over the next few days.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued alerts for glacial lake outburst floods (Glof), urban flooding, and flash floods across various regions of Pakis­tan over the next 24 to 48 hours.
In Balochistan, heavy rains inundated areas around Koh-i-Suleman, Zhob, Sherani, Barkhan, Qila Saifullah, Musakhel, Kohlu, Dera Bugti, Khuz­dar, Kalat, Qila Abdullah and Chaman.

In Punjab, the maximum rainfall on Saturday was recorded in Attock (102mm). The reading in Lahore was 62mm, Chak­wal 32mm, Bahawalpur 3mm, Narowal and Noorpur Thal 2mm and Kasur 1mm.
The first spell of monsoon rains in Punjab will continue till July 1, the PDMA said earlier this week.
Disaster alert
The NDMA has warned that intense rainfall and above-normal temperatures have increased the likelihood of Glof events in northern districts KP, including Upper Dir, Chitral, Swat, Reshun, Booni, Brep, Sardar Gol, Arkari, Dir Gol, Thalu 1 and 2 and Kumrat Valley.
A statement by the NDMA said these areas were at risk of Glof and sudden flash floods which could damage roads and infrastructure and disrupt public mobility.
Similarly, isolated rain and thunderstorms were expected in Chitral, Dir, Swat, Abbottabad, Mans­e­hra, Haripur, Karak, Ko­­hat, Kohistan, Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand, Now­shera, Malakand, Char­sad­da, Bannu, Buner, Haz­ara, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, and Waziristan.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, rapid glacier and snow melt combined with rain had escalated the risk of Glof in high-altitude valleys such as Badswat, Hinar­chi, Tursat Hundur, Darkut, and Ishkoman. Rainfall was also likely in Hunza, Skardu, Astore, Chilas, and adjoining regions.
The Glof events could increase the water level in rivers and trigger flash floods.

At least 16 scientists and 10 senior commanders were among those mourned at the funeral, according to state media, including armed forces chief Major General Moham­mad Bagheri, Revolutionary Gua­r­­ds commander General Hossein Salami, and Guards Aerospace Force chief General Amir Ali Hajizadeh.
 
 

Their coffins were driven into Tehran’s Azadi Square adorned with their photos and national flags, as crowds waved flags and some reached out to touch the caskets and throw rose petals onto them. State-run Press TV showed an image of ballistic missiles on display. Mass prayers were later held in the square.
State TV said the funeral, dub­bed the “procession of the Martyrs of Power”, was held for a total of 60 people killed in the war, including four women and four children.

In attendance were President Masoud Pezeshkian and other senior figures, including Ali Sham­khani, who was seriously wounded during the conflict and is an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as well as Khamenei’s son Mojtaba.
There was no immediate statement from Khamenei, who has not appeared publicly since the conflict began. In past funerals, he led prayers over the coffins of senior commanders ahead of public ceremonies broadcast on state television.

At least 19 people have been killed and six others injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid heavy rains and the consequent flash floods and landslides, according to data from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Separately, KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah suspended Swat Additional Deputy Commissioner for relief Ihsan-ul-Haq, Babuzai Assistant Commissioner (AC) Nida Iqbal and Khwazakhela AC Muhammad Amir Khan.
Tarar expressed his grief over the disaster in the Swat River, stating, “Whenever there’s a natural disaster, it is the government’s responsibility to extend relief.”
Speaking about the KP government suspending the Swat deputy commissioner, Tarar said that KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur should have been suspended instead.
“The CM should have been suspended; a man who says ‘I cannot hand out tents, it’s not my job’,” Tarar stated.
“Did the people of KP give you the mandate to work from Adiala?” the minister asked, referring to how Gandapur approaches incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for instructions and approval. “The people did not give you a mandate to operate like this; they gave you a mandate to serve the public.”
Tarar then noted how, despite advanced technology, the PTI’s KP government has been unable to implement effective infrastructure and attempts to rescue people who get trapped atop steep rock formations using makeshift arrangements.

“The KP government helicopter, which is used by the CM and was used by Imran Khan, could not be flown to the rescue of women and children who were in grave danger,” he lamented.
“Coming to Islamabad, armed with weapons and attacking policemen is not bravery, nor is it any sort of feat,” Tarar said, referring to the PTI’s Islamabad rally. “Real bravery is implementing an effective rescue system during 12 years of government.”
He addressed Gandapur: “If you could not procure rescue equipment, you should have just kept quiet. If handing out tents is not your job, then what is? Is rescuing people and keeping them safe not your job?”
Tarar noted that the KP taxpayer is bearing the brunt of inaction by the provincial administration. The minister suggested that Gandapur “abolish the PDMA … and stop taking taxes if you are not able to save people”.
 


According to Rescue 1122 KP spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi, the bodies of 11 of the 13 people who were swept away in the flood have been recovered so far.
“Of the bodies, nine are from Sialkot, while two are from Mardan,” Faizi told Dawn.com. “Rescue 1122 is conducting a search operation to recover the remaining missing people.”
Following the flooding, the KP government later on Saturday announced measures to mitigate the problems caused by flooding in rivers across the province.
In a post on X, the provincial government announced that among the decisions taken were a complete ban on all types of mining activities and encroachments along the riverbed, as well as declaring the office of the assistant deputy commissioner (relief) a response centre.
Additionally, all rivers will be effectively monitored, rescue teams will be provided with life jackets, drones and other modern equipment and irrigation early warning systems will be re-evaluated.
 






Swat DC among another official removed from posts
The KP government suspended the Swat deputy commissioner today, while another official faced disciplinary action for their alleged negligence during the floods.
An order from the KP government’s Establishment Department, seen by Dawn.com, read that Shahzad Mehboob was removed from his post as DC and transferred to the establishment department.
The same order, issued by the KP chief secretary, stated that Saleem Jan would be awarded the post.
Meanwhile, the Tehsil Municipal Officer (TMO) for Khawazakhela, Zahidullah Khan, was also removed from his post, according to an order issued by the KP government’s local government, elections and rural development department.
According to the order, seen by Dawn.com, Khan was removed from his post for “failure in delivery of municipal services and performance of assign lawful duties during emergency/floods situation”.
Under the powers conferred under the Local Councils PUGF (E&D) Rules, 1980, read with Local Council Board (Constitution and Conduct of Business) Rules, 1988, the chairman of the Local Council Board suspended Khan on administrative grounds with Immediate effect.</p><small>2025-06-28 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2823021581d25e6.jpg?r=231616' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920819/g7-agrees-to-avoid-higher-taxes-for-us-companies' target='_blank'><strong>G7 agrees to avoid higher taxes for US companies</strong></a><br><p>The United States and the Group of Seven nations have agreed to support a proposal that would exempt US companies from some components of an existing global agreement, the G7 said in a statement on Saturday.
The group has created a “side-by-side” system in response to the US administration agreeing to scrap the Section 899 retaliatory tax proposal from President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill, it said in a statement from Canada, the head of the rolling G7 presidency.
The G7 said the plan recognises existing US minimum tax laws and aims to bring more stability to the international tax system.
G7 officials said that they look forward to discussing a solution that is “acceptable and implementable to all”.
In January, through an executive order, Trump declared that the global corporate minimum tax deal was not applicable in the US, effectively pulling out of the landmark 2021 arrangement negotiated by the Biden administration with nearly 140 countries.
He had also vowed to impose a retaliatory tax against countries that impose taxes on US firms under the 2021 global tax agreement.
This tax was considered detrimental to many foreign companies operating in the US.</p><small>2025-06-28 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2821360468a49b9.jpg?r=213621' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920817/pakistan-a-net-region-stabiliser-following-indian-aggression-army-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan a ‘net region stabiliser’ following Indian aggression: army chief</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday stated that Pakistan proved itself as a “net region stabiliser” after having repelled Indian military aggression twice and demonstrating its commitment to regional security.
The remarks followed recent tensions between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
Speaking at the Pakistan Naval Academy in Karachi, COAS Munir said that Pakistan will protect its sovereignty and national interests decisively and without hesitation, state media PTV reported.
The report quoted the army chief as saying, “In recent years, India has twice undertaken acts of unprovoked aggression against Pakistan, which were met with our resolute response.”
“Despite grave provocations, Pakistan acted with restraint and maturity, and demonstrated its commitment to regional peace and stability, leading to its role as a net regional stabiliser,” he added.
 






He further said that India was “deliberately creating tension in the region” when Pakistan was close to eliminating terrorism, PTV said on X.
COAS Munir also highlighted the Kashmir issue, saying, “At such a time, we must remember the sacrifices of our Kashmiri brothers who are struggling against India’s illegal occupation.”
“Pakistan is a strong advocate for a just resolution of the Kashmir issue in accordance with United Nations resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people,” he added.
He called for a “just and peaceful resolution” to the Kashmir issue for lasting peace in the region.
Separately, Field Marshal Munir visited the Corps Headquarters in Peshawar, where he was briefed on the prevailing security situation and ongoing counter-terrorism operations, according to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The statement said, “During the visit, the field marshal also attended the funeral of martyrs of the incident at Bannu Garrison and visited the injured at Bannu Combined Military Hospital.”
“COAS (Munir) paid rich tribute to the unwavering courage and resilience of Pakistan’s security forces, who continue to confront and neutralise the Indian-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij with exemplary valour.”
 






The ISPR further said that the army chief vowed to bring “all facilitators, abettors, and perpetrators of terrorism” to justice, assuring “swift and decisive retribution” against those who undermine the country’s stability.
“The field marshal also emphasised the critical need for institutional capacity enhancement of civilian law enforcement agencies, particularly the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police,” the statement said.
“He urged relevant government stakeholders to prioritise these efforts, while reaffirming the Army’s continued support in building and augmenting the capabilities of law enforcement institutions.”
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
Earlier today, at least 13 security personnel were martyred in a suicide bombing in KP’s North Waziristan district, carried out by Indian proxy terrorists.
The military has said India was using its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, with ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry detailing “irr­e­futable evidence” of an Ind­ian military personnel’s involvement.</p><small>2025-06-28 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/28215800489963b.jpg?r=220008' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920818/norris-secures-pole-at-austrian-gp-with-stunning-last-lap-to-end-verstappen-dominance' target='_blank'><strong>Norris secures pole at Austrian GP with stunning last lap to end Verstappen dominance</strong></a><br><p>Lando Norris delivered a superb final flying lap in his McLaren on Saturday to end Max Verstappen’s run of domination in qualifying at the Red Bull Ring by claiming pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix.
The 25-year-old Briton clocked an outstanding lap in one minute and 3.971 seconds to outpace nearest rival Charles Leclerc of Ferrari by 0.521 seconds, with McLaren team-mate and championship leader Oscar Piastri third.
Norris, who is 22 points behind Piastri in the drivers’ title race, erased any hangover from his collision with Piastri in Canada two weeks ago with a thrilling demonstration of his speed and talent.
“It was a good lap, that’s for sure,” said Norris. “I guess that just little bit by little bit, I was able to get more time. Q1 was good, but I knew there were a few places I could get more time and I did what I planned to do.”
Verstappen had taken pole position at the Red Bull-owned circuit in the Styrian Alps for the last five F1 races before Norris succeeded and seized his first pole in Austria, his third of the season and 12th of his career.
Team-mate Piastri was disappointed and frustrated.
“I had [Pierre] Gasly spin at the first corner so I didn’t even open my second lap. Lando’s been very quick all weekend so it would have been a tough challenge, but we had the pace to be on the front row,” he said.
“We can still have a good race from there and we are not here to come home third.”
Verstappen’s last lap was stymied by a yellow flag waved when Gasly spun in his Alpine, leaving him, like Piastri, unable to clock a flying lap time. He finished seventh.
Leclerc said: “I’m very pleased. It’s been a long time since we started on the front row and it’s been a difficult season overall, but the team has kept pushing.
“We brought some new parts this weekend which for sure made a difference. We know we have a better car in the race than in qualifying so I hope we can put more pressure on the McLarens.”
Leclerc’s Ferrari team-mate and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton was an encouraging fourth ahead of Mercedes’ George Russell, Liam Lawson of Racing Bulls, four-time champion Verstappen of Red Bull and Gabriel Bortoleto of Sauber.
Italian rookie Kimi Antonelli was ninth in the second Mercedes and Gasly 10th.
‘Worse than before’
The session began in hot conditions with temperatures of 32° Celsius (air) and 48°C (track), indicating hard work for tyres.
After a frantic finale, in which Russell recovered from the drop zone to 11th, it was Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll, Esteban Ocon of Haas, Red Bull’s Yuki Tsunoda, Carlos Sainz in the second Williams and Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg who were eliminated.
McLaren, led by Norris, set the pace.
The entire field was separated by less than a second with the Red Bulls of Verstappen and Tsunoda, sixth and 18th, only 0.25 seconds apart. It was Sainz’s third consecutive Q1 exit.
The track temperature touched 50 at the start of Q2 with Ferrari leading the way on used softs as Norris established his supremacy again before a trackside grass fire prompted a red flag stoppage, Hamilton having run wide there at turn 10.
Verstappen was unhappy with his car’s reaction to the heat. “No grip, it’s worse than before,” he reported. “I don’t know what to say!”
After six minutes, the action resumed with only four to go as Norris and Piastri set the pace ahead of Leclerc while two-time champion Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin, Williams’ Alex Albon, Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar, Franco Colapinto of Alpine and Oliver Bearman of Haas missed out.
All of this left Bortoleto celebrating his first top ten qualification in fifth for the improving Sauber outfit, while Verstappen complained he was impeded by a Ferrari in a way that was “a bit naughty and super unnecessary”.
As Q3 began, Russell almost hit a Ferrari when he was released into their path, narrowly avoiding a collision.
On the first runs, Norris was fastest again, ahead of Leclerc with Piastri third and Hamilton fourth, the Ferraris enjoying the heat as Mercedes wilted before Norris stormed to pole.</p><small>2025-06-28 17:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2815003205420e3.jpg?r=150237' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920797/ndma-issues-urban-flood-warning-as-intermittent-showers-in-karachi-to-continue-till-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA issues urban flood warning as intermittent showers in Karachi to continue till tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Saturday warned that there is a risk of urban flooding across the southern district of Sindh, as rains lash Karachi and are forecast to continue tomorrow.
Karachi has been experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall since Thursday night, bringing on reprieve from the scorching summer heat. Monsoon rains continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities. Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September every year.
According to an NDMA alert on X, there is a risk of urban flooding within the next 48 hours in the districts of Sujawal, Thatta, Badin, Karachi, Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas.
The authority also issued an urban flood warning for “the low-lying areas of Pothohar/northeast Punjab”, including Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot and Lahore.
 






Meanwhile, two people died in rain-related incidents in Karachi, according to police, hospital and rescue officials.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com, a 30-year-old man was fatally electrocuted in New Karachi and his body was transported to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
“The man was electrocuted in his home,” New Karachi Station House Officer Mohammed Saud told Dawn.com.
Separately, a 17-year-old boy was fatally electrocuted near Murtaza Chaurangi in Bilal Colony, according to an Edhi Foundation spokesperson.
Korangi Industrial Area SHO Mohammed Ali Niazi said no one approached the police for legal proceedings regarding the teenager.
Earlier, the Met Office forecast intermittent showers in Karachi till tomorrow as the city continues to receive rain for a third consecutive day on Saturday.
According to a weather advisory issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), “strong monsoon currents are penetrating over the province”, causing thunderstorm/rain with moderate to heavy rainfall in Karachi along with Jamshoro, Dadu, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Hyderabad, Mitiari, Sanghar, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Shaheed Benazirabad, Nosheroferoz districts of Sindh.

In its weather advisory, the Met Office warned: “Heavy downpour/windstorm and lightning may affect daily routines, urban flooding, water logging in low lying areas and may damage weak structures like roof/wall of Kacha houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels, etc. during the forecast period.”
It advised farmers to manage their activities in light of the weather forecast.
The Met Office directed concerned authorities to remain alert and take all necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation.
Separately, an advisory issued by the traffic police advised people to avoid unnecessary travel, and to not take sudden brakes while on the road, as the roads may become slippery.
The advisory further asked commuters to maintain a low speed when driving, keeping a distance from the next vehicle and urged motorcyclists to use the left side of the road only.
On Friday, two young men died from electrocution in Karachi’s SITE and Surjani Town.

Established in 1960, the CDA is a civic organisation tasked with the development of the federal capital. The authority’s official website said that it plays a “pivotal role in the sustainable development and management” of the city.
A day earlier, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani heard two writ petitions challenging a Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) issued by the CDA in 2015 imposing Direct Access and Right of Way (ROW) charges on petrol pump/CNG stations located on major roads in Islamabad.
Today’s judgment said that the CDA charged the petitioners an amount of Rs337,442,856 for payment “under ROW charges”.
It said that the “issuance of SRO constitutes an illegal act and is unconstitutional” under Article 77 of the Constitution, which directs that taxation powers must be exercised with the parliament’s authority.
Justice Kayani noted, “Essentially, the imposition of direct taxes, ROW charges, or access charges by the CDA under the CDA Ordinance, 1960 based on municipal functions derived from the Municipal Administration Ordinance, 1960 without following the statutory procedure outlined in Sections 88, 89, and 90 of the ICT Local Government Act, 2015, is unlawful.”
The order said, “It is now time for the federal government to take appropriate steps to terminate the functioning of the CDA in terms of Section 52 of the CDA Ordinance, 1960, and to formally dissolve the Authority, as its original mandate has
been fulfilled.
“The entire administrative, regulatory and municipal framework of Islamabad Capital Territory is now governed under the ICT Local Government Act, 2015, which is a special legislation enacted to regulate local governance through elected representatives.”
While allowing both writ petitions, the order said that the SRO was declared “illegal” and “without lawful authority or jurisdiction”.
Justice Kayani directed the government to “initiate and conclude the process for the dissolution of the CDA, and to transfer all powers, assets, and functions to the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation (MCI)”.
“This transition shall ensure that the Islamabad Capital Territory is administered under a transparent, accountable, and lawful municipal framework, and that the rights of its citizens are duly protected under the law,” the order noted.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the city managers to reverse the decision to increase the fare of the CDA buses, after the public criticised the authority for doubling the fare.
Last week, the IHC rebuked the CDA for its failure to provide designated spaces for licensed pushcart vendors, terming the issue one of dignity and survival for the city’s working poor.</p><small>2025-06-28 14:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/281530079017bd5.png?r=165214' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792/26-opposition-mpas-barred-from-punjab-assembly-for-15-sittings-over-disorderly-conduct' target='_blank'><strong>26 opposition MPAs barred from Punjab Assembly for 15 sittings over ‘disorderly conduct’</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan has ordered the suspension of 26 opposition MPAs for 15 sittings of the provincial legislature after their protests disrupted the proceedings, it emerged on Saturday.
The members raised slogans and protested during Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s speech in the assembly yesterday, when she responded to PTI leadership’s comments that ex-premier Nawaz Sharif — also an MNA — had been removed from the political arena.
According to an order issued by Malik on Friday, the suspended MPAs “became disorderly, beyond all parliamentary reasoning and practices”, including tearing the agenda papers and hurling torn pieces towards the treasury benches as well as using “offensive, abusive, and unparliamentary language and slogans”.
The order was issued under Rule 210 of the Punjab Assembly Rules of Procedure 1997 (power to order withdrawal or suspension of member) and stated that the 26 MPAs violated four provisions of Rule 223.
These were (c) (shall not interrupt any member while speaking by disorderly expression or noises or in any other disorderly manner), (f) (shall maintain silence when not speaking in the assembly), (h) (shall not chant slogans, display banners or placards, throw and tear table documents and reports, etc), and (i) (shall not indulge in rowdy behaviour).
 






The MPAs also allegedly manhandled the treasury members, blocking their way as they tried to approach the treasury benches with “threatening gestures”.
Malik, in his order, said he repeatedly tried to call the assembly to order, but the opposition “declined to act in accordance with the Rules and persisted with misconduct and disorder and kept challenging my orders and authority”.
The speaker concluded that the opposition MPAs had “disregarded [his] authority as speaker […] consistently and willfully obstructing the business of the assembly”.
Out of the 26 MPAs suspended, 17 were listed as belonging to the Sunni Ittehad Council, which PTI-affiliated candidates joined last year after their party was deprived of its election symbol. At least eight others, however, were stated as PTI MPAs.
 






The following 26 lawmakers were suspended:

10 MPAs fined for ‘vandalism’
Separately, the Punjab Assembly secretary general has also fined 10 MPAs Rs203,550 each for allegedly damaging public property during the June 16 session, according to a letter issued today.
According to Malik, opposition members had tried to interrupt the budget speech by Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman. He claimed SIC’s Hassan Malik had hit the minister with the budget book repeatedly, causing the Rehman to stop his address.
The letter by Chaudhry Amer Habib to the 10 lawmakers stated that the fine was being imposed on account of damages, as eight microphones were broken after the named individuals climbed upon the desks. It also cited a video recording of the incident.
The statement added that if the payment was not made within seven days, action would be taken under the Punjab Government Dues Recovery Ordinance 1962.
 
 

The 10 MPAs included six who have been suspended over yesterday’s session — SIC’s Tanveer Aslam, Imtiaz Mahmood and Riffat, along with PTI’s Nisar, Ismael and Aurangzaib.
Others were Shahbaz Ahmed, PTI’s Chaudhry Javed Kausar and Mohammad Ahsan Ali, and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Asad Abbas.
The MPAs, the letter said, had violated Rule 223 (r), which states that a lawmaker “shall not break or harm any furniture, equipment or device installed in the chamber”.
Malik directed the recovery of the damage under Rule 235 (residuary powers of the speaker.</p><small>2025-06-28 14:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/281806184f04d6f.jpg?r=180625' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920809/pakistan-leading-emerging-markets-in-reduced-default-risk' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan leading emerging markets in reduced default risk</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is leading the Global Emerging Markets (EM) Rankings, indicating improvement in default risk, Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad said on Saturday.
The current government has reassured that the country has moved onto a path of economic recovery and growth, witnessing “economic stabilisation” after a period of turbulence and uncertainty.  Some assessments by global rating agencies have signalled gradual improvements in key economic indicators.
In a statement on X, Schehzad said, “As per the latest data posted by Bloomberg Intelligence, Pakistan stands out globally as the most improved economy in terms of reduction in sovereign default risk, as measured by CDS-implied probability.”
He said that the country has topped the Global Emerging Markets rankings with the “largest drop in sovereign default risk globally over the last 12 months”.
The statement said, “[The] default probability [went] down from 59 per cent to 47pc, a massive 1,100 basis points improvement.”
“This marks the sharpest decline among major emerging markets, ahead of Argentina (-7pc), Tunisia (-4pc), and Nigeria (-5pc).”
 
 

The country’s ranking contrasted with places like Turkey, Ecuador, Egypt, and Gabon, which have seen their default risks rise, it added.
The statement also said that the “sharp decline in Pakistan’s risk signals renewed investor confidence” through macroeconomic stabilisation, structural reforms, successful International Monetary Fund engagement and timely debt repayments, and improved credit outlooks by S&P, Fitch, and others.
Terming it “a resounding signal to global investors”, Schehzad said, “Pakistan is not only back on the map — it is moving forward with stability, credibility, and reform at its core.”
Earlier this month, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb unveiled the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25, exuding confidence that Pakistan’s economy would be able to post growth of 2.7 per cent in the outgoing fiscal year for the gross domestic product (GDP).
A United Nations report in May said that Pakistan was expected to experience “moderate growth, stabilising after a period of economic contraction”, with its GDP projected to expand by 2.3pc in 2025.</p><small>2025-06-28 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/28165143fd8dab6.jpg?r=165942' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920808/uk-distances-new-spy-chief-from-nazi-grandfather' target='_blank'><strong>UK distances new spy chief from ‘Nazi’ grandfather</strong></a><br><p>The British government has distanced the incoming head of its foreign intelligence service from her grandfather following reports he was a Nazi spy known as “the Butcher”.
Blaise Metreweli will, in the autumn, become the first woman to lead MI6 in its 116-year-old history, the British government announced earlier this month.
The Daily Mail newspaper reported this week that her grandfather Constantine Dobrowolski defected from the Soviet Union’s Red Army to become a Nazi informant in the Chernigiv region of modern-day Ukraine.
The newspaper said German archives showed Dobrowolski was known as “the Butcher” or “Agent No 30” by Wehrmacht commanders.
“Blaise Metreweli neither knew nor met her paternal grandfather,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement.
“Blaise’s ancestry is characterised by conflict and division and, as is the case for many with eastern European heritage, only partially understood. It is precisely this complex heritage which has contributed to her commitment to prevent conflict and protect the British public from modern threats from today’s hostile states, as the next chief of MI6.”
The Daily Mail said Dobrowolski had a 50,000 ruble bounty placed on him by Soviet leaders, and was dubbed the “worst enemy of the Ukrainian people”.
He also sent letters to superiors saying he “personally” took part in “the extermination of the Jews”, the newspaper added.
The head of MI6 is the only publicly named member of the organisation and reports directly to the foreign minister.
Metreweli, 47, will be the 18th head of MI6.
Like her predecessors, she will be referred to as “C”, not “M” as the chief is called in the James Bond film franchise.</p><small>2025-06-28 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2815541815a755e.jpg?r=155434' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920806/immigrants-scramble-for-clarity-after-us-supreme-court-birthright-ruling' target='_blank'><strong>Immigrants scramble for clarity after US supreme court birthright ruling</strong></a><br><p>The US Supreme Court’s ruling tied to birthright citizenship prompted confusion and phone calls to lawyers as people who could be affected tried to process a convoluted legal decision with major humanitarian implications.
The court’s conservative majority on Friday granted President Donald Trump his request to curb federal judges’ power but did not decide the legality of his bid to restrict birthright citizenship.
That outcome has raised more questions than answers about a right long understood to be guaranteed under the US Constitution: that anyone born in the United States is considered a citizen at birth, regardless of their parents’ citizenship or legal status.
Lorena, a 24-year-old Colombian asylum seeker who lives in Houston and is due to give birth in September, pored over media reports on Friday morning. She was looking for details about how her baby might be affected, but said she was left confused and worried.
“There are not many specifics,” said Lorena, who like others interviewed by Reuters asked to be identified by her first name out of fear for her safety.
“I don’t understand it well.”
She is concerned that her baby could end up with no nationality.
“I dont know if I can give her mine,” she said.
“I also don’t know how it would work, if I can add her to my asylum case. I don’t want her to be adrift with no nationality.”
Trump, a Republican, issued an order after taking office in January that directed US agencies to refuse to recognise the citizenship of children born in the US who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident.
The order was blocked by three separate US district court judges, sending the case on a path to the Supreme Court. The resulting decision said Trump’s policy could go into effect in 30 days but appeared to leave open the possibility of further proceedings in the lower courts that could keep the policy blocked.
On Friday afternoon, plaintiffs filed an amended lawsuit in federal court in Maryland seeking to establish a nationwide class of people whose children could be denied citizenship.
 
 

If they are not blocked nationwide, the restrictions could be applied in the 28 states that did not contest them in court, creating “an extremely confusing patchwork” across the country, according to Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst for the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.
“Would individual doctors, individual hospitals be having to try to figure out how to determine the citizenship of babies and their parents?” she said.
The drive to restrict birthright citizenship is part of Trump’s broader immigration crackdown, and he has framed automatic citizenship as a magnet for people to come to give birth.
“Hundreds of thousands of people are pouring into our country under birthright citizenship, and it wasn’t meant for that reason,” he said during a White House press briefing on Friday.
Worried calls
Immigration advocates and lawyers in some Republican-led states said they received calls from a wide range of pregnant immigrants and their partners following the ruling.
They were grappling with how to explain it to clients who could be dramatically affected, given all the unknowns of how future litigation would play out or how the executive order would be implemented state by state.
Lynn Tramonte, director of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said she got a call on Friday from an East Asian temporary visa holder with a pregnant wife. He was anxious because Ohio is not one of the plaintiff states and wanted to know how he could protect his child’s rights.
“He kept stressing that he was very interested in the rights included in the Constitution,” she said.
 
 

Advocates underscored the gravity of Trump’s restrictions, which would block an estimated 150,000 children born in the US annually from receiving automatic citizenship.
“It really creates different classes of people in the country with different types of rights,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, a spokesperson for the immigrant rights organisation United We Dream.
“That is really chaotic.”
Adding uncertainty, the Supreme Court ruled that members of two plaintiff groups in the litigation — CASA, an immigrant advocacy service in Maryland, and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project — would still be covered by lower court blocks on the policy.
Whether someone in a state where Trump’s policy could go into effect could join one of the organisations to avoid the restrictions, or how state or federal officials would check for membership, remained unclear.
Betsy, a US citizen who recently graduated from high school in Virginia and a CASA member, said both of her parents came to the US from El Salvador two decades ago and lacked legal status when she was born.
“I feel like it targets these innocent kids who haven’t even been born,” she said, declining to give her last name for concerns over her family’s safety.
Nivida, a Honduran asylum seeker in Louisiana, is a member of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project and recently gave birth. She heard on Friday from a friend without legal status who is pregnant and wonders about the situation under Louisiana’s Republican governor, since the state is not one of those fighting Trump’s order.
“She called me very worried and asked what’s going to happen,” she said.
“If her child is born in Louisiana is the baby going to be a citizen?”</p><small>2025-06-28 11:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/281446129e2ac1f.jpg?r=145322' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920800/france-bans-smoking-on-beaches-in-parks-and-bus-shelters' target='_blank'><strong>France bans smoking on beaches, in parks and bus shelters</strong></a><br><p>France will ban smoking on beaches and in parks, public gardens and bus shelters from Sunday, the government said.

Monsoon rains across the region offer respite from the summer heat and are vital for agriculture and food security. Weather-related incidents are common during the season, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity.
Two people died while four were wounded in a roof collapse incident reported at 3:20am in the Abbas Nagar area of Lahore’s Shahdara Town, Rescue 1122 said in a statement today.
It noted that the house was single-storied and the roof was made of mud. The bodies were taken to Shahdara Hospital, where some of the injured were also taken, while others wounded were brought to Mayo Hospital.
 
 

Separately, eight children were among 12 dead while 39 others were injured in various rain-related incidents across Punjab since Wednesday, according to a PDMA report issued today.
From Wednesday to Friday, 25 incidents were reported in various cities, which rose to 28 today, a statement by the PDMA spokesperson said.
Most of the cases involved wall and roof collapses due to torrential rains, accounting for nine out of 12 lives lost during the four-day period, according to the report.
In Kasur, two children died from a roof collapsing while another two lost their lives in a wall collapse incident. One child each died in roof collapse incidents in Okara, Bahawalnagar and Faisalabad.
In Wazirabad, a wall collapsing killed a man and a child, along with injuring a woman and another minor.
In Jhelum, the PDMA report said, two men “drowned in a rainwater nullah”. A recent report detailed that a loader rickshaw fell into a storm drain on an inundated road.
The PDMA report also mentioned a lightning incident in Khanewal that took the life of a man.
Other districts where casualties were reported were Mandi Bahauddin, Sahiwal, Chiniot, Multan, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib. Separately, a cow perished in Rahim Yar Khan after a tree fell due to a windstorm.

Irfan Ali Kathia, the PDMA director general, issued directives to provide medical assistance to the injured as well as financial aid to their relatives.
In a statement, he also requested citizens to avoid non-essential travel during inclement weather conditions.
“Do not live in dilapidated houses,” he advised. “Take care of the children [and] do not let them go near the rainwater drains, electric wires and poles.”
Monsoon rains have commenced in Punjab and the first spell will continue till July 1, the PDMA said earlier this week, adding that rainfall with strong winds and thunderstorms are predicted in most districts of the province.
Punjab is predicted to receive 25 per cent more monsoon rains this year, Kathia said on Wednesday.
In case of emergency, citizens are directed to call the PDMA helpline at 1129.</p><small>2025-06-28 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2811383292c47c4.jpg?r=113836' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920784/flood-hit-china-expands-social-security-net-as-extreme-rain-takes-toll' target='_blank'><strong>Flood-hit China expands social security net as extreme rain takes toll</strong></a><br><p>China has expanded the economic safeguards for segments of its population affected by flood control schemes in times of extreme rainfall, including pledges of direct compensation from the central government and payments for livestock losses.
In China, diverting floodwaters to areas next to rivers is a major step in managing downstream flooding. As extreme rainfall grows in frequency, China is increasingly utilising such areas, some of which have been unused until now and have been populated by farms, croplands and even residential buildings, stoking social tensions.
According to revised rules on compensation related to flood diversions released late on Friday, the central government will now bear 70 per cent of all compensation funds, with local governments responsible for the rest. Previously, the ratio was to be decided based on actual economic losses and the fiscal situation of local governments.
Livestock and poultry that cannot be relocated in time before the arrival of diverted floodwaters will also be included in the compensation scheme for the first time. Previously, only the loss of working animals could be claimed for compensation.
In the summer of 2023, almost 1 million people in Hebei, a province on the doorstep of Beijing, were relocated after record rain forced authorities to divert water from swollen rivers to some populated areas for storage, triggering anger over the homes and farms sacrificed to save the Chinese capital.
China currently has 98 designated flood diversion areas spanning major river basins including the Yangtze River basin, home to a third of the country’s population. During the 2023 Hebei floods, eight flood storage areas were used.
Since the start of the East Asia monsoon in early June, precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze has been up to two times higher than usual, officials from the China Meterological Administration told reporters on Friday.
In other parts of China, daily rainfall measured by 30 meteorological stations in provinces such as Hubei and Guizhou broke records for the month of June, they said.
Guizhou was the focal point of China’s flood alleviation efforts this week, with one of its cities hit by flooding on a scale that meteorologists said could only happen once in 50 years, and at a speed that shocked its 300,000 residents.
That prompted Beijing to issue pledges on Thursday to move vulnerable populations and industries to low-flood areas and allocate more space for flood diversion.</p><small>2025-06-28 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/28104512bdec426.jpg?r=104702' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920712/pilgrims-unable-to-perform-haj-to-get-full-refund' target='_blank'><strong>Pilgrims unable to perform Haj to get full refund</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Religious Affairs has been ordered to refund Rs36 billion to aspiring pilgrims who couldn’t perform Haj this year.
The money would be returned to over 67,000 Pakistani pilgrims who were supposed to go on Haj through private tour operators but couldn’t over delays in payments.
The sub-committee of Senate Standing Committee on Religious Affairs on Friday directed the ministry to fully reimburse the victims.
The sub-committee’s convener, Senator Aon Abbas Buppi, announced that Rs36.43 billion held in Saudi Arabia must be refunded by August 15.
There should be no deductions whatsoever, including currency exchange losses or service charges, Mr Bappi emphasised.
 






Religious Affairs Secretary Dr Attaur Rehman informed the committee that Pakistan was allotted a quota of 179,210 pilgrims for the Haj in 2025 by the Saudi government.
Of this quota, 90,830 slots were allocated to private Haj operators.
However, the Saudi government later revised its policy to only allow operators with a group of 500 to 2,000 pilgrims.
None of the 903 registered private tour operators in Pakistan fulfilled this requirement, the official said.
 
 

He claimed that despite multiple communications from the min­­istry, the Haj Operators Associat­ion of Pakistan (HOAP) obtained a stay order from the Sindh High Court against the policy.
The stay was vacated on January 7 but by then, the window to deposit payments had nearly closed.
During the legal deadlock, HOAP had transferred 50m riyals to the Pakistani Haj Mission’s account.
After the stay was lifted, the ministry instructed the private operators to promptly deposit the remaining funds into a designated Saudi E-Wallet account.
However, by the Saudi cut-off date of February 14, only 187m riyals had been deposited.
According to Saudi policy, only pilgrims who had paid the full 14,000 riyals by Feb 14 were eligible to perform Haj.
As a result, only 26,986 remained eligible as their full payment was deposited.
Director General Haj Abdul Wahab Soomro reported that 667m riyals were transferred to Saudi accounts by Pakistani private operators, out of which 489m riyals — around Rs36.43bn — remained unutilised and are still held in Saudi Arabia.
Senator Dinesh Kumar said the negligence of officials and tour operators deprived 67,000 Pakistanis of a chance to fulfil their religious obligation.
 
 

Senator Bushra Anjum Butt strongly slammed HOAP’s absence from the meeting, stating that it was unacceptable for the main stakeholders to skip a session that directly concerned them.
The sub-committee also directed the ministry to submit the complete list of existing private tour operators, along with new applicants, to the standing committee.
Senator Bappi suggested the federal government establishes a high-level commission to evaluate and regulate the operations of private Haj operators. “This would ensure that such failures are not repeated in future Haj”.
He further directed the government to ensure public awareness of the Saudi Haj policy for the next season.
The committee also discussed a letter written in March 2025 by former Religious Affairs minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain, expressing concerns over the award of contracts related to hotel bookings, transport, catering, and Mashaheer services.

• Circular debt crosses Rs4.9tr; unfunded pensions, weak governance deepen fiscal strain
ISLAMABAD: With relentless financial haemorrhaging of nearly Rs342bn in just six months, the cumulative losses and unfunded pension liabilities of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have crossed Rs7.5tr — almost three times the country’s defence allocation of Rs2.55tr for FY26, and over seven times the upcoming year’s Public Sector Develop­ment Programme (Rs1tr).
The Ministry of Finance informed the Cabinet Commit­tee on State-Owned Enterprises (CCoSOEs) on Friday that total SOE losses now exceed Rs5.8tr — nearly one-third of the recently passed Rs17.5tr federal budget for 2025-26.
Presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb, the meeting was briefed by the Central Monitoring Unit of the Finance Division on the biannual performance of federal SOEs for the period July to December 2024.
The report outlined the worsening state of SOEs, including cumulative losses of Rs5.8tr, with Rs342bn incurred in just six months.
Despite repeated increases in electricity and gas tariffs over the past three years, circular debt in the oil, gas and power sectors has surged to over Rs4.9tr — almost double the defence budget — severely affecting cash flows and asset valuations.
The committee was told that government fiscal support to SOEs — via grants, subsidies, loans and other injections — also exceeded Rs600bn in just six months, equivalent to nearly 10pc of total revenue receipts.
Unfunded pension liabilities in power distribution companies (Discos) and other SOEs, estimated at Rs1.7tr, remain off the government’s books, as do the pension obligations of Pakistan Railways.
Government guarantees currently stand at Rs2.2tr, while costs related to debt rollovers and financial restructuring further tighten fiscal space. The meeting was informed of persistent governance issues, particularly weak transparency in beneficial interest disclosures under IFRS Section 30, and other regulatory compliance gaps. A lack of strategic alignment and operational inefficiencies were identified as urgent areas for reform.
The cabinet committee noted with concern the staggering Rs5.8tr in cumulative losses, including Rs342bn in just six months — a daily average loss of Rs1.9bn, according to an official statement.
Finance Minister Aurangzeb deplored inefficiencies in Disco operations, delays in grid upgrades by NTDC, and ballooning pension obligations. He warned that weak governance standards are undermining fiscal space and deterring investor confidence.
He stressed the need for urgent reform in the power and energy sectors, where circular debt has crossed Rs4.9tr, and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to enhancing transparency, financial discipline, and accountability across SOEs.
He vowed to push through governance and operational reforms to ensure the financial sustainability of public sector entities.
Mr Aurangzeb also directed that all government-nominated directors on SOE boards exercise due diligence and actively contribute to improving financial and operational performance through informed decision-making.
Ironically, each SOE board includes at least one senior official from the finance ministry — alongside representatives from relevant line ministries — who receive generous remunerations for attending quarterly board meetings, yet the financial bleeding remains unchecked.
The finance minister underscored the importance of aligning business plans with national priorities and tackling operational challenges in a coordinated and timely fashion. The meeting was also attended by ministers from the ministries of Power, Maritime Affairs, and Science and Technology.
The committee approved the appointment of chairpersons for Quetta Electric and Gujranwala Electric, as well as the constitution of the Board of Directors for the Independent System Market Operator (ISMO) and an independent director for GENCO Holding Company Ltd (GHCL), as proposed by the Power Division.
It also approved the nomination of independent directors for the boards of Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Power Information Technology Company (PITC), and the formation of the board for Energy Infrastructure Development and Management Company (EIDMC).
Additionally, the committee approved a summary from the Ministry of Railways seeking the winding up of three railway subsidiaries — RAILCOP, PRACS, and PRFTC.

• Insists Trump’s Nobel nomination a joint civil-military decision
• Dismisses claim Islamabad sought ceasefire
ISLAMABAD: Foreign Mini­ster Ishaq Dar on Friday ruled out the possibility of Pakistan joining the Abraham Accords, stating that such a move would effectively mean abandoning the country’s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict and recognising Israel.
Speaking at a news conference at the Foreign Office, Mr Dar, who also serves as deputy prime minister, reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
His comments came in response to recent remarks by US Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who suggested that more countries, which were not previously “contemplated”, were preparing to join the US-brokered accords, which normalise ties with Israel.
Witkoff had joined President Donald Trump at the White House lunch for Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“We are not ready to recognise Israel until the two-state solution to the Palestine conflict is accepted,” Mr Dar said. “There is no change in our stated policy on the Palestine issue.”
He added that signing the Abraham Accords would be tantamount to abandoning Pakistan’s long-standing demand for a Palestinian state with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders. “Let it be clear to everyone that our seven-decades-long policy rem­ains unchanged,” he said.
Trump’s Nobel nomination
Addressing criticism over Pakistan’s nomination of President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr Dar said the decision was made jointly by the country’s civilian and military leadership.
He emphasised that the nomination, submitted prior to the start of the Israel-Iran conflict, was based on Trump’s role in de-escalating tensions between India and Pakis­tan and his remarks regarding the Kashmir dispute.
The foreign minister recalled that Trump “tweeted 15 or 16 times about that”.
Trump’s repeated cla­i­ms on social media about his role in facilitating the May 10 ceasefire between Pakistan and India have irritated New Delhi.
“The decision to nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize was in the context of his role in the India-Pakistan conflict and his statements on the Kashmir issue,” Mr Dar said.
“It was a collective decision by the civil-military leadership. I signed the letter on June 11, days before the Iran-Israel war began. The prime minister’s approval was obviously part of the process.”
Mr Dar referred to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s remarks at a June 4 event at the US Embassy, where he reportedly called Trump “a man of peace”.
The nomination has stirred controversy within Pakistan, with many questioning the rationale behind the move.
Indian ceasefire claims
Responding to Indian officials’ statements that claimed Pakistan had sought a ceasefire, FM Dar dismissed the assertions and reiterated Islamabad’s position that dialogue must be based on equality.
“We didn’t ask anyone for a ceasefire, nor would we ask anyone for dialogue,” he said.
“If India wants talks, we are ready. But we are a dignified nation, we won’t beg. Pakistan is prepared to talk on all outstanding issues, including Kashmir and terrorism, at any venue, but in a respectful manner. The ball is in their court. It takes two to tango.”
His remarks directly challenge New Delhi’s narrative and reaffirm Pakistan’s readiness for dialogue grounded in mutual respect and national dignity.
