Hunger as policy
The death trap

It starts with the body eating itself, consuming all the energy stored in its nooks and crannies. Then begins the shedding: weight, hair, skin, muscles, colour, sanity. And finally, when months pass, all that remains are shadows of a self that once was. Slowly, the heart and liver stop functioning, and soon after, death descends.
This is the story of two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, who have been stripped of food, water, shelter, dignity and a future. It is a story that started well before the onslaught began on Oct 7, 2023, following the Hamas attack on Israel.
In the two years since, the Israeli military has pretty much flattened Gaza, killing almost 70,000 people, injuring and maiming thousands of others and displacing hundreds of thousands. But some in Gaza consider the deceased lucky — at least they don’t have to witness their loved ones slowly starve to death.
While the signs started showing way back, officially, a famine was declared in the enclave on August 22 this year. According to the Integrated Security Phase Classification (IPC) — a standardised global system for analysing and classifying the severity of acute and chronic food insecurity and acute malnutrition — more than half a million Palestinians are trapped, starving to death, in the Strip.

The declaration was news, but no surprise. For the past two years, the world has witnessed in real time this famine unfold on their mobile and television screens. International human rights bodies had been warning of it for months; resolutions were passed, letters were written, and condemnations were issued. Yet, as hundreds of desperate Palestinians starved to death, the world looked on — some with agonising helplessness, others out of brutal indifference.
As of October 1, at least 455 Palestinians have died of starvation. While most of these deaths are among children and infants, older people are increasingly succumbing to the hunger that Israel has imposed on Gaza. Aid agencies have warned that the meagre amount of aid Tel Aviv is allowing into the enclave will only worsen conditions in the Strip.
“People are literally falling dead from hunger in the streets,” said Hany Abufayez, a writer based in Gaza who specialises in social and political issues. Once a successful businessman, the father of six — four boys and two girls — lost everything in the war. His only asset now is his family; their safety is his top priority.
Under international law, access to food is a “fundamental human right”. But in Gaza, this right has become a choice: death by starvation or death by bombs. “Either we die of hunger in the tents or risk going out in search of food amid killings, bombings and sniper fire,” said Abufayez. His nephew, Fayez Jamal Abu Akar, paid the price: “he went out to fetch food. He was shot in the head, abdomen and leg.”
Stages of starvation
By definition, starvation is suffering or death caused by the lack of food. It occurs over three stages: the first starts as early as a skipped meal, the second comes with a prolonged period of fasting when the body relies on stored fats for energy, and the third and fatal stage is when these fat reserves are depleted. The body consequently turns to bones and muscles for energy.

“Starvation is one of the most barbaric ways to kill someone,” said Dr Fyeza Jehan, professor and chairperson of the Department of Paediatrics & Child Health at the Aga Khan University in Karachi. “It is not sudden … it is prolonged, you are constantly conscious of it, and it is intended to maximise suffering.”
Chronic starvation, the doctor explained, is like the body cannibalising itself. Without access to food, the stomach contracts, leading to severe hunger pangs that occur as the body utilises all of its glycogen stores — the stored form of glucose, primarily located in the liver and skeletal muscles. In adults, the process can last 48 hours, while in children, it is accelerated and can last up to a day.
After two to three days without food, the hunger vanishes, leaving the body behind in what is called the survival mode, and as it happens, the body goes frigid. “It feels like there is no life left in you,” Dr Fyeza said. In a child, this can manifest as a boy or a girl with dull eyes who doesn’t play or talk anymore. For toddlers or infants, their cries dim or just stop altogether.
When weeks pass, these effects worsen in the form of lost weight, thin skin, shrinking muscles, hallucinations and a weak immune system in adults. In these circumstances, even a common cold can lead to severe infections.
In children, prolonged starvation eats up all the fat and protein in their bodies, leaving them with oedema — swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body’s tissues, often affecting the legs, ankles, and feet. Physically, the child loses all colour and embodies a shrunken leaf. At this stage, any infection can cause death.
For Gaza’s children, the signs Dr Fyeza pointed out fit like a glove.
Dr Wesam Amir, a Palestinian medic who left the enclave for safety last year, cannot forget those dull eyes, once sparkling with life and light. “Instead of running around, they now search for a place to lie on; instead of toys, they now ask for bread; many have forgotten what it is like to eat a full meal.”
“Their cries echo in my ears even today … and it breaks me every single time,” he sighed. Dr Wesam recalled the wails of an infant in the neighbourhood where he lived. “The mother couldn’t breastfeed … she was malnourished herself. Her baby would cry with hunger for hours, but there was nothing that could be fed, not even formula milk.”
As months pass without adequate food, a starving adult may still be able to survive. But they are merely a shadow of their former selves; all that remains are bones and skin. Eventually, the heart and liver begin to fail, and the body’s tissues break down. Death is not far away.
Children, on the other hand, rarely ever reach this stage. Their fragile bodies rapidly deteriorate, becoming susceptible to diarrhoea, pneumonia and sepsis. At three weeks, the process of starvation reaches its catastrophic phase, where children get lesions on their eyes and go blind, their hair falls out, and their organs shut down.
“Unable to move, speak or cry out, they draw their last breath,” said Rachael Cummings, humanitarian director at Save the Children. She highlighted that data compiled by the organisation for July showed cases of acute malnutrition in children under the age of five at their clinics across Gaza surged tenfold during the four months of total siege.

Of the 3,533 children screened for malnutrition during the first half of July, 259 were admitted for treatment (7pc) compared to 28 (1pc) in March. The number of children admitted for treatment of malnutrition in the first two weeks of July was close to the total for the whole of June, a trend that is dangerous and unprecedented. “There is a clear correlation here with the start of the total siege at the beginning of March and its knock-on impacts.”
When it comes to grown-ups, research suggests that a healthy adult can survive without food for between one to two months. However, there are no healthy adults in Gaza today — two years of aid being blocked intermittently by Israel has deprived them of conditions indispensable for survival, essentially rendering people in the enclave vulnerable to malnutrition and a host of infectious diseases.
“Imagine that 99 per cent of people here have not eaten a meal containing meat or eggs in over a year or six months,” Khalil Abu Shama, a human rights defender in Gaza, told Dawn.com. His family is very much a part of this percentage.
Shama’s son, Mohammed, especially requires the nutrients. He fractured his right leg during the Israeli bombing of the beachfront Al-Baqa cafe in Gaza City on June 30, in which the military used a 500lb bomb — a powerful and indiscriminate weapon that generates a massive blast wave and scatters shrapnel over a wide area.
“He needs nutritious foods, like meat and eggs, to recover and walk again,” the father said. “But we struggle to provide him with even basic food. The available food consists mainly of canned goods such as fava and kidney beans, peas, some bread, cheese, and a very limited amount of vegetables,” he rued.
But meals in Gaza are no longer about nutrition or flavour; they are now only meant to quell the hunger pangs. Most families survive on one meal a day. As per the recent IPC report, July 2025 was consistent with the exponential rise in acute malnutrition across Gaza. It found that at least 1 in 5 households in the enclave are facing an extreme shortage in their consumption of food, roughly 1 in 3 children or more are acutely malnourished, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people are dying daily because of outright starvation or the combination of malnutrition and disease.

It further reported that in the Gaza governorate, 15pc of households said they have resorted to scavenging through bins for food, adding that at certain points over the past 23 months, people were forced to eat leaves to survive, or scraps that even rats wouldn’t want to eat.
“Breakfast is often a cup of water and, if you are lucky, a piece of stale bread,” described Dr Wesam. “The main meal of the day is usually a thin rice soup made with lots of water and a handful of grains. On other days, it is plain rice with a pinch of salt.” A dish like eggplant stew, he continued, has become a luxury — unseen in months.
“My grandmother-in-law has health conditions that require a special diet, but we can’t provide it. She is so frail, yet she often gives a portion of her food to the children, pretending she isn’t hungry,” he added.
Psychological toll
Beyond the toll and hunger is something grave — it is the erosion of dignity and future potential and the long-term psychological trauma that will haunt generations of Palestinians to come.
“There is … a multi-generational societal impact. The trauma, sense of degradation and humiliation that accompany the experience of famine lives on in the memories of people,” said Alex de Waal, one of the world’s leading experts on famine, in an interview with Anadolu Agency, while comparing starvation in Gaza with the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s, which left a lingering silence and chafed pain for over a century.
“I fear that in the case of Gaza, this sense of trauma, degradation, humiliation, dehumanisation will mean that this is a wound that … will take generations to heal,” he added.
The Palestinian spread, once a symbol of pride for Gaza, was reduced by Israel to stale bread and thin rice soup made of a handful of grains — that too require begging — and dirty water. Some families look at old photos of meals on their phones just to remember what it used to feel like to have a full table and a fuller stomach.
“Managing feels too generous. People aren’t managing; they are barely surviving,” said Dr Wesam. And this affects not just their bodies, but also their behaviours, which become contrary to normal survival instincts, both in adults and children. For babies born in Gaza during the last several months, food is a foreign concept, as many of them have never tasted a hearty meal. This doesn’t just impact them but also helpless mothers, who are malnourished themselves.
“In Nasser, the hospital corridors are lined with women who have just given birth. In six missions to Gaza, I have never seen it like this — new mothers and vulnerable newborns lying on the floor,” said Unicef spokesperson James Elder.
“Three premature babies share a single oxygen source — each breathing for 20 minutes, before giving way to the next. A premature baby, Nada, who was in intensive care for 21 days, is discharged and now waits outside, lying on the corridor floor with her mother. Nada weighs two kilograms, less than half of what she should weigh,” he added.
This hunger, visible across Gaza, is also preventing injured Palestinians from recovering fully, as two years of war and starvation have taken a toll on their immune systems. And contrary to popular belief, refeeding, as Dr Fyeza pointed out, is not the solution.
“At this time, even if aid enters Gaza, the damage has already been done,” she lamented. Palestinians in the enclave are now at risk of the refeeding syndrome — a metabolic disturbance which occurs as a result of the reintroduction of nutrition in people who are starved, severely malnourished, or metabolically stressed because of severe illness.
If food is introduced too quickly, the doctor explained, it can cause serious complications such as an electrolyte imbalance. This happens because of the ways our bodies change when they are deprived of nutrients. When we begin refeeding, they have to change back, but they may not have the resources they need.
“As the body starves, it makes adaptations to maintain life as long as possible. These adaptations mean that if a severely malnourished person suddenly consumes a large amount of food, it may actually kill them,” the IPC report highlighted. Instead, food needs to be introduced gradually and under medical supervision to ensure that this unfortunate consequence does not happen.
“Even if the food comes back, all the effects, especially those on children and their brain development, cannot be undone,” Dr Fyeza said. When the body experiences repeated cycles of undernutrition, it causes chronic health problems. In adults, they manifest in the form of heart diseases and diabetes.

It is, however, the children who suffer the biggest loss. Those who survive will be more susceptible to anaemia, stunting, and poor immunity. Similarly, babies born to mothers who are malnourished are more likely to be smaller, less healthy, and at higher risk of malnutrition themselves. But most of all, this is an entire generation growing up with less capacity, whether it is physical or cognitive.
“The impacts of famine often ripple across generations: children who survive may face lifelong health and developmental challenges, and their own children may inherit increased vulnerability,” said Rachael of Save the Children. “The physical, mental, and social harms of famine are not only devastating in the moment, but they also shape families, communities, and futures for decades.”
“Children in Gaza are systematically being starved to death. This is a deliberate policy. This is starvation as a method of war in its starkest terms.”
What begins as hunger does not end with it — it seeps into memory, body, even the bloodline. In Gaza, starvation has become a legacy written into the next generation.
 


Hunger as policy
 


“They need to starve […] the moment it becomes hard for them, it will also be hard for Hamas. There is no problem bombing fuel and food reserves,” Israeli Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu said, days before a famine was declared in Gaza. Before him, far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also thundered: “Not even a single grain of wheat will enter the Gaza Strip.”
“[…] we should bomb all their generators. If our hostages don’t have electricity, let them have no electricity … we need to explain to him [President Trump] that this aid goes to Hamas, and Hamas are Nazis, and they shouldn’t be given a single grain of food. Not only [should we] not give them, but [we should] bomb all of their food reserves,” Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir posted on X on March 3, 2025.
It is no longer a secret that Tel Aviv is deliberately starving Palestinians, not just since October 2023, but as a systematic policy for almost two decades now. The question is how.
After Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel placed restrictions on everything entering the enclave through crossings controlled by its military. “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger,” Dov Weisglass, a senior adviser to the then Israeli prime minister had said back then.
Henceforth, Israel began to carefully calculate the amount of food Gaza precisely needed, allowing just that into the enclave. According to files released by the defence ministry two years later, the food calculation had applied the average daily requirement of 2,279 calories per person. An average adult needs 2,500kcal a day.
Even before October 2023, 1.2 million of Gaza’s 2.2 million population was estimated to be facing acute food insecurity, and over 80pc were reliant on humanitarian aid, the Human Rights Watch noted in a report.
Today, Cogat, the Israeli agency that controls aid shipments to Gaza, appears to be following the same policy. The agency’s records show that 319,926 tonnes of aid were allowed into the enclave between March and September, which is insufficient to meet the starving territory’s needs. As per the World Food Programme, Gaza needs more than 62,000 metric tonnes of food every month to cover basic humanitarian needs for its population.
Even if every bag of flour or can of beans were handed out equitably, starvation and hunger in Gaza were inevitable.

In March and April, after Israel resumed attacks on Gaza following the ceasefire violation, the enclave was under a total siege, with no food allowed to enter. By May, Netanyahu succumbed to growing international pressure and allowed only a trickle of aid to enter the Strip, which didn’t prevent but delayed the famine.
Between May and July, a meagre 116,030 tonnes of aid entered Gaza; one-third of the required food never reached the territory. By August, a famine was officially declared. And all of this happened as hundreds of trucks, carrying humanitarian aid sufficient to feed Gaza for three months, waited a few kilometres from the Strip, awaiting Israeli approvals.
“Just outside Gaza, in warehouses — and even within the territory itself — tonnes of food, clean water, medical supplies, shelter items and fuel sit untouched with humanitarian organisations blocked from accessing or delivering them,” said Rachael Cummings of Save the Children.
“The Government of Israel’s restrictions, delays, and fragmentation under its total siege have created chaos, starvation, and death.”

Like a hawk eyeing its prey, Israel has exercised complete control over the aid entering Gaza ever since the beginning of its onslaught on the Strip. A recent analysis of food availability, conducted by the IPC, showed that from October 2023 to December 2024, there was a considerable caloric deficit in the enclave, as only 1,640kcals per person were available every day. By May 2025, this number fell to just 1,400 calories or “67pc of what a human body needs to survive”.
“Before the war, Gaza was receiving about 500 aid trucks daily,” Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson of the Palestine Red Crescent, told Dawn.com. “But the trucks entering the enclave now are in mere dozens, which does not even scratch the surface of its needs.”
“It is a drop in the ocean.”
 


According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, after the resumption of hostilities in March, only 35pc of 1,445 humanitarian missions were facilitated by Israeli authorities, while 810 were impeded or denied. Israel’s recent changes in its policies, requiring all humanitarian trucks to be accompanied by its security escorts, have further impacted humanitarian logistical operations.
The lack of escort capacity has already caused suspensions on some humanitarian supply corridors, while previously authorised items such as nutrition, health, hygiene and water treatment aid face longer delays than food items, noted the IPC report.
Even if aid trucks do manage to cross the rigidly guarded Gaza border, what they carry is rarely ever sufficient to meet the needs of Palestinians. “The goods that come through the crossing are very limited,” said Nour Abu Shammala, a human rights activist and writer in the enclave. “For example, meat of any kind is not allowed in. The reliance remains on canned foods, legumes and cheese.”

“We went through a period where we didn’t have flour or bread … we had to eat rice instead, and we rationed bread carefully to keep some for the next day. At first, breakfast might have been za’atr and olive oil, but even those ran out, so we depended mainly on fava beans,” she recalled.
Other times, the trucks are hijacked and looted or seized by criminal groups supported by Israel to break down civil order in the Strip and prevent aid deliveries, Nour added.

While Palestinians always knew who funded these gangs, mounting evidence has recently surfaced, laying bare Israel’s glaring role in mobilising criminals in Gaza. On June 5, Netanyahu admitted: “The government has activated powerful local clans in the enclave on the advice of security officials.”
Earlier, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that sources in Gaza claimed one such group Bibi referred to consisted of roughly 100 armed men operating with the implicit support of the Israeli military.
The New Humanitarian, a not-for-profit newsroom, described the gangs as “big and very dangerous”. They are especially located in areas where aid is entering or being distributed. “They loot UN trucks, selling the goods at inflated rates — or sometimes the food just disappears altogether … they also steal food directly from other people who risk their lives to get aid from distribution centres.”
What these gangs steal is sold into the market at exorbitant rates; sugar now costs 300 times more than it did before the war, same is the case with flour and beans. As per the IPC report released in August, July food prices in Gaza increased by 25pc to as much as 9,900pc compared to the February ceasefire levels, and by 233pc to 15,285pc compared to the pre-war prices.
The highest fluctuations were seen in wheat flour — which has become both a bane and boon for Palestinians — up to $30 in June and coming back down to around $15 in July.

Qusay Qasem, 22, is among the thousands of Palestinians for whom fetching bread has become a fatal exercise. A resident of North Gaza, which has been declared a combat zone, he has to risk his life every day to secure a piece of bread. But the markets, now merely a remnant of what they used to be before the war, are nearly inaccessible. The IPC has found that Palestinians face extreme challenges reaching markets across the Strip, with 82pc of households in Deir al-Balah Governorate, 76pc in Khan Younis Governorate, 72pc in Gaza Governorate and 66pc in North Gaza Governorate unable to reach markets.
“Instead, I head to aid distribution centres, where bullets pour down on us,” Qasem told Dawn.com. “I have escaped death several times. Yet, I return alive each time because I know my family is waiting for that one sack of flour, that one loaf of bread.”
Bakeries, previously a reliable source of food — particularly bread — for a majority of Palestinians like Qasem, have remained closed since April 2025. Most of them have been bombed, and the undamaged ones are out of reach. Of the 29 bakeries in Gaza, 13 are now in evacuation and militarised zones, while none of the previous bakeries in North Gaza, Rafah, and Khan Younis are accessible due to the movement restrictions imposed by Israel.
Before the war, many Gazans relied on the enclave’s fertile lands for sustenance and livelihood. But two exhausting years of Israeli aggression have snatched that. All that remains is rubble, dust and despair.
According to an assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, Gaza’s agrifood system faces a near-total collapse. About 86pc of cropland has been damaged, with over 91pc land inaccessible to farmers and only 1.5pc of arable land in use. Agriculture previously supplied most of the Strip’s fresh vegetables, eggs and milk. In fact, some of its top exports included strawberries, dates, olives, and flowers.
 
A similar situation persists with livestock, most of which have been killed; only 26pc of sheep and 34pc of goats remain, ceasing the commercial production of poultry, cattle and dairy. With the Israeli ban on access to the sea — the beach that was once a source of solace, laughter and barbeques — over 72pc of fishing assets, including boats, aquaculture, farms and cold storage have been destroyed.
With its 24-month-long aggression in Gaza, Israel has systematically robbed the enclave of its ability to feed itself, forcing Palestinians to now depend almost entirely on irregular food aid and imports. This is not just an erasure of life, but also dignity. And the FAO agrees, explicitly describing Gaza’s crisis as an “entirely man-made catastrophe, driven by access restrictions and bombardment rather than natural causes”.
Families like that of Nour, who still have some financial stability enabling them to purchase food, also face massive hindrances in terms of preparation because of the complete lack of fuel and gas — the latter hasn’t entered the enclave since February 2025. As a result, Gazans must now rely on burning rubbish to light their stoves.
“Staple foods such as lentils and wheat flour, if poorly cooked, are not well digested by the body, reducing its ability to fully absorb and use the nutrients,” the FAO told Dawn.com. Thus, even for households that can sporadically access food, they often lack the means to safely prepare it.
In addition to this, the IPC report highlighted that basic cooking implements continue to be in short supply due to the constant displacement of populations.
Nearly 800,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the end of the ceasefire on March 18, with almost 350,000 since the escalation of May 15 alone. Most of the population has been displaced multiple times across Gaza Governorate, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. Across these governorates, around 20pc or more of the population has been displaced three to six times, with at least 4pc across all three areas displaced seven or more times.

Continued and frequent displacement erodes household capacity to cope as essential assets such as shelter materials, storage items, water, and food may be lost along the journey, especially given the limited notice that people have to evacuate or relocate from approaching hostilities, the report noted.
Before the war, Hani Abufayez was recognised across Gaza as a successful businessman. He ran a consulting office and lived in a villa with his family of eight. Today, he lives in a tent after being displaced not once but at least thrice. “I survive on very little money … my fears grow with each passing day. I fear my family and I could be killed at any moment, or die of hunger.”
“The reality is that Israel has turned Gaza into a death zone where there is no place for life anymore.” It didn’t just rain down bombs on the enclave, but also ran a planned campaign there, using “food and aid as a weapon to humiliate, weaken, displace and kill Palestinians”.
Systems breakdown
The dismantling of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees was a part of this campaign. For decades, Palestinians have relied on the organisation for aid. “It is the only agency with real experience in humanitarian relief,” said Khalil Abu Shama, a human rights defender in Gaza.
“I am considered a part of the third generation of the Nakba of 1948. I completed my primary and preparatory education in UNRWA schools. I grew up witnessing the agency providing its services to refugees in various fields. I completed my studies, and throughout my long career in the field of human rights, there was continuous coordination between us and UNRWA,” he reminisced.
The UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly on December 8, 1949, to provide basic support, including food, healthcare and education to Palestinian refugees, who were displaced during the Nakba. It supports about six million Palestinian refugees, residing both within and outside Palestine, and provides direct services such as schools, health centres and other social services.
Before Israel launched its offensive in Gaza, about a million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were sheltering in UNRWA schools, clinics and other buildings run by the agency. Meanwhile, nearly the entire population of the Strip relied on it for basic necessities, including food, water and hygiene.
“It was our lifeline, both before the war and especially after Oct 7, 2023,” emphasised Shama.
But just the way it did with everything else, Israel deprived Palestinians of this support as well. On January 30, Tel Aviv banned the UNRWA, months after the Israeli parliament passed two bills: one, barring the agency from activity within Israel and the second banning Israeli authorities from any contact with it, essentially breaking a 1967 treaty that allowed the agency to provide services to Palestinian refugees in areas under Israel’s control.
The action was taken after Israel accused 18 UNRWA employees of participating in the Oct 7 attack on Israel. Subsequently, a probe was launched by the UN, which found that nine workers of the agency “may have” been involved in the attack and no longer work for it. But UNRWA has maintained that Israel never presented any evidence supporting its allegations, adding that it regularly provided Tel Aviv with a full list of its staff members.
The agency has also accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, pressurising them into making false confessions about ties with Hamas. But Netanyahu and his government were adamant on dismantling UNRWA, something they have been advocating for a long time. Israel claims that the UN body “perpetuated” the issue of Palestinian refugees because it allows Palestinians to transfer refugee status across generations, which Tel Aviv refuses to accept.
It is also not a mere coincidence that Israel’s allegations came the same day the International Court of Justice ordered it to prevent genocidal acts and scale up aid to Gaza.
Soon after the Israeli allegations were aired, the US became the first country to announce the suspension of funding to the agency. Canada, Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, Japan, Austria and Romania soon followed.
What happened next looks like this: Israel made UNRWA vacate all premises in occupied East Jerusalem, cease its operations by Jan 30, and cut short the validity of all visas for UNRWA’s international staff. Basically, the agency was evicted.
“Stopping the UNRWA’s work and placing obstacles in the way of its continued presence in Palestine — especially in Gaza — is effectively a death sentence for large numbers of refugees who have lost everything, including the ability to secure food,” said Shama.
A month later, in February 2025, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — backed by the very powers accused of engineering the starvation — was born. It promised relief. What it delivered, many in Gaza say, was something else entirely.
The death trap
 


 


Dr Sami Alastal, a writer and political analyst based in Gaza, has lost 20 kilos since October 7, 2023. “We do not have any food, and if it is available, it is in very small quantities,” he rued. Yet, he refuses to visit the GHF aid distribution centres.
“It is a scam,” he said. “It is a killing and torture squad disguised as a humanitarian organisation.”
Dr Sami’s sentiments were echoed by a majority of Palestinians Dawn.com spoke to, who, despite the catastrophic levels of starvation and hunger in the enclave, refuse to visit the GHF-run stations. They see the distribution process as “humiliating to our humanity and dignity”.
 


“We live near the Netzarim area, from where we see people heading to aid distribution sites,” said Nour Abu Shammala, a Palestinian human rights activist. “The process of entry and aid distribution is manipulated by the [Israeli] occupation to create chaos, and so for us it is unacceptable.” She shared how these aid distribution sites were located in areas described as “execution grounds” for civilians.
“I heard about the crimes in Netzarim on television, watched them unfold from my house, but never went there myself.”
Qusay Qasem, who has no choice but to visit the GHF centres, calls them traps. “It is akin to walking into your death … at any time, the Israeli military starts indiscriminately firing at us, there are bullets everywhere,” he recalled. “I have seen fellow aid seekers fall dead or wounded as I duck to the ground.”
But even as bullets rain down on him, the 22-year-old Palestinian strives to reach the gates of the centre, his family’s shrunken faces flashing before his eyes. “I have to do it; they wait for a single piece of bread all day.”

This is exactly how Israel plays its game — it’s either death from guns or death from hunger. Here is how it is done:
The journey begins hours before the aid site is set to open, often in early morning hours. The aid seekers are only allowed to bring their vehicles up to a certain point, which is at least 1.5km (a 12-20 minute walk) from the centre, and then cover the remaining distance on foot. This means that once — and if — they manage to secure sacks or boxes of aid, it must be carried back on foot. As the crowd keeps getting bigger, everyone is glued to their spots — unflinching for fear of losing out — waiting for the go-ahead signal, usually the buzz of drones.
As soon as the signal rings through the now flattened Gaza, the walk begins, and, with that, the fear of death fills the air.
“These centres are heavily guarded by the Israeli military, who encircle them with sniper nests, tanks and drones,” said Khalil Abu Shama. “The Israeli military monitors the movement of the crowd, sometimes opening fire even before the go-ahead signal.”
“Every day between 10 and 50 civilians are killed without any clear explanation as to why, except that the occupation wants to slaughter as many people as possible in Gaza,” he added.
On July 19, Israel killed at least 32 Gazans seeking aid near Rafah. According to an eyewitness, the shooting took place near a GHF aid distribution centre, adding that gunfire erupted from soldiers and tanks “as if they were in a battle with us”. Doctors who treated the wounded said they had severe gunshot wounds to the head and torso. The Israeli military, on the other hand, failed to provide any reason for the live fire.

This is not something new for the Israeli military. They have been targeting aid coming into Gaza since the first month of the war. From October 2023 to 2024, Forensic Architecture has documented more than 322 attacks on aid, including workers and civilians, as well as 22 attacks on convoys transporting aid.
Separately, during March and August this year, 64 incidents of the Israeli army opening fire on aid seekers were reported, of which 25 were around GHF centres, 19 in proximity to aid routes and seven during aid diversion.
The vast majority of these shootings weren’t merely a mistake or misunderstanding. A report by Israeli newspaper Haaretz found that Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at unarmed Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza after being “ordered” to do so by their commanders. “We fire machine guns from tanks and throw grenades,” it quoted one soldier as saying.
Another soldier said that between “one and five people were killed every day” where he was stationed in Gaza. “It’s a killing field,” he added.
One of the authors of the Haaretz report, in an interview with Al Jazeera, said that the Israeli military’s orders to open fire on civilians were part of a method to “control” the aid seekers. “It’s actually a practice of … controlling the crowd by fire, like if you wanted the crowd to run off [from] a place, you shoot them at them, even though you know they are unarmed … You use fire to move people from one point to another,” Nir Hasson said.
It almost translates to making Palestinians move to the tune of Israeli gunshots — not just a violation of their humanity but also of their dignity. “It is deliberate … Israel uses food as a tool of pressure,” Nour, the Palestinian human rights activist, pointed out. Meanwhile, Dr Alastal said: “Israel is using the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to establish a military model of aid distribution wherein food is used as a weapon of war.”
The same was also highlighted in the Forensic Architecture report. It explained how, for years, aid in Gaza was distributed through experienced humanitarian organisations such as the UNRWA, equipped to meet the needs of the enclave’s population. But after the war, just like every living thing in the Gaza Strip, these agencies too came under attack.
Between March 2 and May 29, 2025, no aid was allowed to enter Gaza. During this period, Israel attacked aid warehouses and community kitchens, exacerbating the conditions of starvation. When aid trucks were finally permitted to re-enter Gaza at the end of May, ending the nearly three-month blockade, efforts to deliver supplies to warehouses faced significant challenges. To make matters worse, Cogat announced in July that Israel will gradually permit the entry of goods into the Strip under a new “private commercial sector” mechanism, in a bid to “increase the volume” of aid, while reducing reliance on aid collection by the UN and other international organisations.

Simply put, Israel wanted complete control over the enclave. And this is how it was able to weaponise food distribution, ergo: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Per the FA’s findings, the previous UN-led distribution network in Gaza operated nearly 400 sites, whereas the GHF has only four of what it calls “mega sites”, a majority of which are located in the south, which the UN says is an attempt to relocate Palestinians from the north and depopulate it.
“The military model dismantles the social fabric. In restricting the reach of any form of aid administration to the confines of the four ration stations, this model designates the remainder of the territory as something akin to a governance wilderness.
“In this ungoverned territory, Israel promotes the lawlessness of criminal gangs and proxy forces. The attacks on aid workers, health workers, and community leaders are part of this,” the report noted.
A method of war
In this war, hunger is not incidental — and aid, under the GHF, is not compassionate. A report by the Jewish Voice for Peace lays it bare: from day one, GHF aid sites became kill-zones; “shoot at the crowds to communicate” were the instructions; distribution was concentrated in militarised zones and managed under Israeli oversight.
This is aid designed to humiliate, corral, and control. And so we arrive at the darkest logic: to deliver bread is to own life. Gaza’s hunger cannot be undone by more trucks or rations — it must be undone by undoing the system that made hunger the weapon in the first place.

Starvation in Gaza is not a byproduct of war — it is the method. This isn’t just the story of the last two years — the policy and actions go back two decades. What began as a blockade of goods has become a blockade of existence.
Israel has built a system where food is not distributed but dispensed; where hunger is not a crisis to be solved but a condition to be managed. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the clearest example of this — aid designed not to relieve suffering but to regulate it. Every grain of wheat, every loaf of bread, is counted, rationed, and handed out under watchtowers and rifles.
And still, the Palestinians resist. They refuse to let the act of eating become a performance of gratitude. In their hunger, they assert the one thing Israel cannot occupy — their humanity.
In Gaza today, starvation has a geography, a policy, and an administration. It has checkpoints and drones, and waiting lines. It has signatures and seals. And that is the real tragedy — that the world has watched hunger become a bureaucracy.
History will remember this war not just for the bombs that fell, but for the bread that didn’t.</p><small>2025-10-07 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/07114707df52631.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947200/pm-shehbaz-receives-honorary-phd-in-leadership-governance-from-malaysian-university' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz receives honorary PhD in leadership, governance from Malaysian university</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister She­hbaz Sharif has received an honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy during his visit to Malaysia in recognition of his “outstanding leadership and contributions to nation-building”.
The premier arrived in Malaysia on October 5 for a three-day official visit, during which he snapped up six accords and several trade and bilateral agreements.
According to Malaysian state news agency Bernama, the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) conferred the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Leadership and Governance during a special ceremony held yesterday at its Kuala Lumpur campus.
Dressed in a blue gown on the occasion, PM Shehbaz termed it a “great privilege and honour” to be part of the event and receive the degree from this “great institute of learning”.
He appreciated Queen of Pahang Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah, who is also the IIUM Constitutional Head, for gracing the event.
 






The premier said: “For over four decades, I devoted my humble services to serve the cause of [and] the people of Punjab, the largest province of Pakistan, as their public servant. And now, as the prime minister of Pakistan, and in the line of duty, despite my human failings, I tried my best to serve the people with sincerity of purpose and unwavering commitment.
“I am truly delighted to be associated through this degree of philosophy with one of the most revered seats of learning in the Muslim world and an institution that has championed the integration of knowledge, faith and ethics, and pursuit of excellence,” he added.
The premier expressed the hope that his visit to the varsity would further strengthen the bonds of academic partnership and collaboration between the IIUM and Pakistan’s leading institutions of higher learning.
The prime minister emphasised that leadership was not a privilege but a “sacred trust, amanah, which must be exercised with honesty of purpose, sincerity, justice and transparent accountability before Allah”.
 
 

“History bears testimony that whenever Muslims held firmly to these glorious principles, they not only flourished themselves but also became a source of guidance for humanity around the globe,” PM Shehbaz said.
Highlighting that the Muslim ummah today confronts “formidable challenges [of] conflict, poverty and disunity, he stressed that it was “in these testing times that we need to hold on together to our values and ethics guided by our religion to be able to reclaim our lost place in the comity of nations”.
Addressing the Pahang queen, the premier said Malaysia was blessed with a very young population and noted that “our responsibility as servants and as leaders is to provide them the right platforms to serve the cause of suffering humanity with compassion and with great commitment”.
 






The prime minister read out a few verses of Dr Allama Iqbal and their English version as well. He expressed his wishes for IIUM’s continued success and for a “future of greater unity, brotherhood and very close coordination” for both Pakistan and Malaysia.
In her remarks, the Pahang queen noted that Shehbaz had “served with vision, discipline and compassion” for four decades.
“From your leadership in Punjab to your role as prime minister, you have shown true leadership is not about power but about purpose, about building lives and uplifting communities through education, healthcare and opportunities.”
She highlighted that the Punjab Education Endowment Fund “opened the doors of higher learning to thousands who might never have dreamt of university education”. “That is leadership that touches hearts and transforms futures,” Iskandariah noted.
Recalling that Pakistan was a founding partner of the IIUM, she said Pakistani students and alumni continue to “enrich the university and uphold our shared mission of serving the ummah”.
The Pahang queen also mentioned the Palestine issue, saying “peace on earth and harmony among all mankind” was what “we truly need today with what is happening in Palestine”.
 






In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said it was a “truly humbling experience” to be recognised with the honorary degree.
“With great humility, I accepted this honour on behalf of the people of Pakistan as a symbol of the deep-rooted intellectual and cultural connection as well as people-to-people ties between Pakistan and Malaysia,” he added.
 






In the afternoon, a post on the Pakistani government’s X account said PM Shehbaz had departed for Pakistan after concluding his visit to Malaysia.
 






A day ago, PM Shehbaz and his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim held several meetings during which they resolved to reignite bilateral cooperation and move towards a more aggressive and forward-looking policy, including the possibility of collaboration under the umbrella of the Asean economic bloc.
On the economic side, the premier termed PM Ibrahim’s announcement of the import of Halal meat worth $200 million from Pakistan a “welcome step”.
Gobi Partners shows ‘keen interest’ in Pakistan’s e-commerce sector
Separately, PM Shehbaz held a meeting with a delegation of Malaysian business group Gobi Partners, which “showed keen interest in collaboration in e-commerce and financial technologies in Pakistan”, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
Addressing the delegation, led by Gobi Partners’ co-founder and chair Thomas G. Tsao, the premier highlighted “immense potential” for enhancing cooperation in various economic sectors between the two countries.
 






He welcomed Gobi Partners’ confidence in Pakistan’s startup ecosystem, assuring the delegation that the government was implementing “focused reforms to support startups and early-stage investors” via facilitating investments and providing better access to infrastructure, the report added.
“Mobilising both domestic and international capital is our priority to develop a sustainable startup ecosystem,” he said.
PM Shehbaz highlighted that the fintech, e-commerce, and IT services sectors form “the backbone of Pakistan’s national development strategy”.
The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening economic and trade relations with Malaysia, saying: “The government is fully committed to creating a business-friendly environment and improving the ease of doing business in Pakistan.”
 
 

Referring to the Pakistan-Malaysia Business and Investment Conference held yesterday, PM Shehbaz said such initiatives were a “welcome step towards promoting business-to-business linkages” between the two countries, Radio Pakistan added.
The prime minister noted that the Special Investment Facilitation Council was providing all possible support and facilities to foreign investors.
He highlighted the importance of the digital economy and expressed Pakistan’s readiness to welcome international business groups and investors with an interest in the country’s growing IT, technology, and artificial intelligence sectors.
Malaysia to expand palm oil exports to Pakistan
The premier’s official visit to Malaysia this week, at the invitation of PM Ibrahim, marks his first since he assumed office in 2024.
This was highlighted in a joint statement issued by Pakistan and Malaysia today, posted by the High Commission of Pakistan in Malaysia on X.
“Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1957, Malaysia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan have built a partnership premised on mutual respect and shared values,” the statement said.
 






It further highlighted the commitments of both leaders to strengthening this partnership via bilateral trade and investment, including Malaysia’s decision to import halal meat from Pakistan that was hailed by the prime minister.
In turn, Malaysia expressed its intention to expand palm oil exports to Pakistan in line with increasing demand, according to the statement.
“Both sides also agreed to further deepen the bilateral defence cooperation, particularly in the field of defence science, technology, and industry, through knowledge and technology transfer,” the statement read.
Besides deciding to explore collaboration in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, the two premiers also agreed to enhance tourism promotion and cultural exchanges from both sides.
The leaders acknowledged the importance of sustainable agricultural practices, energy security and healthcare, agreeing to explore joint research and innovation initiatives as well as partnerships in these sectors.
Furthermore, the two sides noted the cooperation on issues within the framework of international organisations, particularly the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. ’
 
 

Both countries reiterated their shared commitment to “strengthening the solidarity of the Muslim Ummah and upholding the true values of Islam”, calling on the international community to combat “all forms of intolerance”, including Islamophobia and xenophobia.
The leaders also discussed threats to peace and security in the region. In this regard, they both reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful and stable Afghanistan, as well as condemning the ongoing genocide in Gaza and reiterating their support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the establishment of a Palestinian state.</p><small>2025-10-07 11:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0712173744abf53.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947192/how-gaza-exposed-the-myth-of-objective-journalism-in-the-face-of-genocide' target='_blank'><strong>How Gaza exposed the myth of ‘objective’ journalism in the face of genocide</strong></a><br><p>“By God, I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest — something I haven’t known in the past eighteen months.”
Final message of Gaza journalist Hossam Shabbat, 23, killed in March by an Israeli airstrike
A journalist is never supposed to be the story. In Gaza, however, the killing of at least 223 media personnel by Israel — from October 7, 2023, to Oct 1 this year — turned them into headlines. Social media shared their names and faces, and mourned the last messages they wrote in anticipation of imminent death, while mainstream media documented the numbers and converted them into bite-sized news for the ease of readers.
In the newsroom, their deaths seemed personal; these were members of our fraternity whom we had never met but relied on their lens and words. Wafa Aludaini was one of them; she wrote for this publication in 2022, titled ‘Killing the truth: Shireen Abu Akleh’s murder is a reminder that Israel will go to any length to silence its critics’.
Aludaini herself was silenced along with her husband, their five-year-old daughter and seven-month-old son on September 29, 2024, when an Israeli airstrike hit their home in Gaza’s Deir Al Balah. My colleague spotted her name in a news report, after which we added her name to the growing list of journalists killed in Israel’s latest and most brutal campaign — one that had all the makings of a genocide from the time it began, but wasn’t referred to as one.
What’s in a genocide
Soon after Hamas’ attack on Oct 7, 2023, and Israel’s immediate onslaught, I remember having discussions with different editors as to when the term “genocide” would apply. As one year passed, we ran the headline: 365 days of genocide on Oct 7, 2024. On Sep 16 this year, a UN commission officially declared Israel’s actions as genocide.
Journalists are not juries or judges; we’re not supposed to hand out sentences or write verdicts. Editorially, we’re supposed to show restraint in using labels or terminologies, and leave these matters to authorities that are tasked to make such deliberations.
Our job is to gather information, as accurately as possible, report on it and offer analysis with the help of experts and people on the ground for consumers of news to make sense of what’s happening.
But Gaza challenged our profession: every action by Israel, such as bombing hospitals and shelters or orchestrating a man-made famine, made us question when journalists are meant to pick a side and when merely reporting is no longer enough.
 
 

As the death toll rose and Israel’s intentions became more and more transparent, Gaza also challenged the legitimacy of the word genocide itself. Polish lawyer Raphäel Lemkin, who coined the word in 1944, made the argument that “the Genocide Convention has a specially great appeal to small nations because each of them can disappear completely under the first genocidal attack”. The Genocide Convention was the first human rights treaty adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1948, and signified the international community’s commitment to ‘never again’ after the atrocities committed during the Second World War.
But all the while the media debated on the timing of using the word, it concurrently broke the news of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, only to follow that up with Hungary withdrawing from the ICC hours after the Israeli leader arrived in Hungary for a state visit. It reported the United States’ declaration on January 7, 2025, that Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) had committed genocide during the country’s civil war, and exactly a month later, on February 7, ran the headline ‘US approves $7.4bn sale of more weapons to Israel used to ravage Gaza’.
For nearly two years, if we don’t count Israel’s action pre-October 7, the law failed the people of Gaza over and over again, and the media documented the world’s helplessness in preventing a genocide from happening — the very first principle of the UN’s ‘Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide’.
In all this time, Palestine’s continued plight has begged the question: what value does a word hold in the face of such hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of international law? Or, more crucially, what good is international law when none of the glaring headlines deterred Israel from carrying out a genocide?
Did journalism fail Gaza?
October 17, 2023, was the first clear signalling of Israel’s intent to wage a deadly war without any concern for civilian casualties: it targeted a UNRWA refugee camp and a hospital. Only 10 days into the war waged by Tel Aviv, the media tried to piece together information coming from both sides, and without actual press vests of their own on the ground.
The New York Times was among the publications that retracted their initial coverage on the Al Ahli Arab Hospital explosion that killed scores of Palestinians. “The Times’ initial accounts attributed the claim of Israeli responsibility to Palestinian officials, and noted that the Israeli military said it was investigating the blast,” read the Times’ editors’ note published on Oct 23 following criticism, adding that the early coverage “relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified”.
 
 

Subsequent investigations into the incident by multiple organisations didn’t offer a conclusion as to whether a failed rocket launch by Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was responsible for the explosion or if it was an Israeli airstrike. I’m not going to go into the details of the investigations (this Forensic Architecture investigation is worth a read), but want to highlight this incident because at the time, I defended the media organisations’ actions since immediate versions of either side cannot be taken at face value in reporting. But the due diligence proved to be limited to this one incident, prompted by the backlash from Israel’s sympathisers.
The overall Western media coverage remained lopsided for the large part, with headlines, including the NYT’s, often declaring that Palestinian civilians were killed but stopping short of saying by whom; news stories using emotive language for Israeli deaths but not for Palestinians’; editors putting ‘Hamas-run’ before all versions of the Palestinian Health Ministry but failing to provide context to Israeli officials’ repeated claims on incidents of civilian deaths; and media organisations silencing journalists who advocated the rights of Palestinians.
Among the journalists silenced was Mehdi Hasan, whose show was cancelled by American cable news channel MSNBC. While Hasan chose not to speak candidly on the matter, the cancellation was linked by media and lawmakers alike to his opinions about the atrocities in Palestine.
Perhaps the biggest betrayal of the fraternity was the lack of outrage by these media organisations at the deaths of Palestinian journalists. The due diligence exhibited during the Al Ahli Arab Hospital bombing wasn’t exercised in these instances, such as when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the five Gaza journalists — targeted in a Quds Today van parked outside a hospital, where the wife of one of the journalists was about to give birth — were “Islamic Jihad operatives posing as journalists”. No further investigations took place into these claims despite systematic campaigns by Israel in place to defame and threaten these journalists, as detailed by Reporters Without Borders.
“There have been few media campaigns or statements of solidarity with Palestinian journalists — compared with similar efforts around […] other western correspondents targeted by US adversaries,” wrote Mohamad Bazzi for The Guardian, noting that “press freedom and protection from persecution, it seems, are limited to western journalists”.
On August 10, 28-year-old Al Jazeera journalist Anas al Sharif was killed alongside four of his colleagues in an Israeli airstrike that targeted a press tent outside a hospital in Gaza. Less than a month before his death, the Committee to Protect Journalists had said it was “gravely worried” about the safety of Sharif, highlighting that he was being “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign, which he believes is a precursor to his assassination”. Yet, the threats to his life and Israel’s pattern got little to no attention in the Western media, despite hundreds of Palestinian journalists already killed by Israel up to that point. Eleven days after his death, the NYT published an opinion piece with an honest, matter-of-fact headline: ‘He was the face and voice of Gaza. Israel assassinated him.’
Sharif, in the message he prepared for his death, had pleaded “not to let chains silence you”. Perhaps his end was what was needed for the media to start speaking up for him.

How Gaza gave new meaning to/redefined journalism
Despite the often skewed media coverage, Gaza has shifted the tide of public perception. During the course of the onslaught on Gaza, the media also reported on barriers breaking; the barrier to acknowledging that the destruction was not a result of Oct 7 but had been going on for decades, barriers on Gaza being a regional topic and turning into a global protest movement, and barriers of diplomacy which prevented countries from calling out Tel Aviv’s nefarious plans and accepting the Palestinian state.
We also witnessed barriers guarding media hegemony break; with organisations such as the BBC, once considered credible and honest, coming under intense scrutiny for its evasive framing and questionable editorial judgments. And when the same organisation pulled a documentary on Gaza, it created space for others to step in.
The documentary, titled Gaza: Doctors Under Attack, was subsequently streamed by Zeteo, a news platform launched by Mehdi Hasan after he exited MSNBC, after it was dropped by the BBC. Hasan, along with his team of diverse contributors, from Fatima Bhutto and Bassem Youssef to Cynthia Nixon and Greta Thunberg, positioned Zeteo as a leading platform to talk about Palestine without tiptoeing around Israel’s actions.
Meanwhile, Israeli TV continued its propaganda on the IDF’s so-called operations but Haaretz, the country’s left-leaning and oldest newspaper, still managed to publish some pieces critical of the government, repeatedly calling attention to Benjamin Netanyahu’s tactics of keeping the hostages where they were to be able to pursue his rampage. In the Middle East, where the media is highly controlled by the Gulf states’ official policies, The National pushed the envelope in trying to expose the full scale of Israel’s genocidal acts.
The main source of information, however, remained the brave men and women of Gaza who recorded videos and accounts of the unfolding horror and shared them with the world in real time through social media. People across the world turned to their accounts, followed their stories and came to trust them in the absence of original — and often fair — reporting across mainstream media. Inside newsrooms, they served as inspiration through their commitment in the face of some of the worst atrocities modern history has witnessed. They made journalists like myself question what our profession stands for and how we can use it to amplify their voices to end a genocide which has made us feel helpless at many junctures.
 


“I have seen my colleagues break down and cry at how we’re covering the war,” a peer in BBC London told me in December 2024. I shared how I’ve seen my colleagues tear up at the sheer horror of the information and photos coming out of Gaza. The genocide has been difficult and challenging to cover, to say the least. Footage of parents first retrieving bodies of their children from underneath rubble only to bury them, people moving to ‘safe zones’ and then being bombed, unarmed citizens being burnt alive in tents or killed while out to collect food, doctors breaking down at their helplessness to save lives or even have the equipment to do so — sifting through these footages and information has been heavy on the heart and mind.
But none of this comes even remotely close to the pain and suffering of the people living through a genocide and reporting on it.
And so, I won’t end this piece on the toll it has taken on journalists to cover two years of this genocide. Because a journalist is never meant to become the story — unless you are a journalist in Gaza staring at death and writing your final message.</p><small>2025-10-07 10:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/071326324da2ba0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947213/dg-ispr-says-chinese-weapon-systems-performed-exceptionally-well-during-may-conflict-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR says Chinese weapon systems performed ‘exceptionally well’ during May conflict with India</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that Chinese weapon systems deployed during Pakistan’s four-day military conflict with India in May performed “exceptionally well”.
During the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar reportedly said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) used Chinese J-10C jets in its response to India’s May 7 attack. A report by The Guardian had noted that Pakistan deploying J-10Cs would “mark the first time the Chinese planes — and the PL-15 missiles they were carrying — have been used in combat anywhere in the world”.
In May, China had expressed ignorance about the use of its jets, saying it was “not familiar with the matter”. In July, however, the Chinese air chief commended the PAF’s “exemplary performance” in the May conflict.
In an interview with Bloomberg, which was held last week and published yesterday, Lt Gen Chaudhry said: “Of course lately, recent Chinese platforms, they’ve demonstrated exceptionally well.”
 






“We are open to all sorts of technology,” he added.
Lt Gen Chaudhry was quoted as saying that Pakistan had recently raised its tally of Indian aircraft shot down to seven — up from a previous count of six.
Recently, United States President Donald Trump also described how he confronted both nations during an active war that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.
The DG ISPR also refuted Indian claims of Pakistan losing any planes.
“Pakistan has never tried to play with figures and facts,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.
Pakistan said it downed six Indian jets in retaliation in May, including the French-made Rafale.
India’s highest-ranking general has acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
“The conflict marked the largest battlefield deployment of Chinese weaponry in recent history, with the J-10C as well as the PL-15 air-to-air missile seeing live documented fighting for the first time,” Bloomberg stated.
During the escalation, shares of Chinese defence-manufacturing companies rallied as tensions between India and Pakistan boosted the outlook for mainland exporters.
 
 

After the Indian political and military leadership made aggressive statements last week, repeating its terrorism allegations — which Pakistan has repeatedly refuted — the Pakistani military warned on Saturday that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation”.
A day later, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said India faced a “decisive defeat with a score of 6-0” in the May escalation, and “if they try again [to go to fight], God willing, the score will be much better than the last time”.
The May conflict was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
Pakistan had said it downed six Indian planes after the latter carried out deadly attacks in Punjab and Azad Kashmir. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p><small>2025-10-07 10:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/071408065efb64b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947218/dar-says-ex-senator-mushtaq-safely-with-pakistan-embassy-in-amman-in-good-health-and-high-spirits' target='_blank'><strong>Dar says ex-senator Mushtaq safely with Pakistan embassy in Amman, in ‘good health and high spirits’</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Tuesday that former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had arrived at the Pakistan embassy in Amman, Jordan and was in “good health and high spirits”.
Mushtaq led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them.
In a post on social media platform X, Dar said, “I am pleased to confirm that former Senator Mushtaq has been released and is now safely with [the] Pakistan embassy in Amman. He is in good health and high spirits.”
He said that the embassy stood ready to facilitate his return to Pakistan at his wish.
“[I] am pleased to extend our gratitude to all our friendly countries who actively engaged and assisted in this behalf,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, Mushtaq also posted a video on his X account in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over.
“I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention.
“During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said.
He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down.
“We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted.
He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.
 






On Sunday, the Foreign Office (FO) said it was actively engaged with international partners to ensure the “safety and prompt repatriation“ of Pakistanis detained by Israel. With regards to Mushtaq, it had stated: “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.”
On Monday, FO reiterated that it was making efforts for the safe return of the former senator.
“With the invaluable assistance of the Jordanian government, we are hopeful that the process can be successfully concluded within the next couple of days,” the FO had said. It had also expressed deep gratitude to the “brotherly” government of Jordan for “their exemplary cooperation and generous support”.
Pakistan and several other countries had condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the GSF. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also called for the release of those detained by Israel.
On Oct 3, he had assured JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman during a telephone conversation that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including Mushtaq.</p><small>2025-10-07 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/071226252fe1368.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947205/7-injured-after-blast-derails-4-jaffar-express-bogies-in-sindhs-shikarpur' target='_blank'><strong>7 injured after blast derails 4 Jaffar Express bogies in Sindh’s Shikarpur</strong></a><br><p>At least seven people were injured on Tuesday after a blast on a railway track derailed four bogies of the Jaf­far Express in Sindh’s Shikarpur district, according to officials.
With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Shikarpur Deputy Commissioner Shakeel Abro said, “A blast had occurred on the train tracks at 8:15am. The incident occurred at a distance of 1km from the Sultan Kot railway station.”
He said that the blast had caused the derailment of four bogies. Abro said that seven people had been injured, out of which four had been taken to the Combined Military Hospital, while the remaining three had been taken to the Civil Hospital in Shikarpur.
He said that the Jaffar Express train was bound for Quetta via Jacobabad.
Sukkur Deputy Divisional Superintendent Syed Moalim said that the blast occurred while the train was moving on the track. He said that a crane was being brought by railway officials to put the derailed bogies back on the track.
Sukkur Divisional Transport Officer (DTO) Mohsin Ali Sial told Dawn.com that “passengers were being taken to nearby stations so that work could commence on repairing the track.”
Shikarpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Shahzeb Chachar added that the remaining bogies had proceeded toward Jacobabad. He said that the blast had targeted a single track used by trains going to and from Quetta via Jacobabad.
He maintained that police in Jacobabad and Shikarpur were trying to trace the culprits responsible for the incident.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah condemned the incident. According to Radio Pakistan, Shah sought a report of the incident from the Sindh police inspector general.
He also directed the Larkana commissioner to provide medical assistance to the injured passengers.
In August, no loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express. The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung’s Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station with 350 passengers on board.
The incident came just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.</p><small>2025-10-07 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/07140725c0f1f14.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947214/pakistan-reaffirms-commitment-to-a-stable-afghanistan-in-quadrilateral-meeting-with-russia-iran-and-china' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan reaffirms commitment to a ‘stable’ Afghanistan in quadrilateral meeting with Russia, Iran, and China</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Tuesday, along with China, Russia, and Iran, reaffirmed its commitment to a “stable and peaceful” Afghanistan, while also voicing concern over the “presence of terrorists” in the country at a quadrilateral meeting held in Moscow.
The development comes against the backdrop of the 7th meeting of the Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan, where countries including India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are set to participate to discuss matters related to Afghanistan, as per the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website.
The meeting will be held later today.
In a post on X, Pakistan’s special envoy to Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq Khan, who is currently in Russia, detailed the discussions that took place during the quadilateral meeting, saying, “The participating states unanimously reaffirmed their steadfast commitment to a stable, sovereign, and peaceful Afghanistan, underscoring the necessity of a country free from the scourge of terrorism and external intervention.”
Voicing their concerns over the terrorist groups present in Afghanistan, the envoy went on to say that the participating countries agreed on “enhanced coordination and collaborative action” to fight against terrorism in the region.
 






Separately, Khan, in different meetings with his Chinese and Iranian counterparts, discussed regional security, counterterrorism cooperation, as well as humanitarian concerns in Afghanistan.
With his Iranian counterpart Muhammad Reza Bahrami, Khan held “ in-depth discussions on the latest developments in Afghanistan“, particularly terrorism, as per a statement posted on his X.
“Both sides emphasised the importance of continued dialogue and coordination to address common challenges,” he added.
 






Meanwhile, in a meeting with China’s Yue Xiaoyong, both countries underscored the “importance of a coordinated approach to promote lasting peace and stability in the region,” as per a statement posted on his X.
“The meeting underscored the strong partnership between Pakistan and China in addressing shared challenges and advancing regional development,” he added.
 






The envoy also held discussions with his Russian counterpart, Zamir Kabulov, focusing on measures to promote regional cooperation in Afghanistan.
 






Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan
At today’s meeting, Afghanistan will be represented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Amir Khan Muttaqi, who left for Moscow on Monday.
The deputy spokesperson for the Afghan foreign minister, Hafiz Zia Takkal, said in a statement that “this marks the first time the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’s foreign minister is participating in the Moscow Format as an official member.”
In July, Russia became the first country to formally recognise the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
According to Takkal, Afghan FM Muttaqi is “expected to present Afghanistan’s position on enhancing relations between Afghanistan & the broader region.”
Muttaqi is also expected to hold a separate meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the event, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.
Their discussions will focus on current issues of bilateral cooperation, she said, adding that the meeting will be held behind closed doors.
“Priority will be given to promoting Afghan national reconciliation and expanding practical cooperation between regional states and Kabul in the political, economic, counter-terrorism, and anti-drug fields,“ she said.
In previous meetings, the Moscow Format Consultations have urged the Afghan government to take “viable and verifiable actions in fulfilling the international obligations and commitments made by Afghanistan to fight terrorism, dismantle and eliminate all terrorist groups equally and non-discriminatory and prevent the use of Afghan territory against its neighbours”.
Pakistan is an active member of the Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan. It has been a part of the format since 2016, when it first began.</p><small>2025-10-07 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/07134030b567fe6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947197/26th-amendment-case-sc-constitutional-bench-approves-live-streaming-of-proceedings' target='_blank'><strong>26th Amendment case: SC Constitutional Bench approves live streaming of proceedings</strong></a><br><p>An eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) approved on Tuesday a set of requests seeking the live streaming of proceedings on pleas challenging the 26th Amendment.
The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy.
It took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered the prime minister to appoint the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that led to its establishment.
 
 

It has been challenged by various high court bar associations, the PTI and others.
A CB headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprises Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan resumed hearing the set of pleas today, which were last taken up on January 27.
Today’s hearing
During today’s hearing, three matters were primarily discussed — the constitution of a full court to hear the pleas against the 26th Amendment, objections to the CB and live streaming of the proceedings.
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Aminuddin Khan said the bench would first hear arguments on requests for a full court hearing on the pleas and objections to CB. “We will decide on the matter of live streaming (of court proceedings) later,” he added.
At that, lawyer Khawaja Ahmad Hassan argued that arguments on pleas seeking a full court hearing should be live-streamed so that the public was also made aware of the grounds on which the request was being made. He then urged the court to first hear arguments on requests for streaming the proceedings live.
Justice Aminuddin Khan remarked that matters of the bench were of relevance to the court, not the public. He asserted that the court would first take up the matter regarding the constitution of a full court.
At one point during the hearing, he said, “Things have to be managed. All of us are serving the public, we are all fulfilling our responsibilities. This is a big case, we will proceed on this in an orderly manner.”
The counsel for Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan Vice Chairperson Mustafa Khokhar, Shahid Jameel, informed the court that the SC registrar had raised objections over his client’s plea for a full court hearing.
“We filed an appeal against the objections,” he said, requesting the court to first decide Khokhar’s appeal. He further said that his client had also raised objections over the CB and urged the court to hear it along with the other petitions.
After consultation among the judges, Khokhar’s petition was allotted a number.
The lawyer representing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government also presented arguments for a full court hearing of pleas.
He clarified that they did not have any objection regarding any of the members of the existing eight-judge CB but wanted a full court to hear the pleas.
During his arguments, Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed contended that every citizen had the right to information. However, neither was the draft of the 26th Amendment made public nor was there a public debate on it, he argued.
He then argued that at least proceedings should be live-streamed for public viewing.
He recalled that the 26th Amendment was approved by parliament “in the darkness of the night”, adding that previously court proceedings had also been streamed live, including those in Zulfikar Bhutto case and the case pertaining to the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act.
He said senior advocate of the SC Makhdoom Ali Khan had declared the 26th Amendment case the “constitutional case of the century”, arguing that a full court or a full CB should hear the case.
 
 

Following his arguments, Justice Afghan enquired, “So you want that apart from the proceedings taking place in broad daylight, they should also be live-streamed?”
To that, Barrister Ahmed said, “The Amendment was passed in the darkness of the night. That is why facts must be revealed to the public.”
Following that, the bench reserved its decision on requests seeking live streaming of the proceedings.
During the hearing, Justice Malik also asked Additional Attorney General Amir Rehman about the government’s stance on the live streaming of court proceedings.
To that, Rehman said the matter was administrative.
“So you will agree with whatever the bench decides?” asked Justice Mazhar.
Eventually, the court approved the requests for live streaming the case’s proceedings and adjourned the hearing till 11.30am tomorrow (Wednesday).
The petitions
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary which is a salient feature of the Constitution: namely the provisions for annual performance evaluation of judges of the high court by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the chief justice of Pakistan being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches of the apex court and high courts.
As a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) (Amendment) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an unconstitutional amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.
The petitioners also requested the SC for a full court hearing of the pleas instead of a hearing by the CB, which was established under the 26th Amendment.
‘Opportunity lost’
Between January and now, there have been multiple calls for a full court hearing of these pleas.
On August 14, two responses from Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi were uploaded on the court’s website, explaining why he had disregarded a decision made last year by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full SC.
The committee, which met on Oct 31, 2024, under the Practice and Procedure Act (PPA) 2023, was convened by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. In response, CJP Afridi, who chairs the committee, said he did not find it appropriate to call for a full court hearing.
The CJP had argued that such a move would undermine the much-needed spirit of collegiality among judges and expose the apex court to public comment, which, he noted, had regrettably been the case in the recent past.
On Aug 20, Justices Shah and Akhtar wrote a joint letter to the CJP, following the SC decision to make public the Oct 31 committee’s minutes.
In their joint letter, Justice Shah and Justice Akhtar observed: “The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending and a golden opportunity to decide them at the earliest instance before the institution as a whole — i.e. the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably.”</p><small>2025-10-07 08:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/07113832be47d1a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947201/pti-activist-sanam-javed-allegedly-abducted-from-peshawar-fir' target='_blank'><strong>PTI activist Sanam Javed allegedly ‘abducted’ from Peshawar: FIR</strong></a><br><p>The Peshawar police on Tuesday filed a case over the alleged abduction of PTI activist Sanam Javed near the Civil Officers’ mess in the provincial capital.
The first information report (FIR), seen by Dawn.com, was filed by Javed’s friend Hira Babar at Peshawar’s Sharqi police station in the early hours of Tuesday.
Babar claimed in the FIR that she and the PTI activist were heading back after having dinner together on Monday during the latter’s visit to the city when the “abduction” took place.
“Around 10:40pm, we were blocked by a green Vigo while we were heading back after having a dinner outside. We tried to turn back but a white car appeared from behind to intercept us,” she told the police.
“Five men got out and attempted to force Sanam into their car. At this point, we started shouting for help, but the people in the surroundings, which included officers and security personnel, did not intervene,” she said.
“The car took her towards the Red Zone,” Babar claimed.
The FIR was filed under Section 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent to secretly and wrongfully confine person) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Taking notice of the incident, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s spokesperson said that “CM Ali Amin Gandapur has ordered an investigation into the incident,” vowing to arrest those responsible.
“The culprits will be severely punished,” he said, adding that the government was utilising all its resources to find the perpetrators.
Meanwhile, the PTI, in a post on X, decried the alleged abduction as “shameful and deeply disturbing”.
The party maintained that “such actions are a blatant violation of basic human rights and dignity, and they highlight the urgent need for accountability and justice.”
 






Last night, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram had claimed on X that Javed was “pulled out of her car and taken away in front of her friends”.
 






Javed has previously been named in several cases, including over a dozen May 9 cases for which she was incarcerated for a year until the Islamabad High Court (IHC) ordered her release last year in July.
More recently, the activist was again arrested earlier this year for holding a rally and blocking the road outside Aiwan-i-Adl, alongside other PTI members. On May 20, she was booked in a case regarding derogatory posts on social media against the heads of state institutions.
Last month, her sister Falak Javed was arrested by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in a case pertaining to the fake videos of Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari being uploaded on social media.</p><small>2025-10-07 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/07103828fc33288.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946976/death-displacement-and-despair-2-years-of-israels-brazen-onslaught-on-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Death, displacement and despair — 2 years of Israel’s brazen onslaught on Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Two years ago today, Palestinian resistance group Hamas launched a surprise operation against Israel. In response, Tel Aviv announced a total blockade of the Gaza Strip, and launched a military campaign which has since decimated the Palestinian enclave and claimed more than 67,000 lives.
Here is a timeline of key events in the conflict over the past two years.
October 2023
Palestinian group Hamas launched Operation Al-Aqsa Flood inside Israel, combining gunmen breaching security barriers and a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza at dawn during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, killing 1,163 people and taking more than 240 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.
Two days later, Israel announced a total blockade of the Gaza Strip. “We are putting a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no gas — it’s all closed,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a video statement.
Israel’s military also launched a series of air raids on Gaza as Gallant warned Hamas that it made a “grave mistake”.
“Citizens of Israel, we are at war. The enemy will pay an unprecedented price,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video message from military headquarters in Tel Aviv.
Subsequently, Lebanon’s fighter group Hezbollah also began cross-border shelling attacks against Israel that would continue throughout the conflict, drawing Israeli counter-strikes.
November 2023
After 47 days of continuous bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling siege, Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day truce.
Under the deal, 50 women, children and teenagers under the age of 19 taken hostage by Hamas could be freed in return for 150 Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli detention. The deal included an agreement to allow more emergency aid and fuel into the Palestinian territory.
Israel said it was willing to extend the pause beyond the four-day period, adding a day for every 10 additional hostages released by Hamas, Al Jazeera reported.
Eventually, the ceasefire was extended for a total of one week, resulting in the release of 105 hostages and approximately 240 Palestinian detainees. However, the ceasefire collapsed on Dec 1, leading to a resumption of hostilities.

December 2023
A New York Times investigation showed Israel routinely used “one of its biggest and most destructive bombs in areas it designated safe for civilians”.
The video investigation focused on the “use of 2,000-pound bombs in an area of southern Gaza where Israel had ordered civilians to move for safety”.
 


“While bombs of that size are used by several Western militaries, munitions experts say they are almost never dropped by US forces in densely populated areas anymore,” the report stated.
According to the report, in response to questions about the bomb’s use in south Gaza, an Israeli military spokesman said in a statement to that Israel’s priority was destroying Hamas and “questions of this kind will be looked into at a later stage”.

January 2024
On January 29, 2024, six-year-old Hind Rajab was killed in Gaza City alongside five relatives after an Israeli tank targeted their family car near a roundabout in the city’s Tal al-Hawa suburb. Two medics, dispatched to look for them, were also found dead.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) reported that Hind had placed a desperate, hours-long phone call from the car, trapped with the bodies of her family.
Hind’s story gained prominence when a phone recording of what’s now understood to be her and her family’s final moments went viral on social media and drew widespread condemnation as she became one of most high profile victims of the conflict.
A docudrama by French-Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania about Hind’s story also won the Silver Lion prize at the 2025 Venice Film Festival.
Hind’s death also came the same month that deaths in Gaza crossed the 25,000 mark.

February 2024
After weeks of diplomacy led by the United States and mediated by Qatar and Egypt, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu rejected a Hamas counter-offer for a ceasefire in Gaza on Feb 7. “Delusional” was the word he used to describe the terms of the offer.
In the following months, Washington and other mediators pushed hard for a ceasefire, one in time for the start of Ramazan.
But a deadlock persisted as Hamas said it would agree to a truce and release of hostages only if the proposal ended with an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel, on the other hand, maintained that it would not pull out until the Palestinian group was eradicated.
The same month, Israel also raided Nasser Hospital. Israel claimed the raid was based on information that Hamas fighters were hiding and had kept hostages in the facility, claims which the group termed as “lies”.
Further, at least 112 Palestinians were killed and more than 750 wounded after Israeli troops opened fire on hundreds waiting for food aid southwest of Gaza City. Palestinian authorities said the incident took place on al-Rashid Street at the Nabulsi Roundabout on the southwestern side of Gaza City.
As Israeli military action continued in Gaza, the US — for the third time since Oct 7 — exercised its veto power to block an Arab resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.

March 2024
Israel’s military spokesman said Hamas deputy military commander Marwan Issa was killed earlier in March 2024 in an Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip. However, a senior Hamas official said that the group’s political bureau had not received evidence regarding the death of Issa. Hamas only confirmed his death months after the airstrike.
Also in March, the UN Security Council finally passed a resolution, demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza during Ramazan, an unconditional release of prisoners, and urgent expansion of aid into the besieged Palestinian enclave. The decision came after last-minute discussions within the council successfully avoided another potential veto. The draft resolution was passed, be­c­ause the US did not use its veto and abst­a­ined.
However, deadly fighting raged on in Gaza as hopes of a ceasefire before the holy month of Ramazan were dashed. As Ramazan began, then-US president Joe Biden pledged international efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to the enclave and committed to working tirelessly for an immediate six-week ceasefire. The UN chief, on the other hand, urged all parties to “honour the spirit of Ramazan by silencing the guns”.

April 2024
A two-week Israeli assault on Al Shifa hospital complex, Gaza’s largest medical facility, ended on April 1. Israel claimed to have killed hundreds of fighters and arrested just as many. However, the medical staff at Al Shifa and Hamas denied allegations that fighters were present at the facility, adding that several civilians were killed while medics and patients were rounded up.
Separately, an Israeli attack in northern Gaza killed three sons of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh as Israel continued its bombardment of the besieged enclave on Eidul Fitr. In an interview with Al Jazeera Arabic, Haniyeh confirmed the killing of his children Hazem, Amir and Mohammad along with a number of his grandchildren.
During the month, Israel also struck a World Central Kitchen (WCK) convoy and killed seven aid workers — citizens of Australia, Britain and Poland as well as Palestinians and a dual citizen of the United States and Canada — of the charity, drawing a global outcry. According to a report by Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israel had targeted the convoy travelling on a “pre-approved route” three times.
Meanwhile, the UN Human Rights Council demanded a halt in all arms sales to Israel, highlighting warnings of “genocide” in its aggression in Gaza.
May 2024
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) called on Israel to end its operation in Rafah, the southernmost town in Gaza. Judges at the top United Nations court ordered Israel to withdraw from the enclave, in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide, citing “immense risk” to the Palestinian population.
At the same time, the death toll from Israel’s military offensive crossed 35,000 as Israel’s forces pushed further into north and south corners of the besieged enclave.
Meanwhile, in a joint declaration, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) called upon the global powers to help stop the genocide being committed by Israel against the Palestinian people by implementing an immediate ceasefire and ensure an urgent supply of aid to Gaza.
During this month, Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognised the Palestinian state, a move that was slammed by Israel as a “reward” for Hamas.
June 2024
The United Nations’ first in-depth investigation into events since October 7, 2023, concluded that Israeli authorities were responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity during military operations in Gaza. In its report, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel also found that Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes in Israel.
Also in June, the United Nations Security Council adopted a US-drafted resolution supporting a ceasefire plan.

July 2024
At least 12 people were killed and 30 others wounded in a rocket attack on a football pitch in Majdal Shams, in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s military spokesman, Daniel Hagari, accused the Lebanese group Hezbollah of carrying out the strike, but the group denied any involvement.
The following day, Israel said it launched a series of airstrikes across Lebanon, blaming Hezbollah for the attack. Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the incident as crossing a “red line,” raising fears of wider regional escalation.
Later that month, Hamas’s political chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran’s capital, Tehran, according to a statement from the Hamas, which blamed Israel for his killing. Haniyeh and one of his bodyguards were killed after the building where they were staying was struck, the statement said.

August 2024
Hamas named Yahya Sinwar as Haniyeh’s successor. Meanwhile, Iran stated that it did not seek to increase Middle East tensions, adding that its response to Haniyeh’s killing would be “definite and calculated”
September 2024
At least nine people were killed and about 2,750 wounded by exploding handheld pagers across Lebanon. Lebanon’s Hezbollah blamed Israel for the spree of pager blasts, saying it will get “its fair punishment”, Al Jazeera reported, citing a statement released by the Iran-backed group. But there was no comment from the Israeli military.
During this time, Yemen’s Houthis attacked central Israel with a hypersonic ballistic missile. While Israel’s military claimed the missile fell in an open area and nobody was hurt, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said the Houthi rebels will pay a “heavy price” for the strike.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman asserted that the kingdom would not establish ties with Israel until a Palestinian state was created.
October 2024
Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel on the first day of the month in retaliation to the latter’s campaign against Tehran’s Hezbollah allies in Lebanon and the killing of its chief and that of Hamas. Reports said between 150 and 200 missiles had been fired in the attack. Israel vowed to retaliate with an army spokesman saying it would respond at the time and place of its choosing.
As the Israeli army intensified shelling of northern Gaza and closed roads, preventing the delivery of aid, the death toll crossed the 43,000 mark. During this time, the US also warned Israel to take steps to improve the humanitarian situation or face potential restrictions on military aid.
Israeli forces also killed Hamas political and military leader Yahya Sinwar in the Palestinian enclave. Western leaders said his death offered an opportunity for the war to end, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it would go on.

November 2024
The UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, together with a former Hamas commander, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Judges on the ICC said there were reasonable grounds that the three men bore “criminal responsibility” for the alleged crimes committed from at least October 8, 2023 until at least May 20, 2024 — the day the prosecution filed the applications for warrants of arrest — the Court said in a press release.
During this time, a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah came into effect after both sides accepted an agreement brokered by the US and France.

December 2024
A report by international human rights organisation Amnesty International said there is “sufficient basis to conclude that Israel has committed and is continuing to commit genocide against Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip”.
Titled ‘You Feel Like You Are Subhuman’: Israel’s Genocide Against Palestinians in Gaza, the report documented how, during its military offensive launched in “the wake of the deadly Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, Israel has unleashed hell and destruction on Palestinians in Gaza brazenly, continuously and with total impunity.”
A separate report by the Human Rights Watch stated that Israel was committing “acts of genocide” in the Gaza Strip by damaging water infrastructure and cutting off supplies to civilians.
“Since October 2023, Israeli authorities have deliberately obstructed Palestinians’ access to the adequate amount of water required for survival in the Gaza Strip,” the report said.
The UN General Assembly also called on Israel to withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories and pushed for the creation of a Palestinian state, convening an international conference in June to try to jump-start a two-state solution. In a resolution passed by a 157-8 vote, with the United States and Israel among those voting ‘no’ and seven abstentions, the Assembly expressed “unwavering support, in accordance with international law, for the two-state solution of Israel and Palestine”.
Meanwhile, Israeli newspaper Haaretz, citing unnamed soldiers serving in Gaza, described indiscriminate killings of Palestinian civilians in the territory’s Netzarim Corridor, prompting a firm rejection on Friday from the Israeli military.

January 2025
Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal to halt fighting in Gaza and exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The agreement followed months of on-off negotiations brokered by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, with the backing of the United States, and came just ahead of the January 20 inauguration of Donald Trump.
Meanwhile, Israel said it would cease all contact with the UN’s Palestinian relief agency UNRWA and any other body acting on its behalf, after repeatedly accusing the organisation of undermining its security.
February 2025
US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court and its staff, saying “the ICC has, without a legitimate basis, asserted jurisdiction over and opened preliminary investigations concerning personnel of the United States and certain of its allies, including Israel, and has further abused its power by issuing baseless arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant”.
Dozens of countries expressed “unwavering support” for the ICC following the development. “We reaffirm our continued and unwavering support for the independence, impartiality and integrity of the ICC,” a group of almost 80 countries had said in a joint statement.
Meanwhile, Trump — in a shock announcement — said the US would take over the war-ravaged Gaza Strip and develop it economically after Palestinians were resettled elsewhere. He also shared a video which showed AI-generated renditions of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu sipping cocktails in swimsuits by a pool, while other shots showed Elon Musk dancing under a shower of cash on the beach.
March 2025
After two months of relative calm, Israel resumed its offensive, killing more than 400 people in overnight attacks and launching air raids as US President Trump fully supported the deadly operations in the Palestinian enclave.
Arab leaders also adopted an Egyptian reconstruction plan for Gaza  that would cost $53 billion and avoid resettling Palestinians, in contrast to Trump’s “Middle East Riviera” vision. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi said that the proposal had been accepted at the closing of a summit in Cairo.
Meanwhile, a United Nations investigation concluded that Israel carried out “genocidal” acts in Gaza through the systematic destruction of sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities.
The UN Commission of Inquiry said Israel had “intentionally attacked and destroyed” the Palestinian territory’s main fertility centre, and had simultaneously imposed a siege and blocked aid including medication for ensuring safe pregnancies, deliveries and neonatal care.

April 2025
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that the military was “dissecting” the Gaza Strip and seizing territory to pressure Hamas into freeing prisoners still held in the territory. Israel began seizing the area it called the Morag Axis, in southern Gaza on April 2, forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee Rafah that borders Egypt to the south.
US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also said that new negotiations were in the works aimed at getting more hostages released from Hamas captivity in Gaza.
Meanwhile, the remains of 15 people, including a UN worker and medics working for the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), were found in a mass grave, prompting outrage and condemnation. According to the Guardian, some of the bodies were found with their hands or legs tied and had gunshot wounds to the head and chest, according to two witnesses.
May 2025
The ICJ concluded public hearings into what Israel’s obligations are regarding allowing United Nations agencies and other relief groups to work in the Palestinian territory it occupies.
During this time, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that it would “take control” of the whole of Gaza. As Israel ramped up its military offensive, United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said “Palestinians in Gaza were enduring what may be the cruelest phase of this cruel conflict” after dozens of community kitchens in Gaza shut their doors due to a lack of supplies.
The starvation in Gaza also came into sharper focus as the UN called Gaza “the hungriest place on Earth” and warned that the Palestinian territory’s entire population was now at risk of famine. The World Food Programme also said that more than 70,000 children in Gaza were facing acute levels of malnutrition.
June 2025
Due to the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, a British-flagged yacht, Madleen, operated by the pro-Palestinian Freedom Flotilla Coalition, set off for the Palestinian enclave with the mission of delivering a symbolic amount of aid. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was also onboard the ship, however,  Israeli naval forces boarded and seized the charity vessel.
Israel also carried out attacks on Gazans lining up at aid distribution centres as Hamas accused Tel Aviv of “employing hunger as a weapon of war and turning aid distribution sites into traps of mass deaths of innocent civilians.”
Meanwhile, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and urging nations to take “all measures necessary” to place pressure on Israel as the death toll in the Palestinian territory crossed 56,000.

July 2025
A coalition of countries announced at a meeting in the Colombian capital of Bogota that they will pursue accountability for Israeli abuses in Gaza, including by preventing the transfer of weapons to Israel. The countries included Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, Namibia, Nicaragua, Oman, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and South Africa.
France said it would recognise a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September.
Meanwhile, the Israeli government stated that it was not responsible for a chronic shortage of food in Gaza, instead accusing Hamas of deliberately creating a crisis.
August 2025
A prominent Al Jazeera journalist, who had previously been threatened by Israel, was killed along with four colleagues in an Israeli airstrike in an attack condemned by journalists and rights groups. Israel’s military said it targeted and killed Anas Al Sharif, alleging he had headed a Hamas cell and was involved in rocket attacks on Israel.
The other journalists killed included Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher and Mohammed Noufal. Also killed were freelance cameraman Momen Aliwa and freelance journalist Mohammed al-Khalidi.
Al Sharif was previously part of a Reuters team which in 2024 won a Pulitzer Prize in the category of Breaking News Photography for coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.
Separately, US President Trump’s special envoy inspected a US-backed food distribution centre in Gaza, as the UN rights office reported that Israeli forces had killed hundreds of hungry Palestinians waiting for aid.
An Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis also found that more than half a million people in Gaza were trapped in famine, marked by widespread starvation, destitution and preventable deaths. Further, a report by the Guardian stated that figures from a classified Israeli military intelligence database indicated five out of six Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza had been civilians.

September 2025
Israel launched an airstrike against Hamas leaders in Qatar, expanding its military actions that ranged across the Middle East to include the Gulf Arab state where Hamas has long had its political base. Qatar, which has acted as a mediator alongside Egypt in talks on a ceasefire in Gaza, condemned the attack as “cowardly” and called it a flagrant violation of international law.
During this time, Britain, Australia and Canada recognised a Palestinian state in a seismic shift in decades of Western foreign policy. Britain and Canada became the first G7 countries to take the step.
Subsequently, France and Monaco also extended formal recognition to the State of Palestine. “We must do everything within our power to preserve the very possibility of a two-state solution, Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security,” French President Emmanuel Macron said before announcing the diplomatic move. Portugal also later formally recognised the State of Palestine.
At the same time, US President Trump met Muslim leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to present his plan to end Israel’s genocide in Gaza. The meeting, held on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA at United Nations Headquarters, brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia.
Meanwhile, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem said in a report that Israel has committed genocide in the Gaza Strip.

October 2025
US President Trump, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, presented a 20-point peace proposal for Gaza that would end the conflict and require the return of all hostages living and dead within 72 hours of a ceasefire.
Subsequently, the eight countries which met Trump on the sidelines of the UNGA to discuss Gaza “welcomed the role of the American president and his sincere efforts aimed at ending the war in Gaza”. However, it then emerged that the deal seen by these eight countries and the plan presented by Trump were different.
For its part, Hamas stated that it agrees to the peace plan proposals in part, but has not responded to several key demands — including its disarmament and not having any future role in the governance of Gaza.

President Emmanuel Macron tasked Lecornu, 39, with forming a government in early September after parliament toppled his predecessor over an unpopular austerity budget.
Lecornu unveiled a new cabinet on Sunday evening but it immediately drew criticism for containing many of the same faces from the previous government, and Lecornu resigned on Monday morning.
But in a twist, Lecornu had by Monday evening accepted Macron’s request that he spend two days trying to salvage his administration.
Macron tasked Lecornu with “conducting final negotiations by Wednesday evening to define a platform of action and stability for the country”, a presidential official said, asking not to be named.
The president was ready to “assume his responsibilities” in case of failure, the official said, appearing to allude to him calling new legislative elections.
Lecornu was from 9:00am (12:00pm PKT) to meet party leaders at the prime minister’s office in an attempt to breach the impasse.
‘Try something else’
A political crisis has rocked France for over a year, after Macron called snap polls in mid-2024 which ended in a hung parliament.
The chaos comes ahead of 2027 presidential elections expected to be a historic crossroads in French politics, with the French far right under Marine Le Pen sensing its best chance yet of taking power.
Edouard Philippe, a former premier and centre-right contender in the next presidential elections, on Tuesday slammed what he called a “distressing political game”.
He urged Macron to call early presidential elections as soon as the 2026 budget was approved.
Within Macron’s own ranks, Gabriel Attal — who was prime minister until last year and now leads the president’s centrist party — on Monday evening said he no longer understood Macron’s decisions.
After a succession of new premiers, it was “time to try something else”, he said.
 
 

Le Pen on Monday said it would be “wise” for Macron to resign but also urged snap legislative polls as “absolutely necessary”.
The party leader of Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN), Jordan Bardella, said it would be “ready to govern”.
‘Change of course’
Lecornu faces a tough task. Socialist party leader Olivier Faure late on Monday called for “a change of course” with a “left-wing government”.
Bruno Retailleau, leader of the right-wing Republicans and outgoing interior minister, said he was not against remaining in a cabinet with Macron’s centrists as long as it did not mean fewer members from his party.
Lecornu’s two immediate predecessors, Francois Bayrou and Michel Barnier, were ousted by parliament in a standoff over an austerity budget.
Any next premier will still face the challenge of finding enough support for the spending bill in a chamber where the Macron-friendly bloc is in a minority.
The crisis comes as France’s public debt has reached a record high.
France’s debt-to-GDP ratio is now the European Union’s third-highest after Greece and Italy, and is close to twice the 60 per cent permitted under EU rules.
Macron has so far resisted calls for fresh parliamentary polls, and ruled out resigning himself before his mandate ends in 2027.
He could also look for a new prime minister, who would be the eighth of the president’s mandate, but would face a struggle to survive without radical change.</p><small>2025-10-07 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68e4735b441ab.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947143/damage-control' target='_blank'><strong>Damage control</strong></a><br><p>IN the past week, it seemed attention was focused on the Middle East, Hamas, Israel and the much-discussed peace plan. But Pakistan is never far away from the excitement, even if it is overseas, and it was no different this time around — from discussions under the glare at the UN events to meetings in quiet rooms, tucked away from prying eyes, it appears Islamabad was always in the loop.
But as events unfolded (to the dismay of some and the excitement of others), at home it also highlighted the dysfunctional and confused ways in which the government continues to behave.
That Pakistan was working closely with Saudi Arabia had been evident for some time before the announcement of the defence pact. But that this collaboration was connected with the Gaza situation was only made public with the meetings held at the UN with United States President Donald Trump. One can only conjecture that the meeting at the White House with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army chief may also be linked to that. But those of us in Pakistan didn’t have to wait for long as the White House meeting with the Israeli PM and the joint press conference with Trump made public the plan to end the onslaught in Gaza.
 
 

However, inexplicably, Sharif tweeted in favour of the Gaza plan quickly — perhaps too quickly. The rest of the countries that had been part of the meetings with the US president at the UN were more circumspect, especially as the details began to be made public. It took another couple of days before Ishaq Dar, foreign minister and deputy PM, realised the need to clear up the confusion. But how successful his efforts were is open to debate.

Mixed messaging from the government or just confusion? It was hard to tell.

What followed first was a press conference. But it was long and a bit unclear, and in this day and age of media management, where frequently journalists are guided as to what the headline-making quotes are, his words were left open to interpretation. This wasn’t just so in the immediate aftermath of the press conference but continued to be the case the next day too. One English-language newspaper, in its headline, spoke of Pakistan signalling a Gaza peacekeeping role, while another claimed that Pakistan was wavering because the Gaza deal draft had been changed.
Mixed messaging from the government or just confusion? It was hard to tell at that moment. But when Dar repeated the mixed messages in parliament days later, it appeared as if the ambiguity was deliberate. It truly was a case of breadcrumbing, in the slang of today.
Dar continued to argue the draft was changed but insisted that it was the only way to stop the Gaza bloodshed; the message was that there are few good choices and countries are forced to pick the least bad one. He dismissed the PM’s tweet as one made out of ignorance of the changes in the plan and insisted Pakistan continued to stick to its policy of a two-state solution. Unlike the Shama Junejo matter, he didn’t point the finger at the PM or distance himself from the matter.
But this ambiguity takes on a different light against the background of the commentary by many media people who, too, are arguing about the necessity to end the Gaza war. The rest, they insist, will come and be thrashed out later — for now, whatever can be done to stop the killings. One can make a wild guess as to where these arguments are coming from.
Is this simply a tightrope act, hoping to keep the rich allies happy as well as a populace which identifies with the Palestinians? Gossip in Islamabad has the answer but with little proof. Meanwhile, the government ends up looking dysfunctional and confused.
But if this were the only issue, one could put it down to the complexity of Middle East politics, as the West keeps reminding us. However, the dysfunction is a product of more than just limited choices internationally. This came through in the other crisis the government had to contend with in Azad Kashmir. When the protests first began, the government’s reaction was one of arrogance. Little attention was paid to the matter. In any case, the PM and his deputy were far too busy with their foreign tours. The media, too, it appeared, was so busy with international events that the protests at home were ignored, and covered only by social media, despite the phone services having been suspended there.
This dismissive attitude continued even as the protests turned bloody and lives were lost. The only sign that the government was aware of the matter was a reply given by ISPR during a question-and-answer session away from the cameras. Perhaps some intrepid reporter or observer provided the information to the media, in which the DG appeared confident that the government was in place in AJK and explained the need for everyone to pay taxes.
However, the government abruptly began paying attention to the matter when the protests turned violent. First Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and then an entire retinue of PPP and PML-N leaders were selected to talk to the protesting Kashmiris. Overnight, the issue catapulted to the headlines and stayed there as the negotiating team acceded to most of the protesters’ demands. The need to pay taxes, one assumes, can wait.
Did the change of heart come with the bloodshed or the inexplicable attack on the National Press Club in Islamabad? I, for one, am not privy to the decision-making. But it seems the government and media discovered the issue around the same time and the former rushed to resolve it. (And then we wonder why people believe social media and its lies.)
But between both these incidents, the picture emerges of a government given to ignoring the larger context of politics in which it functions — until a possible explosive situation becomes a full-blown crisis and requires damage control rather than deft and timely management. This is a surefire recipe for disaster.

Infirmities in the plan include the history of the Trump-Netanyahu axis to lure quarries with syrupy promises into death traps, as they did with Iran and Qatar. The trust deficit is thus an overarching challenge.
Suppose the hostages were released, as the plan envisages — and it is way past the time they were since their living or dying is immaterial to Netanyahu’s murderous Hannibal Doctrine. What if Israel, with Trump’s support, then launches another widely expected attack on Iran? The discourse would change, wouldn’t it? And the idea of peaceful coexistence would in all likelihood be back to square one. This has happened before. People have won Nobel Prizes by promising Arab-Israeli peace. Why must this one be different, given that Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are the key players?
 
 

Already, components of the genocidal ruling coalition in Israel see it as their religious duty to spit on Christians whose faces they get close to. They deal more viciously with Muslims, of course, whose lands they covet and claim ownership of through a dodgy and supremacist religious edict. The festering strife suits global hegemons. A potential trigger could be a Russian and Saudi agreement to step up oil production with adverse fallout for American hydrocarbon businesses. An Israeli-Iranian shootout would cynically staunch a potential oil glut.
The flip side is that interdiction of oil flows would hand Russia a windfall. As the slaughter in Gaza showed, the region is enduring deeper ethnic polarisation. Britain mastered the use of religion and race to divide and rule, something it successfully carried out in Ireland before unleashing devastating experiments in Asia and Africa. The 1917 Balfour Declaration was timed to check the spread of Bolshevism in the Middle East. The antidote would forcibly truncate Palestine on religious grounds. Along the way, Lyndon Johnson loosened JFK’s tight leash on Israel to recraft the Zionist state as America’s unsinkable ship in the Mediterranean. The ties have never looked back.
Trump’s Gaza plan is deemed to have the approval of Saudi rulers, though they are visibly absent from the negotiations. The prospect of Riyadh turning the settler colonial state into an equitable space for all three inhabitants of old Palestine would be tantamount to a miracle. Egypt, whose military dictatorship is funded by Riyadh as a quid pro quo for keeping the lid on the Egyptian hub of the religio-nationalist Muslim Brotherhood, is representing the paymaster in the talks with a grudging Netanyahu-led Israel.
Before the events of Oct 7, 2023, Hamas was deemed a threat to Arab regimes more than to Israel. Netanyahu had reportedly aligned with Qatar to shore up hard-line Hamas as a foil to a moderate two-state-accepting Fatah.

Was the Fahd plan a sleight of hand, an illusion, or the bus the Arabs missed?

The plan was jolted when Muslim Brotherhood won the 2012 presidential elections in Egypt in the footsteps of Hamas outvoting Fatah in 2006. Both elections were cancelled by the West whose habit of dissolving uncomfortable democracies is legendary. The Anglo-American overthrow of Mohammad Mosaddegh’s elected government in 1953 in Iran reinstated the Shah as the first blow in the murky politics of oil.
Israel’s prompting later foiled a religio-nationalist victory in the oil-rich former French colony of Algeria. Secular allies of the former USSR were next. Iraq, Libya and Syria were dismantled at Israel’s behest, with Saudi Arabia playing the staging post in all cases.
Why then did the Saudis conjure a charming proposal on the Palestinian question in 1981? Was it to pre-empt the tide of mass fervour the Iranian Revolution threatened to unleash against incipiently anti-Palestinian Arab regimes?
The Saudis unveiled their plan at the 1981 Fez summit of Arab leaders. It was barely two years into the Khomeini phenomenon. The threat became more dire when the Ayatollah met Yasser Arafat at his home in Tehran and set up an elite military guard called the Quds Force named after Jerusalem, sacred to Muslims.
The Cold War was peaking as Crown Prince Fahd unveiled his proposals to the tense Fez meeting. For the first time in Arab discourse, it included the implicit recognition of Israel. Predictably, Iraq, Syria and Libya rejected Fahd’s implied two-state solution.
Remember, in 1973, Saudi Arabia was leading the Arab oil embargo against US support for Israel. Shortly thereafter, the king who led the protest was shot dead by a royal nephew. The new incumbent promptly rowed back from a future stand-off with Israel. Trump’s so-called municipal deal for a greatly abridged Palestinian homeland is rooted in the Arab rulers’ fear of Palestine. It’s a slippery slope for both sides. The Zionist press is projecting Trump as a headscarf-wearing Hamas protégé and Netanyahu as a traitor to the cause of a ‘Greater Israel’.
Was the Fahd plan a sleight of hand, an illusion, or the bus the Arabs missed? Consider the treasure on offer to decide: 1) Israel to withdraw from all Arab territory occupied in 1967, including Arab Jerusalem. 2) Israeli settlements built on Arab land after 1967 to be dismantled, including those in Arab Jerusalem. 3) A guarantee of freedom of worship for all religions in the holy places. 4) An affirmation of the right of the Palestinian Arab people to return to their homes and compensation for those who do not wish to return. 5) The West Bank and the Gaza Strip to have a transitional period under the UN’s auspices for a period not exceeding several months. 6) An independent Palestinian state should be set up with Jerusalem as its capital. 7) All states in the region should be able to live in peace in the region. 8) The UN or its member states to guarantee the carrying out of these provisions.

With the elements mentioned above routinely blamed for expensive electricity in the country, the failures of power sector regulators Nepra and the CPPA-G to effectively enforce regulation to protect consumer rights and financial interests have always escaped public scrutiny.
The latest episode, in which an international coal supplier invoked force majeure to cancel a long-term contract with the Sahiwal power plant last year, compelling the latter to buy fuel at higher prices, is a case in point.
Instead of penalising the defaulter through forfeiture of its performance guarantees to recover replacement costs for wrongly invoking the force majeure clause, Nepra and the CPPA-G decided to pass on the cost differential to power consumers in the form of a higher tariff. Not just that, the CPPA-G, rather than blacklisting the supplier, permitted it to continue the supply of coal under its long-term contract, and participate in and win a spot tender at a higher rate in June for the same power plant.
 
 

That the two regulators failed to act against the defaulting supplier, and instead, effectively rewarded it for reneging on its contractual obligations, underscores just how weak and compromised the power sector’s regulatory framework has become. This failure is particularly indefensible given that industry data flatly contradicts the supplier’s justification for invoking force majeure.
The firm had cited congestion at South Africa’s Richards Bay Coal Terminal and the flare-up with India in May this year as reasons for suspending deliveries. Yet, the record shows that other suppliers continued to meet their contractual commitments through the same terminal, while coal shipments to Pakistan from other traders remained uninterrupted. The real motive, it appears, was economic self-interest, with the supplier belatedly discovering that the agreed price discount was too steep for its comfort and thus choosing to walk away.
Unfortunately, this is not the first time electricity consumers have been made to bear the cost of regulatory rot through their inflated bills. Nor, sadly, should it come as a surprise.
The latest breach has only reaffirmed a familiar pattern where regulatory dysfunction seems to have been institutionalised. In Pakistan’s power sector, watchdogs too often become enablers and are complicit, whether by design or by neglect, in protecting private interests and defaulters rather than consumers. When regulators allow private entities to breach contracts without consequence, accountability becomes optional, losses become collective, and market failure the norm.

Justice Shakeel Ahmad, a member of the five-judge constitutional bench who dissented from the majority decision on the seniority issue of IHC judges, observed that the transfers not only posed a threat to judicial independence but also revealed procedural irregularities.
 
 

By a three-to-two majority, the Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar-led constitutional bench upheld on June 19 the transfer of three judges to the IHC from three different high courts, ruling that the move fell within the framework of the Constitution. However, the matter was remanded back to the President to promptly determine inter-se seniority among the judges based on their service records.
Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Shakeel Ahmad dissented, describing the permanent transfers from the Lahore, Sindh, and Balochistan High Courts as a development that caused ripples within the judiciary, carried out through a flawed exercise of discretion under Article 200(1) and effectively rendering Article 175A redundant.

What is done once, if it is allowed, may be done again, judge observes

In his 23-page additional dissenting note, Justice Ahmad cited Lord Justice Pearce in the 1966 Liyanage case to stress the gravity of the precedent: “What is done once, if it be allowed, may be done again and in a lesser crisis and less serious circumstances.”
Justice Ahmad asserted that while constitutional provisions must prevail if clearly permitted, any such course must still be restrained through established principles of constitutional interpretation, warning that failure to do so would be a dereliction of duty. “In the larger interest of our country, in fidelity to the rule of law, and in unwavering defence of constitutionalism, it is our bounden obligation to ensure that transient convenience does not become a precedent for permanent erosion,” he stated.
Justice Ahsan’s visit
Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Ahsan from Supreme  Court of Denmark visited the apex court, as part of his official tour on an invitation of Pakistan’s apex court.
An eminent jurist with a distinguished career in constitutional and administrative law, Justice Ahsan has served in various judicial and academic roles in Denmark and is recognised for his contributions to judicial reform.
He was warmly received by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi.

Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand directed the couple to appear before the court on Wednesday to record their statements under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).

The case pertains to the alleged retention of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set — comprising a necklace, earrings, bracelets and rings — gifted by the Saudi royal family, which the couple allegedly acquired at a nominal price, causing a substantial loss to the national exchequer.
According to the prosecution, the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m. During the proceedings, the prosecution produced 21 witnesses, including Mr Khan’s former military secretary, who made what the court described as a “damaging” revelation.
The former military secretary testified that the ex-PM had instructed him not to deposit the Bulgari set in Toshakhana and instead retained it.
A key witness, Sohaib Abbasi, admitted to undervaluing the jewellery set at Rs5m “under pressure” from Mr Khan’s former personal secretary, Inamullah Shah.

The nomination letters will be submitted to the secretariats of both houses today (Tuesday).
The decision was taken after the Peshawar High Court vacated the stay orders against disqualification of Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz, former leaders of the opposition in the lower and upper houses of parliament, respectively.
Sheikh Waqqas Akram, the party’s information secretary, told Dawn that the decision had been made on the orders of Imran Khan.

Aleema says only sisters will convey Imran’s messages

He said the letter of nomination for the opposition leader in the NA was submitted on Monday while that for the Senate slot would be submitted on Tuesday.
Asad Qaiser, the former National Assembly speaker, confirmed the decision, but added that nomination letters for both positions would be submitted on Tuesday (today).
Mr Qaiser said both Mr Achak­zai and Allama Nasir Abbas were seasoned politicians and never “compromise on principles”.
“As the country is passing through a crisis, Mr Achakzai is outspoken and is a perfect choice to speak in the lower house on behalf of the opposition.
“Imran Khan’s decision will strengthen the opposition alliance as Mr Achakzai is also head of Tehreek Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP),” he said.
In reply to another question, Asad Qaiser said the decisions were made because stay orders for both Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz were vacated by the PHC.
After the disqualification of Omer Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the PTI chief nominated Mr Achakzai and Azam Swati as opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate, respectively, on Aug 20.
Salman Akram Raja, the PTI’s secretary general, gave his assent to the decision.
Only Imran’s sisters can share his views, says Aleema
Separately, Aleema Khan asserted on Monday that only Imran Khan’s sisters would now carry the responsibility of conveying his messages, as directed by the incarcerated PTI founding chairman himself.
Speaking outside Adiala Jail, she said Imran also warned he may soon be shifted to an unknown location and placed in solitary confinement.
Imran Khan reportedly expressed concern over a campaign targeting the family members, allegedly because his sisters shared his messages with the masses.
“He said others cannot bear the burden of his words,” Aleema said, stressing that the sisters have never interfered in party matters in 30 years and visit jail solely for him.

Some 350 trekkers had reached the small township of Qudang, while rescuers had made contact with more than 200 others still in the mountains, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Sunday. An evening news bulletin on Monday provided no further updates on the rescue operation.
The visitors were in the remote Karma valley, which leads to the eastern Kangshung face of Everest, taking advantage of an eight-day National Day holiday in China, which brought hundreds to the area this week.
“It was so wet and cold in the mountains, and hypothermia was a real risk,” said Chen Geshuang, who was part of an 18-strong trekking team that made it to Qudang.

Locals say blizzard in October is highly unusual; claim to have ‘never encountered such weather’ so suddenly during peak season

The severe weather, which began on Friday evening, was a shocking and dangerous turn for what is normally a peak trekking season.
“The weather this year is not normal. The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly,” Chen said.
Chen’s party descended from the mountains on Sunday and was greeted with sweet tea by villagers after enduring a harrowing evening of heavy snowfall combined with thunder and lightning.
An earlier report by state-backed Jimu News said nearly 1,000 people had been trapped by the storm. Hu­­ndreds of local villagers and rescue teams were deployed to help clear snow blocking access to the area.
The remaining trekkers will arrive in Qudang in stages under the assistance of rescuers organised by the local government, CCTV reported.
The CCTV report did not say if local guides and support staff for the various trekking parties had all been accounted for.
Regional havoc
Snowfall in the valley, which lies at an average elevation of 4,200 metres (13,800 feet), began on Friday evening and persisted throughout Saturday.
The Karma valley, first explored by Western travellers a century ago, is a relatively pristine part of the Everest region. Unlike the peak’s arid north face, it boasts lush vegetation and untouched alpine forests, fed by meltwaters from the Kangshung glacier at the foot of the world’s highest mountain.
It was unclear if trekkers near the north face, which draws large numbers of tourists due to its easy access by paved road, had been affected by the weather.
October is typically a peak trekking season, when skies usually clear at the end of the Indian monsoon, offering clear views and stable conditions. The severe weather has caused havoc across the broader Himalayan region.  To the south of Tibet in Nepal, heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 50 people since Friday. Thirty-seven of those people died in separate landslides in the eastern Ilam district bordering India.
A South Korean trekker died in Nepal, and his body was recovered by a rescue helicopter on Monday, said Tulsi Gurung, president of the Nepal National Mountain Guides Association. His guide was rescued.
The hiker, whose name was not released, had climbed the 6,476-metre (21,246-foot) Mera Peak on Saturday.

Markets were abuzz with shoppers, banks were swarmed by cus­­tomers, and roads in major towns, particularly Muzaffa­rab­­ad, rem­ained choked with long qu­­eues of vehicles throughout the day.
Attendance in government of­­fices — thin last week due to the unavailability of public transpo­rt and non-use of official vehicles — was reported to be near normal.
The biggest crowds, however, were witnessed at banks, which had technically remained open during the lockdown, but saw little or no activity. Government and private sector employees thro­n­g­­ed the branches to withdraw their long-delayed salaries, while pensioners stood in queues for cash.
Many ATMs were either empty or out of order, having not been replenished for days due to the uncertain situation. Ironically, fe­­­­deral minister Ahsan Iqbal, a member of the federal negotiating team, was also seen returning empty-handed last Thursday eve­ning after trying his luck at four different ATMs in the capital.
Even those using mobile banking apps faced disappointment as internet and data services had been drastically throttled during the week, disrupting electronic transactions.
 
 

“I had money in my account but no way to access it,” said Rakhshanda Maqbool, a schoolteacher, expressing frustration after finally withdrawing her salary on Monday.
With fresh cash in hand, cro­wds also poured into grocery sto­res and markets, where sales far exceeded the usual day’s turnover. Many households had run out of food supplies during the weeklong closure, while shortages of medicines and household goods had also deepened.
“Today’s footfall was extraordinary,” said Zafar Mir, owner of a local grocery chain. “People were desperate to restock after a week of uncertainty and shortages.”
Pharmacies, though technically exempt from the shutdown, had also remained largely closed. Faisal Javed, owner of a leading pharmacy in Muzaffarabad, said, “We had to call in all our staff to­­day. Many customers prefer buying medicines only from us, and they had been waiting for days.”
Educational institutions, too, regained their usual hustle and bustle, with students returning to classrooms after an unplanned break.
Meanwhile, a meeting of 16 government secretaries was held under the chairmanship of AJK Chief Secretary Khushhal Khan to review implementation of the decisions reached in the agreement between the federal ministers and the JAAC.
“We have already moved a summary for cabinet approval of the agreement,” Mr Khan told Dawn. “A reference has also been sent to the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs for ratification by the federal cabinet.”
He confirmed that all detained JKJAAC activists had been released.

Senior police officials told Dawn a group of armed men stormed into the Qazi Court building in the Maskan Kalat area, about 30 kilometres from Kharan city, at around 11:30am, while the judge was hearing cases.
They held Judge Muha­mmad Jan and other court staff hostage, ransacking records and damaging office furniture and other items on the premises.
“Armed terrorists stor­med into the court and set the courtroom and other sections of the Qazi Court on fire,” Deputy Inspector General of Police for Rak­h­shan region, Abdul Ha­yee Aamir Baloch, told Dawn.
The court building was gutted, and the attackers also destroyed the court’s records.
While fleeing after torc­hing the courtroom and other offices, the assailants kidnapped the judge at gunpoint. “The terrorists kidnapped the Qazi Court judge and also made off with two vehicles, including the judge’s official vehicle and that of a lawyer,” DIG Baloch said.
Security forces, including the Frontier Corps, rushed to the site soon after receiving information about the incident. They cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to trace those involved in the attack and the kidnapping. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident so far.

• Trump looking for swift resolution, but insiders say it may take days to iron out all the details
SHARAM EL SHEIKH / WASHINGTON: Two years since the events of Oct 7, 2023, delegations from Israel and Hamas began indirect negotiations in Egypt on Monday, which the US hopes will bring an end to the war in Gaza.
However, in a surprising turn of events, the White House on Monday appeared not to outright reject the prospect of recognising a Palestinian state in the future.
 
 

The talks between the two sides facing contentious issues, such as demands that Israel pull out of the enclave, and the disarming of Hamas.
Egyptian state TV reported that the talks had begun at the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh.
“I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST,” Trump said in a social media post.
But both sides are seeking clarifications of crucial details, including over issues that have wrecked all previous attempts to end the war and could defy any quick resolution.
Though Trump says he wants a deal quickly, an official briefed on the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he expected the round of talks kicking off on Monday would require at least a few days.
An official involved in ceasefire planning and a Palestinian source said Trump’s deadline to send all hostages back within 72 hours could be impossible to meet in the case of bodies of dead hostages, some of which would need to be located and recovered from burial sites scattered across the battlefield.
A Palestinian official close to the talks was sceptical about prospects of a breakthrough given deep mutual mistrust, saying Hamas and other Palestinian factions were worried that Israel might ditch negotiations once it recovered the hostages.
Negotiators from Hamas will seek clarity on the mechanism to achieve a swap of remaining prisoners — both alive and dead — for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, as well as an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and a ceasefire, according to a statement put out by the Islamist group late on Sunday.
A thorny issue is likely to be the Israeli demand, echoed in Trump’s plan, that Hamas disarm, a Hamas source told Reuters. The group has insisted it will not disarm unless Israel ends its occupation and a Palestinian state is created.
White House briefing
In a surprising turn of events, the White House on Monday appeared not to outright reject recognising a Palestinian state in the future, after being asked about the matter.
“If Hamas does agree to relinquish power and give it up, cede power to this transitional technocratic government, if that does happen, would the Trump administration then recognise a Palestinian state?” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked during a press briefing on Monday.
“Look, I don’t want to get ahead of the technical talks right now… they’re extremely sensitive,” she responded.
“There’s many things to discuss. Of course, this is hopefully – we expect, and we hope – going to be one of the greatest peace deals this world has ever seen. And the Trump administration is working diligently and working very hard to get there”.

• Minister underscores limited window to support farmers; forms three task forces
• KP minister urges committee to formulate aid package proportionate to provincial NFC shares
• Punjab announces tax break for flood-hit areas, will start handing out compensation cheques to survivors from today
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: A high-powered cabinet committee on agriculture, climate change and flood emergencies on Monday put out in the open a nonchalant approach of the federal ministers and provincial governments towards flood-loss assessment ahead of a support package by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expected by the end of this month.
At the start of the first meeting of the cabinet forum, committee convener Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal was irked by the absence of federal ministers for finance, water resources, housing, climate change and power and their subordinates from the meeting.
Similarly, he also took exception to the lack of representation from Punjab and Sindh, saying he would report this non-serious attitude on such a grave issue to the prime minister.
 
 

Subsequently, the water, climate, power, and housing ministers showed up at the meeting. Sindh was apparently conspicuous by its absence, coinciding with PPP’s walkout from the National Assembly due to a political rift with the PML-N, while flood-ravaged Punjab was represented by a special secretary.
Balochistan’s minister for agriculture was present along with KP’s ministers for agriculture and finance, whose preparedness and contribution were appreciated by Mr Iqbal.
The planning minister deplored that the Rabi season was now starting that offered a window of no more than two weeks for the government to support the flood-affected farmers and lead them towards a new crop with greater financial value. Instead, he suggested the use of canola, priced around $700 per tonne in the international market, compared to $250-300 per tonne for wheat.
KP’s agriculture minister reported that his province was already at the cusp of an olive revolution with the plantation over around 700,000 acres, potentially sufficient to meet all of Pakistan’s requirement within a period of 3-4 years.
The province had also been fortunate to have successful plantation of saffron to follow soon. In the short term, he reported, the KP government was providing free seeds and fertilisers from its own resources and was in touch with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank for a comprehensive support package for rain- and flood-affected people.
 
 

KP’s Finance Minister Muzammil Aslam proposed that the PM’s package for flood-affected people should not be Punjab and Sindh centric in the name and cost of smaller provinces.
He demanded that it should be proportionate to provincial National Finance Commission (NFC) shares so that gas subsidy for fertilisers was not consumed only in Punjab or for political reasons in Sindh, given the fact that KP ultimately also faced the difficult situation from a ban on the wheat trade. The sources said the planning minister acknowledged that KP’s stance over the past 18 months at all national forums had been from a national perspective and above provincial and political angles.
Mr Iqbal was unhappy to know that despite flood devastations, the Ministry of National Food Security and the provinces had poor coordination over flood losses and both sides were waiting for each other. “We do not have unlimited time to waste while the opportunity is slipping through,” he was quoted as saying.
A representative of the Punjab government reported that the chief minister had been informed about the loss of crops planted on 2500,000 acres and the CM had set a target of wheat sowing over 16.5 million acres, up from 16.25m acres last year. Mr Iqbal hoped this target was also backed by an implementable plan.
The minister assured the provinces that a cabinet committee at the federal level had been constituted by the prime minister for a joint and coordinated plan and did not mean any federal intrusion. At the planning division, “we are here to provide you all a helping hand” for a better response.
Task forces formed
He also formed three dedicated task forces in consultation with the federal ministries concerned and the provincial governments. These task forces will prepare detailed reports within 15 days covering immediate agricultural relief and provision of seeds, climate change impacts and resilience strategies, and strengthening infrastructure to make it climate-resilient in the long term. These reports will be presented to the PM for final consideration.
 
 

He said providing short-term, medium-term, and long-term relief to farmers was the government’s foremost priority. “Provincial governments, in partnership with the federal government, must take swift steps to ensure that affected farmers are compensated and supported for the upcoming Rabi season,” he said, underlining the urgency of supplying canola seeds to farmers within the next 15 days, taking advantage of the soil moisture left behind by the floods. “I have arranged a 5,000-acre canola seed pilot project in Narowal through corporate sponsorship, because we cannot afford to lose time. This is a moment for urgent action—we must not waste it,” he said.
He also indicated the importance of extending interest-free loan schemes to the farmers through financial institutions and to gradually moving towards private insurance mechanisms to protect them from recurrent climate shocks.
It may be noted that the PM had constituted the committee last month to formulate, in collaboration with provincial governments, an agricultural support package to provide immediate relief to farmers affected by the recent floods.
Tax exemption for Punjab
Separately, the Punjab government announced tax exemptions for flood-hit areas, initiating compensation from Oct 7. The Punjab cabinet meeting presided over by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz approved a 171-point agenda, endorsing a series of initiatives mainly focused on flood rehabilitation.
“The distribution of compensation cheques among flood-affected families will begin from October 7,” the CM said. Compensation for damaged houses, livestock losses, and crop destruction was also approved, along with waivers on ‘Aabiana’ and agricultural income tax in 2,855 flood-affected villages in the province.
The cabinet approved the flood relief package under which Rs1 million would be given to the family of a deceased while Rs500,00 and Rs300,000 would be paid to a person with permanent and partial disability, respectively.
“The family of a fully damaged concrete house will get Rs1 million in compensation, while partially damaged concrete house will have Rs300,000. The family of fully damaged mud house will be paid Rs500,000 while Rs150,000 for a partially damaged mud house.”

Informed sources told Dawn that the Prime Minister Office (PMO) reached out on Sunday night to federal officers posted at the provincial capitals to use their good offices in streamlining the progress on pending matters and upcoming targets in line with commitments to the IMF, not only under the EFF but also the climate-related $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility. Similar instructions were also issued to key federal ministries.
The provincial chief secretaries and finance secretaries were directed to submit an update on their implementation status within 24 hours and to provide clear justifications for any unmet targets or delays. Informed sources said the Ministry of Finance had reported to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) that the governments of the larger provinces were not as forthcoming in cooperating on matters related to IMF commitments.
While the provincial governments — particularly Sindh and Punjab — had missed their targets for providing cash surpluses in line with commitments for the period ending June 30, they have also shown signs of lapses in the current fiscal year. Sindh has already announced a budget with a deficit of around Rs40bn. At the same time, Punjab has expressed discomfort with the stringent conditions, citing concerns over self-respect, even in the context of flood-related assistance.

Backlogs risk derailing review ahead of crucial weekend deadline

The PMO has also requested that the provincial bureaucracy share its updated reports with the Ministry of Finance. Informed sources said the IMF had already directed the authorities to put on hold disbursements for development schemes in flood-hit areas until clear need and loss estimates were available. The fund also expects the federal and provincial authorities to remain fiscally prudent.
The IMF has remained firm that flood support would be unacceptable at the cost of cash surpluses committed under the national fiscal pact, one of the key themes of the ongoing programme to ensure primary budget surplus targets. For FY26, Punjab is required to provide Rs740bn cash surplus to the Centre, followed by Rs370bn by Sindh, Rs220bn from KP and Rs185bn from Balochistan.
This comes amid discussions between the IMF and the federal authorities over revisions in macroeconomic indicators to account for flood-related losses. This may involve a downward official revision of the economic growth projection to around 3.5pc from 4.2pc in the budget, and higher than the anticipated inflation, now exceeding 8pc, compared to the budgeted 7pc. That would involve cascading impact on many other sectors, including revenue collection, imports and exports, besides fiscal and current account targets.
Under the national financial pact, the provinces had amended their agricultural income tax regimes to align with federal income tax rules but they appeared unwilling or unprepared, or both, to ensure effective collections by the Sept 30 deadline linked to the end-October structural benchmark.
The provinces were also required to transition the goods and services tax (GST) on services to a negative list, effective FY26, and on moving to a capital-based property tax.
There are several reform measures committed to under the RSF, which involve greater responsibilities for provinces, requiring considerable preparation and homework, although their deadlines have yet to be met. These initiatives pertain to improving water system resilience and disaster response, financing water charges, and enhancing transparency through digitised records, particularly in Sindh and Punjab.
All the provinces had given an undertaking to the IMF that they would not introduce any policy or action that could be considered to undermine or run counter to any of the commitments or policies outlined in Pakistan’s sovereign agreement, as outlined in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.
The Centre had committed that “provinces agree to consult with the IMF through the federal Ministry of Finance before modifying or adopting any measures that could affect or undercut the program specified in the MEFP or which deviates from the goals of the programme”.

The PPP and PML-N are coalition partners in the Centre.
A post on X from the presidency said today that Zardari and Naqvi held a telephonic conversation related to the ongoing row between the Sindh and Punjab governments.
“President Asif Ali Zardari spoke to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi over the phone to discuss the recent tensions between the Sindh and Punjab governments. The president has called the interior minister to Karachi for an urgent meeting in this regard,” the post said.
 






The PPP and the PML-N’s Punjab leadership have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues ranging from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government.
The war of words between the two sides initially kicked off over flood compensation but expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself.
In response, the PPP lawmakers decided to stay away from parliamentary proceedings last week to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs subsequently met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces.
However, she declared on Friday that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47.
The now-shelved six-canal project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his elder brother and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif on Saturday and discussed with him the ‘growing tensions’ between the PPP and PML-N, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon alleged a day ago that the Punjab government was taking his party’s cover to “target” the federal government.
Partners continue to trade barbs as PPP stages walkout from Senate, NA
The coalition partners continued to trade barbs today as Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari vented that the province had always played the role of a “big brother” during any natural calamity.
She said the Punjab cabinet expressed regret that when the province passed through the challenges of the recent floods, the moment was seized and used for the sake of politics and interests.
“The chief minister said she was saddened and, in her own words: ‘It is difficult for me to forget this. I didn’t expect that Punjab would be treated this way.’”
Bokhari also assailed Memon for his remarks and said a “planted campaign” was being run against CM Maryam.
“Ask all these people doing press conferences what they have done for flood affectees,” she said, also taking a dig at Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab.
The Punjab minister further said that she accepted Memon’s challenge to have a debate.
 


Responding to her, PPP Senator Quratulain Marri said Bokhari had a “phobia” of Sindh.
“PML-N’s declaration of war against Sindh is a dangerous precedent, the consequences of which will not be good for the country,” she said.
Marri also reiterated Memon’s allegation that the Punjab government was actually targeting the PPP to weaken the Centre and PM Shehbaz.
 






In a video message, PPP Senator and Senior Vice President Sherry Rehman said the party had said nothing to suggest that it was manipulating the issue of floods and aid for politics.
“If we are demanding relief for the people of Punjab and someone feels bad about it, that’s strange; Punjab is not anyone’s personal estate.”
 






Speaking in the Senate later, she said the PPP had great concerns and the federation was in “sheer need” of stability amid the devastation wrought by the floods.
She said it was “clear” that the “war of words” between Punjab and Sindh was affecting the federal coalition, saying that the PPP strove to maintain unity during tough times but when “lines were crossed”, the “Punjab card” was used and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s run as foreign minister was criticised, then such statements and remarks crossed the bounds of criticism and decency.
Rehman added that the PPP had never managed a coalition before in such a manner and said that apologising did not lead to a decline in self-respect and stature but only increased them.
“If our leadership is not apologised to, then the PPP is the biggest party in the Senate, count the numbers, we are by far the biggest party in this House and don’t take our support for granted in the coalition benches. We don’t want to break anything, but don’t take our support for granted. That is very clear,” she announced before leading a walkout of PPP senators from the proceedings.
 


Responding to her, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said everyone had a right to protest under a democratic system, but ebbs and peaks were also a part of it.
Tarar said he tried his best in the National Assembly that the recent statements from both sides did not affect parliamentary functioning. He highlighted that PML-N Senator and PM aide Rana Sanaullah had assured the PPP in the Senate that water distribution from the Indus River would only be carried out under the Irsa pact.
The law minister also appreciated that Rehman voiced her party’s grievances in a “very sophisticated” manner, adding that President Zardari and Nawaz were both leaders favouring “reconciliation”.
Addressing the opposition, the law minister stressed that the ongoing tensions were an “ordinary change in temperatures”.
At this point, Senate Deputy Chairman Syedaal Khan, who hails from the PML-N, called on his party’s Anusha Rehman and Khalil Tahir Sandhu, as well as on Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Amir Waliuddin Chishti to go and convince the PPP lawmakers to return to the Upper House.
 


Meanwhile, PTI Senator Ali Zafar quipped that they were witnessing a “historic contest” between the coalition allies.
“The contest is very interesting. It is about who served [the people] better during the floods.”
The PTI senator said that “surely the PPP prepared and may have prevented Sindh from being flooded, but only in books, not in reality”.
Noting the Punjab government’s assertions of providing ample rescue and relief services, Zafar claimed, “Surely they must have given the aid, but this is strange and perplexing aid because it did not reach the flood victims, but perhaps went into their pockets.”
The PTI senator assailed both government parties for contesting over “who held more press conferences rather than who built more houses”.
Meanwhile, in the National Assembly, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser welcomed the PPP’s “friendly fire” amid applause from the opposition. “I feel that if they are serious, they should come and present a vote of no confidence, we will side with them.”
His suggestion came after PPP MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said that it was hard for his party to continue to participate in proceedings until it was given assurances by Punjab or any other authority.
Ashraf subsequently led a walkout of PPP lawmakers from the Lower House.
 


PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro addressed Qaiser’s suggestion in an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’ and said a mere sentence could not do anything and “reliablility” needed to be considered.
“I don’t know how reliable the PTI are, has he talked to his party founder?” he said.</p><small>2025-10-06 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06213522e301c38.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947036/militant-linked-violence-in-pakistan-soars-in-third-quarter-report' target='_blank'><strong>Militant-linked violence in Pakistan soars in third quarter: report</strong></a><br><p>Violence has surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) said on Monday.
In a quarterly report, CRSS reported a 46 per cent rise in fatalities, including civilians, security personnel and terrorists, compared to the previous quarter. The thick tank recorded 901 fatalities and 599 injuries resulting from 329 incidents of violence, including terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations.
The report noted that this year is on track to be deadlier than 2024 — already the most violent year in a decade.
The surge reflects an “intensification of militant violence and the expanded scale of counter-terrorism operations”, CRSS said.
“With an entire quarter still remaining, … 2025 is on course to surpass last year’s toll,” the report read.
“If the current trend continues, 2025 could mark one of the deadliest years in a decade.”
There were 2,414 deaths in the first three quarters of 2025, nearing the 2,546 fatalities reported in 2024, according to the think tank. The report added that when comparing casualty numbers from January to September 2024 (1,527 fatalities) to this year, 2,414 fatalities were recorded within the same period — an increase of 58pc.
“However, the source of fatalities has shifted; in 2024, security operations caused 505 deaths (33pc of the total), while terror attacks claimed 1,022. In 2025, security operations accounted for 1,265 deaths — over half of the total fatalities. This shift underscores how the state’s response has intensified, with security forces inflicting heavier losses on militants,” the report read.
Attacks have increased since the withdrawal of US-led troops from neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, with the federal government accusing the Taliban authorities of sheltering terrorists — a charge they deny. However, the United Nations has warned of a “permissive environment” for militant groups in Afghanistan.
Government officials told AFP in September on condition of anonymity that the presence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — designated Fitna al Khawarij by the authorities — had increased in recent months.
That same month, opposition lawmakers accused the military of carrying out an air raid on militant hideouts that killed children.
Local village councils have repeatedly warned that sweeping counter-terrorism operations would risk harming civilians.</p><small>2025-10-06 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06192458f5ce325.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947020/sidra-amin-reprimanded-for-code-of-conduct-breach-during-india-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Sidra Amin reprimanded for code of conduct breach during India clash</strong></a><br><p>Top batter Sidra Amin was reprimanded for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct during their ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 match against India in Colombo.
India won Sunday’s match against Pakistan by 88 runs, with Sidra Amin scoring 81 runs during the encounter. She also become the first Pakistani batter to hit a six against India in a women’s ODI match.
The right-handed batter was found guilty of breaching Article 2.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to “abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international match.”
 






The incident occurred during the 40th over of Pakistan’s chase, when Sidra forcefully hit her bat onto the pitch after being dismissed.
In addition to the reprimand, one demerit point has been added to Sidra’s disciplinary record. This is her first offence in a 24-month period, ICC reports.
“Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points,” ICC reported.
On-field umpires Lauren Agenbag and Nimali Perera, third umpire Kerrin Klaaste and fourth umpire Kim Cotton had levelled the charges.
Sidra admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Shandré Fritz of the Emirates ICC International Panel of Match Referees, negating the need for a formal hearing.
Pakistan play their next match on Wednesday, October 8 against Australia.</p><small>2025-10-06 14:27</small></div><hr>
