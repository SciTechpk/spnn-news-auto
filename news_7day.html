The operation took place near the old Surkhab refugee camp in the district.
A CTD spokesperson said a heavy exchange of fire took place during the law enforcers’ raid on the terrorist hideout.
As a result, a suspected suicide bomber and his four accomplices were killed. The statement added that the terrorists had “planned to attack the police lines and Cade College Pishin”.
Security forces are conducting further investigation into the incident.
Last week, the CTD said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts.
In a statement, the CTD said eight armed men were killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area.
In a separate statement, the CTD said “six terrorists were killed in a fire exchange” during an intelligence-based operation in Barkhan.
The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
On February 5, security forces concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The operation was initiated as security forces responded to a spate of attacks across the province on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days.
During simultaneous operations, around 180 suspects were arrested and a huge cache of arms and ammunition was seized by Frontier Corps and police, officials said.</p><small>2026-02-23 05:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23090919a4801df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975148/mexican-military-kills-cartel-boss-el-mencho-in-us-backed-raid' target='_blank'><strong>Mexican military kills cartel boss ‘El Mencho’ in US-backed raid</strong></a><br><p>One of Mexico’s most notorious drug lords, Nemesio Oseguera, or “El Mencho,” was killed in a military raid on Sunday, sparking widespread retaliatory violence.
President Claudia Sheinbaum has been under mounting pressure from Washington to intensify her offensive against drug cartels blamed for producing and smuggling drugs, particularly the synthetic opioid fentanyl, across the border to the US.
Oseguera, 60, the mastermind of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) died in custody after being injured in a military operation by Mexican special forces in the town of Tapalpa on Mexico’s Pacific coast in Jalisco state, according to Mexico’s defense ministry.
His corpse arrived in Mexico City on Sunday afternoon in a heavily guarded convoy of National Guard troops.
Reuters had reported on Sunday that a new US-military-led task force played a role in the raid led and carried out by Mexican forces. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later posted on social media that the United States provided intelligence support.
Leavitt added that the Trump administration “commends and thanks the Mexican military for their cooperation and successful execution of this operation.”
After reports of El Mencho’s death, cartel henchmen blockaded highways with burning cars and torched businesses in more than a half a dozen states, paralyzing parts of the country. No civilian deaths have been reported.

In Jalisco’s popular beach resort of Puerto Vallarta, frightened tourists on social media described a “war zone” as plumes of dark smoke rose into the sky from around the bay.
Air Canada, United Airlines, Aeromexico and American Airlines suspended flights in the area.
Former cop turned kingpin
Oseguera, a former police officer, founded and oversaw the rapid rise of the CJNG, named for the western state of Jalisco that is home to one of Mexico’s biggest cities, Guadalajara.
In recent years, CJNG has expanded into one of Mexico’s most powerful cartels, known for violent tactics including forced labor and forced recruitment.
Under El Mencho’s leadership, CJNG also became a highly diversified criminal enterprise, expanding from drug trafficking to fuel theft, extortion, human smuggling, and complex financial frauds.
The cartel pioneered use of drones in attacks against civilians in remote regions of western Mexico as part of its rapid territorial expansion.
Sunday’s raid was one of Mexico’s highest-profile blows against drug gangs responsible for smuggling billions of dollars of drugs - including fentanyl - into the US.
In recent years, the leaders of the rival Sinaloa Cartel - Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman and Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada- were captured alive. Both are now in US prisons.
President Donald Trump’s administration lauded El Mencho’s killing, but the domestic violence it triggered highlighted the political balancing act Sheinbaum must strike as her government escalates its cartel offensive.
On Sunday, Sheinbaum stressed that activities in most areas of the country were proceeding as usual. Schools in various states across Mexico protectively canceled classes for Monday, according to announcements by state-level education departments.
Security experts were watching whether the raid and death of the cartel boss will fracture CJNG leadership and trigger bloody infighting.
“There will definitely be skirmishes between the various factions, and these spasms of violence could last for years,” said Carlos Olivo, a former US Drug Enforcement Administration assistant special agent in charge and an expert in CJNG.
Killing wins US praise
Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, previously ambassador to Mexico, said Oseguera’s killing was a “great development” for the US and Mexico, as well as the rest of Latin America.
In January after the US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Trump said “the cartels are running Mexico,” and warned “we are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels.”
Sheinbaum said she would strengthen efforts to cooperate with the U.S. to fight cartels., but vowed to uphold Mexico’s sovereignty and warned against any unilateral military action by the U.S. in Mexico.
Sheinbaum in a social media post on Sunday said security officials would provide information on the operation.</p><small>2026-02-23 04:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23085825f2b727f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975128/the-ecological-cost-of-pesticides' target='_blank'><strong>The ecological cost of pesticides</strong></a><br><p>Crop protection chemicals have become inseparable from modern agriculture. From cotton belts to vegetable clusters, pesticides are widely used to secure crop yields, protect quality and stabilise farm incomes. For decades, the policy conversation has focused mainly on how much pesticide was being applied and whether it was enough to prevent crop loss. Today, a more complex and uncomfortable question is emerging: what is the ecological price of this protection and who ultimately pays for it?
New international scientific assessments suggest that the ecological risk associated with pesticide use is increasing across many farming regions. The concern is not only about spray volume, but about toxicity intensity; how harmful the applied chemical mix is for insects, soil organisms and aquatic life. This shift in measurement changes the narrative. Even where total usage grows slowly, the biological damage potential may rise sharply due to stronger formulations and combined exposures.
For agricultural economies like Pakistan, this is not just an environmental debate. It is a purely farm management and agricultural economics issue. Agriculture depends on living ecological systems as pollinators, soil micro-organisms, beneficial insects and natural pest predators. These systems rarely appear in farm budgets, yet they silently support productivity. When pesticide regimes become more toxic or poorly targeted, these support systems weaken.
The consequences do not always appear immediately, but they do accumulate. Insects are usually the first to be affected. While pesticides are designed to eliminate crop pests, they also reduce non-target insect populations. This includes pollinators and beneficial predators that naturally control pest outbreaks. When beneficial insect numbers fall, farmers often face secondary pest surges. The response is typically more spraying, not less. Over time, the production system may slip into a chemical dependence cycle.

Areas with heavy pesticide reliance experience declining beneficial insect populations and weaker soil biology, which harms crop productivity

Soil biology is another hidden casualty. Many soil organisms are sensitive to chemical residues. They play a pivotal role in nutrient cycling, soil structure and moisture retention. When soil biodiversity declines, fertiliser efficiency drops and crop response becomes less predictable. Farmers compensate with more inputs, raising production costs.
Field-level observations across multiple countries show that areas with heavy pesticide reliance often experience declining beneficial insect populations and weaker soil biological activity. The economic effect is indirect but real: rising input needs, greater pest volatility and reduced resilience against shocks. Pakistan’s crop sector has seen steady growth in pesticide consumption over the past two decades.
Climate variability, pest pressure and yield targets have all contributed. However, advisory and monitoring systems have not expanded at the same speed. In many regions, pesticide retailers are the primary source of farmer guidance. Their commercial incentive is sales, not optimisation. As a result, overuse, repeated sprays and unverified chemical mixtures are commonly reported by growers themselves.
The cost implications are already visible. Crop protection chemicals now represent a significant share of variable production costs for many crops. When misuse reduces beneficial species, farmers must spray more frequently, pushing costs further upward. This pattern narrows margins and increases financial risk, especially for smallholders.
There is also a growing trade dimension. International food markets are tightening standards on chemical residues and sustainability compliance. Export buyers increasingly require traceability and safe-use assurances. Shipments that exceed residue limits face rejection and financial loss. For Pakistan’s horticulture and specialty crop exporters, pesticide governance is becoming a competitiveness factor, not merely a regulatory one.
The answer is not to demonise pesticides or call for blanket bans. Crop protection remains essential for food security. The real issue is efficiency and intelligence of use. The difference between necessary protection and ecological overreach lies in targeting, timing and dosage. Integrated pest management provides a tested pathway.
Instead of routine calendar spraying, integrated systems rely on field scouting, pest thresholds, biological controls and selective intervention. Chemicals are used when needed, not by default. Countries that have invested consistently in integrated pest management have reduced chemical load while maintaining yields. In Pakistan, such programmes exist but remain fragmented and underfunded. Scaling them requires institutional commitment rather than pilot projects alone.
Technology can strengthen this transition. Farm-level digital transformation including pest alert platforms, satellite crop monitoring and precision spraying tools may reduce unnecessary applications. But technology adoption is not an automatic. Farmers must have sufficient digital literacy to interpret advisories and act correctly. Building technology-enabled farm capability means shifting decisions from routine habit to data-supported judgments. When used properly, digital decision support lowers both ecological risk and input cost.
A major constraint is weak data. Reliable long-term pesticide usage and exposure records are limited across much of the developing world. Without measurements, risk management remains incomplete. National databases that track sales, usage patterns and ecological indicators would strengthen both policy-making and market confidence.
Farmer realities must remain central in any reform effort. Producers are already under pressure from rising fuel, fertiliser and seed costs. Sudden regulatory tightening without support would be counterproductive. Transition toward lower-risk systems must be accompanied by training, advisory access and financial incentives.
Global experience shows that reducing ecological pesticide risks and protecting farm profitability are compatible goals. In many cases, better targeting reduces chemical expenditure while improving ecosystem function. The benefits, however, appear over time, while adjustment requires immediate effort. That is why sustained policy backing matters.
Modern crop protection has delivered undeniable gains in farm yield and agricultural supply stability. But its rising ecological cost is now producing economic repercussions that can no longer be ignored. Agriculture is not separate from ecology; it is built on it. When ecological foundations weaken, farm economics eventually follow.
The policy choice ahead is not between productivity and protection. It is between short-term chemical intensity and long-term agricultural resilience. Smarter pest management, stronger advisory systems and technology-enabled farm capability can protect both biodiversity and balance sheets if acted upon in time.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, February 23rd, 2026</p><small>2026-02-23 03:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699a6702e17d2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974953/remittances-cant-replace-fdi' target='_blank'><strong>Remittances can’t replace FDI</strong></a><br><p>


Pakistan is increasingly relying on home remittances — now making up 9.3 per cent of GDP — which have proven to be one of the main drivers behind the recently attained, hard-earned economic stability. The authorities are upbeat about this and take it as a pinnacle of the economy. However, this is a dangerous path, as while remittances are healthy and can serve as a good stopgap measure, the real solution to our balance-of-payments worries is to build a portfolio of foreign direct investment (FDI).
Remittances cannot replace FDI and are not enough to kick-start industrialisation in the country. They fuel consumption in an economy that is already overly dependent on imports. Consumption growth further fuels imports and can never solve balance-of-payment concerns.
Pakistan needs to grow industrial capacity, enhance productivity, and achieve technology spillovers. To meet these objectives, investment (and financing) is required. These are needed to build import substitution capacity and generate export-led growth. Remittances do not support any of these factors, while efficiency- and market-seeking FDI surely do.
That is why it is imperative to focus on how to attract foreign investment, and for that, attaining the confidence of existing investors is essential. The policy framework should focus on cementing existing investments while also attracting fresh input. However, successive governments’ actions, especially in relation to taxation measures, are making the economy investment-averse instead.
This is visible in a weak investment-to-GDP ratio of around 14pc and FDI’s fate is no different (0.6pc of GDP). Both are falling, and that gap cannot be replaced by robust remittances. The latter’s growth of 40pc in the last two years is giving the economy breathing space to think beyond firefighting. It is a transitory period, not an end goal. It is borrowed time and should be utilised to formulate policies that enhance economic productivity and boost investment.

Successive governments’ actions, especially in relation to taxation measures, are making the economy investment-averse

There is no time left for complacency. The government should focus on long-term goals, and for that, improving industrial and business competitiveness is imperative. The government should think of taxation, energy, and regulatory policies through an investment lens and not get carried away with meeting short-term targets.
One such example is how the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) recently hurried to collect super tax dues right after the court decision came in the tax authority’s favour. Without debating how the retrospective application of taxes damages investor confidence, the manner in which the FBR asked companies to pay dues over the weekend was not appropriate. Some believe the FBR was under pressure to meet its monthly target, which is why it could not wait.
That is the government’s cash-flow problem. One can understand and be empathetic about it. However, firms have their own ways of managing cash flows. It would have been better if the FBR had allowed firms some time to arrange funds and pay the government, as per the court decision.
Investors watch and observe these episodes very carefully and make decisions accordingly. Already, past investor experience has not been positive. Some have suffered from policy inconsistencies; others complain about higher taxation and the increasing penetration of the informal economy, while almost every foreign investor is wary of delays in profit and dividend repatriation during periods of economic stress.
Not every economy faces these issues, and not every country is in dire need of investment. That is why Pakistan’s authorities must be extra careful about foreign investors’ sentiments.
However, the absence of broad-based economic recovery appears to be making the authorities jittery. Growth anxiety is building up. Persistent stability is creating an illusion of growth. The celebration is focused on growing remittances, which are now almost equal to goods and services exports combined and nearly double, as a share of GDP, compared to neighbouring economies. Some in government circles may believe that overreliance on remittances can pull the economy out of the woods and restore growth momentum.
It may, but the party would be short-lived. The key is to build production capacity and develop the requisite skill sets. The experience of many economies clearly shows that efficiency-seeking investment is the best way to achieve this. The message for the government is to align policies with long-term economic objectives and create much-needed jobs for a growing population.

In a statement, the chief minister said that all cultivable government land across Punjab would be leased to peasants for 10 years, with each beneficiary receiving up to five acres free of cost. No lease charges would be collected, she added.
She said farmers will also receive financial assistance along with land allocation to help them immediately begin cultivation. The initiative aims to boost agricultural productivity and support the rural economy.
The scheme was first announced on February 4 during her address at the inauguration ceremony of an electric bus service in Rajanpur, where she stated that around 250,000 acres of land would be distributed among deserving and underprivileged individuals.

Detailed guidelines and the application procedure are expected to be issued soon.
Separately, speaking at the launch ceremony of the CM Green Tractor Programme Phase-III, the chief minister formally initiated the balloting process and congratulated successful farmers.
She said that while 20,000 tractors were distributed over the past 25 years, her government has provided 31,000 tractors in just two years, setting a new record.
During the ceremony, she personally called selected farmers, including Hamza Liaquat from Bahawalpur, informing him of his success in the draw.
The chief minister said the Green Tractor Scheme was transforming the Punjab’s agricultural landscape, adding that the provision of modern machinery would significantly enhance crop yields. She reaffirmed that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz remained committed to farmer-friendly policies and would continue to prioritise agricultural development.

This perceived strength, sustained through administrative controls and political signalling rather than economic fundamentals, has become a silent killer on exports and a key driver of widening trade imbalances. What appears stable on the surface conceals deeper vulnerabilities: shrinking export competitiveness, rising imports, and a consumption-led growth model unsupported by productivity or reform.
The recent improvement in some macroeconomic indicators should not be mistaken for structural progress. These gains are largely ad hoc and cyclical, not the outcome of reforms in productivity, taxation, energy pricing, logistics, or export competitiveness. Pakistan has followed this path before — artificially supporting the currency until external pressures mount, the current account deteriorates, and the rupee eventually corrects sharply, inflicting greater economic pain.
A stable currency is not inherently harmful. But when domestic inflation runs higher than that of trading partners and the exchange rate is held rigid, exports steadily lose competitiveness. Over the past three years, the cost of Pakistan’s growers, manufacturers, and exporters has surged — energy tariffs, wages, financing costs, taxes, and compliance burdens have all risen sharply. Exchange rate adjustment, the most direct price-correcting mechanism, has been largely avoided.
The State Bank’s policy emphasis on containing imported inflation through a stable rupee coincided with historically high interest rates. While this may have moderated short-term price pressures, it significantly eroded export competitiveness. Exports compete on price, quality, reliability, and market access. On all four counts, Pakistan is under pressure, especially when compared to regional peers who actively manage costs and exchange rate alignment.

Exports compete on price, quality, reliability and market access; however Pakistan is under pressure on all four counts due to its currency

The logic behind falling exports is straight forward. Domestic costs increased sharply, the exchange rate remained broadly fixed around Rs280, export prices in dollar terms rose, and international buyers shifted to cheaper suppliers. When this happens, a “stable” currency becomes overvalued in real terms. What matters is not nominal stability but alignment with regional competitors. An appreciating real effective exchange rate hurts exports far more than moderate exchange rate volatility.
Pakistan’s failure to adjust the rupee in line with peers such as India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Cambodia has resulted in a double squeeze on exporters: rising domestic costs without any currency cushion. These countries allow gradual depreciation, keep energy relatively cheaper, offer export facilitation, and invest in logistics, including rail and waterways that reduce fuel dependence. Pakistan has done the opposite.
The damage is most visible in price-sensitive sectors with thin margins — textiles and ready-made garments, Basmati and coarse rice, sesame seeds, maize, fruits and vegetables, and light engineering goods. Pakistan’s Basmati, a geographical indicator and premium quality product, is rapidly losing shelf space due to higher prices compared to Indian Pusa varieties.

 

Currency depreciation, however, is not a magic solution. A weaker rupee does not automatically boost exports if key inputs are imported; energy remains expensive, taxes continue to rise, refunds are delayed, productivity stagnates, and market access remains limited. That is why some countries experience repeated depreciation without export growth, importing inflation instead. The issue is not weakness or strength, but balance.
Currency stability works when inflation is low, productivity is rising, and export costs are controlled. Currency rigidity becomes harmful when inflation is high and trading partners are adjusting. Pakistan’s export slowdown reflects not just exchange rate misalignment, but a broader cost and policy failure. Attempts to substitute competitiveness through rebates such as DLTL cannot offset a misaligned currency combined with a two per cent withholding tax shift from Final Tax Regime to Minimum Tax Regime and additional super tax on higher exports.
Recent data underscores the problem. Pakistan’s trade deficit widened by over 28pc to $22.04 billion in 7MFY26. The current account deficit has returned after a surplus last year. Exports fell by over 7pc during the same period, while imports rose by more than 9pc. A strong rupee has simultaneously eroded export competitiveness and made imports more lucrative.
Exchange rate policy has increasingly been treated as a symbol of political pride rather than an economic tool. Artificial strength may temporarily suppress imported inflation and please urban consumers, but it encourages imports and penalises domestic producers. Pakistan’s economy increasingly rewards consumption over production. Cash-driven spending on imported goods, luxury consumption, and speculative assets continue to grow, while export-oriented industries struggle.
Across Asia, successful economies have treated exchange rate competitiveness as a strategic tool, not a source of pride. China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh maintained competitive currencies aligned with export growth, attracting investment and building manufacturing depth. Pakistan’s insistence on currency rigidity ignores these lessons, resulting in de-industrialisation and repeated balance-of-payments stress.
Pakistan must allow the rupee to reflect economic fundamentals through a genuine market-based or credibly managed float. A realistic exchange rate would restore export competitiveness, discourage non-essential imports, incentivise domestic substitution, and reduce rent-seeking distortions in the foreign exchange market. It would also encourage remittances through formal channels and investment into productive sectors rather than speculative or cash-based avenues.
Concerns about inflation from a freer exchange rate are valid but overstated. Pakistan’s inflation is largely structural — driven by inefficiencies, energy losses, cross border smuggling under reported exports via land routes, supply chain wastage, and weak governance. Artificial currency strength merely masks these problems. Like a painkiller, it suppresses symptoms while worsening the disease.
The way forward requires shifting from currency pride to economic prudence. Policymakers must reduce administrative interference, lower the cost of doing business, reform taxation, document the cash economy, rationalise imports, and support export diversification and value addition. A strong economy is built on competitiveness and productivity, not an artificially strong currency.
Allowing the rupee to find its true value is not a sign of weakness. It is a prerequisite for restoring balance, credibility, and sustainable growth. Only then can Pakistan move from a cash-rich illusion to an export-led economic reality.

• Trump asking why Tehran has not ‘capitulated’ in the face of military build-up, US envoy Witkoff says• Iranian commander claims ‘enemy’ movements being monitored round the clock• Talks expected on Thursday if nuclear proposal furnished ‘in next 48 hours’• Washington ‘offered’ opportunities for investment in Iran’s oil industry
DUBAI: The United States has evacuated hundreds of troops from key bases in Qatar and Bahrain in what is described as a precautionary move as tensions with Iran continue to escalate, according to a report by The New York Times.
The withdrawal, which involved personnel stationed at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and facilities linked to the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, comes amid growing concern in Washington over the possibility of military confrontation with Tehran and the risk of Iran’s retaliatory strikes across the region.
Al Udeid, the largest US military installation in the Middle East, hosts around 10,000 troops and plays a central role in American air operations in the region. Officials said the redeployment was intended to reduce exposure of forces in the event of a sudden escalation.
The move has been widely interpreted as part of a contingency planning rather than a signal of imminent conflict.
US forces remain deployed across a network of bases in Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE.
Meanwhile, US negotiators are ready to hold another round of talks with Iran on Friday in Geneva if they receive a detailed Iranian proposal for a nuclear deal in the next 48 hours, Axios reported on Sunday, citing a senior US official.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday officials of Iran and US are expected to attend Oman-mediated talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on Thursday, noting that there is still “a good chance” of diplomatic solution to Tehran’s nuclear ambition.
Later, Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi in a post on X confirmed “US-Iran negotiations are now set for Geneva this Thursday, with a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalising the deal.”







Trump asks why Iran has not capitulated
US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Saturday that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal. In a Fox News interview, Witkoff said the president was “curious” about Iran’s position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.
“I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated’, because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t… I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated’, but why they haven’t capitulated,” he said.
“Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.”

 

Witkoff’s comments come after Araghchi said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days. Trump said on Thursday that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear programme.
Iran monitoring ‘enemy’ movements
An Iranian commander said on Sunday that his country’s forces are monitoring “enemy” movements around the clock amid rising tensions with the United States, according to an Anadolu report.
“All enemy movements are continuously monitored,” Ground Forces Commander Ali Jahanshahi said during a visit to a military unit in the city of Piranshahr in West Azerbaijan province near the Iraqi border.
“Thanks to their advanced capabilities, our soldiers will not allow any hostile action against this land,” he added in his comments cited by local media.
Iran and the US have differing views over sanctions relief in talks to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, a senior Iranian official said on Sunday.
“The last round of talks showed that US ideas regarding the scope and mechanism of sanctions relief differ from Iran’s demands,” the official said.
“Within the economic package under negotiation, the US has also been offered opportunities for serious investment and tangible economic interests in Iran’s oil industry,” the official said. However, he said Tehran will not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources.

An Indian army statement said three fighters were killed during a military operation in the high-altitude Kishtwar district after it received “credible intelligence of a rebel presence” in the area.
It added that security forces had recovered weapons from the site.
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, the youths were killed in the Chatroo forest area. It added that additional troops were deployed to the area. “All entry and exit points have been sealed,” it reported.
An attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Paha­lgam on April 22 last year resulted in the death of 26 people. While New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence, Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry questioning the credibility of India’s account of the events and saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
A day after the attack, India decided to immediately hold the Indus Waters Treaty in “abeyance”. For its part, Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin.
Roughly two weeks after the Pahalgam incident, India launched a series of strikes in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire.

The change confirmed by the UK Home Office means British citizens who also hold another nationality will be required to present a British passport when travelling to the UK. Those without one must apply for a “certificate of entitlement” attac­hed to their non-British passport at a cost of £589.
The measure is part of a broader overhaul of UK border systems requiring most travellers to obtain prior permission before entering the country.
Similarly, from February 25, visitors who do not hold British or Irish citizenship and do not require a visa to enter the country will need an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA), costing £16, before departure. According to the UK government, “Enforcing will mean that everyone who wants to come to the UK must have digital permission through either an ETA or an eVisa.”
The BBC reported that dual nationals cannot apply for an ETA and must have a certificate of entitlement instead, “with checks now carried out by airlines when departing en route back to the UK”.
Alarm among dual nationals
The changes have caused alarm among dual nationals, with some saying that they were unaware of the new requirements and now fear being stranded abroad. A British woman resident in Germany told The Guardian she was concerned her children could be affected, particularly her son, who was due to travel to the UK in the coming weeks.
“I’m really annoyed about being treated as Brexit collateral once again with this short-notice change of the rules,” she said.
Another long-term resident in Spain told the newspaper the requirement posed legal complications. Spain obliges non-nationals who naturalise as Spanish citizens to renounce their previous nationality. Although the UK permits dual nationality, presenting a British passport at a Spanish airport could jeopardise her Spanish citizenship.
“It seems a strange anomaly that while the UK is willing to recognise dual nationality, it refuses to recognise that a valid EU passport held by a UK citizen can give the right of entry,” she said.
The issue also affects British-born dual nationals who have never applied for a British passport. One London-born professional holding Italian citizenship was reported to have said he only recently realised he might be unable to return to the UK after a work trip because he does not possess a British passport.
A Home Office spokesperson said the policy forms part of a digitisation programme designed to create a seamless travel experience and strengthen border security.
Campaign group ‘The3million’ has called for a low-cost digital authorisation instead of the £589 certificate. With the deadline days away, dual nationals are scrambling to check passport status or begin applications amid fears that failure to comply could leave them stranded.

A day earlier, Trump said he was sending “a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there”.
But Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who heads the autonomous territory’s government, wrote on his Facebook page: “That will be ‘no thanks’ from us.”
“President Trump’s idea to send a US hospital ship here to Greenland has been duly noted. But we have a public health system where care is free for citizens,” he said.



Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen likewise told Danish broadcaster DR: “The Greenlandic population receives the healthcare it needs.
They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialised treatment, they receive it in Denmark.” He added: “It’s not as if there’s a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland.”

Danish forces evacuate US submarine crew member

AI-generated hospital ship
In Greenland, as in Denmark, access to healthcare is free for citizens. There are five regional hospitals across the vast Arctic island, with the one in the capital Nuuk serving patients from all over the territory, population 57,000.
Without explicitly mentioning the US proposal, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was “happy to live in a country where access to healthcare is free and equal for all. Where insurance or wealth does not determine whether one receives dignified treatment.”
Trump, in his Truth Social message on Saturday about the hospital ship, posted an AI-generated image of a US Navy medical vessel, USNS Mercy. “It’s on the way!!!” he added.







It was not immediately clear if that meant he was deploying that ship to Greenland.
The US president indicated the deployment was being carried out in coordination with Jeff Landry, appointed in December as the US Special Envoy to the Arctic island.
Aaja Chemnitz, who represents Greenland in the Danish Parliament, wrote on Facebook that, while Greenland’s health system had its share of problems, they were best resolved through cooperation with Denmark.
Denmark, she noted, “is one of the wealthiest and most educated countries, for example in the field of healthcare,” contrasting it with “the United States, which has its own healthcare system problems”.
US submarine
Danish forces evacuated a crew member from a US submarine off the coast of Greenland on Saturday after the sailor required urgent medical treatment, authorities said.
Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command, which oversees Danish operations in the region, said in a post on Facebook the crew member was flown to a hospital in Nuuk after a medical emergency on board the vessel.
Officials did not disclose the nature of the medical issue or give details about the submarine’s mission. Images posted online appeared to show the sail of a submarine surfacing in Nuuk’s bay.
Since returning to the White House last year, US President Donald Trump has argued that Washington needs to control mineral-rich Greenland — an autonomous Danish territory — for American national security.
Last month, Trump backed down from earlier threats to seize the Arctic island after striking a “framework” deal with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.
‘New normal’
Trump has repeatedly said he believes the United States must control Greenland to ensure US national security. Earlier threats he made to seize the territory, by force if necessary, have ebbed since he struck a “framework” deal with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.
The defence minister, Lund Poulsen, told DR he was not aware of a possible arrival of the suggested US hospital ship. “Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics,” he said.

WORDS are never just words. They carry history, suspicion and memory. A single sentence, spoken casually in Washington or by an American official, can travel thousands of miles and land like a strategic signal.
When US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told podcaster Tucker Carlson in an interview that “It would be fine if they (Israelis) took it all (Arab lands),” he may have intended a theological remark.
But in Arab capitals and the broader Muslim world, it was heard as something else — an endorsement of the ‘Greater Israel’ vision, peddled by Israeli Zionists.
The reaction was not scattered, rather collective. Fou­r­teen governments — among them Pakistan, Eg­ypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, Türkiye, Indonesia and the State of Palestine — joined hands with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, League of Arab States and Gulf Cooperation Council to denounce the remarks.
Their joint statement did not hide behind soft language, expressing “strong condemnation and profound concern” and affirming “categorical rejection of such dangerous and inflammatory remarks, which constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region.”
This is not how governments usually react to a casual gaffe by an official. This is how they react when they feel something foundational is being questioned.
The controversy began when Mr Huckabee referred to the biblical promise of land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates. When asked if Israel had the right to that territory, he replied that it would be fine if Israel took it all.

 

The map implied by that verse in the book of Genesis includes not only the occupied Pale­s­t­inian territories but also parts of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
Sovereignty and international law
There were several reasons for the sharp reaction from Arab and Muslim states.
Firstly, it relates to the core issue of sovereignty of other states. In a region that has witnessed occupation and annexation, even rhetorical acceptance of territorial expansion triggers deep anxiety.
The second reason is the long-running Palestine dispute as the two-state formula, though weakened, remains the diplomatic touchstone. Arab governments see the ambassador’s remark as undermining any claim that US still backs a political horizon for Palestinian statehood.
Thirdly, the fear of domestic backlash forced Muslim leaders to react promptly. Cairo, Amman, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh justify cooperation with the US on the understanding that the US guarantees their territorial integrity. But when a senior American official app­e­a­rs to bless expansion, that understanding fades.
Fourthly, the statement meant setting a precedent. Diplomacy works on signals. An ambassador’s words are not treated as personal musings; they are read as indicators.
International law is clear on the basic principle that territory can’t be acquired by force. The UN Charter rests on sovereign equality and territorial integrity.
“The ambassador’s remarks regarding Isr­ael’s territorial acquisitions in the Middle East are deemed unwarranted and represent a clear contravention of established international norms… Furthermore, as an accredited envoy, he is precluded from endorsing aggressive act­i­ons,” Ahmer Bilal Soofi, president of the Res­earch Society of International Law, told Dawn.
The dispute over West Bank or East Jerusalem, notwithstanding, there is no legal doctrine to validate scripture-based territorial claims. Borders in the modern state system can only be changed by treaty or mutual deal.
“Arab leaders don’t expect Israel to cross the Jordan River, but the real question is whether the West Bank will be fully annexed. The full annexation of the West Bank would be a problem for normalisation,” said Adam Weinstein of the Quincy Institute’s Middle East Programme.
That is why the joint statement framed the issue in legal terms besides noting that such remarks contradict the stated vision of de-escalation and a political settlement leading to an independent Palestinian state.
Implications for US policy
For Washington, the implications go beyond one interview.
American influence in the Middle East does not run on aircraft carriers alone; it is anchored in the carefully maintained belief that Washington, despite its tilt towards Israel, still values stability. Egypt’s strategic location, Jordan’s role, Saudi Arabia’s oil leverage and the Gulf states’ security partnerships, all rest on that understanding.
If the Arab public concludes that US quietly supports territorial expansionist visions, their governments will face a higher political cost in sustaining cooperation with Washington. The consequences may not lead to dramatic breakups, but may yield hesitation, reduced diplomatic flexibility, and greater openness to other powers such as China and Russia.
Trust in this region is thin and expensive. Once eroded, it cannot be easily restored.
Mr Huckabee later attempted to clarify what he said. He argued that Israel does not want such territory and that his remarks were theological, not policy-related.







On social media, he also denounced the so-called Khazar theory as an “odious conspiracy theory” and accused “Islamist accounts” run from countries like Pakistan and Turkiye of spreading false smears about Israel. In doing so, he reframed the backlash as the product of anti-Semitic disinformation. By naming Pak­istan and Turkiye, both signatories to the con­demnation, he personalised the dispute.
That may satisfy the domestic audience in US, but it will do little to calm the Middle East, or even wriggle his government out of the tight spot he has put it in.
“The Ambassador’s statement has placed his sending state in a precarious position. Should the government endorse… this irresponsible statement… [it] would potentially incur significant costs… Conversely, if the government disavows his comment… he would have demonstrably exceeded his authority as an envoy under the Vienna Convention,” Mr Soofi explained.
In such a scenario, dissociation from his irresponsible views would necessitate his removal as an envoy as a minimum measure,” he maintained.

The capital Kyiv, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the full-scale invasion, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified assaults amid freezing winter temperatures.
“Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said of the attack on social media, adding that Russia launched about 50 missiles and 300 drones overnight.
“The main target of the attack was the energy sector. Ordinary residential buildings were also damaged, and there is damage to the railway.” The intense barrage came the same day Hungary said it would block the EU’s latest package of sanctions against Russia, unless Ukraine re-opens a key oil pipeline that supplies the country.

Drone attacks prompt suspension of operations at Moscow airports for hours

Ukraine says the Druzhba pipeline that crosses its territory to deliver Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary was damaged late January by Russian strikes.

 

In Kyiv and its region, the Sunday overnight strikes killed one man and wounded a dozen more, among them four children, Ukraine’s national police said.
This news agency saw rescuers sifting through debris of a largely destroyed two-storey house in Kyiv’s suburb of Sofiivska Borshchagivka.
“I felt the building shaking. It was clearly a hit, and the force (of the explosion) was strong. I jumped up because my dog got scared too,” Olga, a 48-year-old woman who lives in the settlement, said.
Anton, also from the area, said there were no military installations in Sofiivska Borschagivka. “Only people live here — schools, kindergartens, private houses — so it’s definitely not connected to any military facilities or any kind of industry,” he said.
Moscow airports
Moscow airports were back in operation on Sunday evening after hours-long suspensions imposed by aviation regulator Rosaviatsia over drone attacks which the city’s mayor said had been repelled.
Rosaviatsia said all major Moscow airports were open for arrivals and departures, subject to consultation with authorities.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, in a succession of posts on Telegram, said 20 Ukrainian drones had been destroyed or intercepted en route to Moscow from about 3pm.
‘Act of terrorism’
The Russian army said it had carried out a mass strike targeting facilities used by Ukraine’s military, saying all targets were hit, in a standard comment for such attacks.
The Russian bombardment on Ukr­aine, which included ballistic and cruise missiles, prompted heigh­tened vigilance across the country, all the way to the western border.
Ukraine’s energy ministry said consumers in six eastern and southeastern region were without power after the strikes.
Authorities in Russia’s western Belgorod region, meanwhile, said two man died after a Ukrainian drone strike. Poland’s Operational Command said it scrambled jets after detecting “long-range aviation of the Russian Federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine”.
In one attack, an explosion rocked a store in central Lviv, a western Ukrainian city near the Polish border far from the front line that has been largely spared the worst of the conflict.
Explosions ripped through a central shopping street at around midnight, killing a policewoman and wounding 25 people after officers responded to a reported break-in. Hours later, law enforcement said it had detained a Ukrainian woman suspected of carrying out the bomb attack, adding that an investigation was ongoing.
“This is clearly an act of terrorism,” mayor Andriy Sadovyi said. Ukraine’s interior ministry later said “there is every reason to believe that the crime was committed on the orders of Russia”.

ISLAMABAD: Amid alerts already raised by two key federal ministries, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has invited expert and public opinion on a rather quick and upfront four-year payback period for a $432 million government-to-government inve­stment bet­ween state-owned entities of Pakistan and Azerbaijan in the oil sector.
Ogra has scheduled a public hearing for March 2 and sought comments from stakeholders, including the general public, on “whether the proposed payback period of four years is justified” and whether the project would affect regional transportation costs compared to existing road movement.
The project has to mostly use local resources and dollar-based returns to cover full investment in four years, which has already been objected to by the Ministry of Finance.
The proposal involves a 20-inch, 256-kilometre pipeline from Faisalabad to Thallian (Section I) near Islamabad to carry about seven million tonnes per annum (MTPA), extendable to 10 MTPA.
It would then convert to a 12-inch line for 172km to Tarujabba near Peshawar (Section II) with a capacity of five MTPA, and an eight-inch, 9km line from Thallian to Faqirabad (Section III).
The cost of Section I has been put at $320m, followed by $94m for Section II and $17.5m for Section III. According to Ogra, the project life is 30 years.
The regulator has also sought public input on whether the claimed throughput volumes are fair and justified, whether the proposed capacities for the three pipeline sections can handle the intended volumes over the project life, and whether the proposed storage capacity — 60,000 tonnes each at Faisalabad and Thallian and 50,000 tonnes at Tarujabba — is appropriate for the projected throughput.
The project cost cleared by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet five months ago was $300m, while two ministries had raised reservations over guaranteed returns in dollar terms on the transportation of petroleum products.
The Machike-Thallian-Tarujabba white oil pipeline is to be developed on a government-to-government basis with Azerbaijan’s SOCAR, the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and Pakistan State Oil through a joint project company. The project, being pursued as a “strategic investment” from Azerbaijan, has long been pushed by the FWO through local resources.
The ECC had “approved the terms and conditions” proposed by the Petroleum Division to enable the launch of this strategic project, which was expected to strengthen bilateral friendship, trade and investment ties between Pakistan and Azerbaijan by the end of August 2025.
Power Minister Awais Leghari had cautioned against guaranteed return in dollar terms, saying the government should have learnt lesson from the experience of independent power producers (IPPs).
He advocated that “all aspects of the investment proposal should be checked thoroughly for cost and internal rate of return (IRR), keeping in view the instance of independent power producers”, according to official minutes of the meeting.
SOCAR had set a “ship or pay” condition for investment in the project on the pattern of “take or pay” in power purchase agreements with independent power producers that required full payment for the pipeline capacity (about 7-8 MPTA) even if petroleum products are unable to be moved for some reason.
Moreover, the Ministry of Finance raised questions over the upfront payback period and noted that “dollarised return was being considered only in the context of foreign investment and should not be applicable in the event that foreign investment does not materialise”.
There was a view that returns being secured for foreign investment could not be allowed on local investment, and payback should be of a longer term.
The Ministry of Finance also demanded rationalising the interest rate assumptions, a more rational weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and an increase in payback period to seven years instead of four to avoid a higher tariff impact at the early stages of the project.
It also wanted the Petroleum Division to finalise the technical details relating to inland freight equalisation margin and declaration of default mode of transport, instead of Ogra, considering the peculiar needs of the sector.
However, the Petroleum Division argues that such amendments would make the key project unattractive.
Therefore, the ECC has overruled the finance ministry’s demand for rationalising payouts and containing other liabilities as well as the power minister’s views and “observed that the project would open new vistas for future investment and hence, must be seen in a larger strategic perspective and be understood as an investment opportunity”, according to the official record.
The FWO had originally sought 14.6 per cent IRR and 25pc equity IRR.
The ECC has, nevertheless, agreed to the cautions to the extent that “dollarised return would be applicable only in the event of foreign investment coming into the project”.
At present, approximately 70pc of petrol and diesel is transported by road, whereas 28pc is being moved through an existing pipeline from Karachi to Machike and 2pc is carried by railway.
A revised version also provided for guaranteed quantities for oil transportation, for which Ogra would allow a transportation tariff. The tariff will be in US dollars with optimal utilisation of pipeline capacity in “default mode of transportation”.
Under this, all oil marketing companies would be bound to commit minimum annual pipeline volumes and shortfall would be covered against their inland freight equalisation margin.
According to the agreed mechanism, Ogra will design a regulatory framework to ensure optimal utilisation of the pipeline by declaring it a default mode of transportation.

A senior police officer said the armed men barged into the construction company’s camp in Mula area, some 60 km from Khuzdar, and kidnapped 11 workers including a project manager.
“Six labourers belonged to Sindh province who were working with the com­pany while five others are residents of Khuzdar and other areas of the province,” the police official said.
He said the armed men attempted to take away arms and ammunition of the police station but police personnel offered resistance, forcing the kidnappers to flee.
Six out of 11 labourers have been identified as Project Manager Gul Sher, Ghulam Sarwar, Abdul Malik Bugti, Maulana Bakhsh, Muhammad Irfan and Ikhtiar.
Security forces reached the area after getting information of the incident and launched a search operation in the area. However, no arrest of kidnappers or recovery of labourers was reported despite the passage of 24 hours.
The second kidnapping incident took place in Barkhan district where officials said over 30 armed men attacked the crushing plant in Dhola Nadi area and after damaging the plant they kidnapped three workers and fled from the area.
“Armed men abducted three labourers working at the crashing plant in Musakhail area,” Barkhan deputy commissioner Abdullah Khosa said, adding that the kidnappers also damaged the plant.
They also took away three police personnel posted at a check post along with their weapons.
Soon after the incident, SSP Barkhan Dr Saad Afridi reached the area along with a heavy police contingent and launched a search operation.
“Prompt response of the police forced the armed men to release the kidnapped police personnel and escape to nearby mountains along with three labourers,” the SSP said, adding that the operation is continuing in the mountainous area. “Soon the labourers will be recovered,” he said.

After a counter-attacking 63 by David Miller and some late hitting from Tristan Stubbs took South Africa to 187-7, the defending champions were all out for 111 in 18.5 overs, failing badly in their first chase of the tournament.
Left-arm quick Marco Jansen finished with 4-22, while left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 as the South African bowlers exposed India’s fragile batting line-up.
“Great performance. Very different type of wicket to what we’ve had here, so great to see the boys assess that pretty early and adapt their skills to execute their plans,” said South Africa captain Aiden Markram.
“We’re really pumped for the bowling group. They’ve been working hard, started the comp a bit tough, but the way they rocked up tonight was a great effort.” Hot favourites to defend their crown on home soil, India will need to win their two remaining Super Eight games against Zimbabwe and the West Indies to have a chance of qualifying.
But the magnitude of the defeat means they will take a poor net run rate forward and that could prove pivotal if their Super Eights group is tight.
“We bowled really well, but we could have batted a little better,” said India captain Suryakumar Yadav.

Fans silenced
“Sometimes you’ve got to think, if you’re chasing 180-185, you can’t win the game in the power play, but you might lose it.
“We lost too many wickets in the power play.” Both teams were unbeaten in group phase and the game was a rematch of the 2024 T20 World Cup final in Barbados, which India won.
India’s unbeaten run in the tournament had stretched back to their defeat in the semi-final against eventual winners England in 2022.
South Africa struck immediately in India’s chase when Markram opened the bowling and dismissed Ishan Kishan with his off-spin.
Abhishek Sharma got his first runs of the tournament, after three ducks, with a four off Markram to get the 82,000 crowd on their feet in the cavernous stadium, which has a reported capacity of 130,000.
The joy of Indian fans was short-lived, and they were silenced as left-arm quick Marco Jansen had Tilak Varma caught behind for one in the next over and removed the left-handed Abhishek for 15.
India needed a partnership, but Corbin Bosch dismissed Washington Sundar and Suryakumar, who toe-ended to midwicket, as the hosts slumped to 51-5.
Left-arm spinner Maharaj took three wickets in one over to dismiss Hardik Pandya (18), Rinku Singh (0) and Arshdeep Singh (one) to shut the door on India.
Shivam Dube made 42 at the end, but it was too little too late, and when he fell off Jansen, last man Jasprit Bumrah followed the next ball.
Batting first after winning the toss, South Africa slipped to 20-3 before Miller and Dewald Brevis, who hit 45, put on 97, to guide South Africa to 187-7.
Tristan Stubbs had a late cameo that saw him crash an unbeaten 44 off 24 balls and launch the final two balls of the innings both for six off Pandya.
India’s Jasprit Bumrah took 3-15.</p><small>2026-02-22 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22232736a3dcc56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975011/hamas-official-says-group-in-final-stage-of-choosing-new-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas official says group in final stage of choosing new chief</strong></a><br><p>A senior Hamas official told AFP on Sunday that the group was in the final phase of selecting a new leader, with two prominent figures competing for the position.
Hamas recently completed the formation of a new Shura Council of more than 80 members, a consultative body largely composed of religious scholars, as well as a new 18-member political bureau, the official said.
Since Tel Aviv’s war on Gaza began on October 7, 2023, in response to Hamas’ attack on Israel, Israeli forces have killed several Hamas leaders, including two former chiefs. The country has also killed more than 70,000 Palestinians.
“The movement has completed its internal elections in the three regions and has reached the final stage of selecting the head of the political bureau,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly.
He said the race for the group’s leadership was now between Khaled Meshaal and Khalil al-Hayya.
A second Hamas source confirmed the development, while a third source said the new leader would lead the movement only “for one year”.
Despite a US-brokered ceasefire that entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in Gaza, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement.
Members of the council are elected every four years by representatives from Hamas’s three branches: the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and the movement’s external leadership.
Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails are also eligible to vote.
The council subsequently elects the political bureau, which in turn selects the head of the movement.
Experienced leaders
Both Meshaal and Hayya have years of experience within the movement.
Hayya, 65, a Gaza native and Hamas’s chief negotiator in ceasefire talks, has held senior roles since at least 2006, according to the US-based NGO the Counter Extremism Project (CEP).
Meshaal, who led the political bureau from 2004 to 2017, has never lived in Gaza. He was born in the West Bank in 1956.
He joined Hamas in Kuwait and later lived in Jordan, Syria and Qatar. The CEP says he oversaw Hamas’s evolution into a political-military hybrid.
He currently heads the movement’s diaspora office.
Last month, a Hamas source told AFP that Hayya enjoyed backing from the group’s armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades.
After Israel killed former Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July 2024, the group chose its then-Gaza chief, Yahya Sinwar, as his successor.
Israel accused Sinwar of masterminding the October 7 attack. He, too, was killed by Israeli forces in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
Hamas then opted for a five-member leadership committee based in Qatar, postponing the appointment of a single leader until elections, given the risk of the new chief being targeted by Israel.</p><small>2026-02-22 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22214514922957c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975007/in-pictures-pakistanis-embrace-quiet-moments-of-prayer-sehri-and-iftar-during-ramazan' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Pakistanis embrace quiet moments of prayer, sehri and iftar during Ramazan</strong></a><br><p>Ramazan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, is a time when Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, focusing on prayer, charity and deepening their connection with the Almighty.
Homes and mosques come alive with pre-dawn meals (sehri) and the evening ritual of breaking the fast.
Across Pakistan, communal iftars bring people together, as neighbours, friends and even strangers share meals to end the day’s fast. Held in mosques, community centres and public spaces, these gatherings are about more than just food, as they nurture unity, strengthen bonds, and foster a sense of togetherness.
They also create spaces for conversation, understanding and generosity, embodying the spirit of the holy month.
Photographs from cities across Pakistan capture these quiet, meaningful moments: prayers in reflection, the preparation of iftar, the laughter and chatter around shared tables, and the calm anticipation as the sun sets.
Together, they paint a picture of Ramazan as a time of patience, gratitude, humility and spiritual renewal.

Under the special directions of Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, police have continued comprehensive operations against professional beggars and their facilitators in the federal capital, according to a press release.
Acting on these instructions, legal action is also being taken against professional beggars who harass citizens on roads, intersections, markets, and commercial areas.
“Facilitators and contractors who provide transportation and logistical support to beggars are being identified through Safe City surveillance cameras and human intelligence,” the release said.
“During the ongoing year, police arrested 588 professional beggars and registered cases against them under the Islamabad Prevention of Beggary Act.”
Additionally, legal action is also being taken against parents who hand over their children to criminal elements for begging. Many criminals disguised as beggars have also been found involved in street crimes in different areas, it added.
All police officers have been clearly directed to further intensify and make these operations more effective. Citizens are requested to discourage professional beggars and immediately report any such activity to the police emergency helpline “Pucar-15.”
Islamabad Police have also conducted eight grand search and combing operations.
During search operations carried out last week, a total of 1,340 individuals, 604 houses, 10 hotels, 21 shops, 428 motorcycles, and 137 vehicles were checked. Additionally, 86 suspicious individuals, including 20 foreigners, along with 25 motorcycles, were shifted to respective police stations for verification, the release said.
The IGP Islamabad has directed that these operations should continue throughout the district to eliminate organised crime. The primary objective of these operations is to protect the lives and property of citizens.
Islamabad Police have appealed to citizens to cooperate during checking and immediately report any suspicious activity to the nearest police station.</p><small>2026-02-22 18:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22215537712b075.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975008/firing-during-taraweeh-prayers-in-kps-charsadda-kills-4-injures-several-police' target='_blank'><strong>Firing during taraweeh prayers in KP’s Charsadda kills 4, injures several: police</strong></a><br><p>SHABQADAR: Four people, including a father and son, were killed and several others injured when gunfire broke out during taraweeh prayers at a mosque in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Charsadda district on Sunday, police and local sources said.
According to local sources, the firing occurred during prayers at the Aldadkhel Mosque in the Battagram area of Shabqadar tehsil, Charsadda district, and started in front of worshippers inside the mosque.
The incident reportedly stemmed from a dispute between two parties, sources said.
Those killed from the first party were identified as Parvez, son of Mehrdal, and Inayat, son of Jan Muhammad, while from the second party, Ayaz, son of Torsam, and Zakir Ayaz, residents of Aldadkhel in the Battagram area of Shabqadar tehsil, were killed.
After receiving information about the incident, Rescue 1122 Shabqadar sent ambulances to the scene and transported the deceased and injured to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, Shabqadar, a statement from the rescue team said.
Meanwhile, police said an investigation into the incident has been initiated.</p><small>2026-02-22 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22094546e08ecf3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974894/over-80-terrorists-killed-as-armed-forces-strike-7-camps-along-pakistan-afghanistan-border' target='_blank'><strong>Over 80 terrorists killed as armed forces strike 7 camps along Pakistan-Afghanistan border</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani airstrikes on Afghanistan killed “more than 80 terrorists,” security sources said on Sunday, in a retaliatory operation against groups responsible for recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.
Pakistan struck seven “terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban of [Fitna al Khwarij] and its affiliates and [the Islamic State-Khorasan Province] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting announced in a post early Sunday on the social media platform X.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Security sources said late Sunday evening that, “Last night, Pakistan’s intelligence-based airstrikes destroyed seven centres of Fitna al-Khawarij TTP in three provinces of Nangarhar, Paktika and Khost, in which more than eighty Khawarij have been confirmed killed, while more are expected.”
They added that the centres targeted included “New Centre No. 1 and New Centre No. 2 in Nangarhar, Khwariji Maulvi Abbas Centre in Khost, Khwariji Islam Centre, Khwariji Ibrahim Centre in Nangarhar, and Khwariji Mullah Rahbar and Khwariji Mukhlis Yar in Paktika.”
Per the information ministry, the action was taken, “in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan, including Imam Bargah at Islamabad, one each in Bajaur and Bannu, followed by another incident today in Bannu during the holy month of Ramazan.”
“Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij on the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers. Responsibilities for these attacks were also claimed by Afghanistan-based Pakistani Taliban belonging to Fitna al Khwarij (FAK) and their affiliates, and Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP),” the ministry said.

 

It asserted that “Pakistan has always strived for maintaining peace and stability in the region, but at the same time, the safety and security of our citizens remains our top priority”, adding that the action against the seven camps and hideouts was “a retributive response”, carried out based on “intelligence-based selective targeting”.
“Despite repeated efforts by Pakistan to urge the Afghan Taliban Regime to take verifiable measures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the ministry noted.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates [that the] Interim Afghan Government […] fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan, as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost. Pakistan also expects the international community to play a positive and constructive role by urging the Taliban regime to stand by its commitments as part of [the] Doha Agreement to deny use of its soil against other countries; an act vital for regional and global peace and security.”
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, in a post on X, stated that the strikes by the “Pakistan Air Force were retribution for the innocent lives lost to terrorism”.
He maintained that the strikes were an “answer to the tears of every mother who has sacrificed her son for the homeland”.
Chaudhry issued a stern warning, stating that while “Pakistan desired peace, it would not make compromises on its safety, land, and people”.
“Whoever looks at us with evil intent, we will destroy them, and no one will be spared,” the minister said.







Kabul protests
Meanwhile, the Taliban regime in Kabul called the strikes a violation of its sovereignty, saying “an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time”, Reuters reported.
The news agency quoted the Afghan foreign ministry as saying that it had summoned Pakistan’s ambassador over what it described as violations of Afghan airspace and the bombing of civilians, calling the strikes “a provocative act”.
A Taliban spokesperson also claimed the attacks had killed and injured dozens of people, but Pakistani authorities termed such claims a “false and malicious narrative designed to create cover for terrorist sanctuaries”.
They maintained that TTP terrorists routinely blended into civilian areas and used non-combatants as human shields, adding that Pakistan’s operational planning accounted for this, and forces took measures to reduce or eliminate any collateral damage.
They described the actions as a “limited, proportionate response to an ongoing terror wave”, which saw mass casualty attacks inflicted on Pakistani civilians and security forces.
Photos from Nangarhar’s Bihsud district – one of the locations Afghan authorities claim were targeted by Pakistan – showed people using a bulldozer to search to clear the rubble of a destroyed building, which was being guarded by Taliban fighters.
Souring relations
There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded.
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire.
Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast.

 

Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault.
Then, on Saturday, Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district.
In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted.
On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable.
Not the first time
In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR.
The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.</p><small>2026-02-22 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22220729ad4b37a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975009/iran-agreed-secret-shoulder-fired-missile-deal-with-russia-report-claims' target='_blank'><strong>Iran agreed secret shoulder-fired missile deal with Russia, report claims</strong></a><br><p>Iran agreed a secret 500 million euro ($589 million) arms deal with Russia to acquire thousands of advanced shoulder-fired missiles, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
The agreement, signed in Moscow in December, commits Russia to deliver 500 man-portable “Verba” launch units and 2,500 “9M336” missiles over three years, the FT said, citing leaked Russian documents seen by the FT and several people familiar with the deal.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report.
Under the deal, the deliveries are scheduled in three tranches, running from 2027 through 2029, the FT said.
The deal was negotiated between Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport and the Moscow representative of Iran’s Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL), the FT claimed.
Tehran formally requested the systems last July, according to a contract seen by the FT. In June last year, US forces struck Iran’s three main nuclear sites as the country joined Israel’s military campaign against Iran.
President Donald Trump said Iran’s key nuclear facilities were destroyed in the attack. However, according to a preliminary US intelligence assessment at the time, the US airstrikes did not destroy Iran’s nuclear capability and only set it back by a few months.
Iranian officials have repeatedly said Tehran had recovered from the damage incurred during the war and that its capabilities are better than ever.
Russia has a strategic partnership treaty with Iran, although it does not include a mutual defence clause.
Earlier in February, a Russian naval corvette conducted manoeuvres with the Iranian navy in the Gulf of Oman this week, according to Russia’s Defence Ministry.</p><small>2026-02-22 17:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22210935c42a01c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975006/israel-disqualifies-its-own-bobsleigh-team-over-false-statements-to-officials-report' target='_blank'><strong>Israel disqualifies its own bobsleigh team over false statements to officials: report</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Olympic officials have disqualified Israel’s four-man bobsleigh team from finishing their event today, Times of Israel reported on Sunday.
The Olympic Committee of Israel told the publication that it has prevented the country’s four-man bobsleigh team from taking part in today’s competition after one athlete provided false information to officials to let teammate Ward Fawarseh compete in his place.
Per the report, Israel had raced on Saturday with Adam Edelman, Menachem Chen, Uri Zisman, and Omer Katz. Although the team was originally scheduled to compete this morning with Edelman, Chen, Fawarseh, and Katz, the disqualification has halted their participation.
Fawarseh would have become Israel’s first Druze Olympian had he competed, but he arrived at the Games as an alternate and was only permitted to race if another team member was unwell.
“The bobsleigh team asked to include Ward, the substitute, in the competition. According to the rules, this is only permitted if one of the athletes is injured or ill,” the Olympic Committee of Israel said, according to Times of Israel.
“In order to make this possible, one of the team members — encouraged by his teammates — declared that he was unwell. He even went for a medical examination and signed an affidavit so that the Olympic Committee could request approval for a substitution.”
After admitting that he had lied, the athlete told the head of the delegation that he “had acted improperly,” forcing the Olympic Committee to withdraw the request and disqualify the move, the OCI said.
The committee called the team’s actions “improper” and said they “go against fair and sportsmanlike conduct.”
After the first two runs on Saturday, Israel’s team was in 24th place out of 27, following crashes by three sleds during the second run.
Previous controversy
The team had made headlines earlier this week as well when a commentator on Swiss channel RTS said Adam Edelman’s supportive comments of Israel’s more-than-two-year bombardment of Gaza, which has resulted in the deaths of over 70,000 people and the destruction of most of the territory’s infrastructure, should have resulted in him being barred from the Olympics.
“Edelman, first appearance at an Olympic Games, who defines himself and I quote ‘as a Zionist to the core’,” remarked the commentator, Stefan Renna, as Edelman and teammate Chen began their two-man bobsleigh run on Monday.
The commentator went on to tell viewers that Edelman had posted on social media “in favour of the genocide in Gaza. I remind you that genocide is the term used by the United Nations commission of inquiry”.
Renna also commented that Edelman had “said the Israeli military intervention was, I quote, the most morally justified war in history”.
He suggested Edelman should have been barred from the Milan-Cortina Games on the same basis that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to allow Russian athletes to appear if they had made pro-war remarks regarding their country’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Edelman was furious and hit back on his Instagram account.
“I am aware of the diatribe the commentator directed towards the Israeli bobsled team on the Swiss Olympic broadcast today,” he wrote.
“I can’t help but notice the contrast: Shul Runnings is a team of 6 proud Israelis who’ve made it to the Olympic stage,” he said in a reference to the Israeli team’s nickname, a play on the film “Cool Runnings” about the debut of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics.
“No coach with us. No big program. Just a dream, grit and unyielding pride in who we represent. Working together towards such an incredible goal and crushing it. Because that’s what Israelis do. I don’t think it’s possible to witness that and give credence to this commentary.”
The Israeli embassy in Switzerland reacted robustly to the commentary.
“We are deeply appalled by the blatant abuse of a live Olympic broadcast by a Swiss RTS journalist,” the embassy posted on their X.
They demanded that action be taken against the journalist.
“@RadioTeleSuisse must publicly address this misconduct, issue a clear apology, and take decisive action against the journalist responsible.”
IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said it was not for them to comment.
“In terms of specific comments by a commentator, that is a matter you have to refer to the broadcaster,” he said at the IOC daily briefing at the Winter Olympics.</p><small>2026-02-22 16:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/222002097ddf8eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975004/us-secret-service-says-shot-dead-man-trying-to-access-trump-florida-estate' target='_blank'><strong>US Secret Service says shot dead man trying to access Trump Florida estate</strong></a><br><p>The US Secret Service said on Sunday that its agents had shot and killed an armed man who breached the security perimeter of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.
Trump was in Washington at the time of the incident, which officials said happened around 1:30 am (11:30am PKT).
Secret Service agents fired at a man after they saw him “unlawfully entering the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago early this morning,” agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a post on X.







The suspect, a man in his early 20s, “was observed by the north gate of the Mar-a-Lago property carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can,” the agency said in a statement.
Agents confronted the man and fired shots. No US officers were injured, the agency said that no “Secret Service protectees” were present in Mar-a-Lago at the time.

 


The individual was pronounced deceased.
“The only words that we said to him were drop the items, which means the gas can and the shotgun,” Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters.
“At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” Bradshaw said. A deputy and two Secret Service agents then shot him.
Trump, who often spends his weekends in Mar-a-Lago, has been the target of several assassination plots or attempts.
Earlier this month, Ryan Routh, 59, who plotted to assassinate the president at a Florida golf course in September 2024, two months before the US election, was sentenced to life in prison.
Routh’s planned attack on Trump came two months after an assassination attempt on the Republican leader in Pennsylvania, where 20-year-old Matthew Crooks fired several shots during a rally, one of them grazing Trump’s right ear.
That attack, in which a rallygoer was killed, proved to be a turning point in Trump’s return to power. Crooks was immediately shot and killed by security forces, and his motive remains unknown.
The incident was the latest in a series of episodes of political violence in a highly polarised country.
The name of the suspect in the Sunday incident has not been released while officials attempt to contact his relatives.</p><small>2026-02-22 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22195101c24db62.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975003/claim-about-pakistan-paying-interest-on-external-loans-of-up-to-8pc-is-misleading-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Claim about Pakistan paying interest on external loans of up to 8pc is ‘misleading’: finance ministry</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Finance on Sunday dismissed claims that Pakistan was paying up to eight per cent interest on external loans as “misleading,” clarifying that public external debt interest outflows rose by 80.4 per cent between fiscal years 2022 and 2025, not 84pc.
The ministry issued a clarification in response to “recent press commentary” on Pakistan’s external debt, saying the figures cited needed context to provide an “accurate and comprehensive understanding” of the country’s debt and interest payments.
“Pakistan’s total external debt and liabilities currently stand at $138 billion. This figure, however, encompasses a broad range of obligations, including public and publicly guaranteed debt, debt of public sector enterprises (both guaranteed and non-guaranteed), bank borrowings, private-sector external debt, and intercompany liabilities to direct investors,” the statement said.
“It is therefore important to distinguish this aggregate figure from external public (government) debt, which amounts to approximately $92bn,” it added.
It said that of total external public debt, nearly 75pc comprised “concessional and long-term financing” obtained from multilateral institutions (excluding the International Monetary Fund) and bilateral development partners.
Only about 7pc of this debt consists of commercial loans, while another 7pc relates to long-term Eurobonds, it added.
“In light of this composition, the claim that Pakistan is paying interest on external loans of ‘up to 8pc’ is misleading. The overall average cost of external public debt is approximately 4pc, reflecting the predominantly concessional nature of the borrowing portfolio,” it stated
With respect to interest payments, it clarified that public external debt interest outflows increased from $1.99bn in fiscal year 2022 to $3.59bn in fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 80.4pc, not 84pc as reported.
“In absolute terms, interest payments rose by $1.60bn over this period, not $1.67bn.”
The finance ministry also referred to the State Bank of Pakistan’s records, saying the total debt servicing payments to specific creditors during the period under reference were as follows: the IMF received $1.50bn, of which $580 million constituted interest; Naya Pakistan Certificates payments totaled $1.56bn, including $94m in interest; the Asian Development Bank received $1.54bn, including $615m in interest; the World Bank received $1.25bn, including $419m in interest; and external commercial loans amounted to nearly $3bn, of which $327m represented interest payments.
“While interest payments have increased in absolute terms, this rise cannot be attributed solely to an expansion in the debt stock.
Although the overall debt stock has increased slightly since fiscal year 2022, the additional inflows have primarily originated from concessional multilateral sources and the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) under the ongoing IMF-supported programme,” it maintained.
The finance ministry said that during 2022–23, Pakistan had faced heightened balance of payments pressures, which led to foreign exchange reserves falling below one month of import cover.
“In response, the government entered into an IMF EFF arrangement and mobilised financing from multilateral and other concessional partners. These measures played a critical role in rebuilding foreign exchange reserves and strengthening the country’s external account position.”
It further said that the increase in interest payments reflected prevailing global interest rate dynamics.
“In response to the inflation surge of 2021–22, the US Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate from 0.75-1.00pc in May 2022 to 5.25–5.50pc by July 2023.
Although rates have since moderated to around 3.75 pc, they remain significantly higher than 2022 levels. This global monetary tightening has kept international borrowing costs elevated and contributed to higher external interest payments,” the finance ministry said.
It concluded that the government remained committed to prudent debt management, transparency, and the continued strengthening of Pakistan’s macroeconomic stability.
“Accurate representation of debt statistics is essential to informed public discourse, and stakeholders are encouraged to consider the full context of Pakistan’s external debt structure and evolving global financial conditions.”</p><small>2026-02-22 15:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2219503004566c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975002/ttap-slams-govt-for-flawed-policies-warns-of-irreversible-damage' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP slams govt for ‘flawed’ policies, warns of ‘irreversible damage’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Leaders of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Sunday launched a broadside against the government, terming its national and foreign policies “flawed”, criticising its economic performance and governance decisions, and warning that the country was facing irreversible damage.
The leaders, including Taimur Khan Jhagra, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai and others, were speaking at a press conference in Islamabad.
Jhagra alleged that the government’s claims of economic recovery were incorrect and claimed that the government “lacked a plan to improve the country’s economic situation.”
Referring to recently released national poverty statistics, he said that in 2018, as much as 22 per cent of the population was living below the poverty line, but that figure had now risen to 29pc.
“Over the past 11 years, not only has poverty increased, but the gap between the rich and the poor has further widened, reaching a poverty level of 32.7pc,” he said.
Jhagra alleged that Punjab and Sindh were having the highest increases in poverty, with poverty rising by 41pc in Punjab and 33pc in Sindh. He also claimed that the government’s latest unemployment report reflected the highest jobless rate in 21 years.
He also alleged that special privileges were granted to Punjab’s inspector general and chief secretary, including the provision of 4500cc vehicles, and claimed that government officials in Punjab were provided with vehicles worth Rs 110 million.
Speaking at the presser, Khokhar expressed concern over rising regional tensions, stating that “clouds of war were looming over a neighbouring country.” He claimed that the United States had deployed naval fleets against Iran. “The heavy deployment is equal to the one deployed in 2003 before the attack on Iraq”, he added.
He also criticised Pakistan’s participation in US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace,” referring to a report by The Guardian, which claimed the event was attended by representatives of dictators and monarchies. He questioned Pakistan’s participation, stating that China stayed away.
He further alleged that just after participation in the meeting, news emerged that a deal regarding the Roosevelt Hotel had been done. He demanded that the government share the terms and conditions of the agreement.
Regarding the rise in terrorist incidents in the country, Khokhar stated that the government should strictly deal with the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other terrorist organisations.
TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Yousafzai showed concerns about the health of PTI founder Imran Khan, saying that the second injection will be administered to the incarcerated leader on Feb 24 or 25.
“The PTI founder must be taken to the Shifa International Hospital for medical treatment in the presence of his family and Dr Asim,” Yousafzai  demanded.
He also condemned recent tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan and suggested that the disputes with neighbouring countries should be resolved through dialogue.</p><small>2026-02-22 14:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22185438894db64.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975001/ctd-bannu-foils-militant-attack-as-detained-commander-killed-during-exchange-of-fire' target='_blank'><strong>CTD Bannu foils militant attack as detained commander killed during exchange of fire</strong></a><br><p>The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu said on Sunday it had thwarted a militant attack, adding that a detained commander of a banned outfit was killed in an exchange of fire, according to a press release.
The investigation team was transporting a “recently arrested, highly wanted terrorist commander, Osama alias Baghi”, to identify the site of the attack on Assistant Commissioner Miranshah Shah Wali Khan, when his accomplices opened indiscriminate fire on the convoy, attempting to release him, the release said.
“A fierce exchange of fire followed, during which Osama was killed by gunfire from his own associates,” it added.
The CTD team’s armoured personnel carrier (APC) was also hit, but no personnel were injured. The gun battle reportedly lasted around 40 minutes, it added.
It stated that the assault was aimed at freeing the detained commander during a crime-scene visit.
“In the retaliatory action by CTD’s Special Weapons and Tactical (SWAT) team, another terrorist was also killed. He was identified as Kamyab Khan alias Ikhlas Yar, a resident of North Waziristan.”
It added that the killed terrorist was wanted in multiple cases involving attacks on police and security forces.
“Weapons and explosives, including a Kalashnikov rifle with two magazines, two hand grenades, a card of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a CNIC and a mobile phone, were recovered from the slain militant.”
The release continued: “Bloodstains were found at several locations, indicating that the fleeing terrorists took their injured accomplices with them. Search and strike operations are underway to arrest the remaining suspects.”
Inspector General of Police (IGP) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Zulfiqar Hamid and the additional IGP CTD praised the professionalism of the officers involved and reiterated that indiscriminate action against terrorist elements would continue, particularly in the southern districts, to ensure lasting peace and order in the province, the release said.
On February 12, CTD announced the arrest of Osama alias Baghi from Bannu’s Pipal Bazaar area.
It said that he was an active commander of the newly formed organisation Ittehadul Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), established through a collaboration between the banned TTP and Gul Bahadur group.
During the interrogation, he confessed to his involvement in nine major terrorist activities, including the killing of AC Miranshah Shah Wali Khan and three others.</p><small>2026-02-22 14:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/221639366419d07.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974999/mqm-p-terms-resolution-passed-by-sindh-assembly-against-any-new-province-unconstitutional' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P terms resolution passed by Sindh Assembly against any new province ‘unconstitutional’</strong></a><br><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Sunday assailed the PPP-led Sindh government for moving a resolution in the provincial assembly against the creation of any new province, terming it “unconstitutional”.
On Saturday, the Sindh Assembly on Saturday passed a resolution declaring Karachi an “inseparable part” of the province and opposing any move that suggested otherwise.
Subsequently, on Sunday, MQM-P Convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui — flanked by Farooq Sattar, Mustafa Kamal and Senator Faisal Subzwari — addressed a press conference in Karachi on the development.
“Yesterday, a resolution against the Constitution of Pakistan was passed by one assembly of Pakistan,” Siddiqui said at the outset of his speech.
“A province had carried itself as if it were a separate country,” Siddiqui, also the federal education minister, said while referring to Sindh.
The MQM-P leader asked the public and the “intellectuals” of Sindh whether any province could pass a resolution that “went against the Constitution”.
“This [resolution] challenged Pakistan, its Constitution, its law and its state,” he remarked, noting that it was being done by the party that had been in power in the province for the past 17 years.



Siddiqui contended that Article 239 of the 1973 Constitution provided the procedure for establishing new provinces.
“This resolution is not against any demand of ours but against Pakistan’s Constitution, its state, presence and the PPP leader (Bhutto),” he said.
The MQM-P leader also referred to Articles 246 and 248 of the Constitution, which he said gave presidential powers for “extraordinary circumstances”.
He recalled that the MQM-P had demanded the empowerment of local governments even at the time of the 26th Amendment, when “the Pakistani state, government and democracy were in dire need of us”.

 

Siddiqui emphasised that the solution to the issue was “dialogue, not threats”.
“What fear made you table this resolution?” he asked, asserting that no demand ever made by the MQM-P was in violation of the Constitution.
“The incident and trauma that Pakistan suffered in 1970, a show of solidarity had to be made after that. Then what happened? The Punjab Assembly declared Urdu its provincial language. Sarhad (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and Balochistan also chose Urdu as their provincial language,” he said.
However, Sindh, he said, was the only province which didn’t do so because the ruling party here had “other dreams and intentions, which have been proved today.”
“As long as we are here, every dream of establishing Sindhudesh will be shattered,” he declared. “As long as we are here, we cannot let this happen.”
Speaking about Pakistan’s electoral history, he said that in the elections of the 1970s, there wasn’t a single candidate representing the PPP from West Pakistan, i.e. 55 per cent of the country, declaring itself a lingual party. Only 1.5 provinces had PPP representation.
“Today, a party with a manufactured majority has held control of Sindh since 1972. I want to ask the state of Pakistan: is there any other province where such segregation exists along linguistic lines? In 1970, the quota system was not merely an administrative arrangement; it was structured on the basis of language.”
Siddiqui then questioned the prime minister, the president, the state of Pakistan, the courts, and the nation at large, asking whether the kind of treatment meted out to Sindh’s cities has ever been seen in any other part of Pakistan. He said that whenever anyone raises their voice for their rights in Sindh, they are branded as traitors.
He further said that the MQM-P had “never made any demands that go against the interests of Pakistan,” adding that when their founding leader made remarks against the country, he was separated from the MQM, stressing that for the party leaders, it is Pakistan first, then MQM.
The resolution
On Saturday, the Sindh Assembly on Saturday passed a resolution declaring Karachi an “inseparable part” of the province and opposing any move that suggested otherwise.
The resolution, tabled by CM Murad and passed with a majority, stated that the House “unequivocally condemns and rejects any conspiracy aimed at the division of Sindh or the creation of a separate province comprising Karachi”.
“Karachi is, and shall forever remain, an integral and inseparable part of Sindh,” it declared.
The chief minister’s move comes after MQM-P repeatedly called for the Centre’s intervention in Karachi, demanding that the metropolis be made a “federal territory”.
The resolution urged “all political stakeholders to refrain from divisive rhetoric or actions that threaten provincial harmony and national cohesion”.
It reaffirmed that the “unity, territorial integrity, and historic identity of Sindh are sacred trusts inherited from our forefathers and shall be defended through constitutional, democratic, and political means”.
The resolution stated that the Sindh Assembly stood “united — beyond party lines — in defence of Sindh’s integrity, dignity, and unbroken legacy”.</p><small>2026-02-22 13:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/221737033798efa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975000/nadra-to-issue-cnics-for-first-time-registrants-without-birth-certificate' target='_blank'><strong>Nadra to issue CNICs for first-time registrants without birth certificate</strong></a><br><p>The National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) announced that it would issue Computerised National Identity Cards (CNICs) to those seeking first-time registration without a birth certificate, a statement said on Sunday.
The time-bound facility for first-time registration would be valid until December 31, 2026, and would be subject to strict verification conditions.
“This facilitation has been approved under Section 5(1)(b) and Section 20 of the Nadra Ordinance, 2000, read with Rule 8 of the Nadra NIC Rules, 2002, which permit alternative verification mechanisms in specified categories”, the statement said.
It added that the CNIC issuance under this framework would be allowed only where identity was established through NADRA’s existing records and mandatory biometric verification of already registered immediate family members.
Per the statement, for a married woman aged 18 years or above, a valid local government Nikah Nama, a valid CNIC or National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) of either parent, a valid CNIC or NICOP of the husband, and biometric verification of one parent and the husband would be mandatory.
For an unmarried female aged 18 years or above, the husband-related condition would not apply; however, a valid CNIC or NICOP of either parent and biometric verification of one parent would be mandatory, it stated.
For a male applicant above 24 years of age, the statement said, issuance would be allowed only where either parent holds a valid CNIC or NICOP, and at least one sibling also holds a valid CNIC or NICOP, with mandatory biometric verification of one parent.
However, it added that where both parents or the husband were deceased, but their records existed within Nadra, the authorised officer might grant exemption from biometric verification, subject to record-based linkage and satisfactory verification checks.
“To further facilitate applicants, non-smart CNICs applied for under the normal category shall be issued under this framework without any fee,” Nadra said.
Once recorded in the National Identity System, parentage, date of birth and place of birth shall be irrevocable and non-changeable, it warned.
The statement, therefore, advised citizens to ensure the accuracy of all information at the time of registration.
Eligible applicants were also urged to approach the nearest Nadra registration centre to avail time-bound facilitation.</p><small>2026-02-22 12:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/221428065ea94bf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974994/us-envoy-steve-witkoff-says-trump-questioning-why-iran-has-not-capitulated' target='_blank'><strong>US envoy Steve Witkoff says Trump questioning why Iran has not ‘capitulated’</strong></a><br><p>US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Saturday that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal.
The United States and Iran this week resumed Oman-mediated talks in Geneva aimed at averting the possibility of military action, after Washington dispatched two aircraft carriers, jets and weaponry to the region to back its warnings.
In a Fox News interview with Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara, Witkoff said the president was “curious” about Iran’s position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.
“I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated’, because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t… I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated’, but why they haven’t capitulated,” he said.
“Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.”







The US envoy also confirmed in the interview that he had met with Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a critic of the current authorities, who has not returned to the country since before the 1979 Revolution that ousted the monarchy.
“I met him at the direction of the president,” Witkoff said, without providing further details.
“I think he’s strong for his country, cares about his country. But this is going to be about President Trump’s policies.”

 

US-based Pahlavi last week told a crowd in Munich that he was ready to lead the country to a “secular democratic future” after Trump said regime change would be best for the country.
Witkoff’s comments come after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days.
Trump said on Thursday that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear programme.
As talks between the two nations continued in Geneva, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday said that Trump would not succeed in destroying the Islamic republic.

 

Western countries accuse Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes.
Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy, which played a role in sparking anti-government protests in December.</p><small>2026-02-22 09:36</small></div><hr>
