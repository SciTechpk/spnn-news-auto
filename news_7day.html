He asserted that nobody had the right to make “fake videos” or try to harass journalists by defaming them.
Shah posted on Sunday on X that an account on the social media platform followed by Tarar had “made an AI video of me”.
“But as we’ve said before, we’ll say it again: #AttacksWontSilenceUS,” she added. Her post was in response to the video in question, shared by an account called PakVocals. The description with the clip claimed that it was a “leaked video” of Shah “dancing in a club in London”.
Subsequently, Tarar responded to Shah on Sunday night, saying, “Totally unacceptable and highly condemnable. Notice taken, please.
“Nobody has the right to make fake videos and then disseminate them or try to harass any journalist by defaming them. I follow more than 1,900 accounts. I do not condone the behaviour of this account and also assure you that action will be taken,” the minister said.
 






Journalists also rallied behind Shah as the matter garnered attention on social media.
“Deep fake, condemnable, culpable crime, should be investigated and the one who doctored the video must be brought to the court of law. My sincere support to fellow brilliant journalist Benazir Shah who always stands by facts, neutrality and truth. More power to you. Stand firm, please,” posted journalist Zahid Gishkori on X.
Journalist Asad Ali Toor said he was sure that the person in the video was not Shah. He said he was also certain that the account that shared the video was a “pro PML-N account followed by pro PML-N journalists and the minister”.
“This is [a] shameful and disgusting campaign, and I strongly condemn it. At the same time, I want to say all political parties have their own pool of dirt which they time to time launch against their critics. Shameful,” he commented.
Journalist Meher Bokhari, referring to the video in question and the accosting of Geo News anchor Shahzeb Khanzada in a separate incident, called for more respect.
“This is not who we were meant to become. Whether it’s PTI supporters harassing Shazeb Khanzada or or PML-N supporters circulating fake AI videos of Benazir Shah, none of it reflects who we are.
“Both are hardworking journalists, people who have dedicated their lives to informing the public despite constant pressure. Sure, nothing makes sense here anymore, but the least we can do is hold on to our values and our respect for one another. Character is what you choose to keep intact when everything around you falls apart,” she said.

In a statement, the FO said Dar would be leading the delegation at the summit, being held on November 17-18, at the invitation of Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Vladmirovich Mishustin.
“The CHG will be attended by the heads of government of Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the vice president of Iran, and the foreign ministers of Pakistan and India,” the statement said.
 






Further, in addition to SCO member states, the heads of the governments of Mongolia, Bahrain, Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait and Turkmenistan will also be attending the meeting alongside those of regional/international organisations, including the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Euro Asian Economic Union (EAEU), Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).
“In his address to the SCO CHG, the deputy prime minister will share Pakistan’s perspective on important regional and global issues as well as ways to strengthen the organisation for the benefit of the SCO region,” the statement added.
Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with the leaders of other SCO countries on the sidelines of the summit, the FO added.
The CHG is the second-highest decision-making institution in the SCO and provides guidance in the areas of economy, finance, trade, connectivity, commerce and socio-economic cooperation, including the organisation’s budgetary matters, according to the FO. The SCO CHG adopts joint communiqué, statements and important decisions.
The SCO held a summit in Tianjin, China from August 31 to September 1 earlier this year. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also announced in September announced that Pakistan would be hosting the next SCO summit, but did not provide a date.</p><small>2025-11-17 06:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/170847277d001e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955592/politicians-journalists-jump-to-shahzeb-khanzadas-defence-after-anchorperson-accosted-in-public' target='_blank'><strong>Politicians, journalists jump to Shahzeb Khanzada’s defence after anchorperson accosted in public</strong></a><br><p>Politicians and journalists have jumped to the defence of anchorperson Shahzeb Khanzada after videos emerged on social media of him being accosted in public by a man accusing him of acting against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi.
The video, which has been circulating on social media since Sunday night, shows a man following Khanzada in what appeared to be a clothing store. In the video, the man told the journalist he should be “ashamed” of “what he has done against Imran” and his wife. For his part, Khanzada — who appeared to be present with his family — did not engage with the man and walked away.
 
 

While the man did not provide an explanation for the allegations he was levelling against the journalist, PTI’s Shahbaz Gill shared an old clip of Khanzada talking about the Iddat case, filed against Bushra Bibi and Imran by her former husband Khawar Maneka, on his show. The case pertains to Imran and Bushra Bibi’s marriage during the latter’s Iddat period.
“This is the filth Shahzeb did,” he said. He added that if the condemnation had come from the media fraternity, then the situation would not have reached this point, an apparent reference to the harassment of the journalist.
 






The incident comes two days after The Economist published an article covering Imran’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as premier, which the party has termed recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary.
Many on social media came to Khanzada’s defence, terming the incident “condemnable”.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the incident was “yet another filthy reminder of the mob mentality Imran Khan has carefully bred within PTI”.
“This crowd does not [have] manners, they were never taught dignity, decency or basic humanity. Their entire existence feeds on confrontation, chaos, and bullying. This is not politics, it is brute thuggery masquerading as activism. They know that they can only survive when society is torn down,” said the minister.
 






PPP leader and Sindh Minister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said he strongly condemned the incident.
“You can certainly disagree, but do so within the bounds of decency and respect. Your actions have not affected Shahzeb Khanzada’s honour, but rather [of] those who taught you this behaviour,” he said.
 






Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Senator Faisal Subzwari said the incident was “another glimpse into the filth that had taken root in politics over the past decade”.
“When national leaders praise the abuse brigade and give bad names to everyone except their own kind, then these lamentable traditions take root,” he said.
 






Journalist Waseem Abbasi called the incident harassment, adding that this was “no crusade”.
 






“This is disgusting and utterly condemnable,” said Ziauddin Yousafzai, the father of Nobel Laureate Malala Yousufzai.
“Khanzada is an honourable man and an outstanding journalist. This incident exposes the ugly face and behaviour of an intolerant cult,” he said.
 






Journalist Asad Ali Toor termed the incident a “shameful campaign” against Khanzada.
“I still maintain that Shahzeb in that interview completely exposed Khawar Maneka that his ‘Iddat’ case is a politically motivated case and he is just a disgusting proxy,” he said, adding that the PTI should be thanking him, rather than harassing him.
 






Journalist Matiullah Jan said that Imran’s supporters should learn that harassing a journalist in this manner in the presence of his family members was condemnable.
“There are a hundred civilised ways of protesting. Shahzeb Khanzada has left the government and its ministers speechless on many occasions,” he said.
 






Journalist Zahid Gishkori, who has previously worked with Khanzada, said it was “extremely painful to see a strange man” harassing the latter and his family, adding that he stood with the journalist during this difficult time.
 






“This is unacceptable and outright shameful. Harassing someone in a public place is not freedom of expression, it’s intimidation and thuggery,” said sports journalist Faizan Lakhani.
“Shahzeb Khanzada is a respected, credible journalist, and this behaviour towards him is shameful. This incident exposes the true face of an intolerant society,” he said.
 






“I strongly condemn the worst kind of fascism and the targeted harassment being inflicted on Shahzeb Khanzada by zombies of a political party,” said journalist Asma Shirazi.
 






The Pakistan Daily founder Hamza Azhar Salam said the PTI had not taken Khanzada to court for defamation because “it knows they will be taken to the cleaners”.
“Instead, PTI workers unleashed to harass Pakistan’s most credible journalist in front of his family. We stand by Khanzada and condemn this campaign of harassment,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, Khanzada responded to PTI leader Gill on X, accusing him of lying.
“This is classic Shahbaz Gill. When he was a minister, he was caught lying several times and here again he is lying,” he said, adding that he was responsible for reporting court proceedings.
“These trolls actually don’t care about facts even if they go in favour of Imran Khan,” he said.
 






“We didn’t just expose the Iddat case but also spoke for Shahbaz Gill, condemned his torture under custody and the use of the outdated treason law against him even when his own party and leaders were refusing to speak for him,” he said.
 






The PTI founder and his wife — who are both currently under arrest — were convicted by an Islamabad court in the Iddat case and sentenced to seven years in jail each on Feb 3, 2024, five days before the general elections.
In July the same year, they were acquitted in the case but then arrested on charges related to the sale of state gifts.</p><small>2025-11-17 05:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17094630329e737.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955606/trump-reverses-stance-on-epstein-files-urges-republicans-to-vote-for-releasing-them' target='_blank'><strong>Trump reverses stance on Epstein files, urges Republicans to vote for releasing them</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Sunday urged his fellow Republicans in Congress to vote for the release of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, reversing his earlier resistance to such a move.
Trump’s post on his Truth Social came after House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier that he believed a vote on releasing Justice Department documents in the Epstein case should help put to rest allegations that Trump had any connection to Epstein’s abuse and trafficking of underage girls.
“House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files because we have nothing to hide,” Trump wrote on Sunday night.
“And it’s time to move on from this Democrat hoax perpetrated by radical left lunatics in order to deflect from the great success of the Republican Party, including our recent victory on the Democrat ‘shutdown’.”
 






Although Trump and Epstein were photographed together decades ago, the president has said the two men fell out before Epstein’s convictions.
Emails released last week by a House committee showed the disgraced financier believed Trump “knew about the girls,” though it was not clear what that phrase meant.
Trump, who has recently dismissed the Epstein files as a Democratic smear campaign, has since instructed the Department of Justice to investigate prominent Democrats’ ties to Epstein.
The battle over disclosure of more Epstein-related documents, a subject Trump himself campaigned on, has opened a rift with some of his allies in Congress.
Many of Trump’s most loyal supporters believe the government is withholding sensitive documents about Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died by suicide in jail in 2019, that would reveal the late financier’s ties to powerful public figures.
Trump late on Friday withdrew his support for US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, long one of his staunchest supporters in Congress, following her criticism of Republicans on certain issues, including the handling of the Epstein files.
US Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat and an original sponsor of the petition calling for a vote on the files’ release, said on Sunday that he expected more than 40 Republicans to vote in favor.
Republicans hold the majority in the House, with 219 seats, versus 214 for Democrats.</p><small>2025-11-17 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/170943048d97280.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955518/hiv-found-in-children-previously-treated-at-hospital-in-karachis-site-town' target='_blank'><strong>HIV found in children previously treated at hospital in Karachi’s SITE town</strong></a><br><p>• Local political activists put their heads together after first case of infection confirmed in 18-month-old girl
• Over 15 HIV cases found after Valika Hospital administration persuaded to screen children treated there
• Govt official says health dept ‘focusing’ on treatment and prevention
KARACHI: A serious health crisis, involving children as young as one year, is brewing in the impoverished and densely-populated neighbourhood of SITE Town where more than 15 children have been diagnosed with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) over the past few weeks with at least two fatalities during the same period while the number of the affected children is still rising.
At the centre of the crisis is the Kulsum Bai Valika Social Security SITE Hospital, commonly known as Valika Hospital, in SITE Town, where the children treated for different health complaints over the past few months have been diagnosed with HIV.
It all emerged recently when people of the neighbourhood with the help of their local government representatives and political leadership of the locality took a solid stand when they learnt about the dark reality.
“In August 2025, an 18-month-old girl fell ill. She was admitted to the Valika Hospital,” said Irshad Khan, vice chairman of SITE Town’s UC-1, which comprises Pathan Colony and Bawani Chali areas.
 
 

“However, her weakness and fever persisted, after which she was taken to a private hospital. Doctors at the private hospital suspected that the child might have some other serious issue. They conducted several tests, after which she was diagnosed with HIV. When the private hospital doctors inquired about the child’s prior treatment, they were informed that she had earlier been treated at the Valika Hospital. It rang alarm bells. We set up a five-member committee on our own comprising leaders of all political parties working of the area — the Jamaat-i-Islami, PPP and ANP.”
The committee led by Mr Khan — who himself belonged to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf — has since been aggressively pursuing the management of the Valika Hospital to conduct screening of those children of the UC who have been treated at the facility over the past few months. It was found that at least 18 of them were HIV-positive.
“But the problem is that despite severity of the issue, we don’t see any seriousness and urgency in the hospital management while the health department seems least bothered about it,” he said.
“We [the committee members] visit the hospital almost daily, but hardly anyone responds. We want every child, at least those who have been treated here since August 2025, to be screened. Currently dozens of children have gone through tests and 18 of them have been diagnosed with HIV. They are aged between one to nine years. On the other hand, hundreds of children are still there roaming in streets, living in houses or going to schools in the impoverished locality. This revelation could only be the tip of the iceberg. We need to take this situation seriously and devise an urgent and aggressive strategy. But authorities are not cooperating.”
Authorities respond
Responding to Dawn queries, an official at the Valika Hospital confirmed that screening for AIDS was underway at the facility while some children had been found to be HIV-positive. However, the officer did not disclose the exact number of affected children.
The government authorities, however, have rejected any such adverse impression.
Dr Kanwal Mustafa, Additional Director HIV/AIDS, Communicable Disease Control (CDC), Sindh Health Department, claimed that her institution responded immediately and set up an anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the same health facility under the question.
“We are further expanding access to HIV treatment and care services in that area,” she added.
Other than recent reported cases at the Valika Hospital, she claimed that a “comprehensive approach” was being taken by the health department, CDC-1 HIV/AIDS Sindh, to tackle HIV/AIDS, focusing on both treatment and prevention.
A total of 31 ART centres have been established across Sindh, offering free counselling, diagnostics and prophylaxis services to HIV-positive individuals, including pregnant women and their children, she added.
When asked about the possible cause of the recent outbreak among the children who were treated at the Valika Hospital, she said “facts and data are still being analysed”.
She referred to common practices that usually cause such viruses to spread.
“HIV transmission in Pakistan, whether urban or rural, is a complex issue driven by several factors,” said Dr Kanwal. “Unlicensed practitioners reusing syringes and IV drips play a major role in the spread of the virus. Unregulated blood banks further exacerbate the issue, while widespread illiteracy and poverty create an environment conducive to the transmission of viruses.”
Despite the risks associated with injections, many Pakistanis believe that injections offer a quick relief, driving their widespread use, she added.
“Quackery in our society and high-risk behaviour among drug users compound the problem. Pakistan’s high anaemia prevalence among children under five also increases the likelihood of blood transfusions, heightening the risk of HIV acquisition,” she said.
The government-led investigations may take time to uncover the truth behind the recent HIV outbreak among children of SITE Town, but Vice Chairman of the UC Irshad Khan’s personal observations paint a dangerous scenario.
“During our recent visits to the Valika Hospital, we ourselves repeatedly witnessed the reuse of used syringes,” he revealed his shocking observation.
“Many staff members also confirmed this practice. I am shocked at how something like this is even possible at a government hospital. I’m not an expert, but I am certain that, among many other factors, this could be one of the reasons why HIV has spread among the children being treated there.”

For Pakistan and Afghanistan, the river system presents an unusual hydrological and diplomatic twist, which in the absence of a comprehensive treaty, means increasing the risks of conflict, over a resource that is both a lifeline and geopolitical.
The Kabul River system has emerged as a potential flashpoint in Pak-Afghan relations, with growing concerns that Afghanistan’s accelerated dam construction — supported by foreign actors, particularly India — could alter river flows critical for Pakistan’s irrigation, hydropower, and food security.
Pakistan’s complex position as both an upper and lower riparian on different tributaries of the basin presents both risks and opportunities. The Chitral River originates in Pakistan and flows into Afghanistan as the Kunar River, before re-entering Pakistan to join the Kabul River and eventually the Indus. This geographic configuration gives Pakistan upstream leverage, yet its downstream dependence makes it vulnerable to flow reductions.

The Kabul River system has emerged as a potential flashpoint in Pak-Afghan relations.

Recent hydrological estimates indicate that Pakistan currently receives around 17 million acre feet annually from the Kabul River system, contributing nearly 20 per cent of total Indus inflows during the early Kharif season. Projected upstream development by Afghanistan including up to a dozen dams could reduce flows by approximately 3 MAF (about 16pc), directly impacting early cropping, water storage, and energy generation in KP and downstream Punjab. Climate change further compounds this risk by reducing glacial melt predictability and altering seasonal run-off patterns. The result: rising potential for hydropolitical tension and environmental insecurity in a basin already lacking a formal water-sharing framework.
The core political challenge constitutes Afghanistan’s use of water infrastructure as a potential political or economic pressure tool to threaten Pakistan’s water and food security. India’s technical and financial involvement in Afghan hydropower and irrigation projects such as the Shahtoot Dam near Kabul and proposed Kunar-Panjshir developments adds a geopolitical layer, effectively turning the Kabul basin into an extension of South Asia’s broader water rivalry.
Pakistan must therefore respond with a strategy that protects downstream flows and agricultural security, preserves its international legal standing as a responsible riparian, counters Indian influence through constructive regional engagement, and converts hydrological vulnerability into diplomatic and economic leverage. While Pakistan is technically an upper riparian on the Chitral segment, its practical capacity to divert or store significant volumes upstream is restricted. The terrain is mountainous, infrastructure options limited, and large-scale diversion would be cost-prohibitive and environmentally risky.
 
 

From a legal perspective, deliberate manipulation of flows would violate key principles of international water law, including equitable and reasonable utilisation, and obligation not to cau­se significant harm. Such action would und­e­r­­m­ine Pakistan’s credibility in other transbo­undary contexts, most notably under the Indus Waters Treaty with India, where Pakistan relies on the same legal norms for downstream protection.
Thus, while Pakistan retains hydrological leverage, it should not pursue coercive diversion as a countermeasure. Instead, this leverage should be exercised through strategic hydro-diplomacy and cooperative basin governance by developing a strategic response framework to:
Establish a bilateral water commission: Initiate negotiations for a Pakistan-Afghanistan Water Commission under a structured ‘Kabul River Basin Dialogue’; include data-sharing, minimum flow guarantees, flood forecasting, and seasonal regulation protocols; seek facilitation by World Bank, ICIMOD, or UNESCAP to ensure neutrality and technical credibility.
Promote a ‘benefit-sharing’ model:  Propose joint hydropower or irrigation projects where both sides gain proportionally from regulated storage; Pakistan may offer to purchase surplus hydropower from Afghan dams or finance co-managed reservoirs that ensure stable downstream releases; the model transforms the river from a zero-sum resource into a shared economic asset.
Deploy climate diplomacy tools: Frame the Kabul basin as a climate-vulnerable transboundary system needing adaptation finance; mobilise Green Climate Fund or Loss and Damage finance windows for joint resilience projects — glacier monitoring, early warning systems, irrigation modernisation — creating shared dependence on cooperative governance.
Counter Indian influence through engagement: Offer Afghanistan direct technical cooperation and concessional energy trade to reduce dependency on Indian-backed infrastructure; engage multilaterally (ECO, SAARC, SCO) to make unilateral Indian-Afghan projects politically less viable.
Develop strategic water intelligence & monitoring: Strengthen satellite-based hydrological monitoring of the Kabul basin using the capabilities of Suparco and Wapda; establish a national cell under the National Security Division to continuously assess upstream developments, construction progress, and foreign technical involvement.
Prepare contingency response plans: Model the economic and agricultural impact of a 10-20pc flow reduction scenario to inform national drought resilience planning; accelerate domestic measures — groundwater regulation, small storage schemes, and canal efficiency — in KP and the Indus plains to offset potential losses.
Pakistan faces a critical juncture in its water diplomacy with Afghanistan. The choice is between reacting to provocation of ‘water weaponisation’ or proactively shaping a rules-based, climate-resilient, and mutually beneficial framework for transboundary water management. Pakistan should adopt a strategy that emphasises regional hydro cooperation by securing predictable downstream flows, limiting India’s geopolitical encroachment, strengthening its international standing as a responsible riparian, and transforming the Kabul River from a security liability into a platform for regional stability and shared prosperity.
Water must be managed as an instrument of strategic leverage, not confrontation. However, if diplomatic initiative, technical readiness, and climate framing through cooperation does not work, Pakistan retains its upper riparian leverage to defend its future water security.

Acting under the command of local TTP commander Abuzar, two important Afghan terrorists were among those who were killed in Merikhel area. Local sources said that the operation took place on Saturday-Sunday night. Three of the slain insurgents were identified as Ehsan Badri and Subaib Lezari, both Afghans, and Omar Sangari from Khyber district.
It was learnt that funeral of the two Afghan terrorists was later held in the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan.
There was, however, no official confirmation of the killing of these insurgents by security officials in the region.
The sources in Bara said that the five TTP men were involved in an attack on a security check point in Bar Qambarkhel area of Bara a few days back.
Security forces had successfully repulsed that attack. The bodies of five terrorists were later found in a cave where they were believed to have been hiding.
It was also learnt through the sources that these terrorists had also earned notoriety by filming beheading of some people and later posting their gory images on social media.

Pakistan’s history bears testimony to a phenomenon that has seen ruling elites focus more attention and energy on external engagements rather than on fixing perennial and mounting problems at home. Pre­occupation with foreign pursuits has translated into less concentration on domestic challenges — as if the former can substitute for the latter.
Today too this stands out in sharp relief, as evidenced by the inordinate time spent by Pakistani leaders on foreign trips, regardless of pressing issues at home. For example, during the floods earlier this year that especially hit Punjab, the prime minister spent more time overseas than at home visiting the affected areas. More recently, he chose to preside over a cabinet meeting to approve the 27th Constitutional Amendment — no ordinary piece of legislation — by video link from Baku, where he was on a visit, which was hardly crucial.
Supporters of the government justify these more-than-frequent overseas visits as indicative of Pakistan’s renewed prominence on the international stage, attributing this to the effectiveness of the government’s foreign policy. But foreign policy gains are measured by outcomes, not activity. The real test is whether that delivers anything substantive to the country, and not the number of foreign visits undertaken by a leader or how he personally benefits from such tours. This is not to say Pakistan should not be diplomatically active. But diplomatic engagements should be purposeful and result-oriented, and not take priority over unaddressed governance issues at home.

External overreach and internal underreach have long characterised the conduct of governments.

External overreach and internal underreach has a long pedigree in the country’s history. The origin of this repetitive pattern lies perhaps in the exigencies of the early chaotic years of Pakistan’s existence. In the turbulent aftermath of partition and early conflict with India, Pakistan was faced with a hostile neighbour and its ever-threatening, aggressive posture. This urged Pakistani leaders at the time to pursue a strategy of ‘external balancing’ to counter India’s power by seeking foreign alignments.
This, of course, made perfect sense. It also did not distract the leadership in the formative years from addressing urgent domestic challenges because creating the governance and military structures of a new state and dealing with the huge refugee influx could hardly have been postponed. Nevertheless, Pakistan’s internal political evolution and foreign policy were greatly influenced by its quest for security. And it remained so for years to come.
However, two things happened over time. Prolonged and intense engagement in Cold War conflicts and involvement in later geopolitical developments aimed at strengthening the country’s security ended up emaciating and exhausting Pakistan and compounding its domestic problems. For example, Pakistan’s intimate decade-long involvement in the US-led war against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan — a war of unintended consequences — came at an extraordinary cost to the country’s own stability. Its multidimensional fallout, whose ramifications are even felt today, needs no reiteration.
This also established a pattern of behaviour that was to resonate in subsequent years. While the country’s rulers involved themselves in geopolitical games that sought to enhance Pakistan’s international influence, at home the neglect of pressing economic problems as well as the education deficit exacted a heavy price. Again, the argument is not that Pakistan could have isolated itself from global and regional developments and avoided foreign engagements, but that its leaders failed to anticipate their consequences while paying little heed to festering internal problems.
Policies of external overreach also encouraged a habit of relying on outsiders to address economic challenges. Economic and military assistance or geopolitical rents received through various phases of the country’s alignment with the US-led West created an official mindset of dependence. This set up perverse incentives for domestic reform. Aid and financial ‘drips’ from allies substituted for reforms that could have placed the economy on a sustainable high-growth trajectory and transformed the country.
 
 

It also yielded an approach that looked outside to deal with mounting problems and address sources of the country’s internal weaknesses.
The foreign policy of successive governments intersected with their economic management approach by which the country pursued rent-seeking relationships with big powers, relying on aid and borrowing rather than finding a viable path to economic growth and development by counting on itself. But neither foreign assistance nor borrowed money had a transformative impact.
In recent years, reliance on the West has been replaced by dependence on China and Saudi Arabia as well as the Gulf states, who have repeatedly provided financial help to bail out the country from economic and liquidity crises. Roll-over of loans and deposits in the central bank to shore up foreign exchange reserves remains a familiar feature. The habit of depending on others has become so entrenched in the country’s political culture that there is little questioning of this when members of the ruling elite routinely visit Gulf capitals to seek financial help. Instead, ministers hold this up as a foreign policy achievement. If this strategy was followed by an individual would that person be cheered for going out to get more loans when already in debt?
This strategy of reliance on external financial resources has helped civil and military elites to perpetuate their power, privileges, and lifestyle at the expense of the country’s development. It has enabled them to avoid reform while keeping the economy afloat, frequently on life support either from the IMF or ‘emergency’ loans from ‘friendly states.’
What has suffered grievously from neglect are various dimensions of human development and human welfare, which have deteriorated over time. The dismal state of literacy, education and healthcare as well as the rising level of poverty presents a grim picture today, and is the most serious consequence of internal underreach. What value do foreign engagements have when, as a result of official neglect, the condition of the majority of people doesn’t improve and Pakistan makes little progress?
For all the present focus on the ‘external’, the factors that will shape Pakistan’s destiny lie within and not outside the country. Its future will be determined by choices made at home rather than foreign pursuits.

The district administration issued a notification advising all drivers and relevant parties to steer clear of travelling towards Jiwani.
Officials warned that any vehicle in violation of the ban would be subject to strict legal consequences, including on-the-spot confiscation by law enforcement agencies.
Law enforcement bodies, including the police, Pakistan Coast Guard, and Frontier Corps, have been instructed to rigorously enforce the ban, as per the district administration’s directive.
The measure aims to curb an illicit trade that costs the national treasury billions. An inquiry in 2020 revealed oil smuggling from Iran was worth over Rs250 billion annually.

Move aims to curb fuel smuggling from across the border

A more recent intelligence report from April 2024 noted that approximately 10 million litres of Iranian petrol and diesel were smuggled into Pakistan daily, causing a revenue loss of over Rs227 billion.
The significant difference in fuel prices between Pakistan and Iran has turned smuggling into a thriving business.
According to officials, a main smuggling artery is the sea route from Sistan, Iran, where speed boats transport fuel in cans along the Dasht river to Jiwani. Thousands of boats are allegedly involved in the illegal operations, supported by storage facilities and hotels along the coast.
From the coast, the cargo is moved in modified trucks to areas near Gwadar. It is then transported in non-Custom-paid pickups to the rest of Balochistan and bordering areas of Punjab and Sindh.
While the trade serves as the only means of livelihood for many people, it remains a lucrative opportunity for others. Smuggling continues to undermine legitimate business, facilitates tax evasion and fuels organised crime in the province.
The region’s reliance on smuggled fuel has previously led to widespread disruption. During a recent conflict between Israel and Iran, the supply of Iranian oil was severely affected, forcing a large number of petrol pumps to close.
The border districts of Turbat, Gwadar, Panjgur, Chagai, Washuk and Mashkail were the worst-affected, facing not only fuel shortages but also food scarcity, as many edibles are also imported from Iran. At the time, 60 to 70 per cent of petrol pumps reportedly closed due to the supply suspension.
 
 

Successive governments have laun­ched initiatives to stop the smuggling, but the problem persists. Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the Balochistan government to take measures to discourage the transport of smuggled fuel out of the province.
Additionally, in August this year, the government passed a bill in the National Assembly to digitally track petroleum products from their origin to sales, aiming to curb smuggling and adulteration.

The estimated cost of these disasters in terms of agricultural losses over the last 30 years is staggering: $3.26tr, or 4pc of global agricultural GDP. And behind the statistics lie millions of lost livelihoods, growing hunger and the increasing fragility of rural economies. The message is that climate disasters are intensifying faster than we can cope.
The report also highlights a parallel digital revolution that could transform how we manage agricultural risks. AI, remote sensing, drones, sensors, and digital insurance platforms are opening new opportunities for proactive action rather than reactive responses. These technologies have enabled more precise early warning systems and allowed millions of farmers to access parametric insurance and timely advisories. However, we can also witness the widening gap between countries able to harness these technologies and those still struggling to gain even basic climate resilience. Nowhere is this divide more evident than in Asia, which accounts for nearly 47pc of all global agricultural losses, reflecting the region’s acute exposure to floods, storms and droughts.
The report’s findings are painfully familiar for Pakistan, which has become an epicentre of climate-induced agricultural devastation. Disastrous floods have exacted massive human and economic costs and reshaped our farming landscape. The soil has suffered deep erosion, with vast tracts facing rising salinity; irrigation and drainage networks remain damaged or dysfunctional. The effect is a decline in productivity in a sector that employs over a third of the labour force and is the backbone of national food security and the export industry.
 
 

The country’s weak capacity to store, process and transport food has deteriorated further under the strain of repeated shocks. Food inflation, which disproportionately hurts the poor, has become a structural feature of the economy due to supply disruptions caused by the changing climate including extreme weather events. Disruptions to the farm economy extend far beyond immediate crop and livestock losses, and spill over into markets, financial systems, public health and social stability. Although digital technology is a game-changer, we lag behind other countries in digital crop monitoring, while farmers’ access to advisory services is patchy at best, with negligible insurance penetration. Where digital tools do exist, they are not integrated into local decision-making.
Pakistan urgently needs a national strategy to mainstream digital agriculture: crop mapping using remote sensing, AI-based pest surveillance, mobile advisory hubs and disaster-indexed insurance. The tools exist, but political will and investment are missing. The window for building tech-based resilience is closing faster than policymakers seem to realise.

Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch urged the state and its institutions to realise that the use of force, extrajudicial killings and disappearances of Baloch citizens would not improve the situation in the province.
Instead, he called for a serious political approach to address Balochistan’s long-standing grievances.
 
 

Flanked by family members of the missing, including VBMP General Secretary Hooran Baloch and activist Ghani Baloch, he said the organisation’s protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club had now completed 6,000 days.
“This camp has also been set up in various parts of Balochistan, as well as in Karachi and Islamabad. It is viewed across Pakistan and the world as a symbol of peaceful resistance,” he said.

Use of force can’t bring peace to Balochistan, Nasrullah Baloch warns

He said that over the past 16 years, the organisation had held protests, seminars and long marches from Quetta to Islamabad, both on foot and by train.
Nasrullah Baloch said the VBMP had registered cases of enforced disappearances with the judiciary, inquiry commissions and the federal and provincial governments, and had presented evidence to the relevant authorities despite “serious difficulties and hardships”.
“False cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act were filed against me, General Secretary Hooran Baloch, Vice Chairman Mama Qadeer Baloch and others. We faced arrests and torture, but we did not abandon our struggle,” Nasrullah Baloch said.
He claimed that two VBMP district coordinators were extrajudicially killed during the movement, yet the campaign continued.
Families of missing persons, he said, submit complete details of their loved ones to the VBMP, which then forwards the cases to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances and to the provincial government.
“The commission initiates legal proceedings within a week and issues notices to the relevant institutions. We also guide victims’ families about legal requirements,” he said.
Drawing on years of experience, he urged the state to understand that peace in Bal­ochistan could not be restored through force.
“Thousands of Baloch have been forcibly disappeared and thousands have been killed extrajudicially, yet the situation continues to deteriorate. We appeal to the state to refrain from using force in Balochistan. The issue is political and must be resolved through political dialogue,” he stressed.
He also demanded that all citizens be treated in accordance with the law, that missing persons be recovered, that those facing charges be produced before courts and that extrajudicial arrests and killings be stopped.
He called for legislation “in line with human dignity and constitutional principles” to address enforced disappearances.
Nasrullah Baloch also urged the families of missing persons not to remain silent. “Come forward with complete details of your loved ones,” he appealed.

While Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari believed the report to be “completely accurate and fully aligned with the facts”, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram asked the PPP and the PML-N to refrain from the “agenda-driven” campaign against ex-PM Imran Khan and his spouse.
He said the campaign through “concocted stories” was nothing but an effort to divert public attention from disastrous policies that had devastated the country “politically, morally, socially and economically”.
 
 

According to the PTI leader, the government had exhausted every tactic and committed every act over the past three years to remove the PTI founding chairman from the political arena, but all these measures proved counterproductive, and his popularity continued to flourish with each passing day. He predicted that the days of incumbent governments were numbered, and they were now frantically searching for escape routes.

PTI spox asks rulers to refrain from ‘agenda-driven’ campaign; Punjab information minister terms report ‘accurate’

Meanwhile, the Punjab information minister quipped that after the revelations about PTI founder Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi’s actions were now making headlines in the international media.
In a statement here on Sunday, she said that the report had exposed the “deception of the fake spiritual setup and the so-called mysticism that concealed darker intentions”.
“The man who used to threaten his opponents, saying he won’t spare them, himself believed that the manipulated information fed to his wife was some form of spirituality,” she stated.
Commenting on the publication’s report, Ms Bokhari said that for four years, the ‘coach’ and ‘spiritual guide’ misled the PTI founder. Despite claiming to champion change and end corruption, Bushra Bibi was facilitating a new form of “legitimised corruption”.
“A country and its economy cannot run on sorcery, spells, or fraudulent spiritual practices. The so-called spirituality of those who wanted to bury their opponents metaphorically has already been dead for three years,” she added.
Last week, The Economist published an article covering Mr Khan’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as prime minister.
‘The mystic, the cricketer and the spy: Pakistan’s game of thrones’, written by Owen Bennett Jones and Bushra Taskeen, claimed Bushra Bibi wielded an “absolute” influence and “upset crucial friends and allies”. The article also quotes a former driver of Mr Khan, alleging that Bushra Bibi used to practice ‘black magic’.
“Accepting his wife’s claim that she could read faces, he would ask for photographs of potential candidates, which would be sent to Bushra Bibi for a decision. She also got involved in pettier matters,” the article went on to say.
The article also shed light on her alleged ties with the intelligence community.
“According to the rumours, the officer would, for example, give one of Bushra Bibi’s pirs advance notice about which politician was about to be arrested. Bushra Bibi would then tell Khan that she had received a revelation about the future. When the event she predicted came to pass, Khan would be amazed at his wife’s perspicacity and conclude she did indeed have a direct line to God,” it claimed.

• Shift from cotton to sugarcane blamed for water depletion, soil degradation, and rising water table
LAHORE: Persistent violations of crop-zoning rules for sugarcane and the unchecked establishment of new sugar mills have drastically reshaped Rahim Yar Khan — once Pakistan’s largest cotton-producing district — where sugar-milling capacity is rapidly expanding both within the district and along the Punjab — Sindh border.
Sources say almost 40 per cent of the country’s total sugar-milling capacity is now concentrated in Rahim Yar Khan and its border belt alone — a shift that experts fear is accelerating the decline of cotton, straining water resources, and degrading soil.
 
 

Six sugar mills currently operate in Rahim Yar Khan with a combined crushing capacity of 135,000 tonnes per day, the highest for any single district in the country. One of these mills is reportedly adding another 10,000 tonnes per day to its capacity this season.
The sources added that two powerful industrial groups, after being denied permission for additional mills within the district, have set up new units just across the Punjab–Sindh border — one with a capacity of 16,000 tonnes per day and the other 19,000 tonnes.
A Sindh-based political family already operates a 16,000-tonne unit there, while another influential group is said to be relocating a major mill from interior Sindh to the same border belt. This relocated mill, sources claim, will become operational during the current crushing season, potentially triggering a further shift from cotton to sugarcane.
Pakistan, which until a few years ago ranked as the world’s fourth-largest cotton producer, has seen its output collapse from around 15 million bales in 2014-15 to barely 5.5m bales in 2024-25, largely due to the unchecked spread of sugarcane in designated cotton zones.
The extraordinary expansion in sugarcane cultivation is not only responsible for a massive drawdown of irrigation resources — with millions of acre-feet of water wasted — but is also raising the water table to levels that threaten to render vast tracts barren.
Concurrently, pollution from sugarcane processing is harming fibre quality, pushing textile mills to imp­ort high-grade cotton to meet export commitments, Cotton Ginners For­um Chairman Ihsanul Haq tells Dawn.
Recalling the “crop transformation”, he says that until a few years ago, Rahim Yar Khan was Pakistan’s single largest cotton-producing district, cultivating the crop on 800,000 acres and yielding 1.3–1.4m bales annually. Across Bahawalpur division’s three districts, cotton output exceeded 4m bales.
During the 2024-25 cotton year, however, the same region produced just 1.5m bales, with expectations of an even lower harvest this season.
Sindh outperforms Punjab
He notes that for the first time in the country’s history, Sindh outperformed Punjab in cotton output during 2024-25 — 2.8m bales in Sindh versus 2.7m in Punjab. This marks a stark reversal from 2014-15, when national output peaked at 15m bales, with Punjab contributing 11m bales compared Sindh’s 4m.
“The ratio has steadily eroded,” he says, adding that preliminary assessments suggest Sindh will again surpass Punjab this year, despite Punjab having planted cotton on 1.4m hectares, more than double Sindh’s 630,000 hectares.

The UNIFIL protested that Israeli forces “fired on UNIFIL peacekeepers from a Merkava tank from near a position Israel has established in Lebanese territory,” adding that heavy machine gun rounds hit about five metres from their personnel.
Sunday’s incident was not the first in which UNIFIL accused Israel of endangering its troops. “Yet again, we call on the IDF to cease any aggressive behaviour and attacks on or near peacekeepers,” the force said.
Lebanon’s army, meanwhile, accused Israel of “violating Lebanese sovereignty, causing instability and obstructing the full deployment of the army in the south”.
The army is meant to deploy to the area alongside UNIFIL as part of the ceasefire agreement. It said it was “working, in coordination with friendly countries, to put and end to the continuous violations”.
The UNIFIL said the peacekeepers this time managed to “leave safely 30 minutes later” after the tank withdrew inside the Israeli position.
However, the Israeli military blamed ‘poor weather conditions’ for the shooting.
Israel denied it had deliberately targeted UN troops. In a statement, the Israeli military said “two suspects were identified” in the El Hamames area of southern Lebanon.
“The troops subsequently fired warning shots, and the suspects distanced themselves. No injuries were reported,” it said.

Israel blames poor weather, says it mistook blue helmets for ‘suspects’

“After a review, it was determined that the suspects were UN soldiers who were conducting a patrol in the area and were classified as suspects due to poor weather conditions. No deliberate fire was directed toward UNIFIL soldiers.”
UNIFIL has been working with Lebanon to consolidate a truce between Israel and Hezbollah reached last year. It said the Sunday shooting “represents a serious violation of UN Security Council resolution 1701”, which ended a 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, and also formed the basis of last November’s truce.
Under the deal, Israel was to withdraw its forces from south Lebanon, but it has kept them at five areas in violation of the ceasefire agreement. It has also carried out regular strikes on targets in Lebanon.
About Sunday shooting, the Israeli military said the incident was under examination.

It is necessary to provide founders with incentives to build freely and commercially to sustain innovation, jobs, and opportunities in Pakistan, without compromising guardrails that safeguard the national interest.
This comes against the backdrop of a recent report by KTrade, authored by its Associate Director Equity Research, Muhammad Faran, highlighting the key economic risks of stablecoin adoption — a use case Zar is tapping into to broaden access to capital inflows, primarily remittances.
Zar raised its seed funding from leading dollar investors following its previous $7m pre-seed round — both rounds led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), often ranked as the company with the most assets under management amongst venture capital management firms globally.
Other notable investors include Coinbase Ventures, Endeavour Catalyst, as well as VanEck, who wrote in an investor note from the previous round that “trust in local currency is gone”. This note, reiterated by a local expert who read it as a threat, begs an evolved question: Does national interest trump commerce?

Sadapay’s new stablecoin venture Zar, could potentially broaden access to capital inflow, primarily remittances

Aatiqa Lateef, a Dubai-based policy expert who has previously served as Director of Policy at Rain, the Middle East’s first licensed cryptocurrency exchange, says that she reads that note as “investor soundbite, not a policy reality”, while a senior source inside Zar distances Pakistan from that framing as they think VanEck’s comments reflect “a global macro view of dollar demand in high-inflation economies”.
They further add that the “rupee has shown remarkable stability” as inflation fell sharply from over 30 per cent in 2023 to “around 4–5pc in 2025”.
 
 

But stablecoins can pose risks to stable currencies too. “The Bank of England governor has warned that significant stablecoin adoption may pose risks to financial system stability,” says Mr Faran, as more and more countries are exploring their own digital currencies to fight against this risk to traditional banking. This is because of the uniquely accessible and centralised nature of stablecoins being pegged to a currency, which creates an environment where national interests of different countries intersect and often clash.
“This is why regulation is important,” as Ms Lateef says, “Stablecoins do warrant bespoke oversight because they behave like short-term money. The answer isn’t prohibition, it’s transparency and convertibility under supervision.” That supervision includes licensing, daily reserve reporting, segregation of client assets, service-level agreements for the redemption service, and caps that gradually increase as compliance maturity improves.
According to Ms Lateef, “If on/off-ramps clear through regulated PSPs [Payment System Providers] and settle locally in rupees, the central bank preserves visibility and mitigates dollarisation risk.”
It is also understood that Zar does not ‘aim’ to facilitate local transactions via digital dollars. A senior source from within opines that “people will want to save dollars, not use them to pay for things locally”. However, when asked if the app will feature functionality to support such transactions, the source says that while their “main aim is for savings”, users could still technically use their US-issued Zar Visa cards locally, though it would be “quite expensive to do so”.
Ms Lateef says domestic peer-to-peer (P2P) foreign currency stablecoins should remain restricted because that accelerates crypto dollarisation. Zar currently boasts around 200,000 users on its waitlist across 100+ countries, and its initial focus will be on Pakistan, according to VanEck’s initial investor note.
With that in mind, she further highlights that if a digital currency is truly rupee-denominated and settled domestically through licensed on/off-ramps with State Bank (SBP), then P2P does not need to remain ‘restricted’ beyond a phased, tier-limited rollout. “The start should be with ‘capped wallets’ and limits can be raised as operational/consumer-protection tests are met,” she says.
So, as we regulate crypto to enable innovations like these and the digital rupee to address some of its risks, a question remains unanswered: where should the line be drawn between commercial and national interests?
Ms Lateef says, “promote anything that improves financial inclusion, lowers cost, and increases transparency, provided it is auditable and reversible where needed, and inside SBP oversight.” She adds that a line needs to be drawn at products that create unhedged foreign exchange (FX) exposure, opaque leverage, or unchecked data and consumer-protection risks.
In short, commercial freedom should exist within measurable public-interest outcomes, managed through regulations adopted without commercial conflicts of interest.
Cautioning of another risk, Mr Faran highlights, “Fintechs can profit from offering faster, cheaper cross-border payments and dollar exposure to their customers.” However, with the potential of diverting “deposits and transaction flows away from the regulated banking system, ultimately reducing the local currency demand”.
Commenting on this risk, Ms Lateef says, “Without any constraints, a venture-backed stablecoin model can disintermediate bank deposits, compress net interest margins, and shift liquidity into non-bank balance sheets.” This raises questions for liquidity coverage, net stable funding, monetary policy transmissions and FX leakages. She adds, “The objective isn’t to protect ‘middlemen’, it’s to protect intermediation.”
According to her, the policy answer is to let banks compete on-chain: enable tokenised deposits, allow banks to serve as custodians/issuers under clear reserve and redemption rules, and impose graduated caps for non-bank issuers that rise with compliance performance. Paired with granular reporting to the SBP and rupee settlement for the onshore leg, Ms Lateef says that this system can “keep competition and efficiency, without sacrificing macroeconomic control”.

Borrowing from President Donald Trump’s vocabulary, he described the relationship as having “never been so good looking” in recent memory, while acknowledging that it still requires more substance.
The envoy was speaking at a symposium, organised by Pakistani students at Georgetown University, which covered a wide range of topics and featured several speakers from diverse backgrounds.
 
 

Most speakers attended the discussions in person, while some participated via video link.
Ambassador Robin Raphel, a former head of the State Department’s Bureau of South Asian Affairs, said President Trump had removed the “emotionalism” that previously hindered US efforts to rebuild ties with Pakistan.

Georgetown symposium brings together Pakistani intellectuals to discuss foreign policy, economic challenges and opportunities

“Now is the time to strengthen the relationship with a country that remains strategically important,” she added, pointing to Pakistan’s proximity to some of the world’s most sensitive regions.
Ambassador Shaikh also highlighted Pakistan’s potential as “a large country with the fifth-largest population and many things to offer”, adding that the Trump administration viewed Pakistan as a country with its own identity, rather than solely in reference to Afghanistan or India.
Former US ambassador Maleeha Lodhi outlined five key areas likely to dominate Pakistan’s foreign policy in the years ahead.
These areas include managing relations with China and the United States amid the US-China confrontation, addressing challenges in Afghanistan, maintaining an adversarial stance towards India, and balancing ties between strategic ally Saudi Arabia and neighbour Iran.
 
 

She described the situation in Kabul as a major security and foreign policy challenge, calling it “a severe policy dilemma” for Islamabad.
“There are obvious limits to a coercive approach and military response, as a total breakdown in relations with Afghanistan is not in Pakistan’s interest — especially given the already fraught ties with India,” she said.
Former senator Mushahid Hussain reflected on Pakistan’s evolving relationship with the US, urging Islamabad to leverage the current focus on economic and strategic engagement to rebuild its economy.
 
 

He emphasised Pakistan’s role as a regional security provider in the Middle East, asserting that only a strong and stable Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital, can bring lasting peace to the region. His remarks were met with warm applause from the audience.
Prof Akbar S. Ahmed highlighted the challenges in the country’s tribal areas, praising the wisdom of local communities and warning about Balochistan, which makes up over 40 per cent of Pakistan’s total area. He urged that the mistakes of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) should not be repeated.
He said no state can be sustained without justice, fairness and generosity. “We must consider the factors that truly support democracy,” he added, stressing that a functioning democracy is impossible without education.
Other speakers highlighted the critical role of Pakistan’s young population, with a median age of just 23, in shaping social and political movements.
Dr Mehlaqa Samdani, who leads a group lobbying for Mr Khan’s release from prison, sought permission to address Ambassador Shaikh, but the session ended before she could speak.

Asia states
• Afghan traders say Islamabad still shortest, cheapest route to seaports
• Uzbek president proposes new bloc
AFGHANISTAN is seeking to significantly bolster trade with the oil-rich countries of Central Asia as it attempts to end its economic dependence on Pakistan, which has historically been Kabul’s biggest trading partner.
However, experts warn that geography, high costs, and political constraints will hinder efforts by Afghanistan’s cash-strapped and unrecognised Taliban government to shift trade to Central Asia, according to a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty report.
Kabul’s attempts to find new trade partners come after the worst outbreak of hostilities with Islamabad in years. The neighbours exchanged military attacks last month, killing dozens of people and leading to Pakistan closing its border with Afghanistan.
The month-long border closure has inflicted some $200 million in losses for Afghan traders, who rely on Pakistani seaports to access international markets.
Similarly, Pakistan had been exporting fresh fruits, cement, medicines, surgical items, agricultural tools, fabrics, shoes, plastic pipes and sanitary items, cosmetics, and a variety of other locally manufactured products valued at around $100–200m per month to the neighbouring country.
‘Trade alternatives’
Senior Taliban officials have urged Afghan traders and investors to end their activities in Pakistan and find new business and trade opportunities in Central Asia. “We are actively working with our northern neighbors to find reliable trade alternatives,” Taliban Commerce Minister Nooruddin Azizi said last week.
Abdul Ghani Baradar, a Taliban deputy prime minister, accused Islamabad of using trade as a “tool of political pressure” and framed the ongoing border closure as evidence that Kabul must reduce its reliance on its neighbour.
Swiss-based Afghan expert Torek Farhadi said the Taliban’s new emphasis on trade with Central Asia is “largely political posturing”.
Central Asia is landlocked, and Afghanistan must rely on long-distance overland corridors to reach markets. The region’s tariff structures impose high costs on many Afghan exports, especially agricultural goods. The logistics of handling, storing, and transporting perishable goods such as fruits and vegetables remain underdeveloped.
“To make the northern route commercially viable, Afghanistan would need to remove tariffs and offer incentives to its Central Asian partners,” Mr Farhadi told RFE/RL.
“But for the government in Kabul, customs revenue is one of their primary income sources.”
Meanwhile, several railway projects, crucial for scaling cross-border trade, remain unfinished or lack financing.
The Taliban’s lack of international recognition also prevents it from accessing funds from global institutions like the World Bank and IMF, limiting investment in the infrastructure needed to support northbound trade, Farhadi said.
Those factors have ensured that Afghanistan’s trade with Central Asia, although growing, has remained modest.
Trade between Afghanistan and the five Central Asian states — Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan — has grown steadily, reaching nearly $1.7 billion, according to Afghan officials.
Still dependent
Despite Afghanistan’s growing trade with Central Asia, Kabul remains dependent on Pakistan as Islamabad has long provided its neighbor with the fastest and most affordable access to global markets.
The border crossings at Torkham and Chaman remain the backbone of Afghanistan’s commercial lifelines, but the repeated skirmishes in recent months caused frequent border closures. The most recent closures following armed clashes between Pakistani and Taliban forces left thousands of trucks stranded for weeks.
But for Afghan traders, few alternatives can match Pakistan’s proximity or port infrastructure. Shifting trade away from those routes means higher transport costs, longer transit times, and increased logistical risks, experts say.
“The reality is that Afghanistan’s shortest and cheapest route to seaports as well as India and other South Asian markets is through Pakistan,” said Azarakhsh Hafizi, the former head of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce.
“We need all transit routes to remain open. It would benefit not only Afghanistan and Pakistan, but it is also important for the regional economic integration,” said Hafizi, who previously held membership in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Saarc.
Regional bloc proposed
Uzbek President Shavkat Mirzi­yoyev proposed on Sunday forming a regional co-operation organisation he called the “Community of Central Asia”, in what he said was a bid to promote economic integration in the region of more than 80 million people, Reuters reported.
In a speech at a meeting in Tashkent of the leaders of the five post-Soviet republics of Central Asia, as well as Azerbaijan, Mirziyoyev suggested transforming regular meetings between the leaders of the five former Soviet republics of Central Asia into a formal regional bloc.
He also stressed the need to boost economic, security and environmental cooperation.
There was no immediate indication of the other countries’ response to the Uzbek proposal, but all five countries have in recent years said they want greater regional integration, where ties were sometimes testy in decades past.
All five leaders visited Washington in unison for talks with US President Donald Trump earlier this month.
Two of the countries, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, earlier this year settled a longstanding border conflict that had claimed hundreds of lives.

The resolution for a vote of no confidence against Mr Haq was submitted to the Assembly secretariat on Friday afternoon. Sho­rtly afterwards, Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar summoned the Assembly to meet at 3pm on Monday.
While the PPP had already secured the supp­ort of the required 27 law­makers, its chairman Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari had stressed at a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) should not only support the no-trust move to ensure a “thum­ping majority” but also join the next coalition setup.
 
 

However, the PML-N leadership announced that it would back the no-confidence motion but would not take any share in a PPP-led government. Cons­equently, the party’s two senior AJK leaders Shah Ghulam Qadir and Raja Farooq Haider signed the resolution along with the 23 PPP legislators.
On the other hand, the five-member PTI, which currently holds the office of Leader of the Opposition, as well as the two single-seat parties — Muslim Conference and Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party (JKPP) — have announced that they will stay away from the process.
On Sunday, two more PTI ‘forward-bloc’ lawmakers — Minister for Elementary Education Deewan Ali Chughtai and Minister for Small Industries Corporation Taqdees Kausar Gillani — announced their decision to join the PPP after meeting Faryal Talpur, raising its own support base to 29.
“We will get the no-confidence motion through with a wide margin,” said Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, a senior PPP figure and cabinet member in the Haq-led coalition government. “The PML-N will also support us in this regard,” he added.
 
 

It was, however, yet to be seen whether the movers of the no-trust motion, who have accused Mr Haq of causing “serious damage to the constitutional, ideological and democratic framework of the state through his governance style, political narrative and confrontational conduct”,  would defend their position through speeches in Monday’s session.
Ironically, neither had any of the movers stepped down on their own, nor had Mr Haq mustered the courage to remove them in response to their allegations.
Referring to these accusations in an interview with a private TV channel, Mr Haq termed them “childish” and “frivolous”, adding that those who drafted them did not themselves appear to understand what they had written.
“The charge sheet against me leaves one wondering whether the allegations were even understood before being made. If my cabinet colleagues had difficulty writing in Urdu, they could have asked me; I would have drafted the accusations against myself in better words,” he remarked.
Mr Haq claimed he had broken the “status quo” and ensured cabinet involvement in all decisions.
Responding strongly to the allegation of “confrontational conduct” in the no-confidence text, the embattled prime minister asserted that his speeches, videos and public statements over the past two and a half years were on record, and that a disruptive mindset did not — and could not — exist in him. “The person who wrote this phrase should at least know what he was writing,” he said.
Under the AJK Constitution, a vote of no confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution. Once the motion succeeds, Mr Rathore will stand elected as the new prime minister, fourth in the sitting assembly since its installation in 2021.
Mr Majeed said the new premier was likely to take the oath of office on Tuesday before President Barrister Sultan Mahmood.
PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari is also expected to attend the swearing-in ceremony, among other dignitaries, he added.

• Calls from IMF, armed forces, others to re-balance transfer of resources to provinces go unheeded
• Centre ‘backs off’ from changes to award after deal with PPP
ISLAMABAD: The inaugural session of the National Finance Commission (NFC), constituted three months ago, is not in sight, as the proposed date of Nov 18 has also been postponed amid a downward revision in the economic growth forecast by up to 0.7 per cent to 3.5pc for the current fiscal year.
Informed sources said told Dawn that Prime Minister Shehbaz  Sharif wanted to set the ball rolling at the political level on key Centre-provincial matters before opening the debate for financial rearrangements at the technically-constitutional forum of NFC.
The 11th NFC was constituted on Aug 22 to give a fresh award for the sharing of federal divisible resources among the Centre and the provinces.
The first meeting was originally called for Aug 27 and then delayed to Aug 29 for unannounced reasons. The meeting was postponed again on the request of Sindh government due to floods.
The 7th NFC award delivered in 2009 thus remains in place for over 15 years against its five-year constitutional term.
As a result, repeated calls from various quarters, including the finance ministry, the armed forces, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to re-balance the transfer of a larger chunk of divisible pool resources to the provinces under the 7th NFC award have gone unaddressed.
 
 

The Constitution promises that provincial shares in each NFC award cannot be reduced. The NFC award has to be achieved with consensus of five parties — the Centre and the four provinces.
Under the 7th NFC award, the four provinces are collectively entitled to 57.5pc of divisible pool taxes, besides the revenue from income tax, wealth tax, capital value tax, general sales tax, customs duties and federal excise.
The provincial governments receive their horizontal shares on the basis of population, poverty, revenue collection, and inverse population density.
This allows Punjab to obtain a share of 51.74pc, Sindh 24.55pc, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 14.62pc, and Balochistan 9.09pc.
Political bargain
The sources said the provinces had been conveyed the date of Nov 18 for the inaugural meeting early this month, although without issuing a formal notification.
They added that the Prime Minister’s Office called for postponing the meeting and for not communicating a new date to the provinces before the premier could take up the matter with the coalition partners.
The prime minister has officially no role in the NFC engagements after the commission is constituted by the president.
The revision in the NFC parameters was originally part of the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment as the Centre wanted to reduce the financial shares of the provinces and take back some of the devolved subjects like education, population, etc.
However, the federal government stepped back in a political bargain with its main coalition partner, the PPP, for amendments relating to the armed forces and the judiciary.
Nevertheless, the prime minister has been hinting at continuing dialogue with the PPP for the NFC.
While the Centre had already crafted a major revenue source — petroleum development levy (PDL) on various products instead of the NFC –it has also secured about Rs1.5tr cashback from the provinces outside the award.
Revenue sources outside NFC
The combined impact of the two — PDL and provincial cash surplus — work out to be around Rs3 trillion for the current fiscal year — almost 2pc of the GDP.
On top of this, the Centre has secured Rs2.5 billion each for the current and last fiscal years on account of State Bank of Pakistan’s profits as a consequence of record-high interest rates.
The provincial cash surplus could be impacted by the shortfall in Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) tax collection, which has already amounted to Rs275bn in the first four months and is likely to grow as the year progresses amid lower than the budgeted economic growth rate.
The GDP growth rate has a direct bearing on the FBR’s tax collection and as a consequence on the NFC shares of the provinces and then their commitments to provide cash surplus to the Centre under the National Financial Pact orchestrated outside the Constitution under the dictats of the IMF to ensure healthy finances to the federation.
The lower GDP growth could, however, be partly compensated by higher inflation that generate greater sales tax receipts.
Flood devastation
Recently, the finance ministry told the National Assembly that a report compiled by the planning ministry based on data available as of Sept 30 showed that flood “devastation has led to a projected reduction in FY2026 GDP growth by 0.3-0.7pc, lowering the growth outlook from 4.2pc to a range of 3.5-3.9pc”.
The planning ministry had estimated economic loss of Rs822bn, equivalent to approximately $2.9bn, it said.
The finance ministry said the floods had exerted upward pressure on inflation.
In the first two months of FY2026 — July and August — inflation remained at 4.1pc and 3pc, respectively; however, in September, it surged to 5.6pc, mainly driven by higher food prices, it added.
The agriculture sector, with damages of Rs430bn (crops losses at Rs422.7bn), alongside significant infrastructure losses of Rs307bn (road infrastructure losses at Rs187.8bn), have been a primary driver of this downturn, the finance ministry said, adding that “due to the crops damages, the growth of agriculture sector is projected at 3pc-3.8pc against the target of 4.5pc.
 
 

The finance ministry further said the annual targets for key macroeconomic variables were approved by the National Economic Council.
“These targets remain intact; however, internal assessments are carried out to evaluate the impacts of changing domestic and external conditions,” it added.
“Amid the recent floods, considering the estimated economic loss of Rs822bn, the overall GDP growth is projected to decline for FY2025- 26 based on lower growth in agriculture due to extensive crop damages while growth in industry and services may also suffer due to linkages with agriculture.”
Moreover, it warned that the rice exports could also suffer while imports of raw cotton, wheat, pulses, and construction materials could increase, thereby widening the trade deficit and straining foreign exchange reserves.
However, higher expected workers’ remittances might offset the adverse impact of floods and keeping the current account deficit in check. Likewise, there is a risk of inflationary pressures, particularly on food and essential items, due to crop losses, supply chain disruptions, and higher input costs.

“Iran is a brotherly, friendly country. Pakistan is always in favour of finding peaceful resolutions of issues through dialogue and diplomacy, and we appreciate the offer of mediation of our brotherly country, Iran,” Andrabi told Dawn upon a query about reports that Tehran was working to convene a regional meeting for mediation between Islamabad and the Afghan Taliban.
“We believe that Iran can play an important role. We would not shy away from any mediatory role by Iran. Mediations are always welcome,” Andrabi said, adding that Pakistan had a “very strong case”.
He further stated: “Generally, mediations are resented by a country or a side which is on a weak legal or a political case. Pakistan’s case on this issue, on terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, is very strong. So, obviously we will not shy away from mediation.”
Pakistan, which has been grappling with the problem of terrorism for long, has been demanding that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. But, the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegation of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
Earlier this month, a third round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators from Turkiye and Qatar, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to prevent cross-border terrorism. The talks had followed deadly border clashes between the two neighbours in October.
The border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on the night of October 11 and continued into the next morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm or deny whether it was behind the strikes, but maintained that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on the evening of October 15, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
But on November 7, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban have suspended trade ties with Pakistan.
Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Iran and Russia called for continued dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan to resolve their ongoing disputes on cross-border terrorism.
Previously on Nov 9, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had spoken with his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, Ishaq Dar and Amir Khan Muttaqi, discussing bilateral ties as well as the recent negotiations in Istanbul between Islamabad and Kabul.
According to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, Araghchi had also expressed Iran’s readiness for any kind of assistance to resolve differences between the two countries.
The same day, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin would visit Islamabad next week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to suffer casualties among its security forces and civilian population in terror attacks, which authorities link to Afghanistan.</p><small>2025-11-17 02:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16224610aa21e67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955465/pilgrims-with-certain-diseases-health-conditions-to-be-barred-from-performing-haj-in-2026' target='_blank'><strong>Pilgrims with certain diseases, health conditions to be barred from performing Haj in 2026</strong></a><br><p>The Saudi government has imposed a restriction on pilgrims with certain health conditions, including chronic and infectious diseases, from performing Haj next year, according to a notice on the Ministry of Religious Affairs website.
The notice, citing the Saudi health ministry, lists organ failure such as kidney diseases requiring dialysis, heart diseases in cases where patients are not capable of even slight exertion, chronic lung disease with patients requiring intermittent or continuous oxygen and liver failure or liver cirrhosis as conditions that do not meet the criteria for Haj.
The list also includes those suffering from neurological or cognitive disorders that affect memory, dementia and severe physical disability. Moreover, aged individuals with Alzheimer’s or suffering from tremors, as well as pregnant women in their last trimester or with those with complicated pregnancies, would also face restrictions.
Furthermore, those with infectious diseases that pose a risk to others in large gatherings, such as whooping cough, open pulmonary tuberculosis and viral haemorrhagic fever, would also be barred from performing Haj.
The list further includes patients suffering from advanced stages of cancer and undergoing chemotherapy, biological or radiological treatment.
The religious affairs ministry in Pakistan urged doctors to issue health certificates to the pilgrims after proper verification to avoid legal action and warned that in case of any false and incorrect declarations about health, the relevant pilgrim would have to return from Saudi Arabia at their own expense.
In case any of the above-mentioned illnesses were detected in an individual while getting vaccinated, medical officers at the Haj camp would be authorised to stop them from travelling, the notice stated.
Saudi monitoring teams would verify the validity of the pilgrims’ fitness certificates at the entry and exit points and locations of Haj to ensure that only those meeting the health criteria participate in the pilgrimage, the notice said.</p><small>2025-11-16 20:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1610433994d91f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955436/hyderabad-fireworks-explosion-death-toll-climbs-to-9-fir-registered-against-factory-owner-and-others' target='_blank'><strong>Hyderabad fireworks explosion death toll climbs to 9; FIR registered against factory owner and others</strong></a><br><p>Police have registered a case against multiple suspects, including the owner of an allegedly illegal firecracker factory in Hyderabad, where an explosion occurred yesterday. As a result of the explosion, at least nine people have died so far.
The first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered yesterday on the complaint of B-Section Station House Officer (SHO) Niaz Panhwar.
It invoked Sections 322 (punishment for intentional murder), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 286 (negligent conduct with respect explosive substance), 336 (punishment for mutilation or dismemberment of a limb), 336-B (punishment for hurt by corrosive substance), 337-H (punishment for hurt by a rash or negligent act) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
Factory owner Asad Yousafzai and his alleged accomplices, Rashid Khan, Dilshad Khan, Arshad and Shakeel Punjabi, have been nominated as suspects in the FIR.
The FIR quoted SHO Panhwar as saying that he received information about the explosion and resultant fire at the factory at 4.03pm. He further stated in his complaint that police, fire brigade and rescue officials rushed to the spot, where he found some bodies upon his arrival. The injured, he added, were taken to the hospital in Edhi ambulances.
The SHO said three of the deceased could not immediately be identified.
According to him, factory owner Asad Yousufzai and his accomplices had set up the factory illegally in the riverine area of Hyderabad’s Latifabad. Human lives were lost when the explosion occurred at the site, and human limbs were found at the spot, he said.
Separately,  Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Adeel Chandio told Dawn that police had arrested some of the suspects, but prime suspect Yousufzai remained at large and raids were being conducted to hunt him down.
Death toll
The seventh death as a consequence of the incident was reported earlier today after another body was pulled out from the rubble of the explosion.
Rescue officials confirmed to Dawn the recovery of one more body from the rubble, which was pulled out late on Saturday.
Later today, Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital’s medical superintendent (MS), Dr Khalid Bukhari, told Dawn over the phone that two of the injured brought to the facility in Karachi had succumbed to their injuries.
They had suffered severe burns, he said, adding that one of the injured, who had full-thickness burns and whose left leg had been amputated, died today morning and another died in the evening.
Hyderabad’s Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) administration had been informed of the deaths, the MS said.
Dr Roshan Chandio, the registrar at the LUH burns ward, also confirmed to Dawn that two patients who had been shifted to Karachi’s Civil Hospital due to their critical condition had died.
Meanwhile, Hyderabad Deputy Commissioner Zain Ul Abedin Memon told Dawn that he had approached Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Vice Chancellor Dr Ikram Din Ujjan and LUH MS Ershad Kazmi regarding the identification of four of the bodies.
“The severely burned bodies have been claimed by their heirs, but DNA tests are required to confirm their identities,” he said, adding that he had written letters to Dr Ujjan and Kazmi, asking them to conduct the bodies’ DNA tests at the earliest.
He added that he had instructed that the heirs should be facilitated throughout the process and not be charged for the tests or other related formalities, considering the humanitarian aspect of the case.
‘Illegal factory’
Yesterday, Latifabad Assistant Commissioner Saud Lund had confirmed that firecrackers at the factory were being illegally manufactured in a house without a licence.
However, the Hyderabad senior superintendent of police said: “Initial findings show that the factory owner actually got a licence for some other spot, but he was manufacturing firecrackers at the present location.”
He said that the owner was absconding, and details of the factory’s licence were being verified
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed the relevant authorities to determine the cause of the explosion and conduct a comprehensive audit of the factory’s safety measures.
Sindh Home Minister Lanjar instructed officials to immediately investigate the factory’s legal status and verify whether it held the required licence and adhered to safety regulations for manufacturing fireworks.</p><small>2025-11-16 19:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/162303108e8fcc0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955466/maaz-sadaqat-dazzles-as-pakistan-shaheens-crush-india-a-in-rising-stars-asia-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Maaz Sadaqat dazzles as Pakistan Shaheens crush India ‘A’ in Rising Stars Asia Cup</strong></a><br><p>Maaz Sadaqat’s blazing unbeaten 79 off 47 balls powered Pakistan Shaheens to a commanding eight-wicket victory over India ‘A’ in their Rising Stars Asia Cup Group ‘B’ clash on Saturday, chasing down 137 with 40 balls to spare.
The 19-year-old all-rounder, who also claimed two wickets earlier, single-handedly dismantled India’s bowling after a dropped catch, ensuring Shaheens maintained their unbeaten run in the tournament.
Electing to bowl first at Doha’s West End Park, Pakistan’s disciplined attack triggered a spectacular Indian collapse, bundling out the opposition for 136 in 19 overs after a promising start.
Teenage sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi, 14, lit up the innings with a fiery 45 off 28 balls (five fours and three sixes), smashing boundaries at will against Ubaid Shah and Shahid Aziz. Partnering with Naman Dhir (35 off 20, six fours and a six), Suryavanshi added 49 for the second wicket, propelling India to 81-2 by the ninth over.
But Sufiyan Muqeem’s left-arm wrist spin turned the tide, dismissing Suryavanshi caught at long-on in a contentious decision upheld after multiple replays.
Captain Jitesh Sharma’s scratchy five precipitated a middle-order meltdown; India lost eight wickets for just 35 runs in the final 10 overs.
Maaz (2-12) and Saad Masood (2-31) choked the scoring with clever variations, while Shahid (3-24) mopped up the tail with yorkers and slower balls. Harsh Dubey’s late 19 off 15 offered brief resistance, but India’s total — the tournament’s lowest a day after their 297 against UAE — proved inadequate.
Shaheen’s chase began aggressively, Maaz and Mohammad Naeem (14 off 10) racing to 51-0 in five overs thanks to Gurjapneet Singh’s wayward spell (. Yash Thakur provided a breakthrough, with Dhir’s diving catch at mid-off, but Maaz exploded; a half-century off 31 balls included audacious sixes off Dhir’s off-spin and Suyash Sharma.
Dropped on 56 by Suryavanshi at point, Maaz unleashed fury, sealing victory with Mohammad Faiq (16 not out off 14) via a pull for six in the 14th over.
India’s fielding woes — missed chances and misfields — compounded bowling errors, as Pakistan’s required run rate dipped below four.
Scores in brief:
INDIA ‘A’ 136 in 19 overs (V. Suryavanshi 45, N.

Pacers Haris Rauf and Mohammad Wasim Junior (3-47) and left-arm wrist spinner Faisal Akram (2-42) starred with the ball before contrasting half centuries by Fakhar Zaman (55 off 45) and Mohammad Rizwan (61 not out off 92) guided Pakistan to the 212-run target with 32 balls remaining.
It was Pakistan’s second successive ODI series triumph after their 2-1 win over South Africa earlier this month, with focus now shifting to the T20I tri-series featuring the hosts alongside Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.
After Pakistan won the toss and opted to field, Haris, Wasim and Faisal struck at regular intervals through the innings, preventing Sri Lanka from building momentum at any stage.
A flurry of crisp strokes on a batting-friendly pitch by Sri Lankan openers Patthum Nissanka and Kamil Mishara gave the visitors a flying start before the in-form Haris forced Nissanka to play one onto his stumps. Sri Lanka nevertheless reached 57-1 by the end of the first 10 overs.
First-drop Kusal Mendis carried the momentum, flicking two full deliveries by Haris for boundaries in the 11th over. But Sri Lanka suffered another setback when Mishara poked at an outswinger by Wasim to get caught behind in the next over.
The dismissal slowed down the run-rate, with Kusal and Sadeera Samarawickrama taking Sri Lanka to 99-2 by the 20th over, which featured a successful DRS review saving Samarawickrama after an lbw decision by spinner Faisal.
With the boundary drought stretching — 47 balls to be precise — pressure mounted on the batters, culminating in another breakthrough for Pakistan and another for Wasim, who seamed one in to castle Kusal through the gate as the Islanders slipped to 117-3 at the halfway mark.
Faisal, who had kept things tight in his five overs, returned to remove Kamindu Mendis off his own bowling in a soft dismissal, pushing Sri Lanka deeper into trouble. Janith Liyanage followed next, chopping Faheem Ashraf’s medium pace onto his stumps.
Faisal then produced a superb delivery in the 36th over, spinning one back sharply into the right-handed Samarawickrama to bowl him for 48.
Maheesh Theekshana fell soon after to a searing yorker by Pakistan captain Shaheen Shah Afridi, with DRS upholding the lbw call. Another pinpoint yorker saw Wasim uproot Jefferey Vandersay’s middle stump.
After Pavan Rathnayake threatened a late rally by launching Haris over long-off for six, his partner Pramod Madushan succumbed to a fierce bouncer, the ball flying off his gloves into the hands of wicket-keeper Haseebullah Khan.
Rathnayake was the last to fall, courtesy of a sharp throw by substitute Saim Ayub that found him short of his crease.
Pakistan’s start with the bat proved tricky as opener Haseebullah perished attempting to clear the infield off Maheesh Theekshana but ended up holing out to Eshan Malinga at mid-on in the fourth over.
Fakhar responded to the early wicket with a firm whip through midwicket off Pramod Madushan for his second boundary, before Babar Azam punched Theekshana for two crisp drives through the off side in the next over.
Fakhar heaved Theekshana over his head for another four as Pakistan reached 46-1 by the end of 10 overs.
Fakhar and Babar raised their fifty stand in the 12th over, the latter caressing Madushan for a cover boundary before the former punished a wide delivery by medium-pacer Liyanage for four.
Fakhar notched his 19th ODI half-century by smacking Jeffery Vandersay through the on side in the 14th over. But he departed soon after — for 55 off 45 — finding a diving Kamindu Mendis at deep midwicket off Vandersay.
Just as Pakistan crossed 100 in the 20th over, Vandersay delivered a brilliant googly to deceive Babar (34 off 52) and shatter his stumps.
The leg-spinner struck again in the 25th over, trapping Salman Ali Agha lbw, the third umpire overturning the on-field decision as Sri Lanka sensed an opening at the halfway stage.
Rizwan, at the other end, responded with an exquisite cover drive off Malinga in the following over.
But as the pitch’s sluggishness increasingly came into play, Rizwan and incoming Hussain Talat opted for caution, relying on hard running rather than strokeplay.
The next boundary arrived after more than 12 overs when Rizwan placed a full toss by Malinga behind square with ease. The former Pakistan captain brought up his second successive fifty off 84 balls in the 42nd over.
He was dropped on 55 in the 44th over, but Pakistan needed only nine more runs by then.
Four came off a straight drive by Rizwan against Madushan before Hussain (42 off 57) struck another boundary to seal the match.</p><small>2025-11-16 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/162112011983575.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955463/jaffar-express-targeted-again-escapes-bomb-attack-in-balochistans-nasirabad-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Jaffar Express targeted again, escapes bomb attack in Balochistan’s Nasirabad: officials</strong></a><br><p>The Jaffar Express, which has been targeted multiple times in the recent past, escaped a bomb attack in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district on Sunday, police and railway officials said.
According to police officials, unidentified attackers had planted an explosive device on the railway track in the Shaheed Abdul Aziz Bullo area to target the Peshawar-bound train that was travelling from Quetta and later detonated it.
However, the train passed the area safely, and no loss of life was reported, the officials said.
Nasirabad Senior Superintendent of Police Ghulam Sarwar told Dawn that police and other security forces had reached the site soon after the blast, cordoned off the area and initiated an investigation.
“A search operation has also been launched to trace the elements involved in the bomb attack,” he said.
Separately, railway officials told Dawn a portion of the track was damaged due to the blast, as a result of which railway traffic between Quetta and the rest of the country was suspended. Meanwhile, the officials added that the Jaffar Express continued its journey to Peshawar after reaching Jacobabad in Sindh.
The railway officials said Jaffar Express had resumed operations today after a suspension of four days. The train’s operations were suspended due to security concerns, they said.
With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.
Jaffar Express has been attacked frequently since March 11, when  Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages. Consequently, the security forces initiated an operation that lasted two days.
Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the Jaffar Express clearance operation launched a day after the train’s unprecedented hijacking, was complete. He added that all terrorists, 33 in total, at the site of the attack had been killed.
On June 18, the detonation of a remote-controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks derailed four bogies of the Jaffar Express near the cattle market in Jacobabad. No one was hurt in the incident, but the attack was reportedly claimed by the banned Baloch Repu­blican Guards in a statement.
On August 7, the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped disaster when a bomb planted near the track close to Sibi Railway Station exploded just after the passenger train passed.
Later that week on August 10, no loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of Jaffar Express. Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, told Dawn: “A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train.“
On September 23, at least four people were injured as a blast derailed six bogies of Jaffar Express near Spezand town in the Dasht tehsil of Balochistan’s Mastung district.
On October 7, at least seven people were injured after a blast on a railway track derailed four bogies of Jaf­far Express in Sindh’s Shikarpur district.
Shikarpur Deputy Commissioner Shakeel Abro told Dawn, “A blast had occurred on the train tracks at 8:15am. The incident occurred at a distance of 1km from the Sultan Kot railway station.”
Later that month, on October 29, the train service escaped a rocket attack in the Notal area of Nasir­abad district.
“Armed men fired four rockets from a distance to target the passenger train,”  Nasira­bad SSP Ghulam Sarwar told Dawn, adding that none of the rockets hit the train.</p><small>2025-11-16 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16201134ff2cf64.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955460/accomplice-of-delhi-car-blast-suicide-bomber-arrested-indian-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>Accomplice of Delhi car blast ‘suicide bomber’ arrested: Indian authorities</strong></a><br><p>Indian authorities claimed on Sunday that a deadly car blast in New Delhi earlier this week was an attack carried out by a “suicide bomber”, announcing the arrest of an accomplice.
The National Investigation Agency (NIA), the country’s counter-terrorism body, said the attacker and the second suspect were both from India-occupied Kashmir, where police have carried out sweeping raids in recent days.
Announcing “a breakthrough” in the investigation, the NIA said it had arrested Amir Rashid Ali, describing him as an accomplice of the “suicide bomber” under whose name “the car involved in the attack was registered”.
He had come to Delhi to “facilitate the purchase of the car which was eventually used as a vehicle-borne Improvised Explosive Device (IED) to trigger the blast”, the counter-terrorism agency said in a statement.
It identified the car’s driver as Umarun Nabi, a resident of occupied Kashmir who was an assistant professor in general medicine at a university in the northern state of Haryana.
The explosion on Monday took place near a busy metro station close to the landmark Red Fort in the capital’s Old Delhi quarter, where the prime minister delivers the annual Independence Day address.
A hospital official said the blast killed 12 people. It was unclear whether Nabi was included in the toll. The NIA’s statement said the attack “claimed 10 innocent lives and left 32 others injured”.
The NIA claimed it had seized another vehicle belonging to Nabi.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the attack a “conspiracy”, and his government vowed to bring the “perpetrators, their collaborators and their sponsors” to justice.</p><small>2025-11-16 16:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161917303959499.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955457/coas-munir-reiterates-pakistans-commitment-to-enhance-military-to-military-cooperation-with-jordan' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir reiterates Pakistan’s commitment to enhance military-to-military cooperation with Jordan</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir reiterated on Sunday Pakistan’s commitment to further enhancing military-to-military cooperation with Jordan and jointly realising the mutual vision of a stable and peaceful region, according to the military’s media affairs wing.
The army chief also underscored the “strong defence partnership” between Pakistan and the Hashemite Kingdom — the royal family of Jordan — during a visit of Jordan’s King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein at the Tilla Field Firing Ranges near Jhelum, a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
The Jordanian king, who arrived in Pakistan for a two-day official visit on Saturday, also visited Global Industrial and Defence Solutions, the state-owned conglomerate involved in the export and marketing of military, industrial and technological products and services. He was accompanied by Princess Salma bint Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein and a delegation of Jordanian civil and military officials and was received by Field Marshal Munir and other officials, according to the ISPR.
 






The ISPR statement said that during his visit to GIDS, the Jordanian king was given a comprehensive briefing on the structure, capabilities, and product portfolio of the conglomerate.
“The briefing showcased Pakistan’s progress in indigenous defence production, technological innovation, and potential avenues for bilateral defence cooperation between Pakistan and Jordan,” the statement added.
Later, it said, King Abdullah visited Tilla Field Firing Ranges, where he was joined by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “Vugar Valeh oglu Mustafayev, minister of defence industry of the Republic of Azerbaijan, was also amongst the distinguished guests at the firing ranges.”
At the firing ranges, the “distinguished guests witnessed a joint fire and manoeuvre exercise”, the ISPR statement said, adding that the “exercise demonstrated multi-domain operations, including conventional and air firepower, coordinated manoeuvres, spectrum warfare capabilities supported by multi-purpose drones employed in various configurations and roles”.

“King Abdullah II appreciated the high standards of training, professionalism, and operational capabilities and preparedness demonstrated by the participating troops and aircrews,” it further stated.
Moreover, PM Shehbaz expressed “Pakistan’s deep respect and affection for His Majesty King Abdullah II and the people of Jordan, noting that the visit reflects the enduring friendship, mutual trust and a shared desire for peace and development”.
Earlier, the ISPR statement said, King Abdullah conferred upon the COAS the Order of the Military Merit of First Degree, “in recognition of his outstanding service and significant contributions to strengthening military cooperation between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Pakistan”.
The statement highlighted that the Jordanian king’s visit to Pakistan “marks a significant milestone in reinforcing the historic bonds of fraternity and brotherhood between Pakistan and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan”.
Highest civilian award for Jordanian king
Separately, the Government of Pakistan also conferred the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civilian award, upon King Abdullah II of Jordan
during a special Investiture ceremony at the Presidency in Islamabad today.
The accolade was presented to the king, who is on a two-day visit to the country, by President Asif Ali Zardari. In response, King Abdullah conferred the Order of the Bejewelled Grand Cordon of Al-Nahda, one of the kingdom’s highest honours, upon President Zardari.

PM Shehbaz and other federal ministers were present at the ceremony, while PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari were also in attendance.
“His Majesty, King Abdullah II … is a visionary leader and a statesman of exceptional statesmanship who has championed the cause of moderation, justice and dialogue amongst nations,” the citation for the award said.
“Under His Majesty’s sagacious leadership, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has emerged as a beacon of stability, tolerance and prosperity in the region,” it added. “His unwavering advocacy for a just and lasting resolution of the Palestinian question and his efforts towards reaching the Gaza peace agreement have earned him profound international acclaim and recognition.
“His Majesty has been a steadfast friend of Pakistan. By virtue of his personal engagement, the bilateral relations between Pakistan and Jordan have been significantly strengthened across diverse fields encompassing political and economic cooperation, defence collaboration, educational partnerships, cultural exchanges and people-to-people contacts.”
It continued: “These developments serve to reinforce the enduring foundation of the historic friendship and brotherhood between the two nations, while concurrently fostering new avenues of cooperation.
“The people and government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan deeply value His Majesty King Abdullah II’s … commitment to strengthening bilateral relations and consistent solidarity with Pakistan.
“In recognition of his remarkable statesmanship and enduring contributions for further cementing Pakistan-Jordan relations, coupled with promotion of regional and international peace, the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has been pleased to confer … the award of Nishan-i-Pakistan as a symbol of profound respect, admiration and friendship from the people and Government of Pakistan.”
The prime minister and Jordanian king also held a bilateral meeting on Saturday at the PM House after the latter arrived in Pakistan.
During the meeting, both leaders affirmed “zero-tolerance” for any displacement of Palestinians from the besieged Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the devastating military onslaught by Israel in the territory.
King Abdullah II also praised Pakistan’s consistent support for Jordan’s role in regional stability and humanitarian efforts during the Gaza conflict, as well as for the territory after the ceasefire.
Both dignitaries also witnessed a ceremony on the exchange of memorandums of understanding in the fields of media, culture and education.</p><small>2025-11-16 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1617281046e99b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955455/we-will-respond-to-those-who-impose-war-on-us-in-the-same-way-we-did-in-may-coas' target='_blank'><strong>We will respond to those who impose war on us in the same way we did in May: COAS</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has said that “Pakistan will respond to those who impose war on it in the same way as it did in May” this year during the brief, but intense, conflict with India, Daily Jang reported on Sunday.
The army chief made these comments to the Urdu newspaper during a luncheon held in honour of King Abdullah II of Jordan, who arrived in Islamabad yesterday for a two-day visit.
“During the war with India, Allah helped us raise our heads high,” Field Marshal Munir said. “When a Muslim puts their trust in Allah, He turns the dirt thrown at the enemy into missiles.”
The COAS added that he performs his duties according to the command of Allah and said it was by God’s grace that Pakistan defeated its enemy.
“This army is an army of Allah and our soldiers fight in His name,” the field marshal added.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties.
India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched the retaliatory ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.
Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul last month, Field Marshal Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.”
Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms.“</p><small>2025-11-16 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161604414ee7f4e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955449/tallal-chaudhry-says-parliament-can-bring-another-constitutional-amendment-for-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Tallal Chaudhry says parliament can bring another constitutional amendment for ‘stability’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on Saturday said the ruling coalition could introduce another constitutional amendment if needed to “maintain stability” in the country.
His remarks come just three days after the 27th Amendment was signed into law after passage from the National Assembly and the Senate, amid strong opposition by the opposition parties.

Insisting that the 26th and 27th Amendments brought “stability” to the country,  Chaudhry said, “If another amendment is needed to maintain this stability, we will definitely bring it together with other parties.”
“The parliament will bring amendments whenever it wants, and the parliament should do them. The parliament should be seen as a parliament,” the PML-N leader said while addressing a media briefing in Punjab’s Faisalabad.
Responding to a query, Chaudhry termed the recent resignations of superior court judges as “political”.
On November 13, the day the 27th Amendment was enacted into law, the Supreme Court’s then-senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah resigned, censuring the legislation as an “assault” on the Constitution and as weakening the judiciary.
A day later, Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza quit the Lahore High Court, also citing the 27th Amendment as the reason, and the Islamabad High Court might also see some departures.
The state minister asserted that making amendments to the Constitution was the parliament’s right.
“Judges take oath under the Constitution; they are not a political party that they will resign if the Constitution is amended,” the PML-N leader said. “The Constitution will not be as per their (judges’) wishes, but of the parliament and the people of Pakistan,” he asserted.
“Their (judges’) every single thing — from their salaries to their decisions — is decided by the parliament,” the state minister said.
He further accused the senior judges who resigned of being “biased” and of handing “political” judgments.
“There have been many extensions of ‘good to see you’, but the environment is not the same anymore,” Chaudhry quipped, referring to the renowned remark made by former Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial in May 2023, when he said “good to see you” to ex-premier Imran Khan upon his court appearance.
 
 

The PML-N leader lamented the judges’ alleged excessive use of suo-motus — the SC’s power to take notice of matters of public importance but has now been revoked under the 27th Amendment — to “send prime ministers home” and assail the government on a whim.
On the PTI’s decision to boycott the upcoming by-elections in Faisalabad, Chaudhry said the party did not want to contest wherever there was considerable opposition.
By-elections on two NA seats (NA-96, NA-104) and three provincial ones (PP-98, PP-115, PP-116) in Faisalabad district are set for November 23.
The PML-N is likely to win all five seats up thanks to the PTI’s boycott, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) being in no condition to contest due to the recent ban on it, and the PPP fielding no candidate.</p><small>2025-11-16 11:25</small></div><hr>
