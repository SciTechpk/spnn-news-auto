The exchange comes amid strains after Washington imposed tariffs of up to 50 per cent on Indian imports, accusing New Dehli of fuelling Moscow’s deadly attacks on Ukraine by purchasing Russian oil.
But Trump and Modi, both right-wing populists, have shared a strong bond since the US president’s first term.
“Deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump’s sentiments and positive assessment of our ties,” Modi wrote on X, adding that India and the United States shared a “very positive and forward-looking comprehensive and global strategic partnership”.
 






Earlier, Trump told reporters that he “will always be friends with Modi”.
“India and the United States have a special relationship. There is nothing to worry about,” Trump said, downplaying his earlier remarks about “losing India” to China.
Last week, Modi visited China to attend a gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, his first visit to the country in seven years signalling a thaw between the two Asian powers.
Trump has appeared irritated at New Delhi as he seeks credit for what he said was Nobel Prize-worthy diplomacy for brokering peace between Pakistan and India following the worst conflict in decades between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
India, which adamantly rejects any third-party mediation on the Kashmir issue, has since given the cold shoulder to Trump.</p><small>2025-09-06 07:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06112354702bd4b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939935/not-just-a-sea-journey-former-ji-senator-details-risks-of-humanitarian-mission-to-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>‘Not just a sea journey’: former JI senator details risks of humanitarian mission to Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Despite almost two years of what has now been dubbed a “genocide” in the Gaza Strip, Israel continues to bomb, starve and torture more than a million Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
After blocking aid from entering Gaza, Israel established the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in collaboration with the United States, which set up food distribution sites, luring starving civilians and then allowing them to be shot by Israeli forces. The GHF sites have been slammed by humanitarian organisations as ‘killing fields’.
Attempting to break the blockade and put pressure on Israel to end its onslaught is a fleet of boats with participants from over 44 countries, including Pakistan. The movement, known as the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), will embark on its journey to Gaza in the early morning hours of Sunday, September 7.
The GSF is made up of four coalitions: the Sumud Nausantara, Maghreb Sumud Flotilla, Freedom Flotilla Coalition and Global March to Gaza.
A five-member Pakistan delegation led by former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan will set sail from Tunisia aboard the Sumud Nausantara, which also includes participants from Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, the Maldives and the Philippines.
 






“This is not just a sea journey, it’s not an adventure, but rather it is a task that is extremely dangerous,” former senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan said while speaking to Dawn.com.
“There are three things we are trying to achieve through this humanitarian mission to Gaza: To end the genocide, to establish a humanitarian corridor and to end the blockade and siege.”
Stressing the legality of this mission, Khan detailed that after the ships leave Tunisian waters, they will sail to Gaza through international waters.
“When governments have failed, international rights bodies such as the UN have failed, world order has failed, the people have risen and taken it upon themselves to transport aid to Gaza,” he said.

On the training given to participants, the former senator said that the volunteers have been instructed on how to behave during the journey, to remain peaceful, what to do in case of an emergency or an attack by Israeli forces and what role each individual has on board.
“Given that this is a very dangerous undertaking, we received two days of training,” he explained.
“We were taught about the salient features of a nonviolent movement, as well as how to maintain discipline on the boat and what to do in the event of an emergency — be it interception or attack.”
 






Dawn.com was told that before boarding, every member of the flotilla has to record an ‘SOS’ video, which is to be uploaded to social media in the event of their detention by Israeli forces.
Former senator Mushtaq also mentioned some of the aid the delegation will be carrying, including “baby formula for the infants that are starving to death … food and water for the malnourished civilians in Gaza … [and] medicine for them”.
The flotilla, departing from North Africa, is in touch with the vessels that departed Spain earlier this week, according to the senator.
Some of the participants in the journey are notable rights activists, such as Nelson Mandela’s grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile and Greta Thunberg. Lawyers and journalists are also in the mix of volunteers.
 
 

The flotillas were originally supposed to head to Gaza on September 5; however, weather conditions forced the boats sailing from Barcelona to divert to Menorca.
“Unfortunately, they ran into a storm, so they might be delayed in getting to Tunis. They should arrive in Tunis by September 5 and need to refuel and perform any necessary repairs, but we expect to collectively leave on September 6.”
Since the conversation with the former senator, the departure date for the vessels has changed once again and they are now expected to head to Gaza on September 7. The ex-senator also confirmed this in a voice note sent to Dawn.com.
Meanwhile, a new development has emerged. Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has branded the Global Sumud Flotilla volunteers as “terrorists” and threatened to seize their boats should they head to Gaza.
The coalition, in a statement posted to X on Thursday, slammed the Israeli minister and urged the UN and world governments to take note and guarantee safe passage to the besieged enclave.
 






“The Global Sumud Flotilla strongly condemns threats by Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir in an attempt to intimidate our participants and falsely brand them as ‘terrorists’. Such threats are not only baseless and unjust but constitute a blatant violation of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions.”
When asked about what they will do if Israeli forces intercept and board their flotilla, the former senator asserted that the participants will remain ‘non-violent’.
“We are not an army or a military force; we are civilians looking to confront and break the siege. In case the Israeli forces attack, we have been told to embody peaceful resistance, stand against oppression and break the blockade peacefully. To put our lives in danger while establishing a humanitarian corridor.”
In earlier comments made to Dawn.com, Khan had highlighted three possible outcomes of the journey to Gaza.
“There are three options. One is that we reach Gaza successfully and are able to break the blockade and show the world what is taking place there,” Khan said. “Another possibility is that they (Israel) could arrest and deport us. The third is that we are attacked by Israel and killed.“
As has been witnessed in the Freedom Flotilla’s previous attempts, the journey to reach Gaza’s shores is far from easy. Those aboard the Handala and then later the Madleen were detained and deported after Israel intercepted the vessels.
Obstacles did show for the Pakistan delegation in the path to answer the GSF’s humanitarian call, as procuring visas proved difficult for Khan’s delegation.
In social media posts, the former senator had appealed to authorities to facilitate visas for his delegation. Fortunately, the four other members were able to receive their visas on time and arrived in Tunis on Thursday.
The senator, who clarified that, as a lawmaker, he has a special passport and does not require a visa, added that the Pakistani government offered no assistance.

“The Pakistani government has not provided any aid to us,” Khan noted. “[Malaysian Prime Minister] Anwar Ibrahim is patronising the Sumud Nausantara, which we are a part of.
“If Anwar Ibrahim can do this, why can’t the Pakistani government?” the ex-senator asked.
Khan noted that he entered an agreement with the government six months ago, under which Islamabad would send an aid flotilla to the Gaza Strip. The agreement was reached after a Palestinian solidarity sit-in ended with force at the hands of the authorities.
“[Interior minister] Mohsin Naqvi said this on record,” Khan recalled. “One of the conditions of ending my sit-in was sending the flotilla.
“I said that if funding is difficult, then I will pay for it out of my own pocket. I will sail on it with my family. But give me state ownership. The government did not fulfil even one part of the agreement.”
When asked, the ex-senator said that he is paying to board the ship and perform the journey.
“People travelling on the Global Sumud Flotilla have to pay beforehand, including travel expenses and the cost of the boat,” he stated. “I am paying for my work here.
“We made a payment for the aid supplies, but those are provided by the GSF central body.”
Reiterating the three possible outcomes mentioned earlier, the former senator who is acting as a coordinator aboard the flotilla said that he and his delegation are prepared, come what may.

Looking at the reaction from the US and EU it would be safe to say that the messages hit bull’s eye.
But let’s first look closer to home. Before the summit, India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said India would be looking for a categorical condemnation of cross-border terrorism, which in common language means that India’s allegations against Pakistan are upheld.
 
 

You may recall in this column last week, there was a mention of the SCO principle of collective or indivisible security and once again that was upheld as both the Pahalgam terror incident and the Jaffar Express and the Khuzdar school bus terror attacks, in which many innocent lives were lost — with India blaming Pakistan for the first and Pakistan saying India was responsible for the second and third incidents — were condemned but neither country was named.
Despite lack of success on this issue, as in the SCO foreign ministers meeting in June, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was triumphantly holding hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin and laughing in videos captured of their stand-up chats with China’s strongman Xi Jinping.

China may still not be militarily as strong as the US but it seems to be catching up fast.

Knowledgeable sources suggested Mr Modi was keen to thumb his nose at the US and its ‘unreliable’ leader and his erstwhile friend President Donald J. Trump whom he has courted in the past, even raising the slogan, ahead of the US elections: Abki baar, Trump Sarkar (The next administration will be Trump’s).
India is smarting at the ‘unfair’ 25+25 per cent tariffs with the latter being punitive for continued purchases of Russian oil when China and many other countries have not been penalised for their bulk oil/ energy procurement from Russia. But the size of the rapidly growing Indian economy, its human capital and enormous market means that despite its current tribulations, India won’t be ignored by either the US and its allies or the Global South for long. That is a certainty.
 
 

Moving out of the region into the global arena, it was clear that the summit and the parade signalled what China sees as a return to a multipolar world and not the unipolar arrangement that evolved after the collapse of the Soviet Union and facilitated the massive eastward expansion of the Nato military alliance.
The Russian military assault and the war it triggered in Ukraine are attributed to that unipolar world, which meant initially that Moscow lacked the ability to stop the Western military alliance’s eastwards march. Later, however, after internal consolidation Russia started to flex its muscles first in Crimea and then in the Donbas region and made rapid advances in eastern Ukraine to pre-empt Nato’s further expansion.
President Joe Biden pumped billions of dollars into the ideological military campaign directly and via the Nato members and slowed the pace of the Russian advance. With Trump’s assumption of office, all that changed as the new US president announced he wanted to end the war and that his friend Vladimir Putin was on board. So far it appears he got played by the Russian leader.
It was not surprising then that looking at the SCO summit and the grand spectacle put on display by the People’s Liberation Army in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the Chinese victory over the Japanese military, Trump wrote a congratulatory message on his Truth Social platform and then said words that could be likened to a child throwing his toys out of the pram: “Give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.”
 
 

China’s response was measured as its spokesperson underlined the fact that the commemoration was to mark the end to World War II and that foreign guests had been invited for it. China said its development of diplomatic relations with any country is never directed against a third party.
Trump’s political appointee as ambassador to Nato Matthew Whitaker seemed to have lost it in an interview with Fox News when, in a fit of rage, he accused China of putting on display lethal weaponry “in all likelihood stolen from us”.
EU foreign policy chief, the former right-wing Estonian politician, Kaja Kallas also criticised the parade and said that Xi, Putin and Kim appearing together was part of efforts to build an anti-Western “new world order” and was a direct challenge to the international rules-based system.
China described the remarks by a “certain EU official” as being full of ideological bias, lacking basic historical knowledge and a blatant attempt to stir up confrontation. Beijing found the remarks misguided, utterly irresponsible and arrogant.
It was laughable that the hawkish EU foreign policy chief referred to the rules-based international system when she and her grouping has supported the Gaza genocide and the shredding of any so-called rules-based order by the apartheid state on a daily basis by the mass murder of civilians by bombs, missiles, drones and starvation.
To many an impartial observer, China’s awesome military display translated into the introduction of a semblance of welcome balance in our unipolar world. China may still not be militarily as strong as the US but it seems to be catching up fast as its various arms and armaments including new hypersonic missiles, stealth fighter-bombers, lasers and microwave air defence and unmanned aerial and submarine military vehicles displayed.
 
 

One hopes this doesn’t unhinge Trump completely. He should realise that his desire of winning the Nobel Peace Prize was nearly non-existent, because he greenlit and enabled the Gaza genocide, a grave crime against humanity. Equally, no end to the Ukraine war on terms unfavourable to Russia is now likely. Trump’s threatened tariffs and sanctions can cause pain but not in any decisive way.
It will be interesting to watch the White House’s next move.

The Defence Day is observed every year on September 6 to commemorate the legacy of the 1965 War, “when the Indian forces crossed international border in the darkness of night to attack Pakistan but the nation foiled [the] nefarious designs of the enemy,” a report by the state broadcaster Radio Pakistan recalled.
The report said commemoration began with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and 21-gun salute in provincial capitals.
“Special prayers were offered in mosques for the progress and prosperity of the country, and independence of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir from the clutches of India,” it added.
‘Courage of fearless heroes continues to inspire future generations’
A statement issued by the military’s media affairs wing in relevance to the day said that on behalf of the armed forces, Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu paid tributes and “offered their deepest respect to the valiant martyrs and their families on the 60th Defence and Martyrs’ Day”.
“September 6, 1965, epitomises the unflinching resolve and unshakeable spirit of the Pakistani nation. On this historic day, our brave soldiers, with the support of nation, stood like an insurmountable wall against blatant aggression, thwarting the nefarious designs of an enemy far superior in arms and numbers.
“The feats of heroic valour and sacrifice left an indelible message on the sands of time, that a united nation can never be defeated,” it added.
The statement further stated that the “courage of our fearless heroes continues to inspire future generations and their legacy shall live on forever”.
“Today, the nation honours and salutes its martyrs, its ghazis and their resilient families who have offered unparalleled sacrifices for the security of this great country,” it said.
Recalling that the armed forces had stood resolutely  against external aggression and terrorism and “have always supported the people of Pakistan in calamities and natural disasters”, it expressed their resolve to extend all-out support to people affected by the recent floods.
Referring to the calamity, it said the Defence Day would be observed with “utmost humility”.
The statement further read: “Today, we reaffirm our pledge to uphold the sacred responsibility  entrusted to us by the nation. Pakistan’s armed forces remain ever vigilant and prepared to defend the country against all kinds of threats. Any attempt to disrupt our hard-earned peace will be met with a befitting and decisive response.”
Messages by PM Shehbaz, President Zardari
In separate messages ahead of Sept 6, the PM Shehbaz and President Zardari reaffirmed the nation’s commitment to safeguarding its sovereignty, countering external threats, and building a united, prosperous future.
They also recalled the 1965 War with India, noting that Pakistan’s valiant armed forces, with the full support of the people, had thwarted enemy aggression, proving that the country possesses the will and capacity to defend its independence and integrity.
Highlighting the recent Oper­ation Bunyanum Marsoos, Marka-i-Haq, PM Shehbaz lauded the Pakistan Army, Navy, and Air Force for their unmatched professionalism and combat skills under the strategic leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to peace and constructive international engagement but war­ned against ignoring the reality of continuous Indian provocations and shifting regional dynamics.
Expressing solidarity with the oppressed people of occupied Kashmir, the prime minister reiterated unwavering support for their struggle for self-determination, stressing that it cannot be suppressed by force.
He also strongly condemned ongoing Israeli aggression in Palestine and urged the international community to ensure the protection of civilians and uninterrupted humanitarian aid to Gaza.
Meanwhile, President Zardari, in his message, paid tribute to the valiant sacrifices of the nation’s armed forces and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to its defence and sovereignty.
He described September 6 as a glorious chapter in the country’s history and emphasised that the spirit of sacrifice from the 1965 War continued to serve as a guiding light for future generations.
The president highlighted the significance of this year’s Defence Day in light of the recent Operation Bunyanum Marsoos conducted in May 2025 against India.
“Just as our courageous forces demonstrated extraordinary valor and dedication in 1965, our sons once again proved their unmatched bravery during this year’s operation,” he said.</p><small>2025-09-06 06:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/061027337d2c592.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940140/alcaraz-downs-djokovic-to-set-up-blockbuster-us-open-final-with-sinner' target='_blank'><strong>Alcaraz downs Djokovic to set up blockbuster US Open final with Sinner</strong></a><br><p>Carlos Alcaraz overpowered Novak Djokovic in straight sets on Friday to set up a blockbuster US Open final showdown against world number one and defending champion Jannik Sinner.
Spanish second seed Alcaraz produced a ruthlessly efficient display to end Djokovic’s latest bid for a record 25th Grand Slam title, winning 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in two hours and 23 minutes.
Alcaraz was then followed into the final by arch-rival Sinner, who was forced to work hard by Canadian 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime before wrapping up a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court.
It means that Alcaraz and Sinner will collide in a third consecutive Grand Slam final this year on Sunday, where United States President Donald Trump will be among a 23,000 crowd to watch the latest instalment of the gripping “Sincaraz” rivalry.
Alcaraz won the duo’s first meeting in an epic five-hour 29-minute tussle at the French Open in June before Sinner dethroned the Spaniard in the final at Wimbledon the following month.
Alcaraz’s victory over Djokovic suggested though that he is more than capable of ambushing Sinner in a match where the winner will be assured of the world number one ranking on Monday.

‘Beating Novak is special’
The 22-year-old five-time Grand Slam winner has not dropped a set en route to the final but still believes he has room for improvement.
“Beating Novak is always special. But I don’t feel like I’ve won anything more than a Grand Slam semi-final,” Alcaraz said after downing the 38-year-old Djokovic.
“It was an important match, but it was just a ticket to the final.”
Djokovic said he plans to chase more Grand Slams next year, but admitted he was no longer physically capable of matching Alcaraz and Sinner.
“I’m happy with my level of tennis, but you know, it’s just the physicality of it,” Djokovic said after his exit. “That’s something I, unfortunately at this point in time in my career, can’t control.”
 


Sinner meanwhile appeared to be readying another quickfire win as he sprinted through the opening set of his clash with the rangy Auger-Aliassime.
But the Canadian leveled by taking the second set only for Sinner to respond to claim the next two and a return to the final.
‘An amazing season’
Sinner, who also won the Australian Open in January, is now only the fourth man in history to reach the finals of all four Grand Slams in a single season, joining an exclusive club whose other members are Rod Laver, Roger Federer and Djokovic.
“It’s been an amazing season. The Grand Slams are the most important tournaments we have throughout the year,” Sinner said.
The Italian’s date with Alcaraz is also a rematch of their famous 2022 US Open quarter-final five-setter, which finished at around 2:50am and remains the latest finish in tournament history.
“Sunday is a very special day and an amazing final again. I feel like our rivalry started here playing an amazing match,” Sinner said in a nod to their 2022 classic.
“We are two different players now, with different confidence too. Let’s see what’s coming. We’ve played each other a lot, we know each other very well.”

Sunday’s final meanwhile will have a rare visit from a sitting US President after confirmation earlier on Friday that Trump plans to attend the tennis showpiece.
Trump’s visit, confirmed to AFP by a White House official, is the latest appearance by the US leader at a major sporting event following trips to the Super Bowl in February and the FIFA Club World Cup final in July.
“For me, playing in front of him… I will try not to think about it,” Alcaraz said of Trump’s presence. “I don’t want myself to be nervous because of it, but I think, attending the tennis match, it’s great for tennis to have the president (at) the final.”
Today, the women’s singles final will be decided when defending champion and world number Aryna Sabalenka faces American eighth seed Amanda Anisimova.
In the women’s doubles final on Friday, Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe won their second US Open women’s doubles title in three years after beating Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova 6-4, 6-4.</p><small>2025-09-06 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06083652eded60d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940103/hybrid-failures' target='_blank'><strong>Hybrid failures</strong></a><br><p>IT is difficult to disagree with the remarks of the Supreme Court’s Justice Athar Minallah, who on Thursday indicated that the hybrid system in Pakistan — where unelected powers are actively involved in civilian affairs — is a euphemism for dictatorship.
The veteran judge, while speaking in Karachi, also dwelt on the role the senior judiciary has played in the country’s history by endorsing the unconstitutional moves of strongmen.
Putting it bluntly, he said that the “77-year judicial history is not a matter of pride for me”, while giving examples of the Maulvi Tamizuddin case, as well as of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s trial and Gen Musharraf’s assaults on the constitutional order, to prove how at crucial times their lordships have sided with authoritarian rulers to subvert the rule of law. Mr Minallah also praised the bravery of judges who refused to bow before dictators.
 
 

Pakistan’s damaging experiments with different forms of hybridity, from earlier decades to the present day, have only weakened institutions, particularly parliament and the judiciary. And rarely have proponents of the hybrid system been held to account for their failures; the actual powers wash their hands of mistakes, while their civilian partners face the music. In contrast, in fully functioning democratic systems, elected leaders are held accountable before the voter.
Considering the judiciary’s role, as highlighted by Justice Minallah, in supporting unconstitutional moves — and these grim episodes are well-documented in our history — ‘willing’ collaborators on the bench have worked with usurpers to subvert the constitutional system, often guided by the ‘doctrine of necessity’. Sadly, in the current scenario too, many of their lordships have been perceived as coming to the aid of the real powers to give their legal blessings to doubtful laws and amendments.
 
 

The solution, as Justice Minallah suggested, is deceptively simple on paper, but difficult to put into practice: abiding by the Constitution, with all institutions staying within the bounds prescribed for them by the basic law. In this regard, when the country faces rampant insecurity, it is essential that the military sticks to its core duty of defending Pakistan. We face two major militant insurgencies — in KP and Balochistan — while a hostile neighbour to the east, and an unreliable regime in Kabul, mean we must constantly remain vigilant.
In such a situation, if the security apparatus indulges in political management, the focus on defence can become diluted. Whether it is direct military rule or a ‘hybrid’ system, both have left lasting scars on the constitutional system. Hence, there is a need to move away from the hybrid model in the interest of democracy, and in the interests of both the civilian and military leaderships.

Opening the session, Ume Laila Azhar, who is NCSW chairperson, stressed the urgent need to standardise the minimum age of marriage across Pakistan, highlighting persistent gaps in the implementation despite Sindh pioneering law.
 
 

Key insights were shared by government representatives, law enforcement, civil society and community stakeholders emphasising on more female station house officer (SHOs) and specialised training for handling child marriage cases.
Reforms in nikah registration through digitisation and mandatory CNIC verification were also emphasised by participants. Among other demands was on strengthening Sindh Child Protection Authority’s role with resources and awareness. Participants also emphasised on government ownership to ensure sustainability and real improvements.
 
 

Shaheena Sher Ali, who is Minister Women’s Development Department Sindh, reaffirmed strong government commitment, stating, “We have been personally taking on cases of child marriage, abuse, and abduction, and we know firsthand challenges survivors face.”
The consultation concluded with a joint call to action on strengthening CMRA implementation, scaling up community awareness, engaging religious leaders, and ensuring coordinated government and civil society efforts. Participants stressed on wearing team jackets to protect the rights of girls and ensure a safer future for every child.

Shabana Mahmood

• Starmer reshuffles portfolios after his embattled deputy Rayner steps down over property tax scandal
• David Lammy named new deputy PM; Yvette Cooper moves to Foreign Office
• Ex-Columbia University president Shafik named PM’s chief economic adviser
LONDON: Faced by crises on multiple fronts, UK PM Keir Starmer overhauled his cabinet on Friday, picking David Lammy to replace his embattled deputy PM, and bringing in Shabana Mahmood to head the Home Office.
Former deputy PM Angela Rayner quit after an investigation found that she had breached the ministerial code, underpaying a property tax in the purchase of a flat in southern England.
Her departure prompted Starmer to carry out the first major cabinet reshuffle of his stuttering 14-month-old premiership.
The shake-up comes after Rayner’s resignation dealt the latest blow to Starmer’s flagging government that has lurc­hed from one storm to another since he became prime minister in July last year.
It has been forced to U-turn on welfare reforms and fuel benefits for the elderly, while its failure to stop undocumented migrants arriving on small boats has bolstered support for Reform, led by anti-immigrant firebrand Nigel Farage.
 
 

Lammy’s post as Britain’s top diplomat will be taken by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who will in turn be succeeded by Ms Mahmood, the BBC reported.
This means that for the first time, all three of the most senior and historically important cabinet positions will be held by women, as Rachel Reeves is the current chancellor of the Exchequer.
Others leaving key posts include leader of the House of Commons Lucy Powell and Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Murray.
Meanwhile, economist Nemat Talaat Shafik has been named Starmer’s new chief economic adviser.
Baroness Shafik was previously the president of Columbia University, and was pushed out following fallout from the 2024 Gaza protests. She has also served as a deputy governor at the Bank of England.
 

Angela Rayner

Rayner’s troubles
Rayner’s resignation followed her self-referral to the independent adviser on ministerial standards.
She disclosed on Wednesday that she had underpaid stamp duty — a property tax — on an apartment following days of reports suggesting that she had saved thousands of pounds by removing her name from the deeds of another property.
After reviewing her case, Laurie Magnus wrote to the PM, saying that in his opinion, she had breached the ministerial code.
 
 

He pointed out that while the tax rules Rayner was dealing with are “complex”, the fact that she didn’t seek expert advice means that she did not meet the “highest possible standards of proper conduct”, as required by the Ministerial Code.
In her resignation, Rayner took full responsibility for the error. In response, Starmer said she had done the right thing.
Rayner had been tipped as a potential future Labour leader and has been a top target for political attacks by the opposition Conservatives and right-wing media.
Despite the circumstances of her exit, Starmer told her: “You will remain a major figure in our party”.
Shabana’s rise
Shabana Mahmood, the 44-year-old Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood, has had a rapid rise. She becomes the second Home Secretary of Pakistani-origin, with Tory minister Sajid Javid being the first in 2018.

Born in Birmingham to parents with roots in Mirpur in Azad Kashmir, Mahmood often links her political outlook to her family’s migration story and the values she absorbed growing up around a corner shop in inner-city Birmingham.
In a New Statesman interview, she linked her parents’ politics to the party “that made them feel they had a stake in British society“, adding that her family “found opportunities in this country that would not have been available to us in the village that we hail from in Kashmir and then Pakistan.”
During her childhood she also lived for a period with her family in Taif, Saudi Arabia. She went on to study at the University of Oxford and graduated with a BA in Law, later working as a barrister.
Mahmood also became one of the UK’s first Muslim parliamentarians when she was elected in 2010 alongside other MPs.
She has spoken directly about representing Britain’s Pakistani communities.
“I…take pride in representing one of the biggest ethnic minority groups in the UK,” she told the British Pakistan Foundation in an interview, arguing that the government should work at the community levels.
She also rejected claims that Pakistanis do not hold British values, saying: “They respect the rule of law, they want to live in a democracy.”

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari meets flood-hit farmers in Kasur.—Dawn

• Seeks loan, electricity bill waivers for flood-hit farmers
• Says PM has assured him of help for affected people
• Accuses India of violating Indus treaty by withholding flood data
KASUR: As floods continue to batter Punjab and severely impact farmers, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday urged both the federal and provincial governments to declare an agricultural emergency in the province.
The PPP leader visited the flood-hit Talwar Post in Kasur, on the border with India, met affected families and later spoke to the media.
According to statement, Mr Bhutto-Zardari also telephoned Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and briefed him on the problems being faced by farmers across Punjab.
He told the premier that the floods had caused severe damage to the agriculture sector and said the Centre must play its role in helping farmers.
According to a readout of the call issued by the PPP, PM Shehbaz assured Mr Bhutto-Zardari that the government would take all possible steps to help the disaster-stricken farmers of Punjab.
 


The PPP leader also demanded that electricity bills of farmers in disaster-hit  districts be waived, while the repayment of agricultural loans should  either be delayed or written off.
He also proposed cash transfers  to the affected farmers through the Benazir Income Support Programme  (BISP), as was done in the wake of previous floods.
In the aftermath of the catastrophic floods in 2010 and 2011, the government  had partnered with international donors to roll out cash grant  programmes through the Watan Card and Pakistan Card schemes.
Their  success was eventually replicated with the BISP programme, which has  since won international acclaim for its effectiveness in augmenting  poverty alleviation efforts.
In Kasur, the PPP chairman heard the grievances of farmers and stressed that the federal and provincial governments should work together to provide relief to the affected people.
The PPP will stand with the provincial government during the relief  and reconstruction phases, he said, adding that no single government  can cope with a calamity of this scale. Speaking at Talwar Post, Mr Bhutto-Zardari accused India of violating the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and withholding flood-related information from Pakistan.
He said that in doing so, India had forgotten basic humanity.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari praised Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for making efforts to provide relief to people displaced by the floods, and stressed the need to stand shoulder to shoulder with farmers.
 
 

The PPP chairman also directed his party workers to take an active part in relief activities and assured the affected families that his party would not abandon them.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari was received by senior PPP leader Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmed during his visit to Kasur. The PPP chairman was accompanied by Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider, former National Assembly speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Hasan Murtaza, Nadeem Afzal Chan and Qamar Zaman Kaira.

Examples include professors demanding sexual favours for better grades, male students creating fake, explicit AI images of female students, and administrators or low-level employees using hidden cameras for blackmail. Social media magnifies all this by a thousand, maybe a million. My internet search shows that some salacious on-sale videos can be viewed for only Rs100. Each scandal inevitably triggers public outrage that peaks and then fades.
Rightly speaking, university administrators should swiftly investigate and appropriately punish teachers or students. Unfortunately, this is rare. However, officials cannot always be held responsible because female students are usually too afraid to testify, fearing damage to their reputations even if they had been trapped and were guiltless. In a heavily patriarchal society with skewed power relationships, what can they do?
 
 

Media lynching — such as the recent sting operation at Bahawalpur University — is therefore seen as an alternative. Carried out by a popular TV channel, its viewership must have skyrocketed. The university’s authorities had, as expected, waffled. But is justice truly served by cameras chasing some bad-guy professor? One can be doubtful.
True injustice occurs, however, when these instances are weaponised by reactionary voices. They rush to seize a megaphone, multiply fears, ignite lurid sexual fantasies and declare the coed university as a den of sin and temptation disallowed by religious and cultural mores. See, they say, let the sexes intermingle and bay-hayaee (immorality) is what you get.

Reports of sexual misconduct are weaponised to enforce segregation and oppose coeducation.

The impact of such propaganda in a conservative society can only be imagined. In the aftermath of even a single incident, we cannot ever know how many hundreds of daughters were disallowed by their fathers or brothers from enrolling at some coed campus or being withdrawn from one.
A frequently proposed solution is to have more women-only universities. This is a dead end. I’ve guest lectured at several and to call them universities is a travesty. Perhaps they could be better described as female safe houses or custodial centres where minds must be sheltered and dulled, not challenged and sharpened.
What about going the Taliban way, and banning female education altogether? Even with the explosive growth of Pakistani conservatism, the near parity of male-female enrolment (100-96) in tertiary education suggests that urbanites do not want this extreme. Universities — whose revenues depend on enrolment — tread cautiously.
As a way out, worried officials aim to reassure fathers and brothers (mothers rarely matter) by increasing segregation through strict moral pol­icing. Official circulars are periodically issued that threaten violators with fines, denial of entry on campus, withholding of semester results, or expulsion. But how do they define morality?
 
 

Official websites do not list as ‘immoral’ crimes like theft, academic cheating, plagiarism or vandalism. Similarly, harassment and violence against different ethnic and religious groups, or disrupting cultural and music festivals, are not classified as immoral. Depending on who’s in charge, some officials disallow such actions while others secretly or openly endorse them.
Immorality, however, revolves around female attire. While none can deny that clothing should be ‘modest’, its meaning varies from city to city and campus to campus. Back in the early 1970s, when I started my university teaching career, the number of female students at Quaid-e-Azam University in burqa were fewer than the fingers on one hand. Today they are the majority, followed by the less restrictive hijab, while those without head cover are outliers.
Morality also comes under threat when a female walks by herself (hence becomes vulnerable), engages in casual conversations with male students, or makes friends across the divide. This is less emphasised at institutions like Lums whose official policy merely forbids PDA (public display of affection) such as the holding of hands. But within that same city is Punjab University (PU), a once-decent relic from British times.
Now better known for hyperactive moral squads than for scholarly accomplishments, PU is the headquarters of the Islami Jamiat-i-Talaba. IJT denounces coeducation and has physically attacked couples found sitting together on the university’s lawn or benches. Some teachers and officials make no secret of their support for such actions.
 
 

Modernity is impacting every country’s values and eliciting different responses. Turkiye, Morocco and Bangladesh have liberal campuses, much more so than ours. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are now outpacing even them. Whether or not de-segregation has full popular support, this is what their autocratic rulers have decided. On the other hand, even under Iran’s strict clerical rule, the cruel death in custody of 22-year-old anti-hijab activist Mahsa Amini led to countrywide protests, suggesting that change is inevitable.
Modernity is also changing Pakistan but far slower than elsewhere. Our conservatives still don’t want wives and daughters to work, but their opposition has diminished now that females in one out of five families have outside jobs. Despite all efforts to minimise contact between genders, full segregation is proving impossible.
The Pakistani diaspora in Britain, now into its third generation, remains backward and stuck in a quandary. Many parents, fearing corruption, resist sending their children to British coed schools. This makes for awkwardness in a society that treasures equality of men and women. Even more seriously, this puts many Pak-Brits at the bottom of the social heap for lack of skills and knowledge. Attitudes towards females, derived from enforcing school segregation, can show up late in life.
Islamophobic forces in Britain have long derived strength from grooming gang sex scandals that, much more than other immigrants, implicate British-Pakistani men. While the far right’s claims are exaggerated to suit its political agenda, Pakistanis familiar with male attitudes towards females in general, and white girls in particular, say: where there’s smoke there’s fire.
Gender-related crimes on campus — or elsewhere for that matter — have no easy solution. Would restricting women to female-only workplaces restore purity and virtuousness? Would banning all contact between males and females eliminate sexual misconduct on our coed campuses?
Very likely, this would — just as banning all cars and motorbikes would eliminate traffic accidents. However, travelling on horses and camels is not a price that many, including conservatives, are willing to pay.

In a letter dated Thursday, seen by Dawn.com, Justice Shah said he was reluctantly writing it in “discharge of an unavoidable institutional duty”, adding that what compelled him was “your (CJP’s) persistent and complete indifference”.
The judge wrote that his “repeated letters and written communications to you (CJP) on the undermentioned issues have gone unanswered and undiscussed; not once have I received a reply-neither in writing nor verbally”, adding that such silence from the chief justice to the senior puisne judge was “not merely discourteous; it undermines the collegial traditions of this court and violates the institutional courtesy without which a constitutional court cannot function”.
Justice Shah said that with the new judicial year commencing from Monday, CJP Afridi had convened a judicial conference to review the reforms undertaken under his leadership and to lay down priority areas for the coming year.
“It is therefore both timely and opportune that the institutional concerns I raise in this letter be addressed squarely by you in that forum. By doing so, you will not only respond to the questions that remain unanswered but also reassure the judges of this court, the bar and the public we serve that your vision of reform is grounded in collegiality, transparency, and fidelity to the Constitution.”
The questions the judge asked the CJP to answer were:

Why has the Practice and Procedure Act Committee never been convened
to carry out its statutory responsibilities?
Why was the revision of the Supreme Court Rules 1980 approved by circulation rather than after discussion and deliberation in a Full Court meeting?
Why was the policy on releasing dissenting opinions adopted by soliciting individual opinions of the judges — saying it was a process “unheard of” — rather than an open deliberation in a Full Court meeting?
Why was a General Standing Order (GSO) on leave issued that subjects judges to controls inconsistent with judicial independence and the Presidential Order of 1997?
Why have the petitions challenging the 26th Amendment not been fixed before the original Full Court?
If CJP Afridi was nurturing independence among judges or “enforcing compliance to turn this court into a regimented force rather than a constitutional court of free and equal judges?”

Justice Shah said the letter must not be construed as a “personal grievance”.
“The concerns I now raise do not come from indolence or neglect, but from a judge who has consistently and conscientiously performed his duty. They are, therefore, institutional concerns borne of experience and responsibility rather than personal complaint,” he explained.
Justice Shah said that he trusted CJP Afridi to use the judicial conference as a “moment of institutional renewal by answering these questions and reaffirming the principles of collegiality and constitutional fidelity”.
Justice Shah said the questions were those that struck at the “heart of independence” and not only the apex court judges, but also the nation, were looking towards CJP Afridi “not for silence but for clarity”.
Concerns about PaPA Committee
Elaborating on his questions, Justice Shah said the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, was enacted by the apex court to put an end to the “one-man show” in the formation of benches.
He pointed out that it required that all causes, matters, petitions, appeals or reviews be placed before benches constituted by a committee under the act, adding that its purpose was “clear”: to review pending cases, devise a transparent case-management plan, categorise cases intelligently and allocate them to benches through collective deliberation.
“Yet, since your assumption of office in October 2024, not a single official meeting of the PaPA Committee has been convened. Bench formation and cause lists are being issued unilaterally, without any committee deliberation. Rosters are circulated for signatures, expecting members to endorse them blindly without discussion of case allocation or categorisation. As a senior member of the committee, I have had no opportunity to participate in its work as mandated by law.
“This is a direct violation of the act and raises serious concerns. Why are junior judges regularly assigned to three-member benches while senior judges are confined to two-member benches? Why are matters of national importance with far-reaching policy implications not fixed before senior benches? The pattern suggests that independent judges are being sidelined, not for reasons of efficiency, but for reasons of control.”
Justice Shah said that minutes of five “committee meetings” displayed on the court’s website could not “cure this defect”, arguing that “they were not committee meetings within the meaning of the act but mere discussions about the chief justice’s travel schedule. Even then, their minutes were uploaded in violation of a binding majority decision of the committee. I had recorded my dissent on that occasion, arguing for transparency, but it was disregarded. This is symptomatic of a mindset averse to collegiality and inclined towards dictation.”
 
 

The judge rued that “the genie of the ‘one-man show’, which Parliament sought to bury through legislation, has been released once again”, adding that that was the reason why he had ceased signing the rosters circulated without any meeting.
“By sidelining the committee and withholding even basic information (such as the number of cases to be dealt with or those fixed before larger benches), you have reduced a statutory mechanism of collective decision-making into a façade.
“The result is evident: despite the increase in the number of judges, the court’s pendency remains at 57,455 cases. The very purpose of enhancing the court’s strength — reducing backlog — stands defeated. The unavoidable inference is that enlargement of the court was less about addressing pendency and more about altering its internal balance, thereby diluting the independence and standing of existing judges.”
Revision of court rules
Regarding the revision of the apex court’s rules, Justice Shah said they were a constitutional document that governed the institution’s functioning and their first revision in four decades was an event of “historic significance”.
He argued that such a process required a Full Court meeting on the administrative side. “Instead, you chose to approve the draft rules by circulation — a process suited to routine matters, not to reshaping the court’s constitutional framework.
“By avoiding deliberation, you deprived the court of collective wisdom and diminished judicial dialogue. This course reflects a lack of collegiality and a preference for unilateral authority.”
Policy on dissenting opinions
Regarding dissenting opinions, Justice Shah said the court’s recent policy on releasing them with the majority judgment was approved through a unique process of soliciting the views of individual judges by the registrar.
He said there was no “legal or institutional basis for individual opinion-gathering on such critical matters”, unless specifically authorised by the Full Court, and even then, only for matters that were procedural or minor in nature.
Justice Shah said the above exercise could not be treated as a substitute for Full Court deliberation, nor could responses to this letter be used to formulate policy in isolation.
“A matter of jurisprudential weight was reduced to a secretive tick-box exercise and the court was denied the richness of open deliberation.
“A Full Court meeting is not merely a procedural formality — it is the bedrock of judicial collegiality. It allows all judges of this court to come together, to deliberate, to exchange ideas and, through open dialogue, to persuade or be persuaded. In such a forum, a judge may revise or refine their view after hearing their colleagues, or may help develop a collective wisdom that is far more robust than isolated responses. This essential element of judicial democracy is entirely lost when opinions are sought in writing and in silos.”
General Standing Order on leave
Justice Shah said that the GSO dated July 29, 2025, was the “first time” in the court’s history that something had dictated that judges were “whole-time” at the state’s disposal, adding that this was language “wholly alien” to a constitutional court.
“Judges are not regimented officers; their independence is constitutionally entrenched.”
The judge said the GSO had confined foreign leaves to five categories, but this was a restriction not envisaged in Presidential Order No. 2 of 1997.
“In principle, leave can, if at all, only possibly be considered for refusal where: (i) a part-heard case cannot be adjourned; (ii) urgent administrative duty demands presence; or (iii) a judge is negligent in work and seeks leave to evade it. Yet, in practice, leave is being denied even when none of these circumstances exist-apparently to enforce compliance and control, and to prevent independent judges from speaking at international forums. Such arbitrary denials betray a deep institutional insecurity.”
Justice Shah further railed that the newly introduced requirement under the GSO that a judge must disclose his residential address and contact details was “alien” to the practice of constitutional courts worldwide.
“It borrows from the ethos of civil-service bureaucracy and attempts to transplant it into the judiciary, with deeply corrosive consequences. A judge of this court is not a supervised functionary of the state but a constitutional actor whose independence is both decisional and personal. To compel disclosure of a judge’s private residence is not administration — it is surveillance. It reduces the dignity of the office to that of a monitored employee and cloaks an instrument of control in the garb of procedure.
“No constitutional court of repute — the US Supreme Court, the UK Supreme Court, or the Constitutional Court of South Africa — has ever imposed such a condition. You may not realise it, but by imposing it here, you are striking at the very independence of this court. A judiciary under watch ceases to be a judiciary; it becomes an extension of bureaucracy. Kindly note that no apex court of repute across jurisdictions mandates such disclosure, precisely because the ethos of independence demands institutional courtesy, not surveillance.”
The senior puisne judge pointed out that the GSO had been “weaponised to create a judicial ‘exit control list’”.
He noted that leave was no longer a matter of “respect and consultation but of bureaucratic obstruction”, adding that it was an “authoritarian impulse that undermines judicial independence”.
The judge further pointed out that “disturbingly, these rigid policies bear the imprint of the civil bureaucracy. The registrar — a retired civil servant — appears to be driving an agenda alien to the ethos of a constitutional court. Judges are not governed by the logic of command and control but by independence and collegiality. Judges are not mere agents of government; they are guardians of the people’s liberties.”
Supreme Court’s legitimacy
Lastly, Justice Shah said the apex court and CJP Afridi’s legitimacy “hangs in the balance” in the pending petitions challenging the 26th Amendment.
He pointed out that the petitions remained unheard for nearly a year, though they concerned the Supreme Court’s independence.
“They must be heard by the original Full Court, excluding judges elevated after the amendment. Until then, any initiative under your leadership remains institutionally fragile, for its foundation is constitutionally suspect. True leadership lies not in managing compliance but in ensuring that the court rises above suspicion as the fearless guardian of the Constitution,” the senior puisne judge concluded.</p><small>2025-09-06 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06021403f355615.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939991/can-icc-use-indias-own-policy-to-revive-pakistan-india-tests' target='_blank'><strong>Can ICC use India’s own policy to revive Pakistan-India Tests?</strong></a><br><p>DUBAI: Could the Indian government’s own sports policy hold the key to reviving the most watched, most lucrative and most emotionally charged rivalry in Test cricket — Pakistan versus India?
Upon reviewing India’s Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports’ policy on international events, a key clause stands out: “Indian teams and individual players will take part in international events that also have teams or players from Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistani players and teams will be able to participate in such multilateral events hosted by India.”
Another important line states: “About international and multilateral events, in India or abroad, we are guided by the practices of international sports bodies and the interest of our own sportspersons.”
Taken together, the policy is clear: bilateral series remain off-limits, but participation in international and multilateral events is allowed, and India defers to the practices of international sports bodies — in this case, the International Cricket Council (ICC).
This is why the two sides still face each other in ICC World Cups, ICC Champions Trophy, and ACC Asia Cups. So why not in the ICC World Test Championship (WTC)?
Currently, the ICC WTC league stage is organised on a bilateral basis, with each of the nine participants choosing six opponents over the two-year cycle — three at home and three away — subject to agreement between boards. Each board arranges fixtures, hosts matches and retains all revenues. The ICC’s role is limited to providing the points system, playing conditions, rules, branding and appointing match and anti-corruption officials.
While this flexibility gives members freedom to shape their calendars, it also means India can simply omit Pakistan from its selection, keeping the rivalry outside the Championship.
Because the ICC WTC fixtures are scheduled and commercialised bilaterally — even though they sit inside an ICC competition — India can contend these are not “multilateral” under its policy.
Unlike the ICC WTC final, the solution does not require the ICC to take over complete match operations or host revenues. The ICC should formally designate the WTC league stage as an ICC event for governance and compliance purposes — competition regulations, branding and non-negotiable fixture obligations — while leaving match operations and all host-board revenues untouched.
Once that happens, matches would not only be classified as ICC events but India’s sports policy would apply, obliging participation. Also, host boards will continue to stage matches and retain revenues while the the ICC enforces compliance and safeguards the competition.
India’s policy — which explicitly defers to international sports bodies — places the onus on the ICC. If the ICC defines the WTC as a true multilateral event, India would be obliged under its own stated policy to participate, including fixtures against Pakistan. Ownership here is administrative and legal, not operational or financial.
The absence of India-Pakistan Tests has left the ICC WTC lopsided and deprived the format of its most compelling contest. A revival would not only balance the competition but also electrify the Championship for fans; in turn, lifting global viewership and sponsorship. Moreover, it will give players a stage to compete in the traditional format and strengthen the ICC’s credibility and reputation in protecting and promoting Test cricket.
The precedent already exists. The Ashes is protected within every ICC WTC cycle, guaranteeing that Australia and England meet home and away regardless of scheduling pressures. There is no structural reason why the same principle could not apply to India and Pakistan once the WTC is elevated to a fully recognised ICC event.
Some will argue that politics, not policy, has always dictated whether India and Pakistan play. True — but the same policy also states that India will take part in international events that include Pakistan. Once the ICC WTC league is formally designated as an ICC event with non-negotiable fixtures, the default is participation; any deviation would require an explicit policy exception rather than ambiguity.
Series logistics are manageable, even if at present the environment is not conducive for the two to host each other. Neutral venues such as the UAE or England have successfully hosted both nations, and several boards have publicly expressed interest in staging Pakistan-India Tests.
The ICC has already branded, officiated and regulated the WTC. It does not need to organise or run matches — it simply needs to make the league stage a fully recognised ICC event under its authority.
Every ICC leader has left a mark: David Richards started the ICC Champions Trophy (previously known as the ICC Knock-Out); Malcolm Speed launched the T20 World Cup; Haroon Lorgat introduced technology in world cricket; David Richardson standardised technology and planted the ICC WTC seed; and Geoff Allardice put wheels to the ICC WTC and spearheaded cricket’s return to the Olympics.
Sanjog Gupta, the ICC’s new Chief Executive, now has the chance to build his own legacy by ensuring the Pakistan-India Test rivalry is restored under ICC authority, without disrupting host boards’ operations or revenues.
The bottom line remains that India and Pakistan haven’t played a Test since the 2007 three-match series in India. However, if these two powerhouses of cricket can generate millions in revenue by playing in ICC-organised ODIs and T20Is, there is no logical reason to deny them a Test series — the game’s purest format.
The ICC World Test Championship is the perfect stage to finally deliver the ultimate India-Pakistan series. To secure the survival and growth of Test cricket, and protect the integrity of its marquee competition, the ICC must think boldly, own the WTC and act decisively.

According to a detailed report by the Washington-based Institute of Inte­rnational Finance (IIF), “taken together, there is about 4pc of GDP worth of debt stemming from the energy sector. The repercussions reverberate throughout the economy, not only impacting the fiscal but also growth, inflation, the external balance and the financial sector.”
Circular debt has plagued the country since 2006. While successive governments have made periodic payments to ease the pressure — including a recent Rs800bn settlement — the flow of new debt remains unchecked. As of June 2025, the stock of circular debt stood at Rs1.6tr (1.4pc of GDP), compounded by another Rs3tr (2.6pc of GDP) owed by power producers to the oil and gas sector.
 
 

The report said the debt has severe fiscal consequences. To contain high servicing costs, the government created Power Holding Limited (PHL), a special purpose vehicle mandated to inject liquidity into the energy market, hold power sector debt, and reduce financing costs. But by absorbing PHL liabilities into the national books, the government effectively increased public debt and assumed additional risks.

IIF says circular debt exceeds Rs4.6tr, equal to 4pc of GDP, fuelling fiscal risks and stalling reforms

Currently, circular debt accounts for about 2.2pc of total government debt, excluding arrears of state-run generation companies to fuel suppliers. Along with energy subsidies, this has exerted persistent pressure on public finances, forcing the diversion of resources away from social programmes, development spending and infrastructure.
Spillover effects
The IIF stressed that the challenge extends far beyond fiscal management. On the financial side, borrowing through PHL has relied heavily on domestic banks, contributing to the crowding out of private sector credit.
On the growth front, recurring power outages — often imposed in areas with poor recovery rates — disrupt industrial activity, investment and productivity, undermining competitiveness. At the same time, high electricity tariffs feed into headline inflation, while a heavy reliance on imported fuel aggravates external imbalances, particularly during episodes of sharp rupee depreciation.
Policy responses
Recognising the gravity of the problem, the authorities have introduced a series of measures. These include approval of the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM), designed to break the monopoly of distribution companies (Discos) by allowing large consumers to negotiate directly with power producers.
Contracts with independent power producers are being shifted from the “take-or-pay” model — under which payments are made regardless of consumption — to “take-and-pay” arrangements where only consumed energy is paid for. At the same time, electricity tariffs have been raised, subsidies are being better targeted, and steps have been taken to address theft, improve bill recoveries and reduce technical and distribution losses.
A gradual shift towards domestic energy sources such as hydropower and coal is also under way in an effort to cut reliance on expensive imported fuels.
Still unsustainable
Despite these initiatives, the IIF observed that reforms have not delivered meaningful improvements in sectoral performance. The recent fall in circular debt during FY24/25 was largely due to a one-off clearance made possible by commercial loans rather than structural fixes.
“As inefficiencies in distribution companies, T&D losses and poor collection rates persist, large bailouts are not a coherent or sustainable strategy in the long run,” the report warned. It underlined that systematic inefficiencies remain deeply embedded in the energy sector, ensuring that the flow of debt continues.
Reform deficit
The institute pointed out that many of the structural issues behind circular debt are well known but difficult to resolve due to entrenched institutional reluctance and vested interests. The problem, it said, has become the “clearest example of why Pakistan’s reforms continue to fall short and why fiscal risks remain entrenched.”
“Until this hurdle is overcome, circular debt will continue to weigh heavily on the economy, eroding fiscal space, constraining growth and fuelling instability,” it concluded.

Following the boycott, the main opposition party held a ‘people’s assembly’ outside the Parliament House and urged the judiciary to take up PTI’s appeals against the passage of 26th Constitutional Amendment. They termed the ame­ndment “a tool to suppress and und­ermine the judiciary”.
“The people’s assembly backs shu­tter-down strike call of BNP chief Akhtar Mengal and PkMAP Pre­s­ident Mehmood Achakzai to be obs­erved on Sept 8 in Balochsitan,” said a resolution passed by the gathering.
The resolution, presented by PTI Chairman Barrister Ali Gohar, rej­ected what it called “hybrid regime” and demanded lifting of curbs imp­osed on judiciary so that it could hear appeals filed against 26th Con­stitutional Amendment.
 
 

It also demanded suspension of Afghan refugees’ repatriation process in view of prevailing instability in neighbouring Afghanistan. The resolution further endorsed the recent speech of Supreme Court judge Justice Athar Minallah.
Former NA speaker Asad Qaisar said no people-friendly legislation was being carried out in the parliament.

A situation report of the UNHCR released on Friday said that in August alone, returns increased by 254 per cent, while deportations rose by 191pc as compared to July, coinciding with the start of the third phase of the ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’ (IFPR).
The report says 531,700 Afghans have returned from Pakistan,as of September 4.
 
 

Since April, more than 483,700 Afghans have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan, including 145,200 in August alone, with some 55,000 making the journey in just the final four days of the month.
The proportion of Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders among returnees has steadily increased, rising from 6 per cent in April to 21–23 per cent between May and July.

UNHCR report reveals that as of Sept 4, around half a million refugees have returned

In August, this share grew sharply, with PoR cardholders accounting for 54pc (77,700 individuals) of all returns recorded to date, the UNHCR data shows.
Some 57,300 individuals have been arrested and detained since April, including PoR card holders. In August alone, some 9,000 arrests were recorded, compared to some 3,400 in July. The top three districts for arrest and detention are Chaghi (Balochistan), Islamabad and Pis­hin (Balochistan).
 
 

In Afghanistan, the UNHCR continued to biometrically process and provide cash assistance to PoR card holders and their nuclear family members, UNHCR slip holders, asylum seeker certificate holders and other protection referrals.
This support aimed at alleviating the difficulties faced by Afghans who have returned home hastily, and often largely unprepared due to the circumstances in Pakistan, the report says.

• High alert along Sutlej as official warns of more flows from India
• PDMA estimates over 3m people displaced; minister announces Rs2m compensation for families of the slain
• PM orders climate change ministry to start preparing for next monsoon
LAHORE: Although a major surge, exceeding 600,000 cusecs in the River Chenab, has crossed Multan and Muzaffargarh without incident, the threat from surging waters has not yet subsided, as more rains are expected to disrupt rescue and rehabilitation work, and bring more water to Punjab’s already swollen rivers.
A major wave crossed the Head Muhammadwala and Sher Shah Bridges and is now advancing towards Panjnad Headworks, where it is expected to peak at 600,000 cusecs by tonight (Saturday), a senior irrigation department official told Dawn.
The episode reveals the complex interplay of Punjab’s river systems. In the River Ravi, water levels at Sidhnai Headworks only began receding after the flood pressure in the Chenab subsided near their convergence point at Abdul Hakeem.
For a tense 36 hours, Sidhnai faced one of its most severe tests as the extremely high flood in the Chenab created a virtual wall of water, blocking the Ravi’s flow and causing it to flow backward, dramatically increasing pressure on the headworks.
 
 

To avert a disaster, the government was forced to carry out a strategic breach at the Mai Safura embankment three days ago to relieve this pressure.
The river flow report released by PDMA Punjab shows that while overall water levels are high, but flows have generally stabilised.
Multan Deputy Commissioner Wasim Hamid Sindhu said that the intensity of floodwaters in the Chenab was decreasing.
He said that water levels reaching Head Muhammad Wala Bridge, Basti Jhagunwala, Akbar embankment, Sikanderi Nallah and Sher Shah were decreasing and the reading on the emergency gate at Akbar embankment had falled from 414 to 413.5.
He said that the water level in the Chenab was expected to decrease over the next 12 hours, adding that Head Muhammad Wala or the Sher Shah embankment would not be bre­ached.
Threat from impending rain
Addressing a press conference in Gujranwala, Provincial Disaster Man­agement Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that another incoming rain spell was expected to disrupt ongoing rescue operations across flood-affected regions. He said that after yet another high-flood warning from India at the Harike location, the government had placed all districts along the Sutlej River on high alert.
DG Kathia warned that fresh rainfall would create additional difficulties for those already affected by the floods.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has already warned officials in Punjab, Sindh and Islamabad to remain alert for a spell forecast from Sept 7-9. According to the NDMA, a low-pressure system is currently located over Madhya Pradesh (India) and likely to move west-northwest, may reach Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Sindh today. Under the influence of this weather system, Punjab, Sindh and Islamabad may face heavy to very heavy rains.
Damages
Speaking at the tail-end of the National Assembly sitting on Friday, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said that so far, 2.1 million people had been displaced by the floods.
He termed it a massive disaster that was not easy to cope with, adding that meteorological predictions had been correct with a 92pc accuracy rate.
He revealed that the families of those who lost their lives due to the floods would be given Rs2m in compensation, adding that Rs680m had been paid to families of those killed and injured so far.
 


Separately, PDMA Punjab issued a report on damages caused by flooding in Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab rivers, which stated that over 3,900 villages had been affected. The report put the figure of those affected by the floods at 3.89m.
Around 1.84m people trapped in floodwaters have been relocated to safety, while 1.34m animals had been relocated.
According to Punjab Relief Com­missioner Nabil Javaid, the reservoirs at Mangla and Tarbela are at 87pc and 100pc capacity, respectively. Meanwhile, India’s Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River is at 84pc, the Pong Dam is at 98pc, while the Thein Dam is 92pc full.
PM orders prep for next monsoon
Separately, chairing a high-level review meeting to assess the damage, as well as the ongoing rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts underway across the country, PM Shehbaz Sharif ordered the Ministry of Climate Change to begin immediate preparations for the 2026 monsoon season and present a comprehensive climate resilience action plan within two weeks.
 






The plan, he said, must address Pakistans growing vulnerability to climate change. The PM stressed the need for real-time monitoring of evacuation and relief operations to ensure that timely assistance reaches those in need. He instructed the establishment of a special committee to facilitate financial assistance for flood victims who are not currently registered with Nadra.
The meeting was informed that compensation for deceased persons, the injured, and property damages was being processed through Nadra, with priority being given to those most affected.

The prime minister made this pledge during a meeting with Adviser to the President of Palestine on Religious Affairs and Chief Justice of the Shariat Court, Mahmoud Siddiqui Alhabash, who is leading a Palestinian delegation attending the Seerat Conference here, alongside the Imam of Al Aqsa Mosque and the Palestinian Ambassador.
“During the meeting, the prime minister conveyed his warm regards to Dr Mahmoud Abbass, President of Palestine. He reaffirmed the unwavering support of the people of Pakistan to the Palestinian cause and assured the Palestinian side that Pakistan would continue to lend its full support for the brotherly people of Palestine, who have rendered enormous sacrifices and bravely faced Israeli brutal aggression,” a statement from the PM Office said.
 






“The prime minister further assured that he would continue to raise his voice with full force for the rights of the Palestinian people at every diplomatic forum,” the press release said.
On the humanitarian situation in Gaza, the prime minister reassured the Palestinian delegation that Pakistan would continue to dispatch humanitarian assistance for the people of Gaza, who have been subjected to a man-made famine by Israeli occupation forces.
The adviser to the Palestinian president conveyed the deepest gratitude of the Palestinian people to the people and government of Pakistan for their consistent and unflinching support.
Recalling the longstanding and historic bonds between the people of Pakistan and Palestine, they said that Pakistan was a source of strength for them in this difficult time. The Palestinian side also offered their condolences over the recent floods in Pakistan.
At the end of the meeting, a letter from President Mahmoud Abbas was also handed over to the prime minister.

• WHO chief urges Tel Aviv to stop starving people to death
GAZA CITY : The Israeli military intensified its bombardment in Gaza City on Friday, demolishing a high-rise building it claimed was used by Hamas, as part of a its campaign to take over control of the area.
In a statement, the military said it had “identified significant Hamas terrorist activity within a wide variety of infrastructure sites in Gaza City, and particularly in high-rise buildings,” adding it would target those sites “in the coming days”.
Less than an hour later, it announced it had struck one such building, accusing Hamas of using it “to advance and execute attacks against troops in the area.”
 


19 killed in Gaza
Israeli strikes killed at least 19 people in and around Gaza City, an area the Israeli military is planning to conquer.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said that attacks targeted buildings and tents sheltering displaced Gazans in various neighbourhoods and city outskirts.
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed to intensify operations, with Israeli military spokesman Nadav Shoshani saying on Thursday that the start of the campaign to seize Gaza City will not be announced in advance to “maintain the element of surprise”.
Hamas video release
Also on Friday, Hamas released a video of two Israeli prisoners, with one captive saying he was being held in Gaza City. The edited video featured an exhausted-looking Guy Gilboa-Dalal, 24, who said he feared being killed by Israel’s offensive.
Gilboa-Dalal and Alon Ohel, who is also seen briefly in the video, is among 48 people still held by Hamas in Gaza, with 20 of them thought to be alive.
 


US sanctions
On the diplomatic front, the United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on three leading Palestinian human rights organisations.
The US State Department designated Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, stating they “have directly engaged in efforts by the International Criminal Court to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals, without Israel’s consent”.
The decision drew swift condemnation. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk called the move “completely unacceptable,” saying the sanctions would have a “chilling effect”.
WHO appeal
The World Health Organisation (WHO) chief on Friday urged Israel to stop the “catastrophe” of people starving to death in Gaza, saying at least 370 people have died from malnutrition since the war began.
 






“This is a catastrophe that Israel could have prevented, and could stop at any time,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebr­eyesus told reporters. “Starvation of civilians as a method of war is a war crime that can never be tolerated.”
Israel has denied famine, insisting the territory was suffering from a “man-made shortage engineered by Hamas”.

The house also passed a resolution “condemning in the strongest words” the recent suicide bombing at the public meeting of the BNP-Mengal in Quetta and “demanding of the provincial government to bring the perpetrators to justice.”
The resolution, read out by Pullain Baloch of the National Party (NP), said that 15 people died and more than 75 people were injured in the incident.
The blast took place near Shahwani Stadium in Quetta’s Sariab area on Tuesday night, shortly after the conclusion of the public meeting of the BNP-M held to mark the death anniversary of late Sardar Attaullah Mengal.

Lawmakers slam govt’s handling of situation in the province; cite ongoing ‘military ops’, failure to address missing persons’ issue

BNP President and MNA Akhtar Mengal, who presided over the gathering, remained unhurt as the blast occurred when he was leaving for home. PkMAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Asghar Khan Achakzai of the ANP, and former senator Mir Kabeer Muhammad Shai of the National Party were also present, but escaped unhurt.
 
 

Speaking in the NA, Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri of the JUI-F said that since he was a child, he had been witnessing “military operations” in the province. He alleged that the government was not ready to pay heed to the genuine grievances of the people of Balochistan, and was unable to satisfy the family members of the missing persons.
“Instead of stopping the [military] operations, lawlessness and cruelty, the rulers are unfortunately sprinkling salt on the wounds of the people,” said Mr Haideri while referring to a reported statement of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in which he had stated that the Balochistan issue could be handled even by a police official of the rank of station house officer (SHO).
 


The JUI-F leader cited a number of recent terror attacks in the province, including the one on his own convoy, claiming that over 1,000 people and security personnel had so far lost their lives in these incidents. He asked the government to convene an all parties’ conference on the Balochistan issue.
The JUI-F lawmaker regretted that some 40 relatives, mostly woman and children, had been staging a protest sit-in outside the press club in Islamabad, but the government had not sent any delegation or team to hear their grievances. Instead, he regretted, the authorities were bent upon declaring them “traitors”.
“How can you call these people traitors and rebels when they have been sitting in the capital right under the nose of the parliament and the judiciary” requesting the government to tell them the whereabouts of their missing family members.
Another JUI-F MNA Usman Badini in his speech hit out at the opposition PTI over the party’s alleged silence on the issues of Balochistan.
“On one hand, the PTI people are making Mehmood Khan Achakzai their head and on the other hand, they are not ready to talk about the suicide attack in Balochistan,” he said.
Responding to the speeches of Balochistan MNAs, State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry reaffirmed the government’s readiness to engage with Balochistan’s leadership and political representatives to find practical solutions to the province’s issues.
About the ongoing protest outside the NPC in Islamabad, the minister said the authorities had been providing security and necessary facilitation to them despite the fact that they had been staging protest on a road inside the Red Zone. He claimed that the government as well as the district administration officials had been in continuous contact with the protesters, and “trying to address their concerns through proper channels.”
He alleged that some individuals were exploiting the ongoing protest for their personal gains or political point-scoring.
The minister informed the house that nearly 2,000 missing person cases had been registered and the relevant commission had been monitoring these matters according to rules.
Interestingly, the minister indirectly put the blame of the Quetta blast on the organisers of the public meeting, stating that holding political gatherings without proper clearance created soft targets.
 


PTI’s walkout
At the outset of the sitting, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan regretted that the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was not helping the flood-affected people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Mr Khan announced that the PTI members had decided to boycott the NA sitting, stating they could not be a part of the “unco­nstitutional proceedings”.
The PTI members staged a walkout from the assembly after making a failed attempt to disrupt the proceedings by pointing out quorum.
 


Speaker Ayaz Sadiq declared the house in order following a headcount and continued proceedings without the PTI members.
The speaker castigated them for boycotting the NDMA briefing and offered them that he could arrange a separate briefing of the NDMA officials for the PTI members.
He said after staging a walkout from the house, the PTI members would now tell the press outside the Parliament House that they were not being given opportunity to speak. The PTI members held a “public assembly session” outside the Parliament House.
The NA session, which began on Monday, has been prorogued for an indefinite period.

• Says no pause in expulsion of Afghans after deadly earthquake
• Spox avoids addressing Trump’s remarks, says SCO promotes multilateralism, peace
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday emphasised the seriousness of the threat posed to regional peace and stability by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups, calling it a common challenge that required collaborative efforts.
“Groups like Fitna Al-Khwarij represent a common threat to the peace and stability of our region, necessitating collective action to counter their malign influence,” Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said at a weekly media briefing.
The government uses the term to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorist group.
The spokesman was responding to questions about reported Pakistani strikes across the border and comments by Taliban acting Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob, who accused Pakistan of blaming Afghanistan for its own security shortcomings.
 
 

Pakistan has long maintained that it faces a persistent threat from militant groups operating out of Afghanistan, including the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). Multiple United Nations Security Council reports have noted the presence of sanctuaries for these groups in Afghanistan, which Islamabad says enable cross-border attacks.
Taliban officials, however, deny the allegations. In a recent media interview, Mullah Yaqoob said Pakistan’s security apparatus was to blame for failing to prevent militant infiltrations.
“If they cross into Pakistan from Afghanistan and travel deep inside Pakistani territory, why aren’t they stopped there? Instead of addressing this, Pakistan unjustly accuses Afghanistan,” he said.
Shafqat Ali dismissed the Taliban defence chief’s remarks as “an exercise in irony”. “It cannot mask the seriousness of this issue,” he said, adding: “The enormity of the matter cannot be diminished by whatever number of statements you issue.”
The FO spokesman said security forces and law enforcement agencies conduct “targeted operations in border regions to safeguard our citizens from terrorist threats”.
“These operations are meticulously planned based on credible and actionable intelligence and executed with precision,” he said, adding that Pakistan respects Afghanistan’s sovereignty and remains committed to dialogue and cooperation.
Expulsion of Afghans
FO spokesman rejected calls to pause the expulsion of Afghans following last weekend’s deadly earthquake in Afghanistan, insisting that deportations would continue and urging Germany to show seriousness in relocating vulnerable refugees.
“This is the global norm, and this is our sovereign decision regarding who we allow to enter or stay in our country. So, any person who’s illegal, we will repatriate that person,” Shafqat Ali said.
He was responding to an appeal by UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, who earlier this week urged Pakistan to suspend its ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’ because of the humanitarian crisis triggered by the earthquake.
“Given the circumstances, I appeal to the government of Pakistan to pause the implementation,” Grandi had said.
Shafqat Ali suggested there would be no extension of the Sept 1 deadline for Afghans to leave, noting that Pakistan already maintains a generous visa policy.
“We are issuing a large number of visas to Afghans under different categories, including visit, business, family, education and medical visas,” he said.
“For Afghanistan, we have a special category under which on-arrival visas are granted for certain medical emergencies. So, what I want to emphasise is that we already have a very liberalised visa regime in place.”
The FO spokesman also pressed Germany to accelerate the relocation of Afghans promised after the Taliban takeover. “We hope that they take it seriously. There is a large group of Afghans in Pakistan which the German side had committed to take to Germany. A number of deadlines have passed,” he said.
Trump’s criticism of SCO summit
The FO spokesman, while sidestepping direct comment on US President Donald Trump’s criticism of the gathering, said this week’s Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin promoted multilateralism and the pursuit of peace and prosperity.
 
 

“The recent Heads of States meeting and then in the expanded format meeting were very successful. The key message was of multilateralism, common prosperity, peace, security and development,” he noted.
He maintained that the SCO was not designed to work against any country.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also brought in new deputy and foreign ministers in a sweeping reshuffle intended to restore his authority after Rayner’s resignation.
Starmer moved foreign minister David Lammy to become deputy prime minister and replaced him with interior minister Yvette Cooper. She was, in turn, replaced by justice secretary Mahmood. All are loyal, trusted hands.
After reshaping his Downing Street team last week to bolster his economic advice, a ministerial reshuffle had been expected. Rayner’s departure meant it was much deeper than widely predicted, forcing Starmer to draw a line under more than a week of distracting speculation over her tax affairs.
Starmer could do little to protect Rayner after Britain’s independent adviser ruled that she had breached the ministerial code by failing to pay the correct tax.
“Angela is a ‘big beast’ and hard to replace,” said one Labour lawmaker, adding that the three new appointments were “sound” if not overly exciting.
Mahmood, 44, is seen as a “safe pair of hands” in Labour, a no-nonsense politician who has not been scared to take bold action while running the justice system.
 






While Lammy has been given the position of deputy prime minister, he has also been forced to hand over the much sought-after role of foreign secretary and replace Mahmood at justice.
 






Cooper is one of Labour’s most senior figures after serving former prime minister Gordon Brown. Her appointment will be seen as a promotion of sorts after overseeing the government’s often criticised policy to tackle illegal migration.
 






Loyalty is seen as vital by Starmer, who has suffered the most ministerial resignations — outside government reshuffles — of any prime minister early in their tenure in almost 50 years.
“There is a sense at the moment that they don’t know what they are doing and what they stand for,” Chris Hopkins, political research director at polling firm Savanta, told Reuters.
Regrets
Rayner, 45, was the eighth, and the most senior, ministerial departure from Starmer’s team, and the most damaging yet after the British leader offered her his support when she was first accused of avoiding 40,000 pounds ($54,000) in tax.
Rayner apologised to Starmer in her resignation letter. “I deeply regret my decision to not seek additional specialist tax advice,” she said.
 






She also stepped down as a minister and as deputy party leader, a position that Lammy will now be in pole position for.
The independent adviser on ministerial standards ruled Rayner had broken the ministerial code — rules to ensure the conduct of politicians meets the standards of public service — because she failed to heed a warning within legal advice, which she said she had relied on to seek expert advice on her complicated financial situation.
Rayner’s resignation has put more pressure on Starmer, with Labour trailing Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK in the polls.
Starmer faces difficult state spending and tax choices as he seeks to repair the centre-left party’s image after they also came under fire for accepting expensive items, including clothing and concert tickets from donors, before they were forced to water down cuts to the welfare budget.
On the first day of Reform’s party conference in the central English city of Birmingham, Farage brought forward his speech by three hours to address Rayner’s resignation.
He said the Labour government was in “deep crisis” and the next election may take place in 2027, implying that Labour, which has a big majority and does not need to call an election until 2029, may find itself unable to govern.
“Despite all the promises that this would be a new, different type of politics, is as bad, if not worse, than the one that went before,” he told the audience to loud applause.
Rayner had registered a new home in the southern English seaside resort of Hove as her primary residence, after she sold her share of her family home in northern England to a trust that was set up for one of her sons, who has lifelong disabilities.
Rayner said she had believed she would not have to pay the higher rate of tax charged when buying a second home. But after media reports drew attention to the fact she may have avoided 40,000 pounds, she took further legal advice and said she had made a mistake and would pay the additional tax.</p><small>2025-09-05 19:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/052351151031529.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939989/eu-hits-google-with-295bn-euro-fine-despite-trump-threats' target='_blank'><strong>EU hits Google with 2.95bn euro fine despite Trump threats</strong></a><br><p>The European Union on Friday slapped Google with a massive 2.95 billion euro ($3.47bn) antitrust fine for favouring its own advertising services, despite President Donald Trump’s warnings not to target United States big tech.
Google vowed to appeal the decision by the European Commission, which accused the US firm of distorting competition in the 27-nation bloc.
“Google abused its dominant position in adtech, harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers. This behaviour is illegal under EU antitrust rules,” EU competition chief Teresa Ribera said.
Trump has threatened to go after Europe for its rules on the digital market and on policing content, which affect tech giants based in the US.
Earlier this week, it emerged Ribera had hit pause on the fine, seemingly for fear of US retaliation.
The EU is still waiting for the US to make good on a promise to lower tariffs on cars under a trade deal agreed in July.
Brussels ordered Google to end its “self-preferencing practices” and take steps to cease its inherent conflicts of interest.
“Google has 60 days to inform the commission on how it plans to do so,” Ribera said.
“If it fails to propose a viable plan, the commission will not hesitate to impose an appropriate remedy.”
She said that, “at this stage, it appears that the only way for Google to end its conflict of interest effectively is with a structural remedy, such as selling some part of its Adtech business.”
Google said the commission’s decision was “wrong” and it would appeal.
“It imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money,” said the firm’s global head of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland.
“There’s nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before.”
‘Competitive advantage’
Advertising is Google’s financial bedrock. The company is a subsidiary of US tech giant Alphabet, which in July reported quarterly profits of $28.2bn.
In its decision, the commission noted that Google not only sells advertising on its own websites and apps, but was also an intermediary for firms wanting to place ads elsewhere to appear on mobile and computer screens.
For that, it has an ad exchange to match buyers and sellers called AdX, as well as an ad server called DoubleClick, and tools to buy ads called Google Ads and DV 360.
In a statement, the commission said it found that between at least 2014 and today, Google abused the dominant positions it held through DoubleClick, Google Ads and DV 360 to favour AdX.
AdX would, for example, be informed in advance of the value of the best bid from competitors taking part in the ad selection process run by DoubleClick, it said.
The European Publishers Council, a media industry group that had filed a complaint over the practices probed by the EU, said a fine was not enough.
“Without strong and decisive enforcement, Google will simply write this off as a cost of business while consolidating its dominance in the AI era,” said its director, Angela Mills Wade.
A US federal court recently upheld a similar complaint over Google’s adtech practices, ordering the firm to put forward remedies.
Friday’s announcement marked the third fine announced in a week against the Alphabet-owned Google.
A US federal jury on Wednesday ordered Google to pay about $425 million for gathering information from smartphone app users even when people opted for privacy settings.
The same day, France’s data protection authority fined the search giant 325m euros for failing to respect the law on internet cookies.
The group notched a major win, however, on Tuesday when a US judge rejected the American government’s demand that Google sell its Chrome web browser.
The landmark antitrust ruling, coming after Google was found to have illegally maintained monopolies in online search through exclusive distribution agreements, did, however, impose sweeping requirements to restore competition in the area.
As the EU’s competition watchdog, the commission has hit Google with multiple fines in recent years.
It fined the online giant 4.1bn euros in 2018 for abusing the market dominance of its Android operating system, and in 2017 slapped a 2.4bn euro fine for anti-competitive practices in the price comparison market.</p><small>2025-09-05 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05225914ee840d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939988/nccia-summons-youtuber-rajab-butt-on-sept-9-for-promoting-online-gambling-apps' target='_blank'><strong>NCCIA summons YouTuber Rajab Butt on Sept 9 for ‘promoting online gambling apps’</strong></a><br><p>The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has summoned YouTuber Rajab Butt on September 9 to join an inquiry regarding his alleged promotion of online gambling apps, it emerged on Friday.
Butt has one of the largest online followings in the country and has been embroiled in controversy for years, including over his brief custody of a lion cub.
A notice by the NCCIA on Thursday to the YouTuber said the allegation against him was of “involvement in financial scams through online trading apps, motivating youth for investments in online gambling app, use of social media platforms to project online gambling investments, designed an orchestrated scheme for looting innocent people hard-earned income on basis of convincing them to invest in unregistered/non-licenced online apps”.
It directed him to appear in person before NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz to record his version in his defence at Lahore’s NCCIA Office on Tuesday at 11am for a fair trial process.
“In case of non-appearance, it will be assumed that you have nothing to present or state in your defence,” the notice read.
Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq told Dawn.com that he would be representing Butt and a written response would be submitted on Tuesday.
“Rajab Butt’s case is being reviewed from all aspects. Rajab Butt’s case will be fully defended according to the law,” Barrister Ashfaq said.
The development comes after YouTuber Saadur Rehman, aka Ducky Bhai, was arrested last month at the Lahore airport after being booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting online gambling and betting applications.
The case was registered by the NCCIA Lahore on August 17 around midnight under Sections 13 (Electronic Forgery), 14 (Electronic Fraud), 25 (Spamming) and 26 (Spoofing) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 as well as sections 294 B (Offering prize in connection with trade) and 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducting delivery of property) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2025-09-05 18:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05144654f72cc85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939910/two-women-held-for-hurling-egg-at-imran-khans-sister-aleema-in-rawalpindi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two women held for hurling egg at Imran Khan’s sister Aleema in Rawalpindi: police</strong></a><br><p>The police said two women were arrested on Friday for throwing an egg at PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum during a media talk in Rawalpindi outside the Adiala Jail, where a hearing of the Toshakhana case was held earlier.

  @dawn.today An egg was thrown at PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum on Friday while she was holding a press conference in Rawalpindi. The footage of the incident was widely shared on different news channels and social media accounts, capturing the expression of shock on Aleema’s face when the egg was hurled at her.

A statement released by the Rawalpindi Police said that the two arrested suspects were PTI supporters, who had travelled to Rawalpindi with other members of the All Government Employees Grand Alliance and the All Pakistan Clerks Association to protest for their unmet demands.
“The egging took place when Aleema Khan did not answer the questions raised by the two women,” the statement said. “They have been taken into police custody and sent to the Adiala checkpoint.”
 






The police added that immediately after throwing the egg, the two women tried to run away in their car. “However, their vehicle was surrounded by PTI supporters, some of whom also hurled pebbles at the car and broke the windscreen.”
Later, the PTI reposted a video of a white car on X, dubbing the incident a “shameful attack on Aleema Khan”.
In a statement posted in a preceding post, the party said PTI workers chased the women right after they hurled an egg at Aleema Khan but police “facilitated them in escaping along with a car as part of a plan”.
The statement also claimed that the women were sent to the media talk “as part of an agenda”. The party further stated that they had the registration number of the car seen in the video. It also demanded the registration of a first information report of the “attack on Aleema Khan”.
 






“We strongly condemn such dirty tricks in politics without discrimination. There is opposition in politics, but within the circle of civility,” said Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on X while criticising the PTI for the past actions of its own party supporters towards politicians.
 






Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said he unequivocally condemned the incident. “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred. We should all work to keep it healthy and respectful.”
 






Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said the PTI faced the reckoning of its own past actions. Nonetheless, he said: “Politics runs on differences of opinion, but these differences should be expressed with political decorum. The expression of disagreement should not involve rudeness or incivility.”
 






Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Rafique slammed the incident as a “shameful, vile and crude act!”
 






“Shameful! The attack on Aleema Khan is appalling. Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words,” said Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal.
 






Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon too condemned the attack, saying political differences should never justify disrespectful behaviour.
 






Aleema has been campaigning for her brother’s release since August 2024.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials in May 9 cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act.
In November 2014, a plot to attack Imran with rotten eggs and tomatoes was foiled in Gujranwala. Earlier that day, TV channels had reported that angry PML-N activists were purchasing and gathering rotten eggs, tomatoes and shoes to hurl at the PTI founder.
The eggs and tomatoes were shown covered with the slogan ‘Ro Imran Ro’ (Cry Imran Cry). When the news had aired, local police took action and arrested four PML-N activists who confessed that they had planned to target Imran on Nowshera Road.</p><small>2025-09-05 17:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05160502b13170f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939928/fo-spokesperson-says-future-of-refugees-up-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>FO spokesperson says future of refugees ‘up to Pakistan’</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan on Friday said that Pakistan will decide what to do with the refugees it is hosting, such as those from Afghanistan.
Last month, Pakistan started deporting up to 1 million documented Afghan refugees ahead of its deadline for them to leave, following the interior ministry’s July 31 announcement that Proof of Registration (PoR) cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
Addressing a press briefing today, Khan said, “Those Afghans waiting to travel to Germany should be deported as soon as possible,” referring to 2,400 Afghan refugees who were promised refuge by Berlin, before its approach to migrants hardened under a new gov­­­ernment. Germany has since announced it is considering an appeal to take in 200 refugees.
“Germany should take in these refugees as soon as possible,” the spokesperson added. “Pakistani law will apply to those Afghans living here. We will decide what to do with refugees in Pakistan.”
Khan also referred to an August statement from the German foreign ministry on X, which said that Berlin takes the issue “very seriously”.
 






“I have seen the German foreign minister’s statement,” Khan said. “We are actually encouraged by it. I hope the Germans take in the large group of Afghans as soon as possible, as several deadlines have passed.
“As promised, we hope they take the matter seriously and take in the Afghans that they promised they would.”
 
 

Pakistan is not a signatory to the 1951 Geneva Convention. Instead, it operates under the Foreigners Act, which empowers the authorities to arrest, hold, and deport foreigners, including refugees and asylum seekers, who do not possess valid documentation.
Additionally, the spokesperson said that Kabul would need to take the issue of terrorism in Afghanistan seriously, stating, “Terrorist safe havens still exist in  Afghanistan.
“Pakistan knows how to defend its territory and its people,” Khan said.
“An operation was carried out in the border area with Afghanistan against terrorists,” he added, referring to drone strikes allegedly carried out by Pakistan on August 28. “Afghanistan needs to stop allowing its territory to be used for acts of terrorism.”
Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul to prevent its soil from being used to stage attacks in Pakistan, and that it is fully capable of targeting terrorists who carry out such attacks.
During the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) meeting of the Council of Heads of State, members reaffirmed their commitment to the country’s establishment as an independent, neutral and peaceful state, free from terrorism, war and drugs, and expressed their readiness to support the efforts of the international community to ensure peace and development in the country.
“Member states reiterated that the formation of an inclusive government with broad participation of representatives of all ethno-political groups of Afghan society is the only way to achieve lasting peace and stability in the country,” the declaration said.</p><small>2025-09-05 15:01</small></div><hr>
