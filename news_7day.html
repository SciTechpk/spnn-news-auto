Within the forest, an eco-tourism community offers a unique blend of natural beauty and leisure. 
This tranquil retreat, managed by the Prek Kongkang Koh Rong Ecotourism Community, provides visitors with unforgettable experiences while preserving the island’s delicate ecosystem.
Established in April 2021, it spans 40 hectares of lush mangrove forests. 
Founded through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Environmental Conservation Association and the National Council for Sustainable Development, the initiative aims to bolster local livelihoods, generate income and create employment opportunities.
“Our community not only enhances tourism in Koh Rong and Sihanoukville but also plays a vital role in conserving mangrove forests and biodiversity on the island,” explained community chief Sok Sreng.
With nearly 4,000 residents on Koh Rong, the project also strengthens the relationship between conservation and economic sustainability.

For just 40,000 riel (approximately $10), visitors can paddle along a 1,300-metre stretch of the Prek River, where the mangroves meet the turquoise waters of the sea.
This picturesque route offers stunning views of nature’s artistry, culminating in a visit to the luxurious Koh Song Saa Island.
Complementing the mangrove adventures is the Wild Orchid Flower Garden, a vibrant haven of colourful blooms nestled within the forest. 
Visitors can enjoy the harmonious blend of lush greenery and floral beauty, making it a perfect escape for nature enthusiasts.
“The community has steadily grown in popularity, welcoming 70 to 100 visitors on weekdays and even more on weekends and holidays,” Sreng told The Post.

Local food offerings, including freshly prepared islander specialities like papaya salad, crabs and mangrove coffee, provide an authentic taste of Koh Rong. 

Plans are also underway to expand accommodations with eco-friendly guest houses, catering to those who wish to stay longer and immerse themselves in the serene environment.

Once a quiet fishing community, Koh Rong has transformed into a thriving tourist destination, supported by major infrastructure projects.
Nuon Bunthol, governor of Koh Rong City, highlighted how tourism has reshaped the island’s economy. 
“Many villagers now provide tourism-related services, creating sustainable livelihoods while showcasing the island’s beauty to the world,” he said.
The mangrove forest is more than a scenic escape; it is a hub for promoting sustainable tourism.

In December 2024, Mang Sineth, governor of Preah Sihanouk province, along with international and local officials, planted 1,000 mangrove seedlings and released fish and crabs to enrich the ecosystem. 
This commitment to biodiversity underlines the importance of preserving Koh Rong’s natural heritage for future generations.
“We want to develop the area not just as a tourist attraction but as a model for sustainability,” said Sineth. 
Promotional signage and infrastructure improvements, such as roads and electricity grids, have further enhanced Koh Rong’s accessibility and appeal.

The mangrove forest of Koh Rong is not just a testament to the island’s natural charm but also a call to action for investors and developers. 
Long Dimanche, deputy provincial governor, emphasised the need for luxury resorts to elevate Koh Rong’s status on the global tourism map. 
Drawing inspiration from Bali, Indonesia, Dimanche said, “With well-designed resorts and extended stays, we can attract millions of visitors annually”.

As visitors glide through the waterways of the mangrove forest or relax under the shade of its towering trees, they contribute to the vision of a sustainable Koh Rong – where nature and tourism thrive hand in hand. 
Whether it’s kayaking, enjoying local delicacies or exploring vibrant gardens, the mangroves of Koh Rong offer a journey of discovery and tranquillity.
For those seeking an unspoiled corner of Cambodia, the mangrove forest in Koh Rong Marine National Park is a must-visit destination.

Tokenisation is the process of creating a digital version of an asset.
Separately, Pakistan also gave initial clearance for Binance and HTX, a digital-asset platform, to register with regulators to set up local subsidiaries and begin preparations for full exchange licence applications, the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) said.
The ministry said the agreement paved the way to explore a potential collaboration aimed at enabling the tokenisation and blockchain-based distribution of real-world assets, including sovereign bonds, treasury bills, commodity reserves such as oil, gas, metals or other raw materials owned by the government.
“Under the proposed arrangement, Binance and/or its affiliates may provide technical expertise, advisory support, training and capacity building to enable Pakistan to assess modern, compliant blockchain infrastructure,” the ministry said in a press release.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the agreement was a very strong message to both Pakistan and the entire world.
“What we have signed today reflects a long-term partnership. From where we started to moving towards operationalisation, this progress could not have happened without active guidance and leadership,” Aurangzeb was quoted as saying.
“The next step for us is execution, and we are fully committed to delivering results with speed and quality.”







The move comes as other countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, Japan and parts of the European Union, expand formal licensing rules for crypto exchanges amid broader global regulatory tightening.
The ministry also said the initiative could involve assets of up to $2bn, subject to approvals, to improve liquidity, transparency and international market access.
Binance founder Changpeng Zhao said the agreement was “a great signal for the global blockchain industry and for Pakistan”, saying it marked the beginning of a move toward full deployment of the tokenisation initiative.
“This is the beginning … now we can move towards full deployment and execution. We are honoured to work with Pakistan’s leadership and are confident this collaboration will deliver positive and lasting outcomes for the economy,” he was quoted as saying.
Initial clearances for Binance, HTX
The PVARA said it had issued early approvals to Binance and HTX after reviewing their governance and compliance controls. The clearances allow them to register on the Anti-Money Laundering system, set up local units and prepare full applications.
PVARA Chairman Bilal bin Saqib said the clearances kick off Pakistan’s phased licensing process and signalled that compliance strength will determine which exchanges move ahead.
Broader digital-asset initiatives
The initiative comes as Pakistan speeds up a major digital-finance overhaul in just a few months, creating the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) and establishing the PVARA, while drafting a formal licensing regime.
Pakistan ranks as the world’s third-largest crypto market by retail activity, Saqib said at Binance Blockchain Week Dubai 2025 earlier this week.
A central bank digital currency pilot and a Virtual Assets Act are also planned for 2025.
The PCC signed a letter of intent with US-based World Liberty Financial to explore stablecoin use, tokenisation and other digital-asset infrastructure, the finance ministry said in April.</p><small>2025-12-12 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12183930026c4cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960685/pm-calls-on-world-to-urge-kabul-to-rein-in-terrorists-operating-from-afghan-soil' target='_blank'><strong>PM calls on world to urge Kabul to rein in terrorists operating from Afghan soil</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called on the international community on Friday to urge Afghanistan to fulfil its international “obligations” and rein in terrorist outfits operating from its territory.
The premier made these remarks while addressing an international forum in Turkmenistan, where he also held bilateral meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.
During those meetings, he stressed the need for the rulers in Kabul to take “meaningful action” and “fully address” Pakistan’s security concerns.
Pakistan, which has been grappling with the problem of terrorism for long, has been demanding that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. But, the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegation of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
The two sides also engaged in border skirmishes in recent months, following which a ceasefire was reached. Pakistan and Afghanistan have also held talks with the mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, but the negotiators have failed to bridge differences over how to prevent cross-border terrorism.
‘Fragile ceasefire’
Today, PM Shehbaz, who is on a two-day visit to Turkmenistan, raised the matter in his address at the international forum hosted in Ashgabat to mark the 30th anniversary of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality.
The United Nations granted Turkmenistan the status of a neutral country in 1995. It defines neutrality as “the legal status arising from the abstention of a state from all participation in a war between other states, the maintenance of an attitude of impartiality toward the belligerents, and the recognition by the belligerents of this abstention and impartiality”.
A forum was organised in the Turkmen capital today to commemorate the development where global leaders, including heads of state from Russia and Turkiye, were among the attendees.







Talking about the “scourge” of terrorism on the occasion, the premier called on the international community and said, “We need the international community to urge the Afghan Taliban regime to fulfil its international obligations and commitments and rein in terrorists operating from its territory.”
PM Shehbaz also expressed gratitude to Qatar, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates for their efforts in brokering a ceasefire between Islamabad and Kabul.
The premier noted that while the ceasefire still stood, it remained “fragile”.
He also underscored Pakistan’s commitment to “peaceful dispute resolution”.
“The UN Security Council’s (UNSC) adoption of resolution 2788 earlier this year was a strong endorsement of Pakistan’s vision for the peaceful settlement of disputes,” he said.
In July, the UNSC had unanimously adopted a resolution sponsored by Pakistan, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.
In his remarks, PM Shehbaz also talked about Gaza and expressed the hoped that ongoing peace efforts would “ultimately protect and save the lives of innocent Palestinians, ensuring a lasting and permanent ceasefire, [and] allow the flow of critical humanitarian aid”.
“Pakistan has been and shall continue to support all efforts aimed at upholding the inalienable right to self-defence for the Palestinian people as well as the brave and resilient Kashmiri people,” he went on to say.
The premier noted that “the pursuit of lasting peace is intrinsically linked to the path of sustainable development”.
“In this regard, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development presents a universal blueprint for a better and peaceful world.
“Socio-economic development and the welfare of our people are my government’s foremost priority,” he said.
PM Shehbaz told the conference that Pakistan was making “significant strides in several key areas, including advancing financial inclusion, bringing women and marginalised into the economic mainstream”.
Shifting his attention to climate, the premier said that Pakistan had demonstrated its commitment to undertaking cleaner and greener solutions, “transforming our landscape and setting a global example in ecosystem restoration”.
The premier, however, pointed out that similar to many developing nations, Pakistan’s “quest” for sustainable development was “facing the headwinds of climate-induced disasters and inequities in international economic relations”.
He also highlighted the “catastrophic impact” of floods in recent years. The prime minister told the gathering that “climate change, poverty, and inequality are not isolated challenges”.
“These are transnational threats,” he said, adding that resolving them required “solutions built on a foundation of shared responsibility and unity of purpose, and access to advanced technology, especially digital technology”.
He insisted that “it must also be equitable and without any kind of discrimination”.
In his concluding remarks, PM Shehbaz thanked the Turk­menistan leadership for hosting the forum.
“I appeal to all of you ladies and gentlemen to let this forum serve as a genuine call to action and urgent action for a new paradigm of international relations where we move from zero-sum mindsets to purposeful cooperation,” the premier said.
“Let us invest in connectivity, not just as conduits for transportation of goods but as bridges for people, ideas and prosperity. Let us commit to [resolving] disputes peacefully through dialogue and diplomacy and reaffirm our earnest commitment to the principles of the UN Charter, and let us together chart a common course towards a future defined by peace, mutual trust and shared prosperity.
“For far too long, the seeds of hatred and conflict have overshadowed our world,” PM Shehbaz noted, calling on the world to “let the dove of peace take flight once more”.
Shehbaz-Erdogan meeting
In a meeting with President Erdogan on sidelines of the forum, PM Shehbaz expressed Pakistan’s resolve to “strengthen bilateral cooperation” with Turkiye in various sectors, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said.
“During their warm and cordial meeting, the two leaders reaffirmed the significance of the historic and deep fraternal bonds between the two nations, that are rooted in shared values and a common aspiration for peace and prosperity,” the statement said.
PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction at “leadership-level engagements” between the two nations and at the “convening of the 16th session of the Pak-Turkiye Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC) that would ensure implementation of the decisions of the 7th High Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC), it added.







He expressed his firm resolve to further strengthen bilateral cooperation with Turkiye in all areas of mutual interest, including political, energy, economic, defence and investment.
“While identifying energy, petroleum and minerals as priority sectors, the prime minister welcomed Turkish interest and investments in these areas,” the statement said.
PM Shehbaz also “urged the two sides to ensure the timely implementation of the recently signed memoranda of understanding/agreements in these critical sectors.”
During the meeting, the premier expressed Pakistan’s desire to seek “benefit from Turkish expertise in the privatisation of distribution companies”.
“In this regard, it was decided that ministerial-level exchanges between the two countries would take place very soon,” the statement said.
Additionally, PM Shehbaz “underscored the importance of regional connectivity as manifested by the revival of the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail network,” the statement read.
It added that “both leaders also exchanged views on regional as well as global developments.”
PM Shehbaz lauded the Turkish president’s “bold leadership and strong commitment to peace efforts in Gaza”.
Turning his attention to Pak-Afghan relations, the premier thanked Turkiye for its “constructive role” in mediating talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
However, PM Shehbaz maintained that “peace would only be possible if Pakistan’s security concerns were fully addressed”.
“President Erdogan thanked PM Shehbaz for his views, particularly his kind words and expressed his desire to work together with a view to build stronger ties between the two countries,” the statement said.
Shehbaz-Pezeshkian meeting
Later, PM Shehbaz also held a bilateral meeting with President Pezeshkian, the PMO Office said in a separate statement.
“During their warm and cordial meeting, both leaders appreciated the strong support that their countries had provided to each other when they had faced external aggression earlier this year,” the statement read, apparently referring to the conflict between India and Pakistan in May and another one between Iran and Israel in June.







The statement further said that noting the “successful convening” of the 22nd meeting of the Pak-Iran Joint Economic Commission earlier this year, the premier emphasised the need for both sides to continue working closely to strengthen bilateral cooperation with a view to enhancing the volume of bilateral trade, operationalising border markets, strengthening border security, and reinvigorating transport connectivity through the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail network.
It said the two leaders also exchanged views on regional and global developments.
“The prime minister stressed the need to urge the Afghan Taliban regime to take meaningful action to address Pakistan’s serious security concerns as regards terrorism emanating from Afghan soil.”
Moreover, the two leaders also discussed ongoing peace efforts regarding Gaza, the statement said.
It added that “President Pezeshkian thanked the prime minister for the most useful and timely exchange of views and stated that Iran also desired to further strengthen its ties with Pakistan”.
“The meeting reflected the close and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Iran, rooted in their shared history, culture, and faith. Both leaders agreed to continue regular high-level engagements and consultations to further consolidate bilateral relations,” it read.
The statement also said that the PM conveyed his warm regards and good wishes for Ayatollah Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran.
PM Shehbaz also held informal meetings with several other world leaders on sidelines of the international forum, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon and Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Japarov, state broadcaster PTV News reported.







Dar meets other foreign ministers
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who is accompanying the premier to Turkmenistan, held a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
In a post on X, Dar said that the pair discussed “bilateral cooperation and exchanged views on regional developments”.
“We agreed to further deepen collaboration in trade, connectivity and people-to-people ties, and reaffirmed our commitment to working together for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” he added.







In a separate post, Dar said that he also met with Kyrgyzstan Foreign Minister Zheenbek Kulubeav, and the pair “reviewed progress” on Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan’s bilateral relations.
“Following the recent visit of the president of Kyrgyzstan to Pakistan, we reviewed the progress of our bilateral relations, discussed regional developments, and agreed to work together to further enhance cooperation for the mutual benefit of our peoples,” Dar added.







Dar also met the foreign ministers of Turkiye and Oman, and the three exchanged views on “regional and international developments.”
“Good to catch up with my brothers, FM Sayyid Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi @badralbusaidi of Oman and FM Hakan Fidan @HakanFidan of Türkiye, today in Ashgabat on the sidelines of the Peace & Trust Conference,” he said in another post on X.
“We exchanged views on regional & international developments, and reaffirmed our commitment to further strengthen our fraternal ties,” he said.







The foreign minister also met with his counterparts from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
In the meeting with Tajikistan’s Foreign Minister Sirojiddin Muhriddin, the pair agreed to “deepen cooperation” across various sectors.







While in a meeting with Uzbek Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, Dar and Saidov reviewed the progress of bilateral cooperation between Pakistan and Uzbekistan.







Earlier in the day, PM Shehbaz and other leaders attending the international forum, also visited the Monument of Neutrality in Ashgabat, where a floral wreath laying ceremony was held.







PM Shehbaz had met Turk­menistan President Serdar Berdimuhamedov on Thursday and congratulated him on the 30th anniversary of Permanent Neutrality of Turkmenistan and on the UN designation of 2025 as the International Year of Peace and Trust.
While underscoring the importance of the historic and fraternal relations between Pakistan and Turkmenistan, the PM expressed his resolve to further strengthen ties between the two countries, partic­ularly through enh­anced trade and economic engagement.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s desire to enhance connectivity with Turkmenistan through land and sea routes.
In a subsequent post on X, the premier said he looked forward to welcoming President Berdimuhamedov and politician Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov to Pakistan next year.







PM Shehbaz has undertaken the visit at the invitation of the Turkmen president.
In addition to Dar, Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Tariq Fatemi, a key aid to the PM, and Special Assistant to the PM Talha Burki are part of the delegation accompanying the premier on the trip.</p><small>2025-12-12 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121759459726274.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960709/azad-kashmir-gilgit-baltistan-must-receive-funding-under-the-nfc-award-nawaz' target='_blank'><strong>Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan must receive funding under the NFC award: Nawaz</strong></a><br><p>PML-N President and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday asked his brother, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to give funds to Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in accordance with the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award.
Nawaz’s suggestion on including AJK and GB’s share in the NFC is significant, as smaller provinces have previously rejected this federal plea several times. The proposal was formally initiated when NFC talks started under then-prime minister Imran Khan, while current Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had also suggested the same in the past to reduce the financial burden on the Centre.
“Funds should be given to Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan under the NFC award. I will speak to PM Shehbaz Sharif in this regard,“ the PML-N supremo said while talking to party leaders in Lahore.
“A certain amount every year must be given to both provinces — Azad Kashmir and GB. This is very important,” he said, adding that these two provinces must have the capacity to spend this money.



He recalled how both provinces could not properly utilise the funding they received from the federal government in the past.
“They need to know how to spend that money. The way I want such funds utilised did not happen,” he stated.
Nawaz also sought applications for elections in both provinces by December 31.
“We decide who will be awarded the tickets on merit in both provinces, as we do in other provinces,” he announced. “We will not tolerate infighting on tickets. Anyone involved in this will be excluded from the process.”
He added that when the PML-N received applications, he would visit both provinces and meet candidates to listen to their perspectives and reach a better understanding in awarding tickets.
The PML-N supremo also praised his daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, for her performance as the province’s chief executive. He specifically praised initiatives such as building cancer hospitals, model villages and introducing the metro bus system.
During the NFC meeting last week, the federal government proposed mobilising additional consolidated revenues amounting to more than 5 per cent of GDP over the next three years (roughly Rs6.5 trillion per annum at the current exchange rate).
The suggestion came during the much-delayed inaugural meeting, which also sought legal opinion on whether federal expenditure priorities bind provinces.
Participants told journalists outside the Ministry of Finance that there was no demand for reducing the provincial share in the divisible pool from the existing 57.5pc as being speculated, nor any discussion about more or less responsibilities, as they were subjects of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and the National Economic Council (NEC).
Fiscal requirements of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan would also be deliberated at a working-group level.
However, AJK went through a period of political instability between September and November, with the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee’s (JKJAAC) calling a strike over the issue of its unfulfilled charter of demands, including the abolition of 12 seats allocated for refugees in the territory’s legislative assembly.
The strikes turned violent after the administration imposed a communications blackout and rival groups marred the largely peaceful demonstrations with violence, leaving at least 10 dead. Two rounds of talks were held with the federal government — one in September and another in October, where an agreement was reached. The terms included additional funding for the province, a reduction in the cabinet size and a probe into those killed during the protests.
Later, then-prime minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq faced a no-confidence vote in November, with PPP leader Faisal Rathore nominated as his successor. Haq was voted out on November 17, with Rathore being sworn in the next day.</p><small>2025-12-12 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121738329ddda9d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960707/gilgit-baltistan-assembly-polls-to-be-held-on-jan-24' target='_blank'><strong>Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly polls to be held on Jan 24</strong></a><br><p>Elections in Gilgit-Baltistan will be held on January 24, 2026, after the Assembly completed its five-year tenure last month.
The notification for the poll date was issued today by the GB Council.
“The President of Islamic Republic of Pakistan has announced Saturday 24th January as the poll day for the Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly in terms of article 48-A (1) of the Government of the Gilgit Baltistan Order 2018, read with Section 57 (1) of the Election Act 2017,” it said.
Retired Judge Yar Muhammad was appointed chief minister of GB following the expiry of its elected government tenure.
Under the GB Order 2018, elections must be held within 60 days.
The GB Assembly consists of a total of 33 seats, which include 24 general seats, three reserved for women, and three for technocrats.
Five-year background
The GB Assembly elections were held on Nov 15, 2020, across 24 constituencies. The PTI formed the government, and Khalid Khurshid was elected chief minister.
However, in July 2023, the GB Chief Court disqualified Khurshid. Subsequently, a coalition government was formed by members of the PTI disgruntled group, the PPP, and the PML-Nawaz, which elected Haji Gulbar Khan as the new chief minister of the region.
According to Abbas Ali, deputy director of information for the house, the assembly adopted 63 Acts during its five-year tenure, including one pertaining to land reforms as well as six federal ones.
The GB Assembly passed 114 resolutions on various issues, including a demand that the federal government declare Gilgit-Baltistan a provisional province of Pakistan.</p><small>2025-12-12 13:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12164644eac738e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960706/senator-alleges-corruption-of-billions-of-rupees-in-attestation-of-documents-at-foreign-office' target='_blank'><strong>Senator alleges ‘corruption of billions of rupees’ in attestation of documents at Foreign Office</strong></a><br><p>After Senator Rana Mahmoodul Hassan alleged on Friday that “corruption of billions of rupees” was being committed daily at the foreign affairs ministry in the attestation of documents, a Senate body decided to raise the matter with the Foreign Office (FO).
Dawn has reached out to the FO for a comment.
The attestation of documents, such as educational and marriage certificates, by the foreign affairs ministry is typically required for recognition by international and foreign entities.
The matter came up during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, where Senator Hassan of the PPP alleged corruption in the process and remarked: “Overseas Pakistanis are either running from post to pillar for a single signature or paying money for corruption.”
He said that people had been complaining about having to spend nights on pavements to get their documents attested.
The attestation process should either be digitised or union councils and deputy commissioners should be authorised to attest documents, he stressed.
Senator Anwaarul Haq Kakar also raised the question of why the process was not being digitised. “Is there a lack of resources?” he said, adding that there should be an app for the FO.
He further stated that the FO should be asked why the issue was not being resolved.
“The higher-up in the Foreign Office does not want to let go of control, and the subordinate is running a shop,” he commented without taking any names and elaborating further. “What is the job of the Foreign Office?” he added.
PML-N Senator Agha Shahzaib Durrani claimed during the meeting that a commander of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) had travelled for Haj and Umrah on a Pakistani passport.
At that, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman asked, “Who allowed the TTP to enter [the country]?”
Senator Kakar responded to that, saying, “We, too, were with those who gave the permission.” He also mentioned that when TTP’s Mullah Mansour died, a Pakistani passport was also found in his possession.
As the Senate standing committee expressed reservations over the attestation process, it decided to raise the matter with the FO.
Earlier in the meeting, Senator Agha Shahzaib Durrani was elected to chairperson of the standing committee.
The body was previously headed by PML-N’s Irfan Siddiqui, who passed away on November 10.</p><small>2025-12-12 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121644488e3bc04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960705/death-toll-from-river-jhelum-accident-rises-to-10-after-6-more-bodies-recovered' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from river Jhelum accident rises to 10 after 6 more bodies recovered</strong></a><br><p>Rescue services recovered six more bodies from the river Jhelum near the Garari Bridge in Rawalpindi on Friday after a hi-ace van plunged into the river a day earlier, taking the death toll from the incident to 10.
On Thursday, a van carrying more than 12 passengers was coming from Hajera in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) when it plunged into the river while navigating a turn near Garari Bridge in the Kahuta area of Rawalpindi. Four bodies were recovered in yesterday’s operation, which had to be halted later in the day due to low light conditions.
In the operation, which resumed on Friday, at least six more bodies were recovered, District Emergency Officer 1122 Rawalpindi Sighbatullah said in a statement.
Three passengers remain missing, he added.
Earlier, the Rescue 1122 official had confirmed the recovery of five people.
A day earlier, low-light conditions did not allow divers to search for the missing. Rescue officials had expressed fear that the river’s current may have carried away the missing passengers.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Rawalpindi, Engineer Amir Khattak, had directed all relevant authorities, including health, Rescue 1122, traffic police and tehsil administration to launch a coordinated operation for the rescue of the passengers.
On August 24 last year, a fatal accident at the same Garari bridge claimed 24 lives after a bus plunged into the river, while in another accident over 14 passengers were seriously injured in a bus accident in the area on the Kahuta- Hajera AJK road in October 2024.</p><small>2025-12-12 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121528246f199d4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960699/rainfall-snow-expected-in-kp-gb-and-balochistan-over-weekend' target='_blank'><strong>Rainfall, snow expected in KP, GB, and Balochistan over weekend</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meterological Department (PMD) on Friday forecasted rain-thunderstorm and snowfall in the western and northern parts of the country over the weekend.

Under the influence of the weather system, light to moderate rain-thunderstorm with snowfall over the hills is expected in several areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, including “Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Kohistan, Malakand, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir from December 13th to 15th, with occasional gaps,” the statement said.
“Partly cloudy conditions with light rain/storm is expected in Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Waziristan, Quetta, Ziarat, Zhob, Sherani, Chaman, Pishin, Qilla Abdullah, Qilla Saifullah, and Noshki on December 14th or 15.”
It also forecasted drizzle in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Potohar region and light rain or snow in Murree and Galliyat over the weekend.
Moderate or dense foggy conditions are likely to develop over plain areas of Punjab, KP and upper Sindh from night of December 12th to 16th.
The Met Office predicted that “another western disturbance is likely to influence western and upper parts of the country from December 19th”.
In October a report on Pakistan’s monsoon floods, compiled by the Intersector Coordination Group in collaboration with other partners, stated the country is likely to face one of its coldest winter this year in decades due to the La Nina climate pattern.
A La Nina occurs when sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean cool abnormally, triggering extreme weather shifts worldwide.
This could lead to colder-than-usual winter conditions, further stretching the coping mechanisms of households affected by the floods, particularly in the mountainous regions of KP and GB.</p><small>2025-12-12 10:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12140349725ecd3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960696/bilawal-responds-to-punjab-cm-maryams-warm-welcome-thanks-her-for-positive-gesture' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal responds to Punjab CM Maryam’s ‘warm welcome’, thanks her for ‘positive gesture’</strong></a><br><p>Setting aside their political differences, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz have exchanged greetings on social media platform X, with the former thanking the latter for the “positive gesture”.
On Thursday, Maryam, in a post on X, had extended a “warm welcome” to Bilawal, who is currently visiting the province.
“Punjab is your home, and you will always find a place of respect here,” she said.
“Thank you for your gracious remarks. You have my heartfelt good wishes and prayers,” she added.
Although Maryam did not specifically mention which comments she was referring to, Bilawal, during a media talk in Lahore this week, had said he would be very happy if the Punjab chief minister chose to contest polls from Sindh.







In response, Bilawal on Friday said, “Thank you, madam chief minister for the warm welcome and positive gesture.”







The PPP and PML-N, who are allies in the Centre, engaged in a war of words in September and October. The bad blood had escalated to the point that leaders from both sides were holding daily press conferences to take potshots at the other side until tensions defused.

 

More recently, another instance of a rift between the two parties was witnessed on Wednesday when the PPP accused the PML-N of “colluding” with the PTI during National Assembly proceedings after presiding officer for the day, Ali Zahid, ended the session early. The move came as PTI’s Iqbal Afridi pointed out a “lack of quorum” ahead of an agenda item regarding the renaming of Islamabad International Airport.
Meanwhile, Bilawal has had an interesting visit to Punjab thus far. During his visit to Lahore, a woman had interrupted his talk in the city’s Baghbanpura area, shouting from the rooftop of her home, “Don’t talk about politics.”
Bilawal had taken the interruption in stride, smiling up at the woman and breaking into laughter.
“Tell me what I should talk about,” he asked the lady, who then asked about how he was doing.
“I am good, thank you,” he responded.

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi cautiously rekindles ties with Beijing in the face of punishing US tariffs, the officials said New Delhi dropped a layer of bureaucratic scrutiny and shortened visa approval times to less than a month.
Both officials who confirmed the development to Reuters spoke on condition of anonymity.
India had blocked virtually all Chinese visits after the nuclear-armed neighbours clashed on their Himalayan frontier in mid-2020, widening its vetting of business visas beyond the home and foreign ministries.

 

The issues around securing visas have now been completely resolved, said one of the officials with knowledge of the matter.
“We have removed the layer of administrative vetting and are processing the business visas within four weeks,” the official added.
India’s ministries of external affairs, home and trade, as well as the prime minister’s office and the top think tank on policy, did not respond to email requests for comment.
Following the news, China’s foreign ministry said it had noticed “positive action” from India to facilitate people-to-people exchanges in the common interest.
“China is willing to maintain communication and consultation with India to continuously enhance the level of facilitation of exchanges,” ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun added.
Think tank Observer Research Foundation estimates that tougher scrutiny led to production losses of $15 billion over four years to Indian electronics makers, which import key machinery from China to make mobile telephones.
Major Chinese electronics companies, such as Xiaomi, struggled to get visas, Reuters reported last year.
Industry executives have said such curbs hit their plans to expand in India, while the solar industry was also hit by shortages of skilled labour.
The removal of red tape comes after Modi visited China this year for the first time in seven years, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping and discussing ways to improve ties.
Subsequently, both countries resumed direct flights, for the first time since 2020.
The easing of curbs was prompted by a high-level committee headed by a former cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, now a member of the top government think tank, which also aims to ease investment curbs on China that hurt foreign investor sentiment.
“We welcome the government’s decision to expedite skilled-visa approvals for professionals from land-bordering countries,” said Pankaj Mohindroo, head of industry body the Indian Cellular and Electronics Association.
“This reflects a collaborative approach and the government’s acceptance of our recommendations.”
The changes come at a crucial time for India, which is scaling up production across categories from finished goods to components and sub-assemblies, he added.
Warming China ties follow us tariffs
India’s warmer ties with China follow the surprise levy of a 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods by US President Donald Trump, including a penal tariff of 25pc for buying Russian oil.
That prompted India to reshape its diplomatic calculus, reworking ties with China and strengthening ties with Russia, while continuing to negotiate a trade deal with Washington.
In this effort, Modi has doubled down on focusing measures to boost growth by improving the environment for foreign investment, including business with China.
India also recently cut consumption tax and eased labour laws to lure foreign investors.
“We are cautiously easing some rules around restriction on China, which, we hope, will improve the overall business environment,” the second official said.</p><small>2025-12-12 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121007156e17c0e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960682/central-bank-likely-to-hold-interest-rate-at-11pc-as-imf-flags-inflation-risks' target='_blank'><strong>Central bank likely to hold interest rate at 11pc as IMF flags inflation risks</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is expected to retain interest rates at 11 per cent on Monday, a Reuters poll showed, as analysts push back rate-cut forecasts to late 2026 after the International Monetary Fund warned inflation risks persist and policy must stay “appropriately tight”.
All 12 analysts surveyed expect no cut in the policy meeting scheduled for Monday.
A majority of them see inflation hovering at 6pc–8pc in the coming months before rising again towards the end of fiscal 2026 as base effects fade and food and transport prices stay volatile after flood-related supply disruptions.
Most respondents now believe the SBP will not begin easing until the closing months of FY26, which ends in June 2026, with some analysts pushing forecasts for the first cut into fiscal year 2027, beginning July 2026.
IMF warns against premature easing
The IMF, in a second review released on Thursday, said monetary policy needs to remain “appropriately tight and data-dependent” to keep expectations anchored and noted that the SBP had maintained positive real interest rates on a forward-looking basis.
It said the tight stance had been pivotal in reducing inflation and should be maintained to ensure price stability and support the rebuilding of external buffers.
Analysts said these risks, along with the SBP’s preference for maintaining positive real interest rates, would keep policymakers cautious.
The SBP has held its policy rate at 11pc since September, after cutting it by 1,100 basis points between June 2024 and May 2025 as inflation fell sharply from highs near 40pc in 2023.
Price, external pressures edge up
Inflation has started to accelerate after months of decline, driven by food and transport costs and fading base effects.
Headline inflation eased to 6.1pc in November from 6.2pc in October but remained above the SBP’s 5–7pc target. The IMF expects inflation to temporarily accelerate to 8–10pc this fiscal year before stabilising.
While Pakistan’s macroeconomic backdrop has stabilised somewhat, analysts said the recovery remains sensitive to external pressures.
Premature rate cuts could pressure the rupee even with anticipated IMF inflows, including a $1.2 billion disbursement this week to bolster reserves and support climate-resilience reforms.
Any demand-driven uptick, said Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Ltd, “will have an adverse impact on the external front”.</p><small>2025-12-12 07:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/120851152c9261f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960677/5-cops-injured-in-late-night-terrorist-attack-on-police-checkpost-in-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>5 cops injured in late-night terrorist attack on police checkpost in Bannu</strong></a><br><p>Five cops were injured after terrorists launched a late-night attack on a police checkpost in Shaikh Landak area located within the Havaid police jurisdiction in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu, it emerged on Friday.
A statement released by the spokesperson for the regional police officer, Kashif Nawaz, said Fitna al Khawarij terrorists attacked the post late on Thursday night.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement said that police personnel showed courage, bravery and acted in a timely manner, managing to repel the attack.
“As a result of the effective and vigorous retaliatory fire by the police, the terrorists suffered heavy casualties,” the statement said. It said that the exchange of fire continued for three hours, adding that reports suggested that several terrorists had been killed and injured.
It added that armed tribesmen and members of the peace committee backed police personnel in the gunfight with the terrorists.
It added that during this process, five cops sustained “minor injuries” and were taken to the hospital for medical treatment.
The statement said that on the instructions of Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan, additional personnel reached the scene and surrounded the area.
It said that the Bannu DIG and District Police Office (DPO) Yasir Afridi praised the efforts of the police, and the courage and bravery of the people in the area.
The statement went on to say that the Bannu DPO later visited the injured cops at the hospital.
“Bannu police have once again proven that it stands as a strong wall in front of the enemies of peace. The war against terrorism will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The development came as the situation remained tense in the area on Thursday after at least seven people, including minors, were injured in a quadcopter attack carried out by terrorists on a playground during a football match.
Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents follow the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
In October, Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged in the country over three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-12-12 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12123317ee5a2af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960691/japan-lifts-tsunami-warning-after-67-magnitude-earthquake' target='_blank'><strong>Japan lifts tsunami warning after 6.7-magnitude earthquake</strong></a><br><p>A powerful earthquake struck off the coast of northern Japan on Friday, the weather office said, days after an even larger tremor shook the region and injured at least 50.
The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded Friday’s quake to magnitude 6.7 and warned that tsunami waves of up to one metre (three feet) could hit the northern Pacific coastline.
In the end, waves of up to 20 centimetres were recorded on the main northern island of Hokkaido and in the Aomori region, the JMA said, before the tsunami advisory was lifted.
Broadcaster NHK said there was no obvious change at either of the ports where the waves hit.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) also said that the quake measured 6.7 and was 130 kilometres (81 miles) off the city of Kuji in Iwate prefecture on the main island of Honshu.
NHK said that the level of shaking was less than the bigger 7.5 tremor late on Monday, which knocked items off shelves, tore apart roads, smashed windows and triggered tsunami waves of up to 70 centimetres.
In the wake of that quake, an evacuation order was issued on Thursday for residents living near a damaged 70-metre-high steel tower in Aomori, local media said, with authorities citing the risk of collapse.
The Nuclear Regulation Authority said on Friday there were no immediate signs of abnormalities at the region’s nuclear facilities.
Following Monday’s tremor, the JMA published a rare special advisory warning that another quake of similar or greater size was possible for another week.
The advisory covered the Sanriku area on the northeastern tip of Japan’s main island of Honshu and the northern island of Hokkaido, facing the Pacific.
The region is haunted by the memory of a massive 9.0-magnitude undersea quake in 2011, which triggered a tsunami that killed around 18,500 people.
In August 2024, the JMA issued its first special advisory, for the southern half of Japan’s Pacific coast warning of a possible “megaquake” along the Nankai Trough.
The 800-kilometre undersea trench is where the Philippine Sea oceanic tectonic plate is “subducting” — or slowly slipping — underneath the continental plate that Japan sits atop.
The government has said a quake in the Nankai Trough and subsequent tsunami could kill as many as 298,000 people and cause up to $2 trillion in damages.
The JMA lifted last year’s advisory after a week but it led to panic-buying of staples like rice and prompted holidaymakers to cancel hotel reservations.
Japan sits on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is one of the world’s most seismically active countries.
The archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year.
The vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and depth below the Earth’s surface.</p><small>2025-12-12 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1211363435cb08b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960687/absence-of-political-trust-between-india-and-us-highlighted-at-congress-hearing' target='_blank'><strong>Absence of political trust between India and US highlighted at Congress hearing</strong></a><br><p>A US congressional hearing this week noted that President Donald Trump has repeatedly described Pakistan as a “key regional partner” even as his administration seeks to further strengthen ties with India.
The hearing — held by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia — also exposed sharp disagreements among lawmakers and analysts over the direction of Washington’s India policy. Witnesses warned during the hearing that tariff battles, visa restrictions and political mistrust had pushed the relationship into what several described as a “political standstill”.
Jeff Smith of conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, long considered sympathetic to New Delhi, acknowledged that the partnership had entered “choppy waters”, attributing the downturn to Trump’s sweeping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods and India’s discomfort over US engagement with Pakistan after the May conflict between India and Pakistan.
The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire.
Smith noted that the Trump administration’s messaging during the ceasefire between India and Pakistan had placed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a “difficult position at home”, with critics accusing him of “bending to the will of the US”.
Republican scepticism
Republican scepticism — usually muted when it comes to India — was unusually sharp. Congressman Mike Baumgartner of Washington state questioned whether India was genuinely committed to deepening defence cooperation with the United States. He recounted browsing a book on the Indian Army during a recent visit to India and finding a full-page photograph of Indian troops training with Russians while US-India exercises appeared only as a small boxed image. “The next time I go to India,” he said, “I’d like to see those pages reversed.”
His comments reflected a wider concern in Washington that despite two decades of US outreach, India continues to hedge strategically — maintaining close ties with Russia and participating actively in China-led forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
Committee Chairman Bill Huizenga opened the session by calling India a “defining partner for the 21st century”, praising its expanding naval posture in the Indo-Pacific, its role in the Quad, and cooperation in technology, counter-terrorism and energy. Yet he also acknowledged “understandable concerns” over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to New Delhi and India’s involvement in multilateral platforms shaped by China. Huizenga accused Beijing of pursuing a “string of pearls” strategy to militarise ports across the Indian Ocean.
‘Frozen high-level engagement’
Democratic Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove issued the strongest warning, cautioning that Trump risked becoming “the president who lost India” because of escalating disputes over trade and immigration. She revealed that a US-India trade agreement had been on track for signature in July but was abruptly withdrawn by the White House. Instead, India was hit with 50pc tariffs — among the steepest applied to any US partner — and a 25pc tariff on India-linked Russian oil imports.
She criticised the newly announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee, noting that Indians hold nearly 70pc of such visas and form a crucial segment of the US technology and medical workforce. The combined effect of these decisions, she said, had frozen high-level engagement and forced the postponement of the Quad Leaders Summit.
Yet the hearing also underscored a growing divergence between congressional rhetoric and Trump’s own public posture. While several lawmakers focused sharply on allegations of militancy in occupied Kashmir and criticised Pakistan, others noted that Trump had maintained a strikingly different tone throughout the year. He has issued more than 30 public statements praising Pakistan for its cooperation, calling Islamabad a “key regional partner”, and emphasising the need for balanced engagement with both South Asian nuclear powers.
Following the India-Pakistan May conflict, Trump declined to assign blame and instead praised Pakistan’s role in helping defuse tensions.
Analysts at the hearing indirectly acknowledged that such statements had complicated New Delhi’s domestic political narrative.
In multiple statements, Trump has reaffirmed that eight jets were downed during the military escalation. For its part, Pakistan initially said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale, and later increased the count to seven.
Initially, New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Later in October, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh claimed without evidence that his country had “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class”.
‘Second-most significant challenge’
Dhruva Jaishankar of the Observer Research Foundation America told lawmakers that India viewed recent US engagement with Pakistan’s military leadership as “unsettling”, particularly after India’s air strikes inside Pakistan in May. Repeating India’s longstanding allegation of Pakistani support for terrorism — a claim Pakistan rejects — he warned that unresolved tariffs would increasingly be perceived in India as “acts of political hostility”.
Jaishankar, who is son of the Indian external affairs minister, described Washington’s growing relationship with Pakistan as the “second-most significant challenge” to India-US ties, after trade and tariff disputes. Responding to Trump’s assertion that he personally negotiated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, Jaishankar said: “India’s experience is that third-party mediation has often contributed to Pakistan’s adventurism.”
He argued that the United States had long pursued a policy of “de-hyphenation”, engaging both India and Pakistan while avoiding involvement in their disputes, and urged Washington to maintain that approach. He noted that “considerable progress” in the relationship remained possible if disagreements over trade and Pakistan were managed.
At the same time, he acknowledged that defence cooperation continues to expand — including through a new 10-year Defence Framework Agreement, joint production initiatives, the impending launch of the NISAR satellite, and ongoing US support for India’s human spaceflight programme.
Sameer Lalwani of the German Marshall Fund said India remained “poised to become a pole in the international system”, but stressed that New Delhi seeks autonomy, not alignment — a reminder that US expectations often exceed India’s willingness to commit.
Jeff Smith also noted that Washington’s outreach to Pakistan’s military leadership — particularly meetings with Chief of Defence Forces and Cheif of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir — had generated political unease in India, contributing to the perception that the United States was recalibrating its regional priorities.
The overarching message from the hearing was clear: political trust — the element that has long held the US-India partnership together — is now under visible strain. And as Washington reassesses its strategic options in South Asia, Pakistan’s role as a stabilising partner is once again part of the conversation, even if not always acknowledged openly.</p><small>2025-12-12 07:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12103522a280cb0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960684/indias-modi-holds-third-call-with-trump-since-tariff-hike' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Modi holds third call with Trump since tariff hike</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he spoke with US President Donald Trump by phone on Thursday, as New Delhi seeks relief from 50 per cent US tariffs on some of the country’s key exports to punish India for its Russian oil purchases.
“We reviewed the progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments,” Modi said in a post on X.







A White House official confirmed the call took place, but gave no details about what was discussed.
Modi and Trump have spoken three times since Trump doubled tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50pc, hitting exports of textiles, chemicals and food items such as shrimp.
Modi described his conversation with Trump as “warm and engaging” and said their countries would continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity.
Trade negotiations between the two sides collapsed in late July, after India resisted opening its market for US farm products and declined to acknowledge Trump’s role in mediating during a conflict between India and Pakistan in May.
Talks have continued since then, amid signs Indian refiners are cutting Russian oil purchases after the US imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, to pressure Moscow over the war in Ukraine.
US Deputy Trade Representative Rick Switzer met with Indian officials during a two-day visit to New Delhi this week, as New Delhi seeks relief from punitive tariffs imposed by Washington over its Russian oil purchases.
The US Trade Representative’s office had no immediate comment on those meetings.
It was unclear if a trade deal could be hammered out before the end of the year, said one administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Ryan Majerus, a former senior US Commerce Department official now with the King & Spalding law firm, said he expected a deal to be reached with India at some point given its importance in the global economy.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was in New Delhi on a state visit last week. He offered India uninterrupted fuel supplies and challenged US pressure on India to not buy Russian fuel.
Indian exports to the US fell nearly 9pc year-on-year in October to $6.31 billion from $6.91bn a year ago, though they were higher than $5.47bn in September, Indian government data showed.
Washington is also pushing India to lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers on US goods and open its market to American farm products, including soybean and grain sorghum.</p><small>2025-12-12 05:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12093809d6a705f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960635/basant-for-3-days-and-in-lahore-only' target='_blank'><strong>Basant for 3 days and in Lahore only</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari has clarified that there will be only one three-day Basant event in Lahore and not anywhere else in Punjab.
“Basant festivities are officially scheduled for Feb 6, 7, and 8 in Lahore alone and kite flying on any other dates will not be permitted under any circumstances,” she said on Thursday.
“If Lahorites demonstrate responsibility this year, the festival could potentially be celebrated across Punjab next year,” she added.
Last week, the Punjab government lifted the ban on Basant celebrations thro­ugh an ordinance — the Punjab Kite Flying Ordinance 2025.

May be extended across Punjab next year if Lahorites show responsible behaviour: Azma

The festival was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
Azma Bokhari said Basant would be celebrated strictly under rules and regulations, and every kite and string used during the festival would be officially registered.
“Kites will carry QR codes, while manufacturers, string makers, and sellers will also be registered and licensed. Only licensed individuals will be authorised to sell kites.”
The minister said the purpose of this system was to ensure that substandard and metallic strings were completely eliminated, as unsafe strings in the past turned this beautiful festival into a dangerous one and caused loss of life.
She emphasised that the Punjab government would not allow anyone to put lives at risk.
“In connection with Basant, free safety antennas are being provided by the traffic police for motorcyclists to prevent accidents during the festival days.”
Azma said on the direction of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz this vibrant cultural festival was being revived responsibly so that Lahore could once again reclaim its cultural and traditional identity.
She said the information and culture department was also organising special cultural programmes for Basant, featuring music, food, kite flying, and a variety of other activities.

Although the move is being described as temporary, it ends weeks of speculation about the relocation of the IHC to its former building in Sector G-10. It also dims the hopes of FSC judges to retain their coveted spot on Constitution Avenue, opposite the Supreme Court.
The decision to relocate the two courts was taken by the federal government, followed by the issuance of a notification on Thursday.
“In exercise of the powers conferred by Article 175B(2) of the Constitution, the President is pleased to temporarily house the Federal Constitutional Court in the Federal Shariat Court building situated on Constitution Avenue, Islamabad, and the Federal Shariat Court in the Islamabad High Court building,” reads government notification No. F.14(7)/2025-A.II.
Copies of the notification have also been sent to the Secretary to the President, Secretary to the Prime Minister, and the registrars of the FCC, Supreme Court, IHC, FSC, as well as to the Secretary to the Attorney General for Pakistan and the Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice.

The displaced forum will be shifted into premises of Islamabad High Court

Last month, the government had decided to set up offices for FCC judges within the IHC despite space constraints, as FSC judges had reportedly refused to vacate their building for the newly established constitutional court.
Consequently, FCC was temporarily set up inside the IHC after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.

 

A senior FCC official, who requested anonymity, told Dawn that the shifting of the FCC to the FSC building would begin as soon as possible and could be completed by the end of the current week.
The present FSC building contains seven courtrooms with seven judges’ chambers. The FCC currently has seven judges, with the strength expected to gradually increase to 13 in due course.
While FCC judges have been holding court inside the IHC, some of them were using the spacious chambers designated for judges in the Supreme Court building.
Since the FCC’s administrative arrangements were incomplete at its inception, IHC courtroom No.2 was converted into the main courtroom of the FCC chief justice. Meanwhile, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muha­mmad Sarfraz Dogar continues to sit in his original courtroom No. 1, located above the FCC’s main courtroom.
With the FSC reportedly unwilling to hand over its building and the FCC facing multiple teething problems while sharing space with the IHC, the FCC had effectively become the only court in the country without a proper building of its own.
Earlier, rumours were making rounds that the IHC might return to its old G-10 premises early next year may – possibly in January – given the difficulties faced by litigants entering the Red Zone.
Speculation dies
However, speculation started to die down when IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar visited the G-10 building earlier this month to evaluate its suitability by inspecting several renovated sections, including the Chief Justice Block.

A United Nations Security Council resolution, adopted on Nov 17, authorised a Board of Peace and countries working with it to establish a temporary ISF for Gaza.
US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz, who visited Israel this week, told PM Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials that the Trump administration is going to lead the ISF and appoint a two-star general as its commander, Axios said.
The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment, and the news agency could not independently verify the report.
President Donald Trump told rep­o­rters on Wednesday that an annou­ncement about which world leaders will serve on the Gaza Board of Peace should be made early next year.
The resolution, drafted by the US, described the Board of Peace as a transitional administration “that will set the framework, and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza in line with Trump’s 20-point peace plan to end the war with Hamas.
Israel and Hamas agreed in October to the first phase of a Trump-brokered hostage and ceasefire deal.
The agreement marked a major step forward for efforts to end the two-year war in Gaza in which more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed. Under the deal, Hamas handed over prisoners seized in the deadly attacks that started the assault. Both, however, have repeatedly accused each other of violating the truce.
Both sides remain far apart on major issues, including Hamas’ disarmament, the governance of post-war Gaza and the composition and mandate of an international security force in the enclave.
The US president has also been working to expand the Abraham Accords, an initiative from his first term that aims to normalize diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab nations.
Trump initially pursued talks with Iran over its nuclear programme. Israel had launched an aerial war on Iran on June 13 and pressed Trump to join in. He did on June 22, bombing Iranian nuclear sites. He then pressed Israel and Iran to join a ceasefire that Qatar mediated.
Pakistan’s stance
Separately, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also addressed the creation of the ISF.
During his weekly press briefing on Thursday, the Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed that while the situation in Gaza was a key topic of discussion during a recent visit by the President of Indonesia, Pakistan had made no commitment to join the ISF so far.
“This is a sovereign decision of any country,” the spokesperson said. “As far as Pakistan is concerned, such a decision has not been taken as yet.”
The spokesperson also recalled a recent conversation between Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, where Gaza was a primary topic.
The two had strongly condemned Israel’s unilateral plan to restrict the Rafah crossing for the exit only of Gaza residents, deeming it a clear violation of the peace plan and a move that undermines humanitarian access,the spoksperson said.
Members of the eight-nation Muslim bloc have already expressed “deep concern” over Israeli statements about opening the Rafah Crossing in only one direction.

MOHMAND/NORTH WAZIR­ISTAN: At least eight suspected militants were killed and four others injured in two drone strikes carried out by the security forces in Mohmand district, while a school was blown up by unidentified militants in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil on Wednesday night.
The drone strikes occurred at night on December 10, targeting Alingar, a remote village of Mohmand district near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. No police posts or government installations are present in the area.
However, a police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the intelligence-based operation involved two separate drone attacks that killed over eight militants.
“The strikes were precise and aimed at a gathering of militants,” the source said, adding that surveillance and verification efforts were ongoing to ascertain the exact number of casualties and identities of those killed.

Primary school blown up in Mir Ali; major portion of building destroyed

The area remains under heightened security, with forces conducting searches to prevent any retaliatory actions.
There was no official word, either from the district administration or Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), about the incident.
School blown up
Separately, in North Waziristan, unidentified attackers blew up a government primary school in the Khushali area in Mir Ali, putting the education of more than 600 children in jeopardy and spreading fear across the locality.
Officials said that unknown attackers had planted explosives inside the school building and detonated them at night.
The blast, which was heard miles away, destroyed a significant portion of the school building.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far.
Education department officials confirmed that more than 600 students were enrolled in the institution, which served as the only functional primary school in the area.
Authorities said the remaining sections of the building had been cordoned off, while an emergency plan for alternate learning arrangements was under consideration.
Local elders and parents expressed deep concern, calling attacks on educational institutions “a direct assault on the future of children”.
“This school was the only beacon of hope for our children. Its destruction has shocked the entire community,” an area elder said.
The incident comes weeks after Cadet College Wana in the Lower South Waziristan district came under a terrorist attack.
In October, an explosion at a girls’ primary school in Lakki Marwat partially damaged the building.
Last year in May, a private girls’ school was blown up by unidentified militants in Shewa tehsil of North Waziristan district.

Federal Secretary of Energy (Power Division) Muhammad Fakhre Alam Irfan told the committee that Discos repeatedly submitted files that did not meet the audit department’s requirements. He noted that audit objections dating back 30 to 40 years remained unresolved for the same reason, as documents provided were consistently incomplete or below required standards.
The PAC meeting was convened to review audit paras related to the Ministry of Energy (Power Division). In the absence of Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan, members agreed to nominate a chairperson from among themselves on rotational basis for this and all future requisitioned meetings. Thursday’s session was presided over by Shahida Begum.
The PAC expressed strong dismay over audit of Discos, revealing that a huge amount of Rs10.256 billion was credited to consumers in different types of adjustments. The committee learnt that while relief was only allowed to new connections, huge amounts were credited to consumers on bills of already running consumers on their accumulated units of more than two months without taking actions against meter readers, meter inspectors and SDOs who were responsible to record and charge the units to consumers on their actual monthly consumption.
Of all Discos, the total amount credited without units by Lesco was the highest, Rs7.94bn. The total amount credited without units by Gepco was the second highest, Rs916 million.
Members were particularly perturbed over the fact that despite directions from the committee over a year ago to fix responsibility, Discos failed to take action and hand down punishments.
Secretary of power division attributed the undue generation of revenue through overbilling amounting to Rs8.44 billion to dereliction of duty and inefficiency of Discos to provide quality records to the audit department.

 

In another audit para, the meeting observed that 7, 694 consumers of different categories extended the load of their energy connections illegally without approval of competent authority. Losses incurred following the unauthorised extension of load by consumers stood at Rs2.51bn. The field formations neither disconnected the energy connections nor regularised the un-authorised extended load in violation of rules.
Further losses incurred included non-recovery of energy charges from unregistered/kunda connections which stood at Rs1.25bn.
The amount was debited against 7,510 unregistered/kunda connections.
The meeting observed that these unregistered connections were neither regularised and brought into billing cycle, nor outstanding energy charges from both categories were recovered.

The website Trumpcard.gov, complete with an “apply now” button, allows interested applicants to pay a $15,000 fee to the Department of Homeland Security for speedy processing.
After going through a background check or vetting process, applicants must then make a “contribution” — the website also calls it a “gift” — of $1 million to get the visa, similar to a “Green Card,” which allows them to live and work in the United States.
“Basically, it’s a Green Card, but much better. Much more powerful, a much stronger path,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “A path is a big deal. Have to be great people.”
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said some 10,000 people have already signed up for the gold card during a pre-registration period, and he expected many more to do so.
“I would expect over time that we’d sell, you know, thousands of these cards and raise, you know, billions, billions of dollars,” Lutnick said.

ISLAMABAD: Having missed a total of 11 performance indicators under its IMF programme, the government has agreed to 11 new targets, including additional tax measures and expenditure cuts from early next month, to make up for rising revenue shortfalls and keep the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on track.
Commitment to the new or revised structural benchmarks, together with completion of two “prior actions”, enabled the conclusion of a staff-level agreement on the second review of the EFF and its approval by the IMF Executive Board for the disbursement of about $1.2bn, reveal fresh documents released by the Fund on Thursday.
The government confirmed at the outset that it estimated a shortfall from the underperformance of the captive power levy of Rs104bn, which it said would be covered by a reduction in power subsidies made possible through lower circular debt accumulation relative to budget estimates.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has already missed its collection target by about Rs430bn in the first five months of FY26.
“Should FBR’s revenues continue to fall short of expectations in the second quarter of FY26 (end of current month), and if other tax revenues are insufficient to bridge the gap, we will — in consultation with IMF staff — increase federal excise duty (FED) on fertilisers and pesticides by five percentage points, introduce FED on high-value sugary items, and move items from the 8th GST schedule to the general GST regime,” Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb assured the Fund, implying full 18pc GST on those items.
He further committed that “if by the end of the second quarter of FY26 there is a revenue shortfall due to the implementation of the National Tariff Policy, we will postpone an equivalent amount of expenditure until the last quarter of FY26”.
Pakistan has also sought waivers for already missed targets in terms of performance criteria, str­u­ctural benchmarks and indicators. The documents confirm that publication of a governance and corruption assessment report was set as a “prior action” for the latest $1.2bn disbursement to the State Bank of Pakistan, while an­­other prior action related to recapitalisation measures for a weak bank.
In all, the authorities missed one out of six qualitative performance criteria, five structural benchmarks and four indicative targets — some of which were subsequently met after the original deadlines or extended.
The waivers pertain to non-ob­servance of the end-June quantitative performance criterion (QPC) on Benazir Income Support Prog­r­amme (BISP) spending, and a mo­­dification of three end-December QPCs: the ceiling on the general government primary budget deficit, the floor on the number of new tax returns (to account for seasonality) in line with the agreed FY26 primary surplus, and the BISP floor on targeted cash transfers.
Under the roadmap agreed with the Fund, the FBR will complete all actions required to fully implement at least three priority areas by the end of March 2026, including any necessary subordinate legislation, staff hiring and allocation, and initial KPI reporting.
The government has also committed to publish an initial study by the end of June 2026 assessing the fiscal costs and effectiveness of incentives for all existing Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Export Processing Zones (EPZs), and to phase out all such incentives by 2035.
A Tax Policy Office has been created and will now handle all tax policy functions, including the development and publication of a medium-term tax reform strategy by the end of December 2026. The new strategy is intended to reduce reliance on ad hoc revenue measures and ensure revenue-neutral reforms that deliver sustained growth in tax receipts over the medium term.
Provinces have pledged to realise the full potential of agriculture income tax by fully operationalising information-sharing between the FBR and provincial tax auth­o­rities, and by ensuring that all services — except for a limited list of exemptions — are subject to GST.
The authorities will also conduct a comprehensive study of bottlenecks in the local currency bond market and publish an action plan to address identified weaknesses by the end of September 2026. They have further undertak­­en to strengthen efforts to make formal channels more attractive than the hawala market, without resorting to fiscal incentives. To this end, the SBP plans to conduct a comprehensive assessment of remittance costs by the end of May 2026 to improve cross-border payments.
At the same time, the authorities will seek to deepen the foreign exchange market, including through greater reliance on interbank trading and exchange rate flexibility, to support external sustainability.
On the power sector, the government has promised to complete the bidding process for the first round of privatisation of three distribution companies (Dis­c­­os) early in 2026 and to move ahead with the rest.
It has committed to completing the preconditions for the privatisation of Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) and Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco) by the end of December 2026. The authorities also plan to advance the privatisation of public generation companies, finalise transmission network restructuring and launch a wholesale electricity market.
Following amendments to the asset declaration framework, pre­p­­arations are underway to publish, by the end of December 2026, the asset declarations of high-lev­­el federal civil servants on a government website. The framework will also extend to high-level provincial officials and allow banks full access to their declarations.
Based on an institutional-level risk assessment, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) will lead and coordinate action plans to mitigate vulnerabilities in the 10 agencies identified as having the highest risks by the end of October 2026.
Amendments to most of the nine statutory state-owned enterprise (SOE) laws are expected to be submitted to the National Asse­mbly before the end of August 2026. In parallel, the government is moving to amend the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) law by the end of March 2026 to clarify its mandate, ensure transparent and competitive divestment and procurement procedures, introduce fiscal safeguards, and subject SWF-owned SOEs to the SOE law. Operationalisation of the SWF will remain on hold until these amendments are adopted.

ISLAMABAD: Amid concerns by Pakistan regarding the use of Afghan soil by militants to launch attacks inside the country, over 1,000 Afghan clerics recently passed a resolution apparently aimed at discouraging the flow of militancy from its territory to neighbouring states.
The resolution, adopted by leading Afghan clerics, pledges that their country’s soil will not be used against other countries.
In case of violations, the “Islamic Emirate has the right to take necessary measures against them”, it said, noting that Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada had not permitted any Afghan national “to travel abroad for military activity, so if anyone violates this… The Islamic Emirate must take necessary measures to prevent such people”.
The resolution, though welcomed by Pakistan, elicited only cautious optimism, given the Taliban’s track record on militant groups. Terming it a “positive development”, the Foreign Office reiterated its demand for written assurances from the interim Afghan government that its soil would not be used against Pakistan.
The document, described as a significant development by experts in Pakistan and Afghanistan, comes from independent clerics, without any formal endorsement from the Taliban government, nor does it explicitly name Pakistan.
However, it does say that whoever would “conduct military operations beyond Afghanistan’s borders would be considered a rebel against the state”. This would also be considered “as a violation of the emir’s orders” and would be a punishable offence, the resolution said.
But it remains unclear who would enforce such a punishment, as the group of religious scholars who have issued it have no legally binding authority.
However, the timing of the declaration seems significant, coming at a time when Islamabad is asking Kabul to rein in militants, particularly the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), who it blames for perpetrating terror attacks in the country.
Pakistan has asked Kabul to issue a decree — in the name of supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada — to stop such incursions; a demand that was reiterated during a series of negotiations in Qatar, Turkey and Saudi Arabia over the past few months.
However, according to officials privy to the meetings, the Taliban had asked Pakistan to approach their own scholars for such an edict.
Afghan religious scholar Sheikh Faqirullah Faeq, who was present at the Kabul University gathering, termed the resolution “very significant” and appeared hopeful about its outcome.
He said all senior clerics of major religious schools participated in the day-long meeting of the clerics, adding that there were 34 major jihadi seminaries in Afghanistan and all participated in the event.
“Teachers have influence on those Taliban who go outside the country to fight. Some people say certain circles go to Pakistan or Gaza and other areas.
The supreme leader does not want a neighbour to have problems because of us, and I hope this resolution will work,” Sheikh Faeq told Dawn.
FO’s ‘cautious optimism’
In the absence of official backing, it is unclear how it will be enforced — a concern also echoed by the Foreign Office.
“If the leadership of the Afghan Taliban regime or certain segments of Afghan society realise the gravity of the matter that their soil is being used not just by the banned TTP/FAK/FAH but also by their own nationals to perpetrate terrorism in Pakistan, such realisation is positive,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said during his weekly briefing.
“One important aspect is that commitments made in the past by the Afghan Taliban regime have not been fulfilled. This is exactly why, during the talks held with the mediation efforts of our brotherly countries, Pakistan insisted on written assurances from the Afghan side,” the spokesperson said.
Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, however, told the clerics’ gathering in Kabul on Thursday that the interim government had the right to stop anyone using Afghan soil for militant activities in other countries. “If anyone violates this, ulema favour action against them,” he said while alluding to the resolution. He said it was obligatory for all Muslims in Afghanistan to obey the resolution.
‘Positive development’
Despite expressing concern about its impact, the resolution is being seen as a positive development by observers in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s former special representative for Afghanistan Asif Durrani, in a brief message sent to Dawn, said the timing of the resolution was important.
“One has to look at the timing of the resolution when everything seems to be frozen,” he said, adding that the document was “clearly intended” to convey a message to Pakistan regarding reconciliation.
“Hopefully, the TTP, which owes allegiance to the Taliban supreme leader…will now submit to the collective wisdom of the Afghan Taliban ulema and surrender arms,” he said, asking the government of Pakistan to welcome the resolution.
Analyst and journalist Sami Yousafzai said the move would be a positive one for Pakistan, which has repeatedly asked for an Afghan ‘fatwa’ or edict.
“Implementation would be a little difficult. But it would work if the Taliban leaders opt for punishment, arrest and jail those Afghans who join the Pakistani groups,” he told Dawn.
He said Afghans’ participation in attacks in Pakistan has increased, especially of the Afghans from Logar and Maidan Wardak provinces — both provinces are located near the capital Kabul.
“So, the Taliban are also worried over the growing number of Afghans participating. This is a good beginning and a positive message to Pakistan,” he said, adding that the Afghan Taliban’s intelligence can monitor the movement of their own people.
According to the FO spokesperson, Pakistan will adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ policy to evaluate this document, since the Taliban had failed to live up to their promises in the past.

Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsaas attended the Supreme Court hearing of rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts. The diplomat’s presence during the court proceedings generated a lot of chatter on social media.
The ministry, in its statement, said the Scandinavian country’s top representative was summoned by the additional foreign secretary (Europe). He was informed that his presence breached “diplomatic protocol and relevant international law”.







“Noting that his actions amount to interference in the internal affairs of the country, the Ambassador was urged to adhere to the established norms of diplomatic engagement, as outlined in the relevant articles of the Vienna Convention,” said the statement.
However, Imaan defended the envoy’s presence during the court hearing today on social media.
Responding to a journalist who termed the presence of the ambassador as a “breach of diplomatic norms”, Imaan said, “Who is going to explain to this genius that diplomats routinely observe court proceedings — that is not equivalent to them taking a position on any case.
“This is a standard practice but it’s very clear where the pressure is coming from to malign the ambassador,” she said.







Imaan and her husband are facing a trial under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca) — had moved an application in the SC requesting the urgent hearing of their appeal against the IHC’s refusal to grant interim relief.
The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under Peca.
The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The two have already filed a criminal revision before the IHC challenging the trial proceedings on grounds of due process violations under the CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in their absence.</p><small>2025-12-11 16:20</small></div><hr>
