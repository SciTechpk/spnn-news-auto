<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21085227340ff3c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932160/forced-to-live-in-a-park-evicted-afghans-dread-the-journey-home' target='_blank'><strong>Forced to live in a park, evicted Afghans dread the journey home</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Evicted from their homes and huddling under plastic sheets after heavy rains, Afghan refugees in a park near government offices in Islamabad said they had nowhere to go as Pakistan pressures landlords to expel documented families.
Among them is Samia, 26, a Hazara Shia whose community has long been persecuted at home. She gave birth just three weeks ago.
“I came here when my baby was seven days old, and now it has been 22 days we have no food, and my baby was sick but there was no doctor,” she said, wearing damp clothes and shoes caked in mud as she cuddled her son, Daniyal, whose body bore a rash.
The UN says Pakistan has begun deporting documented Afghans before a Sept 1, deadline that could force more than a million to leave.

UNHCR trying to press Islamabad to create registration mechanism, reiterates opposition to refoulement

The action comes despite about 1.3 million holding refugee registration documents, while 750,000 have Afghan identity cards issued in Pakistan.
Samia now lives on the park’s wet ground, among 200 families who cook, sleep and dry their belongings there after nights of rain. Plastic sheets serve as makeshift shelters, and children and parents spend their days battling mud, sun and hunger.
 
 

Families pool the little money they have to buy potatoes or squash, cooking small portions over open fires to share with several people. The women use the washroom in a nearby mosque.
Sahera Babur, 23, another member of the Hazara community, who is nine months pregnant, spoke with tears in her eyes.
“If my baby is born in this situation, what will happen to me and my child?” she said, adding that police had told her landlord to evict her family because they were Afghan.
Dozens of policemen stood at the edge of the park in Pakistan’s capital when Reuters visited, watching the camp. Refugees said officers regularly told them to leave or risk being taken away.
Police denied harassment. Jawad Tariq, a deputy inspector general, said refugees were only asked to leave voluntarily or move to holding centres.
Refugees say they have been left in limbo for years.  “UNHCR gave us promises but they have not visited us,” said Dewa Hotak, 22, an Afghan and former television journalist.
The agency’s spokesperson in Pakistan, Qaiser Khan Afridi, called the situation  “precarious”, adding that Afghans unable to regularise their stay faced arrest, deportation and homelessness.
He said the agency was pressing Islamabad to create a registration mechanism and reiterated its call not to return people to a country where their lives may be in danger.
Many at the camp say they cannot go back to Afghanistan because of the risks.
Ahmad Zia Faiz, a former adviser in Afghanistans interior ministry, said he feared reprisals for serving in the previous government, adding,  “If we return to Afghanistan, there is a risk of being killed.”
 
 

Pakistan, host to millions of Afghans since the 1979 Soviet invasion, has stepped up expulsions under a 2023 crackdown, blaming Afghans for crime and militancy, charges rejected by Kabul.
Neighbouring Iran’s plan to deport more than a million more adds to a refugee return crisis aid groups call the biggest since the Taliban takeover in 2021.

He now appears highly optimistic about being able to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine soon to bring to an end the bloody conflict between the two countries — “…if I can get to heaven, this will be one of the reasons”, the American leader told the media ahead of the meeting he hosted for the leaders of Ukraine and seven European countries at the White House.
One of Trump’s campaign promises was to end the war that began more than three and a half years ago when Russia invaded Ukraine. But resolving one of the largest conflicts to have occurred in recent years may not be as easy as Trump thinks. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed so far on both sides in the conflict, which has virtually turned it into a European war. The Russian invasion was seen as the most serious security threat to the entire West and has united Europe more than at any other time in recent history.
America, too, was one of the largest suppliers of arms to Ukraine before Trump broke away from the ranks, hugely weakening the anti-Russia alliance. His initial efforts failed to get the two sides to agree to a ceasefire. The terms of peace were too vague to be accepted by either side.
While Moscow is not willing to cede the territories it has occupied during the war and accept Nato’s presence in the region, Ukraine is not prepared to make any compromise on its sovereignty. The trust gap is too wide to be bridged. Trump’s threat to completely stop America’s arms supply to Ukraine will not work as Europe stands solidly behind the country. In fact, European military support for Kyiv has increased significantly in recent months.

The Alaska meeting has cemented the rapprochement between Russia and the US.

Meanwhile, Russia intensified its military offensive, occupying more territories over the past few months. It was apparent that even the multiple sanctions clamped on it by the US and its Western allies failed to deter Moscow. Some reports suggest that Russia has not only recouped its military losses but has also expanded its military capabilities. Russia has reportedly lost 250,000 soldiers so far, but even such a large number of casualties has not affected its war efforts.
After an initial setback, Trump has revived peace efforts in recent weeks. He sent his special envoy Steve Witkoff to Moscow earlier this month to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting took place days before Trump’s deadline for Russia to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face economic sanctions. The three-hour meeting with Putin proved very productive. A White House official said the meeting went well and that Russia was eager to continue engaging with the US. The Moscow parleys paved the way for a Trump-Putin summit soon after.
 
 

Last week, the US president met his Russian counterpart for the first time since 2019. Trump welcomed Putin back on the world stage with a red carpet welcome when he landed in Alaska. It was Trump’s typical style of diplomacy. It was a remarkable moment for the Russian leader who was spurned by Western nations after Moscow launched the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin’s international travel has since been largely limited to nations friendly to Russia. The International Criminal Court had issued a warrant for his arrest on war crime charges.
The Alaska summit failed to produce a ceasefire agreement, as was expected by Trump, but was seen as a victory for Putin. His grand welcome on American soil was beyond expectations. Within a moment, Putin has gone from being a pariah in the West to a partner and friend of the US. The meeting ended earlier than expected without any agreement, yet Trump appeared satisfied.
In post-summit comments, Trump asserted that ‘great progress’ was made in the talks. But he did not share any details on the question of whether any concrete steps were being taken to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. There was no mention of any of the ‘severe consequences’ that Trump had threatened would follow if a ceasefire was not reached. Putin made it clear that Moscow was not willing to initiate an immediate ceasefire as demanded by the US and European leaders. There were also some reports that Russia would require Ukraine to give up some of its territory in exchange for ending the violence.
There may not be any tangible agreement on peace in Ukraine but the Alaska meeting has certainly cemented the rapprochement between Russia and the US. Both leaders agreed to continue the peace process. In his comments at the press talk, Putin made no promises, no concessions and no compromises. He appeared to be in full command of the situation.
Before wrapping up his remarks, he referenced one of the American president’s frequent talking points — that the conflict in Ukraine would have never started had Trump been in power then. It seemed the comment was enough to massage Trump’s ego. Putin looked at Trump and said in English: “Next time in Moscow.” Caught by surprise, Trump replied “Oh, that’s an interesting one.”
 
 

Days after the Alaska summit Trump hosted a round-table meeting for the Ukrainian president and seven other European leaders at the White House. The major concern of the European leaders is Ukraine’s security. They want security guarantees that oblige members to defend an ally under attack, meaning that Ukraine should be provided with similar protection even without formal Nato membership. They argue that a security agreement should be made a part of any peace deal. Russia has made it very clear that it will not accept any Western security cover for Ukraine that would threaten its own security.
Notwithstanding Trump’s desire to end the Russia-Ukraine war, which he believes will earn him a place in heaven besides winning him a Nobel Peace Prize, there is little hope of his wishes materialising at least in the near future.

Rain-related disasters have been witnessed elsewhere in Pakistan as well, particularly KP and GB, with hundreds of deaths reported in the former. But Karachi’s issues of urban flooding are unique in many ways, exacerbated by bad planning and unchecked growth. The mayor has attributed the disaster to ‘climate change’.
 
 

While the latter phenomenon has indeed contributed to erratic weather patterns, global warming alone is not the key culprit responsible for Karachi’s rain-related plight — by now, a grim annual spectacle — as soon as the monsoon clouds arrive.
Flooded streets, people trapped on roads for hours and lack of electricity for long periods during stifling weather conditions were some of the outcomes of Tuesday’s wet spell. Indeed, many parts of the city received a high volume of precipitation, but even less intense rain spells have previously brought the wheels of urban life to a grinding halt.
Disturbing visuals of motorists and bikers trapped on thoroughfares resembling raging torrents, and water entering houses and apartment blocks show that something is seriously wrong with Karachi’s drainage system. And the fixes applied to the problem do not seem to be working.
For example, a drainage system, reportedly costing hundreds of millions of rupees, was installed in the upmarket DHA area, but failed to stop flooding in the neighbourhood. DHA is controlled by a cantonment board, beyond the jurisdiction of civilian agencies. People living in low-income, low-lying areas were similarly affected.
 
 

From the august Supreme Court and independent urban experts to people venting their rage on social media — all have expressed their dismay over the fact that Karachi lacks a proper drainage system, and that the monsoon-related destruction is repeated year after year.
The fact is that the problem has been decades in the making, and it would be unfair to blame the present government alone. Successive administrations have neglected Karachi or paid lip service to its civic issues, as encroachers and land grabbers have steadily disfigured its face. Karachi’s urban issues, including the faulty drainage, are complex, and decades of neglect cannot be undone in weeks or months.
But a start must be made somewhere and the key problems of the city, primarily solid waste disposal, provision of water, a working sewerage system, fair land management, etc, which are all intertwined, must be addressed by the city’s managers and independent experts.
Moreover, a better LG system, which responds to local issues promptly and is answerable to the people, is essential to resolve Karachi’s civic woes, as multiple agencies controlling land in the city also complicates civic governance.

Nato military leaders had a “great, candid discussion” during a video conference on the results of recent talks surrounding the conflict in Ukraine, the chair of the alliance’s military committee said on Wednesday.
“On #Ukraine, we confirmed our support. Priority continues to be a just, credible and durable peace,” Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone wrote in a post on social media platform X.
 






Meanwhile, a small group of military leaders is continuing discussions in Washington to work out options for security guarantees for Ukraine, a Western official told Reuters on Wednesday, shortly after a bigger virtual meeting wrapped up. The source said US General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was holding the talks that also involved around half a dozen other Nato chiefs of defence.

Russia says it must be part talks on security guarantees

The Western official said there were no results yet since the topic of security guarantees had not been discussed in detail at a video conference of all Nato chiefs of defence earlier in the day.
The source expected further meetings of the chiefs of defence in the broader format to be called, in order to discuss any options worked out in the smaller group.
No time frame has been set for discussions as the final decision will lie with political leaders, the official said.
Few details leaked on the virtual meeting of military chiefs from Nato’s 32 member countries. But on Tuesday evening, Dan Caine held talks with European military chiefs on the “best options for a potential Ukraine peace deal,” a US defence official told AFP.
US President Donald Trump brought Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders to the White House on Monday, three days after his landmark encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.
Trump, long a fierce critic of the billions of dollars in US support to Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, earlier said European nations were “willing to put people on the ground” to secure any settlement. He ruled out sending US troops but suggested it would provide air support instead.
But while Trump said Putin had agreed to meet Zelensky and accept some Western security guarantees for Ukraine, Kyiv and Western capitals have responded cautiously, as many of the details remain vague.
Russia wants in
Russia said on Wednesday it had to be part of any discussion on security guarantees for Ukraine and downplayed the likelihood of an imminent summit with Zelensky, tempering hopes for a quick peace deal.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that “seriously discussing security guarantees without the Russian Federation is a utopia, a road to nowhere”.
Lavrov also cast doubt on an imminent meeting between the sworn enemies, saying that any summit between Putin and Zelensky “must be prepared in the most meticulous way” so it does not lead to a “deterioration” of the situation surrounding the conflict.

An article in the Washington Post described America’s recent thaw with Islamabad as unexpected, amid a sharp deterioration in relations with New Delhi.
When Trump won reelection in November, many in Pakistan braced for a rough ride. In his first term, he had openly favoured India, castigating Pakistan for “deceit” and sheltering “terrorists”.
Yet six months into his second term — and after the most serious India Pakistan flareup in decades — the tables appear to have turned.
Trade spats and a personal falling out with Narendra Modi have pushed US India ties into crisis, while Pakistan has edged into Washington’s good books, WaPo noted.
In August, a frustrated Trump criticised India’s oil purchases from Russia, slapping 50pc tarrifs on New Delhi and launching a fierce rebuke: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Islamabad secured a 19pc tariff rate — low by regional standards, and far beneath the 50pc levy slapped on India.
Trump has also boasted of joint plans to explore Pakistan’s oil, while Pakistani officials have pitched cryptocurrency ventures and access to rare minerals.
 
 

Behind the scenes, Islamabad has hired Javelin Advisors, led by longtime Trump associates George A Sorial and Keith Schiller, and cultivated family networks.
World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm backed by the Trump family, signed a letter of intent with Pakistan’s Crypto Council in April; the visiting US delegation included Zachary Witkoff, son of real estate developer Steve Witkoff, now Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East.
But some former officials worry that Pakistan’s leadership has been blinded by its recent successes and is not attuned to the risks. “Flattery is not a strategy — it’s not long-term,” warned Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States.
According to WaPo, the army, widely viewed as Pakistan’s ultimate power broker, took charge of the outreach, dispatching Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Washington during inauguration week to soothe Congress.
Still, there are ambitions in Islamabad to lock in gains — notably access to American defence kit from attack helicopters to naval hardware. “We can’t go back to the golden years of the 1950s,” said former ambassador Masood Khan, “but we can build a paradigm that benefits both the United States and Pakistan.”

The finance division issued a notification suggesting the withdrawal of a directive for cabinet members to donate a month’s salary.
However, another notification from the same division stated that the one-day pay of senior bureaucrats from Grades 19 to 22 will be donated to the flood victims.
Meanwhile, officials at the Prime Minister’s Office clarified that the decision to donate one month’s salary of cabinet members has not been withdrawn, and that their salaries will be donated to the flood-hit people through another notification issued by the cabinet division.
The cabinet division’s notification said: “The prime minister has been pleased to direct that all federal ministers, ministers of state, advisers and special assistants to the prime minister shall contribute one month’s salary for flood relief.”
A senior official at the Prime Minister’s Office said the apparent contradiction stemmed from the fact that the finance division deals with the salaries of bureaucrats, while the cabinet division oversees the salaries and perks of cabinet members.
 
 

“Although the finance division’s notification gave the impression that the prime minister’s announ­ce­ment had been withdrawn, ministers will definitely donate their monthly pay to the flood victims,” the official said.
Another notification from the finance division clarified that contributions would be calculated on gross pay and allowances before deductions and would not be included in the taxable emoluments of officers and officials.

The approval of the E1 project, which would bisect the occupied West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem, was announced last week by Smotrich and received final go-ahead from a defence ministry planning commission on Wednesday, he said.
Restarting the project could further isolate Israel, which has watched some Western allies frustrated by its continuation and planned escalation of the Gaza war announce they may recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September.
“With E1 we are delivering finally on what has been promised for years,” Smotrich, an ultra-nationalist in the ruling right-wing coalition, said in a statement. “The Palestinian state is being erased from the table, not with slogans but with actions.”

Approves strategy to conquer Gaza City, calls up reservists

The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the announcement on Wednesday, saying that the E1 settlement would isolate Palestinian communities living in the area and undermines the possibility of a two-state solution.
British foreign minister David Lammy said on Wednesday that the widely condemned Israeli settlement plan would, if implemented, constitute a breach of international law and risk dividing a future Palestinian state.
“If implemented, it would divide a Palestinian state in two, mark a flagrant breach of international law and critically undermine the two-state solution,” Lammy said in a post on X, calling on the Israeli government to reverse the decision.
 






A German government spokesperson commenting on the announcement told reporters on Wednesday that settlement construction violates international law and “hinders a negotiated two-state solution and an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank”.
 
 

The two-state solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict envisages a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, existing side by side with Israel.
Western capitals and campaign groups have opposed the settlement project due to concerns that it could undermine a future peace deal with the Palestinians.
The plan for E1, located adjacent to Maale Adumim and frozen in 2012 and 2020 amid objections from the US and European governments, involves construction of about 3,400 new housing units.
Infrastructure work could begin within a few months, and house building in about a year, according to Israeli advocacy group Peace Now, which tracks settlement activity in the West Bank.
Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law.
Plan to ‘conquer’ Gaza City
Meanwhile, Israel’s defence minister approved a plan on Wednesday for the conquest of Gaza City and authorised the call-up of around 60,000 reservists, piling pressure on Hamas as mediators push for a ceasefire.
Defence Minister Israel Katz’s move, confirmed to AFP by a spokesperson, came as mediators awaited an official Israeli response on their latest proposal.
While mediator Qatar had expressed guarded optimism over the latest proposal, a senior Israeli official said the government stood firm on its call for the release of all prisoners in any agreement.
The framework that Hamas had approved proposes an initial 60-day truce, a staggered prisoner release, the freeing of some Palestinian prisoners and provisions allowing for the entry of aid into Gaza.
On the ground in Gaza City on Wednesday, Mustafa Qazzaat, head of the emergency committee in the Gaza municipality, described the situation as “catastrophic”.
He told AFP that “large numbers” of people were fleeing their neighbourhoods, with the majority of those displaced “on the roads and streets without shelter”.

PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja told reporters that they had received a message from party founder Imran Khan nominating Mr Achakzai as the NA opposition leader and Senator Swati as the Senate opposition leader. Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan, a PTI-led opposition alliance, is also headed by the PkMAP chief.
Mr Achakzai is a veteran political figure from Balochistan, particularly known for his outspoken stance against the establishment. If all goes as per Mr Khan’s plan, this would be the first time the PkMAP chief will be leading the opposition in the lower house of parliament.
Swati, a PTI veteran who joined the party before the 2013 elections, was jailed and allegedly tortured for his tweet against then army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa. He was also embroiled in a controversy after the PTI abruptly postponed its Aug 22 gathering in Tarnol last year, prompting Aleema Khan to question his loyalties.

Imran seeks five names for Punjab Assembly Opp leader, orders party meeting for by-polls decision

About the opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly, he said, Mr Khan had sought five names from the parliamentary party to make his decision. It may be noted that the Election Commission of Pakistan had disqualified NA Opposition Leader Omar Ayub, Senate leader Shibli Faraz, and Punjab opposition leader Malik Ahmad Bhachar following their conviction in the May 9 cases.
The instructions from Imran Khan came through party lawyer Ali Bukhari, who met the former premier in Adiala jail, said sources.
“During the conversation, Imran Khan shared the extremely difficult conditions he is currently enduring in custody. He noted that, in violation of jail regulations, he has been provided only four books over the past month, and is being denied access to television, newspapers, and even a private medical doctor, among other basic facilities,” the sources said.
They said Imran Khan also asked the party’s public committee to convene immediately and deliberate on whether or not to contest by-elections.
It is worth mentioning that political observers believed that the PTI would be making a “strategic and political mistake” if it did not nominate new opposition leaders in the Senate and the National Assembly, even on a temporary basis.
They believed that a failure to fill these posts would not only provide the government an opportunity to establish a complete hold in parliament, but would also give them carte blanche in appointments to key constitutional offices.
On August 8, after the ouster of its opposition leaders in both houses of parliament, the PTI declared it would not nominate new opposition leaders and would challenge the decision in a court of law.
Following the move, Omar Ayub Khan had told Dawn he would file a contempt application, as declaring his seat vacant was a clear violation of a Peshawar High Court (PHC) order, which had restrained the ECP from proceeding with his disqualification.
According to the NA rules, the speaker shall declare a member as leader of the opposition having the greatest numerical strength after verification of the signatures of the members: provided that any member who is not signatory to the proposal, if he presents himself before the count, and signs the proposal, shall be included in the count.

According to the Zoom Earth weather tracking website, an intense system forming over Sindh would hit urban centres like Hyderabad and Karachi after midnight on Wedn­esday. The system, which is likely to head out to sea by the morning, might precipitate heavily concentrated downpours in lower Sindh.
 
 

A spokesman for the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA) advised residents in vulner­able areas, including Karachi, Hyde­rabad, Thatta, Badin, Mirpurkhas and Sukkur, to remain alert and closely monitor official updates to mitigate potential hazards.
Urban flooding is expe­cted to persist in Kar­achi, Hyderabad, Sukkur and Mirpurkhas due to continued downpours and poor drainage infrastructure.
Simultaneously, districts such as Thatta, Badin, Jamshoro and Da­du face an elevated risk of flash flooding.
Rising water levels in the Indus River and its tributaries may inundate low-lying areas, prompting fears of widespread disruption.
Major highways and local roads could be sub merged, severely affecting traffic and daily routines across the region.
In anticipation of flooding, authorities have urged residents to relocate valuables and livestock to safer locations.
Households are advised to prepare emergency kits with essential supplies, including food, water, medicines and first aid. Extreme caution is recommended when handling electrical appliances, and submerged roads or electric poles should be strictly avoided.
Disruptions in power and telecom services are also likely. Citizens are encouraged to stay informed through verified official sources and adhere to safety guidelines issued by local authorities.

• Chinese FM arrives in Islamabad for ‘strategic dialogue’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and China on Wednesday pressed Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to act against terrorist groups threatening their security while reiterating offers of economic cooperation and the extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to the landlocked country.
The calls were made during and on the sidelines of the 6th Pakistan-Afghanistan-China trilateral dialogue, held in Kabul for the first time since the Taliban’s return to power in 2021. Security dominated the agenda not only at the trilateral but also in bilateral talks the Pakistani and Chinese foreign ministers held with Afghan leaders.
Pakistan and China view Afghanistan-based terrorist groups as critical threats to their stability. Since August 2021, Afghanistan has again become a hub for the Islamic State Khor­asan (IS-K), Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), and Al Qaeda, according to the UN assessments.
At a China-mediated trilateral meeting in May, Pakistan had secured promises for closer coordination on security, while Beijing linked future economic projects, including the Mes Aynak copper mine, to action against ETIM militants active near Xinjiang.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, speaking with Afghan Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul, regretted that counter-terrorism commitments were not being honoured.
 
 

“Encouraging progress has been made in political and commercial ties, but progress in the security domain, especially in counterterrorism, continues to lag behind,” Mr Dar said, according to the Foreign Office.
He highlighted a “recent surge in terrorist attacks inside Pakistan perpetrated by groups operating from Afghan soil,” calling for “concrete and verifiable measures” against the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army.
The UN Security Council repo­rted in July that the TTP commands around 6,000 fighters operating from Afghan territory with Taliban support. Bolstered by advanced weapons and ties with IS-K, Al Qaeda, and Baloch separatists, the group carried out more than 600 attacks in Pakistan in late 2024, killing nearly 1,000 people.
Despite a Chinese-brokered thaw between Kabul and Islamabad earlier this year, progress remains uneven. Pakistan restored ambassadorial-level diplomatic ties with Afghanistan, and in July Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani to revive the Joint Coordination Committee on counterterrorism.
 
 

The Taliban, meanwhile, relocated some TTP families to Ghazni and Zabul provinces and offered them financial aid. But the militants rejected relocation to northern Afghanistan, citing supply chain problems; the Taliban have resisted major crackdowns, fearing defections to IS-K.
Diplomatic optics in Kabul reflected the strains between Pakistan and Afghanistan. While Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Taliban Prime Minister Mullah Hassan Akhund, FM Dar only got a counterpart meeting. Official statements and the tone of reception also suggested a more lukewarm attitude toward Pakistan.
Afghan leaders also signalled displeasure over an upcoming conference of Afghan opposition activists in Islamabad, organised by a local group. Though not mentioned in formal communiques, Taliban officials have privately voiced strong objections.
‘Positive engagement’
In his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Mr Akhund alluded to foreign interference, saying: “We also call upon other countries to pursue the path of friendship, sound relations, and positive engagement rather than interference.”
Mr Wang, meanwhile, emphasised Beijing’s concerns over ETIM, whose fighters are based in Afghanistan and pose a threat to China’s Xinjiang region. The group, which rebranded itself as the Turkistan Islamic Party in March, has called for “jihad in Xinjiang” and maintains ties with other extremist groups.
“We also hope that Afghanistan will take into account some of our concerns, particularly concerning security,” he said. “Effective security cooperation between the two countries will establish a foundation for Afghanistan’s development. We hope that you, as China’s friend, will attach special importance to this matter and further enhance your cooperation.”
“Please assure the Chinese leadership that we have demonstrated in practice that no insecurity or other problem will emanate from Afghan soil toward any party,” Mr Akhund told Wang Yi.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office said Muttaqi reaffirmed to Mr Dar that Afghanistan’s territory “will never be used against neighbouring countries.”
Although no joint communique was issued after the trilateral, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said that the three countries agreed to strengthen efforts against terrorism. They also reaffirmed commitments to deepen cooperation in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, combating narcotics and expanding CPEC into Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the Chinese foreign minister has landed in Islamabad to attend the Pakistan-China strategic dialogue, being held today (Thursday).

The severe flooding destroyed earthen homes and agricultural fields in Sumra Nashaib, Dulu Nas­haib, Lohanch Nashaib, Mir­ani Paka, Loni, Darkhan, Cha­dhar, Mohana, and Mosan Shah, leaving families displaced and without shelter. Many struggle to save livestock amid the rising floodwaters.
In Taunsa, several villages such as Bait Lakho, Jarh Leghari, Jarah, Urra, Bodu Manaan, Thulla Chaki, Eida Arain, Basti Habib, Lal Shah, and Kotla Miran have been submerged, with houses reduced to rubble. Thousands of acres of crops in these areas are underwater and entirely ruined, leaving the displaced population without shelter or livelihood, forced to live under the open sky.
In Muzaffargarh, hundreds of residents in villages of Tehsils Jatoi and Alipur were also compelled to evacuate as floodwaters from the Indus inundated their areas.
In Tehsil Jatoi, the villages of Laskani and Kehal saw mass evacuations after a breach of 10 to 15 feet occurred in a Zamindara bund. Locals attempted to fill the breach on their own, receiving no assistance from district or divisional authorities.
 
 

Similarly, in Alipur tehsil, the villages of Bait Dewan, Mouza Shahpur, Mouza Thehri, Mouza Phul Sanjra, Basti Gishkori, Basti Faizu Mandoos, Basti Allah Bachaya Gopang, Basti Kolachi, Basti Bosan, Basti Turk, Basti Lashari, and Basti Noor Mand Gopang have also been inundated. Cotton, sesame, mung beans, and other crops have been destroyed.
In the Langarwah area of Alipur tehsil, the rising level of Indus River breached a flood protection bund on Wednesday, inundating hundreds of homes and vast agricultural lands.
Wazir Khan Gopang, a resident of Bait Dewan, said that his 20 acres of sesame and 10 acres of cotton had been destroyed. He lamented the government’s failure to take preventive measures. He and his family had to relocate, and he was struggling to save his livestock amid the rising floodwaters.
PDMA warning
As rivers swell and dams near maximum capacity, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has issued a red alert across Punjab. With rainfall expected to continue until August 24, district administrations have been instructed to stay on high alert, and citizens are urged to exercise extreme caution.
 
 

The PDMA issued a comprehensive alert following widespread monsoon rains and warned of a worsening flood situation in several districts.
Over the past 24 hours, Narowal recorded the highest rainfall at 94mm, followed by Sargodha (54mm), Joharabad (39mm), Sheikhupura (36mm), and Faisalabad (31mm), with significant precipitation also reported in Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, and other major cities.
Heavy rains are expected to continue in most districts of Punjab until August 24, with concerns over thundershowers and potential cloudbursts in the upper regions.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the current monsoon spell was a bit more intense than the previous ones and directed all district administrations to remain on high alert.
The Indus River is experiencing medium-level flooding at Taunsa and Chashma, while low-level flooding has been reported at Tarbela and Kalabagh.
The Sutlej River is also at a low flood level at Ganda Singh Wala and Sulemanki.
Critical water storage levels indicate that Tarbela Dam is at 98pc capacity and Mangla Dam at 74pc, while Indian dams are reportedly around 70pc full.
Authorities have warned of a likely increase in water flow in the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers and their tributaries due to the anticipated heavy rains.
The alert has been issued to all commissioners, deputy commissioners, and relevant departments including local government, agriculture, irrigation, health, and transport.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed has instructed Wasa officials and district administrations to take preventive measures and ensure full emergency preparedness.
Citizens have been advised to exercise extreme caution during the rainy season, particularly keeping children away from rainwater drains, low-lying areas, rivers, and canals.
Rescue and relief agencies have been directed to maintain their presence in the field during periods of rainfall.

BUNER: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hands a relief cheque to a woman, who was among the victims of the recent torrential rains and floods that caused widespread destruction in the area.—APP

• PM, army chief interact with flood-hit people in Buner
• Shehbaz blames ‘human blunder’ of unregulated construction for worsening rain destruction
• Tells Centre & provinces to join hands on disaster, reforestation, and construction policies
• Over 20 killed as rains lash Karachi, Gilgit-Baltistan
BUNER: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday directed federal and provincial authorities to formulate policies to ban construction in flood-prone zones, as he blamed the unregulated construction in “hazardous areas” for an increase in the damages caused by floods.
He made these remarks during his visit to Buner, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where he addressed the flood victims and promised to utilise all resources for their relief and rehabilitation. The premier described floods, triggered by heavy rains and mountain torrents carrying rocks and debris, as “a doomsday of sorts” for the affected communities.
“More than 350 of our brothers and sisters have lost their lives in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa alone, while nationwide, over 700 lives have been claimed by this tragedy,” he said, adding that hundreds remained injured or missing.
Meanwhile, more than 20 people were killed on Wednesday in a torrential spell of monsoon rain across the country, as downpours have swept away entire villages over the last week, leaving more than 400 dead, AFP reported.
The KP Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) said that the death toll from the floods across the province surged to 385, while 182 others were injured. It said Buner recorded the highest number of 228 deaths, while Swabi recorded 41 deaths.
Recalling the catastrophic floods of 2022, PM Shehbaz stressed that lessons had not been learned, particularly regarding construction in hazardous areas. He criticised the building of hotels and houses on riverbanks and floodplains, terming it a “human blunder” that had worsened the scale of destruction.
“There is no law anywhere in the world that allows construction in such dangerous places,” he said, warning that further spells of heavy rains were expected before September 10.
 
 

The PM directed federal and provincial authorities to immediately formulate policies to ban construction in flood-prone zones. He said he would convene a meeting of all chief ministers and their chief secretaries to make joint decisions on disaster preparedness, reforestation, and regulation of construction.
“If we continue to allow influence and corruption to dictate building permits, then neither the people nor the governments will be forgiven,” he remarked.
Relief measures
He also announced emergency relief measures, including the restoration of electricity in flood-affected districts. He said 37 of the 47 damaged feeders in Buner and Swat had already been made functional and ordered that electricity supply be provided for one week, regardless of the bill payment history. He added Gilgit-Baltistan and KP were also being repaired on priority.
 
 

Emphasising the role of deforestation in worsening the floods, the prime minister urged strict action against indiscriminate tree-cutting in KP. “If the trees had remained, they would have helped hold back water and rocks,” he said, calling for a ‘national movement’ to stop deforestation and protect natural resources.
He lauded the efforts of the KP government, the Pakistan Army under Field Marshal Asim Munir, civil administration, and local relief organisations in assisting victims. He highlighted the dual challenge of external threats and natural disasters faced by the country, praising security forces for their service.
He also announced civil awards for public servants, such as Zahoor Ahmed, a teacher who lost his life while rescuing children during the floods.
Concluding his visit, the PM urged unity and collective responsibility in the face of recurring climate disasters. “Our limited resources must be spent wisely, on education, health, and sustainable infrastructure, not on repairing preventable destruction again and again,” he said.
A statement issued regarding his visit quoted the PM as saying that Pakistan must act as “a hard state where no one is above law” and necessary actions be taken against defaulters without distinction.
The statement said the premier and army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir received a comprehensive briefing on the ongoing rescue and relief operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The COAS also interacted with troops, police and civil administration personnel involved in rescue efforts, lauding their selfless commitment in assisting victims of floods and torrential rains. He directed ground formations to approach this responsibility with devotion and spare no effort in alleviating the hardships of flood-affected families.

Power was nearly restored across the city, and only a few roads had remained inundated after Tuesday’s heavy downpour before a late evening spell of heavy rain accompanied by gusty winds on Wednesday interrupted Karachiites’ hopes for a quick return to normalcy.
The Sindh government had ordered all private and public educational institutions across the city to remain closed on Wednesday, after Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab declared a rain emergency.
Notifications issued on Wednesday by the Sindh government’s college and school education departments stated that schools will remain closed today due to the heavy rain. The notices are available with Dawn.com.
The government notified that the closure will apply to all private and public institutions in Karachi division, which are under the administrative control of the Sindh government’s College Education Department and School Education and Literacy Department.
Later on Wednesday night, Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) also issued a notification stating it would remain closed today due to heavy rainfall in the metropolis.
“All scheduled examinations stand postponed. The revised dates will be announced in due course of time through official notification,” the notice, available with Dawn.com, read.
“However, the services of Dow Diagnostic Reference and Research Laboratory, Dow Institute of Radiology, Dr Ishratul Ebad Khan Institute of Blood Diseases, Dow University Hospital, Ojha Campus, Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Centre, Dow University Road (NIPA Hospital) and Dow International Dental College Hospital (Gulistan-i-Johar) shall continue to operate as per the holiday roster, ensuring the continuation of essential services and rain-emergency duties.”
The notification added that postgraduate trainees at Dr Ruth KM Pfau, Civil Hospital, Karachi and Dow University Hospital would follow the holiday roster.
Three children were among four more people killed in rain-related incidents in Karachi on Wednesday evening, raising the death toll to 14 as the metropolis was lashed with heavy rainfall for a second consecutive day.
By 8pm, Orangi Town had recorded the heaviest showers, receiving 37 millimetres in total from the two spells. The PAF Faisal Base on Sharea Faisal followed with 32mm, while Jinnah Terminal measured 18mm. Keamari received 13mm, and the Airport Old Area saw 11mm of rainfall.

Several areas, such as Gulshan-e-Hadeed, Gulshan-e-Maymar, Saadi Town, and Bahria Town, recorded negligible or no rain during this period.</p><small>2025-08-20 19:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21001110bbc3c27.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932049/death-toll-climbs-to-14-as-rain-batters-karachi-for-second-straight-day' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll climbs to 14 as rain batters Karachi for second straight day</strong></a><br><p>Three children were among four more people killed in rain-related incidents in Karachi on Wednesday evening, raising the death toll to 14 as the metropolis was lashed with heavy rainfall for a second consecutive day.
Tuesday’s rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupted industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet services outages which continued late into Wednesday, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery. Due to the severity of the situ­ation, the provincial admin­­istration had anno­unced a public holiday in the city today.
 


An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said in a statement that two unidentified children drowned in the Lyari River in Liaquatabad’s C-1 Area and near Al-Asif Square in Sohrab Goth, while Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that their rescue team continued the search operation until nightfall, but it was halted due to darkness.
Separately, a young boy drowned while swimming in accumulated rainwater in a ditch off Northern Bypass, according to Gulshan-i-Maymar police Station House Officer (SHO) Abdul Ghaffar Korai.
“The body was recovered and sent to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital,” he said.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the body of an unidentified man in his early 60s who drowned was brought to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital by Site Superhighway Industrial Area police for legal formalities.
Meanwhile, Shah Faisal Colony police said that two young brothers were electrocuted in the area on Tuesday evening.
Shah Faisal Colony SHO Imtiaz Husain Shah told Dawn.com that one of the victims was electrocuted by an underground electric wire near Jamia Masjid Farooqia in Shah Faisal Colony - 4. His brother tried to rescue him, but he also suffered an electric shock and died. The victims were identified as Murad Sultan, 21 and Siraj Sultan, 12.
Shortly after 2:30pm, rainfall was reported in Saddar, Malir, Malir Cantonment, Scheme 33, Gulistan-i-Jauhar Block 2, and near I.I. Chundrigar, Kala Pull Road, and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical College (JPMC). Another spell dumped more rain on the city in the evening, triggering power outages even in areas where electricity had previously been restored.
By 8pm, Orangi Town had recorded the heaviest showers, receiving 37 millimetres in total from the two spells. The PAF Faisal Base on Sharea Faisal followed with 32mm, while Jinnah Terminal measured 18mm. Keamari received 13mm, and the Airport Old Area saw 11mm of rainfall. Other parts of the city experienced lighter showers, including Korangi with 6.8mm, the Met Office station on University Road with 7.6mm, Nazimabad with 2mm, the PAF Masroor Base in Karachi West with 2mm, and Surjani Town with 1.8mm. Several areas, such as Gulshan-e-Hadeed, Gulshan-e-Maymar, Saadi Town, and Bahria Town, recorded negligible or no rain during this period.
In an alert issued at 3pm, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had warned that rains with thunderstorms and strong winds were expected at most places in Karachi and its surrounding areas in the next two to four hours, while heavy showers were also forecast at some locations.
Warning of the risk of increased urban flooding, the PMD had advised the public to take necessary precautions and remain alert.
 






In a post on X, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab warned citizens: “It is expected to rain again from 2pm onwards. I would request people to avoid movement and if it starts to rain, please stay put where you are whether it is your office or residence.”
 






“We are expecting more intense rains,” Anjum Nazir, a spokesperson for Sindh’s meteorological department, as quoted as saying by Reuters.
NDMA warns of more rainfall
The NDMA’s National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) on Wednesday afternoon warned of heavy rainfall of 50-100 millimeters or more in parts of Sindh over the next 12 to 24 hours, highlighting the risk of urban flooding, waterlogging and disruptions to daily life.
A spokesman for the NDMA advised residents in vulnerable areas — including Karachi, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur, and adjoining regions —to remain alert and closely monitor official updates to mitigate potential hazards.
The NDMA said urban flooding was expected to persist in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Mirpurkhas due to continued downpours and poor drainage infrastructure.
The authority warned that disruptions in power and telecom services were likely. Citizens were encouraged to stay informed through verified official sources and adhere to safety guidelines issued by local authorities.
Electricity outages
In an update at 1:30pm, K-Electric spokesperson Imran Rana said the company’s generation, transmission and distribution system was stable, with power supply continuing in the city through more than 2,000 of 2,100 feeders.
“As soon as rainwater drainage is completed and safety clearance is received from ground teams, the few remaining areas will also be restored soon,” he said, adding that the areas where power was being restored included Saima Pari Centre in Surjani Town; KDA Apartments; Hill View Apartments; Blocks A, C, D, I, J, K, R, and S in North Nazimabad; Block 10-A in Gulshan-i-Iqbal; Murtaza Chowrangi; Sector 21, and Sector 29 in Korangi, and Khyaban-i-Shamsheer, Shaheen, Gizri Boulevard and Commercial Street 1 to 4 in Defence Housing Authority.
“The public is urged to maintain safety precautions. Stay away from electrical installations and poles and exercise caution when using electrical appliances.
“In case of emergency complaints, contact the 118 call centre,” the spokesperson said.
 






In an update at 3:50pm, the Karachi Traffic Police said the following roads and underpasses were closed for traffic due to rainwater accumulation.
Shaheed-i-Millat Underpass at Tariq Road and Drigh Road Underpass towards the airport in District East; Nazimabad No. 1 and 2 underpasses, Liaqatabad No. 10 Underpass, Gharibabad Underpass and Sohrab Goth Underpass in District Central; both roads coming and going towards Qayyumabad at Korangi Crossing and both roads coming and going towards Korangi at EBM Causeway in Korangi District.
“The public is requested to take alternative routes to avoid inconvenience and trouble. In case of any emergency, contact the traffic helpline 1915.”
 






The Sindh government had ordered all private and public educational institutions across the city to remain closed today, after Wahab declared a rain emergency. However, Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah rebutted a “fake” notification of school closures for tomorrow and Friday, clarifying that the government had not issued any such directives yet.
Separately, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah⁩ chaired a meeting on Karachi’s rain situation.
“More rain expected, municipal and emergency teams are on alert. Continuous efforts underway for drainage and rescue operations,” said a post on his X account. It noted that 26 de-watering pumps had been deployed citywide to “ease flooding”.
 






CM Shah also visited Sharea Faisal and the Nursery area, where he spoke to the media and highlighted that the effects of climate change were visible around the world.
“Rainwater accumulated in the city, but you can see that the nullahs are flowing,” he said, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa.
“Did the nullahs get cleared within a night? No, the Sindh government had been working on it. But the media was saying that the city had drowned and the administration was not present, which is wrong.
“The entire city administration, municipality corporation’s staff, and I myself are on the streets,” the chief minister added.
State broadcaster PTV News uploaded a post to X stating that the Pakistan Army was continuing relief and rescue efforts in the wake of heavy rainfall in Karachi.
“Due to continuous rain, many vehicles were rescued with the help of [the] Pakistan Army’s relief vehicles,” the post said, adding that elderly people and children were shifted to safe locations by Pakistan Army personnel.
The post included a video showing army personnel working with civil personnel and towing stranded vehicles with heavy trucks.
 






Inundated roads as mayor stresses ‘climate change is a reality’
Floodwater was still accumulated on multiple roads across the city, including near I.I. Chundrigar Road, as Karachi did not witness any further rain till at least 2pm.
While the traffic police listed 10 bypasses and three main roads as being closed till at least 12pm due to urban flooding, Wahab presented a contrasting picture on his social media accounts, sharing videos of only those routes that were clear for vehicles.
The PPP mayor shared videos shot from inside a car of a drive along the Sher Shah Suri Road, Submarine Underpass, Shahrah-i-Pakistan and Liaqatabad No. 10 leading to Daak Khana, which did not have any rainwater in the videos.
 

This Google Map screengrab shows road blockades across Karachi on Aug 20, 2025 as of 4:50pm, a day after heavy rainfall led to flooding in various areas.

In a post on X, Wahab urged citizens not to use Shaheed-i-Millat Road at the moment as “work is being carried out to clear the underpasses”. He suggested using Stadium Road or Shahrah-i-Quaideen as alternative routes.
 






Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Wahab said: “Climate change is a reality. If you want to make someone a target of criticism and say whatever you want, you can. But, you can see how huge a challenge climate change is for any government, state, or administration around the world.”
Noting that Pakistan faced “different challenges” from the developed countries, the PPP mayor said climate change had wreaked havoc in other parts of the country too in recent weeks.
He underscored that people had two options: either change their behaviour to combat climate change, or criticise others. He compared yesterday’s torrential rains in Karachi to those that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, other northern areas and Islamabad faced this monsoon.
Wahab detailed that there were two rain spells on Tuesday, with the first one ending by 9:30am, allowing the city administration to work on removing the rainwater. “By 12:30pm, the situation had been fixed and the main arteries of your city were open.”
 
 

However, the second spell began at around 1:15pm and continued “non-stop” till 6pm, the PPP mayor highlighted. Even after that, rain continued “on and off” till around 8pm with each spell lasting 10 to 12 minutes, Wahab added.
Noting that 235 millimetres of rain occurred in only Manghopir in 12 hours yesterday, Wahab stressed that Karachi’s nullahs had a capacity of 40mm so rainfall above that would result in a spillover effect. He asserted that a nullah situated in the Nursery area was fully functional and had no blockage.
Rain started again while Wahab was holding the media talk, with the mayor saying he was ready to continue the press conference in the same outdoor setting, and later pushed back an umbrella someone else was holding for him.
According to the rainfall record issued by the PMD at 8am for the previous 24 hours, Gulshan-i-Hadeed received the highest amount of rain (178mm), with Keamari following close (173mm).
Airport Old Area recorded 164mm of rain, Jinnah Terminal 156mm, Nazimabad 150mm, Surjani Town 151mm, North Karachi 149mm, Saadi Town 146mm, DHA Phase 7 138mm, Met Office at University Road 145mm, Korangi 139mm, PAF Faisal Base at Sharea Faisal 133mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar (Jamia Rasheed) 103mm, PAF Masroor Base (Karachi West) 101mm, Orangi Town 81mm and Bahria Town witnessed the lowest 5mm.
 






Deaths from rain-related incidents rise to 8
According to separate statements issued by Karachi Rescue 1122, two more people died in rain-related incidents, in addition to yesterday’s six deaths.
Edhi Marine Service volunteers recovered the body of a 50-year-old man, identified as Abbas Mohsin, who went missing in a nullah near the Gurumandir area yesterday, Rescue 1122 said. His body was taken to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK).
 
 

In Defence Housing Authority’s (DHA) Phase 5, Edhi Marine Service volunteers recovered the body of 19-year-old motorcycle rider Yasir, after being informed about an electrocution incident. The man’s body was shifted to the JPMC.
A man and a woman were injured after part of an old building collapsed in the Ranchore Line area, a statement from the Edhi Rescue service said. Both were taken to CHK in an ambulance.
According to statements by Sindh Rescue 1122, “several people” were rescued from Karachi’s Sukhan Nadi, while 18 men and 12 women were evacuated safely from a call centre in PECHS Block 6 after they were trapped there due to rainwater accumulated inside the building.
Among the six people who died yesterday were four members of a family who lost their lives after the walls of a house in Gulistan-i-Jauhar’s Block-12 collapsed during the heavy rain. According to a JPMC statement, a boy aged between two to four years and a six to seven-year-old girl were among the deceased, while a fifth relative was injured.
In another similar incident in Orangi Town, an eight-year-old child lost his life. An unidentified man, aged 20-24 years, died in a suspected electrocution case in DHA’s Phase 7.
Yesterday’s rains severely flooded Karachi’s major arteries, including Sharea Faisal, M.A. Jinnah Road, and I.I. Chundrigar Road, with hundreds of cars and motorcycles submerged and commuters stuck in traffic jams for several hours. Many had to wade through waist-deep water in the business district as they tried to return home.
Shortly after the heavy rains hit the city, power outages swept across the city, plunging several areas into darkness. Even upscale neigh­bourhoods, such as DHA and Clifton, were severely affected, with rainwater flooding homes and adding to the residents’ misery.
The domestic and international flight operations at Jinnah International Airport were also affected, with the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) confirming that several flights were either delayed, cancelled or diverted to an alternative airport due to inclement weather.
More rains expected in Sindh, Balochistan
The PMD has forecast torrential rains in Sindh, parts of Balochistan, and other regions of the country in the coming days, advising the provincial disaster management authorities to make necessary arrangements.
According to the PMD, strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are continuously penetrating the country, particularly the southern parts.
Under the influence of these conditions, widespread rain-wind/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls, at times very heavy, are expected in Karachi, Mithi, Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar and Jamshoro.
Scattered showers are likely in Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, and Jacobabad till August 22 with occasional gaps.
 






In Balochistan, rain-wind/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls are expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Qila Saifullah, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Kech, Gwadar, and Panjgur till August 22 with occasional gaps.
The Met Office warned that torrential rains may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Sindh, including Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tharparkar, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar, and Jamshoro.</p><small>2025-08-20 18:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/202306090c7019a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932099/india-test-fires-ballistic-missile-ahead-of-us-tariff-hike' target='_blank'><strong>India test-fires ballistic missile ahead of US tariff hike</strong></a><br><p>India on Wednesday test-fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads, a government statement said, in an apparent show of strength ahead of a threatened US tariff increase.
The Agni-5 missile was successfully launched in India’s eastern Odisha state, with authorities saying it “validated all operational and technical parameters.”
The test-fire came a week before US tariffs are set to double from 25 per cent to 50 pc, unless India meets President Donald Trump’s demand that it stop buying Russian oil.
 
 

India last tested the Agni-5 missile in March 2024.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said this month that, in the face of US tariffs, India was seeking self-reliance with energy independence and the development of its own defence systems.
New Delhi has deepened defence cooperation with Western countries in recent years, including in the Quad alliance with the United States, Japan and Australia as an apparent counter to rival China.
But India’s relations with China have warmed recently with several bilateral visits, and Modi is scheduled to visit Tianjin later this month in his first visit to the country since 2018.
Agni, meaning “fire” in Sanskrit, is the name given to a series of rockets India developed as part of a guided missile development project launched in 1983.

The letter, which has surfaced amid a brewing controversy, reveals a clash over judicial independence, transparency, and the handling of one of Pakistan’s most politically charged constitutional issues: the 26th Amendment, which alters judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate, with opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy.
The letter states that on October 31, 2024, Justices Shah and Akhtar, members of the Supreme Court Committee formed under the Practice and Procedure Act, 2023, had pushed for a Full Court hearing to address petitions challenging the amendment’s validity. They argued that only a collective adjudication by all judges could restore public faith in the institution, which was seen at the time to have been battered by political pressures.
However, CJP Afridi, citing informal, private consultations with other judges, insisted that the cases should be assigned to a Constitutional Bench — a body created under the very amendment that was under scrutiny.
In a dramatic turn, the two justices said they had convened a formal Practice and Procedures Committee meeting the same day, deciding by majority to schedule the petitions for November 4, 2024, before a Full Court. The decision was never complied with by the Registrar of the Supreme Court, even after a subsequent letter was issued to them.
The CJP, who skipped the meeting, later issued notes justifying his refusal to comply. The two notes from the CJP, recently uploaded to the Supreme Court’s website, suggest that he had declined to implement the committee’s decision because such a move could have dampened the “much-needed spirit of collegiality” among the judges and “further expose the court to public scrutiny”.
However, Justices Shah and Akhtar complain that these notes were never shared with the members of the Committee, but presented at a Judicial Commission meeting – a move that the justices believe was legally inappropriate. The Registrar’s failure to act on the Committee’s directive further escalated tensions, leaving the petitions unresolved nearly ten months later. The judges also stated that they had thoroughly examined both notes authored by the CJP — now available in the public domain — and concluded that they neither provided a valid reason nor legal justification for non-compliance with the Practice and Procedures Committee’s “legally binding” decision on October 31, 2024.
The letter also raises questions over the sudden public disclosure of the Committee’s minutes of the October 31 meeting on the Supreme Court website despite a prior decision to restrict their circulation. The letter suggests this may be linked to the upcoming resumption of Constitutional Benches in September 2025. The judges have also highlighted amendments to the Practice and Procedure Act that removed Justice Akhtar from the Committee, labelling it as an attempt to centralise power with the CJP.
The controversy comes at a critical juncture for Pakistan’s judiciary, already grappling with accusations of political interference. The 26th Amendment, passed in 2024, has previously been criticised by PTI and legal circles as an effort to block Justice Shah, the senior-most judge, from becoming CJP.
In light of the CJP’s explanations being uploaded, the two justices demanded that their letter, too, be placed on the Supreme Court website to ensure transparency, promising to release it publicly if ignored.
“The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending, and a golden opportunity to decide them at the earliest instance before the institution as a whole — i.e., the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably.
“This was the most appropriate forum (in terms of composition) to resolve the fundamental constitutional issues in a manner that would not only satisfy the dictates of law and justice but also ensure a judicial decision whose legitimacy could not be questioned,” the letter regrets.</p><small>2025-08-20 18:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20173213a8cea00.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932040/pm-shehbaz-visits-kps-flood-affected-areas-as-14-more-bodies-recovered' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz visits KP’s flood-affected areas as 14 more bodies recovered</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday visited the flood-affected districts of Swat, Buner and Shangla in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as 14 more bodies were recovered from debris in Swabi’s Dalori.
Record rains in KP, which started on August 15, have wreaked havoc on different parts of the province. Last week, the provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond.
“Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accompanied by federal ministers and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, visited the flood-affected districts of Swat, Buner, and Shangla,” the Press Information Department said in a press release.
Separately, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar, while speaking to the media in Peshawar, expressed gratitude to the federal and provincial governments, Pakistan Army, political parties and their organisations, as well as all individuals and institutions that came forward to provide aid during the floods.
 






Earlier in the day, fourteen bodies were recovered from underneath debris in Dalori, a cloudburst-hit region in KP’s Swabi district, bringing the number of bodies recovered in the region to 37, according to rescue officials.
According to the latest data from the KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority, 385 people have died in rain-related incidents since August 15, with Buner reporting the highest toll at 228. Another 182 people are injured, including 145 men, 27 women and 10 children.
High-level visit
The prime minister and COAS also received a comprehensive briefing on ongoing rescue and relief operations in KP, the PID added.
 






Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam, and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal accompanied PM Shehbaz.
During their interaction with flood victims, the prime minister assured them of the government and the army’s unwavering commitment to extending maximum support to them “in this critical hour”.
PM Shehbaz appreciated the tireless dedication of the armed forces and civil administration, reaffirmed solidarity with the flood-affected population and assured them of all possible assistance, according to the PID.
The prime minister emphasised that every available national resource will be mobilised to accelerate recovery efforts and restore normalcy in the affected areas.
Encroachments on riverways condemned
Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister also drew attention to illegal encroachments, the timber mafia, and stone crushing activities, especially in the region’s waterways, which have contributed greatly to the loss of lives and damages.
“After the 2022 floods, I saw with my own eyes that on the sides of nullahs, rivers  — In fact, even inside the rivers — that hotels and houses had been made. There is no law in the entire world that allows you to construct dangerous hotels in such places,” he regretted.
He said Pakistan must act as a ‘hard state’ where no one is above the law and necessary actions are taken against violators without distinction, according to the PID.
Field Marshal Asim Munir also interacted with the troops, police and civil administration personnel involved in rescue efforts, lauding their selfless commitment in assisting victims of floods and torrential rains.
The COAS directed ground formations to approach the responsibility with utmost devotion and to spare no effort in alleviating the hardships of flood-stricken families, the PID said.
“He underscored that the safety and relief of fellow citizens remain the foremost priority, commending the forces and civil administration for their untiring service,” the PID statement added.
The prime minister and participants earlier also offered prayers for those who lost their lives in the floods.
On Tuesday, the premier had ordered a week-long, uninterrupted supply of electricity to the flood-hit areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and KP, while road and power supply were being restored in these areas.
Tragedy in Dalori
Dalori, the site where the bodies were recovered from on Wednesday, is a far-flung village in the mountainous regions of Gadoon Amazai, Topi, a sub-tehsil of Swabi.
Dalori was hit by a cloudburst on Monday morning, resulting in complete destruction of 12 houses and people were buried under the debris. By Tuesday, the death toll in the Gadoon Amazi area had surged to 24, including eight children.
According to the KP PDMA, the number of dead in Swabi rose to 41 on Wednesday.
 






Swabi Deputy Commissioner Nasarullah Khan told Dawn.com, “With the recovery of 14 more dead on Wednesday, we have completed the task and all 37 dead bodies from the debris at Dalori village have been recovered.”
The district administration has completed the task, satisfying the local people who assisted them and monitoring the entire operation, which was continued round the clock since Monday, he added.
“Eight dead bodies were recovered on Monday, 15 more were extracted on Tuesday and 14 on Wednesday,” he said.
Officials in hospitals said that a total of eight people were injured in Dalori village and they were provided free health services.
DC Nasarullah said: “Now we will shift to relief operation to rehabilitate the locals affected by the cloud burst.”
In a separate incident, four people were killed in Sarkoi Bala village. The dead bodies from there were recovered on the very first day of the incident.
“So far, a total of 29 dead bodies, including children, women and men, have been recovered from the debris in this ill-fated and natural calamity-hit village,” District Emergency Officer (DEO) Rescue 1122 Swabi Muhammad Awais Babar had told Dawn.com earlier.
DEO Babar said the district administration has decided to continue its search operation in the area till the task is completed, with locals assisting and monitoring the efforts, which have been ongoing since Monday.

A total of 110 rescue staff had been deployed at the Dalori village site, as per the DEO. “Rescue 1122 of Nowshera, Haripur and Mardan districts have been assisting them in the continued operation for the last three days.”
Pakistan army soldiers, civil defence volunteers, members of Al-Khidmat Foundation and various locals from different villages in the Gadoon Amazai belt participated in the operation.
However, Topi Mayor Rahim Jadoon said the exact number of missing people was still unknown, but confirmed that the cloudburst had destroyed 12 houses.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur said yesterday his government would provide all possible assistance to flood-hit people to help them pick up the pieces.
UK’s King Charles condoles death of flood victims, extends solidarity
Also on Wednesday, the United Kingdom’s King Charles condoled the death of flood victims and expressed solidarity with those affected by the flooding.
“My wife and I have been desperately saddened to learn of the tragic loss of life and widespread devastation caused by the recent monsoon flooding in Pakistan, and of the horrendous helicopter crash during rescue operations,” the British monarch said in a statement.
“The scale of suffering is truly heart-rending, and our thoughts and deepest sympathy are with all those who have lost loved ones, homes and livelihoods,” the statement quoted King Charles as saying.
The British monarch also extended “heartfelt condolences to those affected and stand in solidarity with the people of Pakistan during this most difficult time.”
The statement added that he was especially mindful of the enduring bonds between the two nations, and of the many families in the United Kingdom with close ties to Pakistan.
He also commended the commitment of the emergency services, volunteers and local communities, “who are working so hard and against such overwhelming odds to rescue those in danger and to provide vital relief to those whose lives have been so cruelly disrupted.”</p><small>2025-08-20 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/201929340437a51.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932084/pakistan-mens-t20-squad-arrives-in-dubai-ahead-of-asia-cup-tri-series' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan men’s T20 squad arrives in Dubai ahead of Asia Cup, tri-series</strong></a><br><p>The national men’s T20 squad arrived in Dubai for the upcoming Asia Cup and Tri-Nation series, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Wednesday.
The tri-series against Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates, which starts on August 29, and the Asia Cup from September 9 will both take place in the UAE.
In a post on X, the PCB said the team arrived in Dubai in four groups, adding that it would participate in a pre-series training camp from August 21-27 and take part in a training session at the ICC Cricket Academy tomorrow.
 






The squad departed from Pakistan in four different groups “to ensure a smooth and organised arrival of players and support staff in Dubai”, state media PTV reported.
While the ICC Cricket Academy will serve as the “primary training facility” for players, the team was scheduled to play a T20 practice match at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, the state broadcaster said.
All training sessions and practice matches will take place in Dubai according to the official schedule, PTV stated, adding, “This setup is designed to provide players with the ideal environment and facilities to prepare thoroughly ahead of the two major tournaments.”
The PCB announced on Sunday that Pakistan have left out Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan from the T20 squad.
Babar and Rizwan have been star performers in the shortest format in the past, but have not played since December, which head coach Mike Hesson put down to other players performing well while addressing a press conference.
Since Hesson took over as head coach in May, Pakistan have played three T20 series — winning 3-0 at home but losing 2-1 away to Bangladesh. They then beat the West Indies 2-1 in the United States.
All-rounder Salman Agha will lead the side, which also sees the return of fast bowlers Mohammad Wasim and Salman Mirza.

Pakistan and the United Kingdom have been engaged in the Enhanced Strategic Dialogue (ESD) since 2011, which has deepened and broadened the dialogue between the two countries, covering areas such as trade, economic growth and development, cultural cooperation, security, and education.
During the meeting, held in Islamabad, Chaudhry highlighted Pakistan’s ‘democratic trajectory’ and emphasised that constructive dialogue and strong institutions were essential for a sustainable democracy.
“The meeting also touched on matters concerning Pakistani-origin citizens in the UK, including taxation and general facilitation,” the press release read. “Marriott welcomed ongoing efforts to support overseas Pakistanis and expressed interest in further collaboration to enhance services for the diaspora.”
Chaudhry stressed, during the discussion, the importance of empowering local governments to deliver services and advance development, the press release said. He also highlighted efforts being made by Pakistan’s government to counter misinformation and project its narrative internationally.
He also invited Marriott to observe educational reforms undertaken in his constituency. “His efforts focus on building international-standard institutions and increasing enrollment in public schools,” the press release read.
“The meeting participants also discussed different strategies to alleviate poverty and improve the standard of living of people living below the poverty line.”
Earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had undertaken a two-day official visit to the UK, where he not only met British counterpart Angela Rayner, but also with British lawmakers of Pakistani origin, as well as Kashmiri leaders.
 






Earlier this month, both nations pledged to deepen their partnership across key sectors, with a renewed focus on defence cooperation and strategic dialogue. This consensus was reached during a meeting between Mariott and Minister for Defence Production Muhammad Raza Hayat Harraj in Rawalpindi.
“Pakistan considers the United Kingdom a close friend and a genuine development partner,” Harraj said, according to a statement. “Frequent interaction has been useful in coordinating our approaches to various bilateral, regional and international issues. The two sides agreed to enhance cooperation in all fields, including defence.”</p><small>2025-08-20 16:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/201843360c2a275.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932073/pakistan-china-afghanistan-commit-to-bolstering-joint-efforts-against-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China, Afghanistan commit to bolstering joint efforts against terrorism</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan, China and Afghanistan on Wednesday committed themselves to bolstering joint efforts against the menace of terrorism and deepening their collaboration in key spheres.
A statement to this effect followed the Sixth Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue held in Kabul between Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese and Afghan counterparts, Wang Yi and Amir Khan Muttaqi, respectively, on the topics of political, economic and security cooperation.
“The three sides committed to strengthening joint efforts against terrorism. They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as extension of CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) to Afghanistan,” the Foreign Office (FO) said on the meeting.
 






Before the meeting, Dar met FM Muttaqi on the sidelines and the two are said to have noted the positive movement in political and economic ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan. They also reaffirmed their commitment to working closely on counter-terrorism and ensuring peace and stability in the region.
 






The FO said the two welcomed the recent elevation of diplomatic representation between the two countries from the chargé d’affaires to the ambassadorial level.
Its statement said both had noted with appreciation that most decisions from recent interactions had either been implemented or were nearing completion, adding that these efforts had significantly strengthened bilateral relations, particularly in the areas of trade and transit.
FM Dar “acknowledged the encouraging progress in political and commercial ties, while expressing that progress in the security domain, especially in counter-terrorism, continues to lag behind,” the FO said, adding that Dar had highlighted a recent surge in terrorist attacks inside Pakistan perpetrated by groups operating from Afghan soil.
The FO added that he urged the Afghan authorities to take “concrete and verifiable measures” against proscribed groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the Balochistan Liberation Army/Majeed Brigade.
The FO said Muttaqi reaffirmed Afghanistan’s commitment to ensuring its territory was not used by any terrorist group against Pakistan or other nations.
 






FM Dar landed in Kabul earlier today for the trilateral meeting and was received by Afghan Deputy FM Dr Mohammad Naeem, other Afghan officials, and Pakistan’s Ambassador to Afghanistan, Ubaidur Rehman Nizamani.
 






On May 21, Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed in principle to upgrade their diplomatic relations by exchanging ambassadors — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.
The understanding was reached during an informal trilateral meeting of foreign ministers from Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan in Beijing. The talks were part of Beijing’s broader effort to ease regional tensions and advance connectivity through its Belt and Road Initiative.
Pakistan and China had also noted that there was an agreement on the extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan.
China, which has strategic interests in regional stability and economic integration, hosted the gathering to help resume the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral dialogue, which had been paused since 2023.
The key outcomes from the Beijing meeting also included commitments to enhance cooperation in security and counter-terrorism, including joint action against militant groups and external interference and an understanding to formally resume the trilateral process by convening the sixth China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue in Kabul.
Earlier that month, the Afghan government had called for “mutual respect and constructive engagement” with Pakistan and China, according to a statement issued by its interior ministry.
The statement was issued after special envoys of Pakistan and China, Mohammad Sadiq and Yue Xiaoyong, met Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul.</p><small>2025-08-20 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2013511936c58ee.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932053/imran-khan-nominates-mahmood-achakzai-as-na-opposition-leader-swati-for-senate' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan nominates Mahmood Achakzai as NA opposition leader, Swati for Senate</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan has nominated Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai for the post of Opposition Leader in the National Assembly, PTI Secretary-General Salman Akram Raja said on Wednesday.
“Azam Khan Swati has been nominated as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,” Raja added. He also said Imran has asked for five names to decide on his nominee for the opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly.
The announcement comes after the Election Commission of Pakistan earlier this month disqualified PTI’s Omar Ayub Khan as the NA opposition leader and Shibli Faraz from the same role in the Senate, along with other opposition MNAs and MPAs, following their convictions in May 9 cases. Both PTI opposition leaders were formally removed from their posts on August 8.
Speaking to reporters outside the Supreme Court, Raja said that Imran had nominated Achakzai, who currently leads the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), to take Ayub’s place.
“The PTI founder has entrusted the matter of by-elections [to seats vacated after recent convictions of lawmakers in May 9 cases] to the party’s political committee,” he said.
“A political committee meeting will be held later today, where a decision will be made in this regard.”

‘We need to fight this war’
In a separate address in Lahore, Raja highlighted that the people need to come together and stand up against oppression, adding that they need to fight for their rights as enshrined in the Constitution.
“It doesn’t matter where you’re from or what party you belong to; if you have empathy, we are all together,” he said. “For the permanence of humanity and dignity, we need to fight this war.”
The PTI general secretary highlighted that anyone can be detained for any reason, warning that nobody has freedom.
“There is only one law in this country, its name is fear,” he emphasised.
 






“We will take your struggle to every stage we can,” Raja said, indirectly addressing party supporters.
“We are all part of one big struggle for human rights. What does the supremacy of law and the Constitution mean? It means having the right to stand up and protest, as in Article 17. Article 15 allows free movement. Article 19 says we can raise and spread our voice together.
“We have to fight for the farmers and the downtrodden,” he added. “I listened to people in Sindh, it brought tears to my eyes, but this is not only in Sindh, it is commonplace.”
Raja emphasised that “we all have rights and we are all human”, adding that the people need to stand up for a common agenda.
“We can see in these floods, they are not purely natural disasters: there is a human hand and greed involved,” Raja declared. “We need to eradicate this greed in the same way as our forests are being cut down. If we do not stand up, we will not be able to raise our voices again.”
Last week, the Peshawar High Court had issued a stay order for the appointments of new opposition leaders in the NA and the Senate. The bench also issued notices to the ECP, seeking its response to two separate petitions filed by Ayub and Faraz. The petitions challenged their disqualification and de-notification as MNA and Senator, respectively.
The PTI is a part of a coalition of six opposition parties, working under the banner of TTAP, which was formed last year.
Earlier this month, the opposition alliance had organised a multi-party conference, following which it had appealed for a new social contract to restore the Constitution and democracy.
The TTAP formalised its organisational structure in July, declaring blanket support for all anti-government protests. During a press conference, Raja had announced Achakzai’s appointment as TTAP chairman, with PTI’s Asad Qaiser as the Secretary General.</p><small>2025-08-20 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/201651320d451c3.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932074/government-establishes-pakistan-digital-authority-to-implement-digital-master-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Government establishes Pakistan Digital Authority to implement ‘digital master plan’</strong></a><br><p>The federal government officially established the Pakistan Digital Authority (PDA), appointing a chairperson and one other member to the body, it emerged on Wednesday.
As one of three bodies formed under the Digital Nation Bill — approved by the federal cabinet in June — the PDA will comprise a chairperson and two members, who will work to develop, implement and monitor the national digital master plan. The authority will also establish a monitoring and evaluation framework for digital transformation projects.
The Digital Nation Bill aims to create a digital identity for citizens in order to centralise social, economic and governance data, and to provide for the transformation of Pakistan into a digital nation, enabling a digital society, digital economy and digital governance, according to its stated objectives.
According to a pair of notifications from the Cabinet Division — dated August 19 and available with Dawn.com — Dr Sohail Munir has been appointed as the PDA chairperson, while Dr Muhammad J. Sear has been appointed as one of the authority’s two members. Both appointments have been made by the prime minister. One other member is yet to be named.
Dr Munir and Dr Sear have been appointed “under [the] Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication on [a] contract basis for a period of five years, with immediate effect and until further orders”, the identical notifications read.
Dr Munir is a “digital futurist” and a “leading expert” in the field of government digital transformation, according to his LinkedIn profile. He currently works in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as an adviser to the Abu Dhabi government’s Department of Government Enablement.
Dr Sear is also an expert on digital transformations in government and has worked as an adviser to governments and the private sector. He is currently the CEO of well-being startup Simpli Human in the UAE, according to LinkedIn.
In June, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif approved a search and selection committee to recommend the appointment of PDA members. Federal Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja was appointed convener of the search committee.
The authority’s other functions include facilitating coordination between different stakeholders; establishing an evaluation frame for projects under the digital master plan; reviewing plans relevant to the master plan; developing and enforcing a national data strategy and comprehensive data governance framework within government entities and across public and private sectors, as well as recommending governance, standards and operational compliance of cloud infrastructure within the public sector among others.</p><small>2025-08-20 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20165558c859689.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932075/iran-says-cannot-completely-break-with-un-nuclear-watchdog' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says ‘cannot completely’ break with UN nuclear watchdog</strong></a><br><p>Iran “cannot completely cut cooperation” with the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog but the return of its inspectors is up to the country’s security chiefs, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Wednesday.
The remarks come nearly two months after Iran suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following its 12-day war with Israel in June.
Iran has cited the IAEA’s failure to condemn Israeli and American strikes on its nuclear facilities as the reason for its decision, which saw the watchdog’s inspectors leave the country following the passing of new legislation by parliament.
“We cannot completely cut cooperation with the agency,” Araghchi said, noting that new fuel rods need to be installed at Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant in the coming weeks, which will require the presence of IAEA inspectors.
 
 

“Under the law passed by parliament, the return of inspectors will be possible through a decision of the Supreme National Security Council,” he told the official IRNA news agency in an interview published on Wednesday, referring to Iran’s top security body.
In mid-June, Israel launched an unprecedented attack targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites, but also hitting residential areas.
The United States launched its own attacks on nuclear facilities at Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz.
The war derailed talks between Iran and the US on a new nuclear deal to replace the one abandoned by US President Donald Trump during his first term in 2018.
Iran has since said cooperation with the agency will take “a new form” and earlier this month, the agency’s deputy head visited Tehran for talks.
At the time, deputy foreign minister Kazem Gharibabadi said Iran and the agency had agreed to “continue consultations”.
In recent weeks, Britain, France and Germany have threatened to trigger a snapback of UN sanctions lifted under the 2015 accord if Iran fails to agree a deal on uranium enrichment and cooperation with the IAEA.</p><small>2025-08-20 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20171406244b3ef.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932077/india-china-agree-to-resume-direct-flights-boost-business-links' target='_blank'><strong>India, China agree to resume direct flights, boost business links</strong></a><br><p>India and China agreed on Tuesday to resume direct flights and step up trade and investment flows as the neighbours rebuild ties damaged by a 2020 border clash.
The Asian giants are cautiously strengthening ties against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable foreign policy, staging a series of high-level bilateral visits.
The two countries would resume direct flights and boost trade and investment, including reopening border trade at three designated points, and facilitate in visas, the Indian foreign ministry said.
Direct flights have been suspended since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. No date was given for their resumption.
The latest statements came at the end of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s two-day visit to New Delhi for the 24th round of talks with Indian National Security (NSA) Adviser Ajit Doval to resolve their decades old border dispute.
The border talks covered issues related to pulling back troops both countries have amassed on their Himalayan border, delimitation of borders and boundary affairs, the Indian ministry said.
Both countries have agreed to set up a working group to consult and coordinate on border affairs to advance demarcation negotiations, a Chinese foreign ministry statement released on Wednesday showed.
It said the mechanism will extend talks to cover the eastern and middle sections of the border. Meanwhile another round of talks on the western section will be held as soon as possible, the ministry said.
Beijing also said both countries agreed to meet again in China in 2026.
“Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X after meeting Wang.
 






Modi is scheduled to travel to China at the end of this month to take part in the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation — his first visit to the country in more than seven years.

A readout from the Chinese foreign ministry said Wang told Doval that “the stable and healthy development of China-India relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries’ people.”
The two sides “should enhance mutual trust through dialogues and expand cooperation”, Wang said, and should aim for consensus in areas such as border control and demarcation negotiations.
 
 

India said Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar had underlined in his talks with Wang India’s concerns with regard to the mega dam China is building on the Yarlung  Zangbo river in Tibet.
Yarlung  Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra as it flows into India and Bangladesh, a lifeline for millions.
The dam would have implications for lower riparian states and the need for “utmost transparency” was strongly underlined, New Delhi said.
To that, China agreed to share with India emergency hydrological information on relevant rivers on humanitarian principles, China’s foreign ministry said.
Both sides agreed to engage an expert-level mechanism on cross-border rivers, and maintain communication to renew flood reporting arrangements, the ministry said.
Chinese officials had previously said hydropower projects in Tibet will not have a major impact on the environment or on downstream water supplies, but India and Bangladesh have nevertheless raised concerns.
Earlier on Tuesday, an Indian source said Wang had assured Jaishankar that Beijing was addressing three key Indian concerns — the need for fertilisers, rare earths and tunnel boring machines.
The Indian foreign and mines ministries and China’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><small>2025-08-20 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20152344524d4e2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932061/talks-expected-soon-between-pti-govt-officials-imrans-release-not-on-agenda' target='_blank'><strong>‘Talks expected soon between PTI, govt officials; Imran’s release not on agenda’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has said he expects negotiations between the PTI and the government to start in a few days, but Imran Khan’s release from jail would not be part of the discussion.
Since Imran’s incarceration last year in several cases, PTI’s relations with the government and the establishment have deteriorated sharply. Last year in November, protests by the party had escalated into violence amid state repression.
Subsequently, in December last year, Imran Khan had formed a five-member committee to hold talks with “anyone”, prompting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to set up a counterpart panel. Despite several rounds, however, the talks ended abruptly and without results. Ties have been further strained after several PTI leaders’ recent convictions in May 9 cases.
In an interview on DawnNews TV programme Doosra Rukh, aired on Tuesday night, the minister said that he saw negotiations “starting in a few days”.
“PTI leaders have contacted us as well as other leadership, and are convincing us that negotiations should open up again,” he said, adding that the opposition was also in consensus that they wanted “some pathway out” after the sentencing and disqualifications of PTI leadership in the wake of the May 9 riots.
He said that the negotiations would be held between the PTI’s team and a committee formed by the Speaker of the National Assembly, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.
He stressed, however, that these negotiations would not include a discussion on Imran’s release, as this was “not in the government’s power”.
“We have told them a dozen times to take the route of the courts, to prove his innocence in court,” he said. “His release is only possible that way. The government cannot provide him freedom or release in any way.”
He added that if there was any issue that party members wanted to discuss; if they wanted to talk about “political space or political issues”, such discussions would be welcome.
Malik also said that the PTI would have to “convince” them as to the necessity of forming a judicial commission for an investigation into May 9 at the current stage in the proceedings, as many cases had already been decided.
“If they have a convincing argument, then they can bring it to that session and convince us,” he said, adding that the evidence already provided in these cases was already admissible and had been taken into account in the trial stages.
 


Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9. In July, he filed an appeal in the Supreme Court after being denied bail by lower courts. That appeal has yet to be decided, with the hearing put off again today.
Earlier this month, PTI’s Opposition Leader in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, and Opposition Leader in the Senate, Shibli Faraz, were removed from their seats after being convicted in May 9 cases by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza, and other PTI lawmakers were similarly disqualified from their seats following their convictions in cases related to the riots.</p><small>2025-08-20 11:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20154429316b6da.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932065/data-protection-standards-issued-for-companies-to-safeguard-citizens-personal-information' target='_blank'><strong>Data protection standards issued for companies to safeguard citizens’ personal information</strong></a><br><p>The National Cyber Emergency Services Response Team (PKCERT) on Wednesday issued data protection guidelines for organisations handling citizens’ personal information, citing an increasingly insecure cyberspace environment.
PKCERT is a federal entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.
The advisory, applicable to companies holding Personally Identifiable Information (PII), prescribes immediate, medium- and long-term measures, which include classifying data sets based on their sensitivity, advanced encryption methods, multi-factor authentication, and others.
Organisations collecting, processing, storing, or transmitting PII may include “financial services, telecommunications and internet providers, commerce and logistics [companies], government agencies, healthcare institutions, educational entities, as well as third-party and outsourced service providers,” the notification said.
In its recommendations, PKCERT instructed companies to keep their PII handling systems updated, retain PII only for legally required durations, and dispose of outdated information lest it be stolen.
It also urged organisations to align their practices with the National Cyber Security Policy 2021 (NCSP) as well as the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016.
The NCSP “mandates safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of citizens’ personal data as a matter of national security and public trust,” reads the advisory.
 
 

PKCERT also called for an immediate review of the systems organisations have been using to handle PII, recommended security training for all staff handling personal information, as well as continuous monitoring to prevent unauthorised access.
 




Recomendations made by the PKCERT advisory.

Outlining possible vulnerabilities and threats, the cybersecurity body underscored the need for data protection, noting that in light of “the growing sophistication of cybercriminals, the widespread exploitation of misconfigured systems, and negligent data handling practices, urgent remediation measures are required.”
 


The advisory detailed that threat actors may include:

Cybercriminal Gangs: Monetising stolen PII via identity fraud, phishing kits, and dark web
marketplaces.
State-Sponsored APT Groups: Using compromised citizen data for surveillance, political manipulation, and intelligence gathering.
Hacktivists: Targeting organisations for ideological reasons, often leaking sensitive records publicly.
Malicious Insiders: Employees or contractors exploiting privileged access for personal gain or revenge.

According to PKCERT, inadequate data protection can lead to “identity theft, fraud, mass privacy breaches, operational disruption, erosion of public trust, national security risks and legal and regulatory consequences.”
In its recommendations to individuals, the advisory outlined preventative measures such as submitting CNIC and personal documents only when necessary, using strong passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and avoiding sharing personal information online.
In May, PKCERT issued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan had been stolen in a global data breach, and urged citizens to take immediate protective measures.
In March 2024, a Joint Investiga­tion Team (JIT) formed to probe a data leak from the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) had found that the credentials of as many as 2.7 million citizens had been compromised between 2019 and 2023.</p><small>2025-08-20 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/201503331ff0270.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932060/murtaza-solangi-appointed-spokesperson-for-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Murtaza Solangi appointed spokesperson for President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>Senior journalist and former caretaker information minister Murtaza Solangi has been appointed spokesperson for the President of Pakistan, he confirmed on Wednesday.
A former director general of Radio Pakistan, Solangi served as the caretaker minister for information and broadcasting from August 2023 to March 2024.
“Mr Murtaza Solangi is appointed as Spokesperson of the President of Pakistan on honorary/pro bono basis with immediate effect until further orders,” said a notification by the president’s secretary, Muhammad Shakeel Malik yesterday.
“A little personal news,” Solangi wrote on X today. “I have been appointed the Spokesperson of the President of Pakistan. I will assume my new responsibilities starting tomorrow. Thank you.”
 






During his tenure at Radio Pakistan from 2008 to 2013, Solangi oversaw a workforce spanning 64 broadcasting units and over 3,000 individuals. He also forged partnerships with international news organisations, including Voice of America, China Radio International, and Deutsche Welle.
He was the first Pakistani elected as the vice president and the acting president of Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union.
In 2011, he was bestowed with the Sitara-e-Imtiaz award by the President of Pakistan.</p><small>2025-08-20 10:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2011083125535a6.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932044/china-to-showcase-latest-military-hardware-at-september-parade' target='_blank'><strong>China to showcase latest military hardware at September parade</strong></a><br><p>China will unveil a slate of new domestically produced military hardware that will showcase its “powerful capability to prevail in modern war” at a parade next month, officials said on Wednesday.
The event, marking 80 years since the end of World War II, will see President Xi Jinping inspect troops in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and other world leaders expected to attend.
Millions of Chinese people were killed during a prolonged war with imperial Japan in the 1930s and 40s, which became part of a global conflict following Tokyo’s attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.
The ruling Communist Party has held a series of blockbuster events in recent years to commemorate its wartime resistance.
On September 3, China’s military will showcase its latest equipment, “reflecting the evolution of modern warfare”, said Major General Wu Zeke, an official at China’s military commission.
“All of the weapons and equipment taking part in this review were selected from domestically produced, currently active main battle systems, with a significant proportion being newly unveiled equipment,” Wu told reporters at a briefing.
These will include strategic heavy weapons, hypersonic precision systems, as well as unmanned and counter-unmanned equipment making their first public debut, he added.
The parade, which will last around 70 minutes, will “fully showcase our military’s powerful capability to prevail in modern war”, Wu said.
It will also feature ground troops marching in formation, armoured columns, aerial echelons and other high-tech fighting gear.
The Kremlin has confirmed Putin will attend, and Chinese officials said other world leaders are also expected to take in the scene.
China in March raised its defence spending for 2025 by 7.2 percent.
The increase comes as Beijing’s armed forces undergo rapid modernisation and eye deepening strategic competition with the United States.
China has the world’s second-largest military budget, but lags well behind the United States, its primary strategic rival.</p><small>2025-08-20 07:13</small></div><hr>
