According to the announcement, all services for non-EU citizens have been suspended, including visa appointments.
“All confirmed visa appointments for non-EU citizens for an undisclosed time are cancelled and will not be rescheduled,” the notice read. “Applicants will need to register again via our appointment system.”
 






A similar notice has been published on the consulate’s website.
The German Embassy in Islamabad has not issued a similar notice. Dawn.com has reached out to the embassy for comment.
Last month, United States consulates in Karachi and Lahore requested that all applicants for F, M or J nonimmigrant visas make their social media accounts public for vetting, after similar instructions were issued by the US Embassy in New Delhi.</p><small>2025-07-28 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/281923185fa10a4.jpg?r=192752' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927192/countrys-july-inflation-likely-to-remain-at-35-45pc-as-price-pressures-ease-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Country’s July inflation likely to remain at 3.5-4.5pc as price pressures ease: finance ministry</strong></a><br><p>The finance ministry on Monday projected consumer inflation for July to remain in a range of 3.5-4.5 per cent, citing stable prices and improved supply conditions, as price pressures ease further after the previous fiscal year’s sharp decline.
Inflation stood at 3.2pc in June, the ministry said in its monthly economic report, while average inflation for the fiscal year ending June 30 dropped to 4.49pc, a nine-year low, from 23.4pc the year before. The country’s fiscal year begins on July 1.
The ministry said the economy is expected to sustain its recovery in the early months of fiscal year 2026, underpinned by an improved macroeconomic backdrop and growing investor confidence.
Large-scale manufacturing likely maintained momentum in June, supported by rising private sector credit offtake and expanding production activity, the report said. The rebound is expected to lift imports of raw materials and intermediate goods, while aiding value-added exports, it added.
Strengthening domestic demand, a stable exchange rate, and steady global commodity prices were also likely to boost exports, remittances and imports in July, reinforcing external sector stability, the ministry said.
However, it warned that recent heavy rains could pose risks to agricultural output and supply chains, potentially impacting the inflation outlook in the coming months.
Since June  26, rain‑ and flood‑related incidents have killed at least 266 people and injured more than 630 nationwide, according to the National Disaster Management Authority, adding that 1,557 houses had been destroyed.
Last week, the Asian Deve­lopment Bank (ADB) projected Pakistan’s economy to grow at a steady pace of 3pc in FY26, even as it lowered growth forecasts for the broader Asian region amid global trade uncertainty.</p><small>2025-07-28 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/28182803e120d1c.jpg?r=182815' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927180/kasur-police-arrest-suspect-for-assaulting-minor-in-viral-video' target='_blank'><strong>Kasur police arrest suspect for assaulting minor in viral video</strong></a><br><p>Police on Monday arrested a man after footage showing him allegedly molesting a minor girl in Punjab’s Kasur district went viral online.
According to Kasur District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Isa Khan, the suspect was arrested in an injured condition.
“The suspect had molested a little girl playing in a street in Shah Inayat Colony three days ago,” the statement said.
DPO Khan took notice of the footage and directed Station House Officer Asif Javed to arrest the suspect within 24 hours, it added.
The police said that the suspect was caught at Dhanpat Road where he pulled out a pistol to escape arrest. However, he was shot during a firing exchange and was arrested in an injured condition, the statement said.
It added that the suspect had been taken to the Kasur District Hospital for treatment.
“According to the vision of the Punjab chief minister, sexual abuse of women and innocent children will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” the statement said.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country last year, according to a civil society report. The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.
 
 

In January of 2018, police recovered the body of six-year-old Zainab Amin from a heap of trash in Kasur, five days after she went missing. A postmortem examination suggested that she may have been raped before she was strangled to death.
The case sparked outrage across the nation and forced the government into action in finding the serial rapist and killer.
The culprit, identified as Imran Ali, was convicted of the rape and murder case and sentenced to death. He was hanged to death in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Central Jail on Oct 17, 2018.
The heinous nature of the crime had seen immediate riots break out in Kasur — in which two people were killed — while #JusticeforZainab became a rallying cry for an end to violence against children.
More than two years after the Zainab case, the National Assembly passed the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, 2019 that seeks to expedite investigation and punishment for perpetrators of child abuse.</p><small>2025-07-28 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/28172410e260042.jpg?r=173924' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927163/india-plans-to-use-detained-pakistanis-in-fake-encounters-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>India plans to use detained Pakistanis in ‘fake encounters’: state media</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani security sources said on Monday that India has once again begun “fake encounters” under the guise of countering terrorism, with an alleged plan to “use” detained Pakistanis in them, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The statement came after the Indian Army’s Chinar Corps said they killed three alleged “terrorists” under ‘Operation Mahadev’ in occupied Kashmir’s Srinagar. While Indian media, citing sources, has been linking one of the dead to the Pahalgam attack, no official has stated that on record.
The April 22 attack in held Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people and sparked heavy fighting between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, as New Delhi blamed the attack on Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation.
India had launched Operation Sindoor in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, which included the deadly strikes launched on Pakistan on May 7.
“After the failure of Operation Sindoor, India has once again initiated fake encounters under the guise of Operation Mahadev,” security sources said today.
Operation Mahadev has been “launched to conceal the setbacks of Operation Sindoor”, the security sources said, adding that the “Indian regime is allegedly preparing to use innocent Pakistanis, illegally and forcibly detained, in staged encounters, falsely portraying them as cross-border terrorists”.
 






India has seen fake encounters as far back as 2015. The National Human Rights Commission of India — a quasi-judicial body — identified 555 instances between 2008 and 2013, but activists say the actual count is even higher.
 
 

The objective of Operation Mahadev is to suppress the “growing freedom movement” in India-occupied Kashmir and to restore the “waning political credibility” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, the security sources added.
They said India was attempting to present Operation Mahadev as a “successful military initiative to erase the embarrassment of Operation Sindoor”.
The security sources highlighted that “immediately following the Pahalgam false flag operation, the Indian Army reportedly began a series of staged encounters”.
The sources further said that on April 24, two citizens of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muhammad Farooq and Muhammad Deen, were “martyred in a brutal encounter by Indian forces after mistakenly crossing the border”.
Indian forces in occupied Kashmir arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes of pro-freedom Kashmiris in a sweeping crackdown following the Pahalgam incident.
 
 

The Radio Pakistan report, recalling the press briefings held on April 29 and April 30 by military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, read that he “revealed details of 723 Pakistani nationals illegally detained in various Indian jails”.
“Additionally, 56 Pakistanis are said to be held in secret custody by Indian intelligence agencies.”
The security sources noted: “As is customary, following these alleged fake encounters, videos and photographs of the deceased, alongside planted weapons, are circulated in Indian media to support the official narrative.
“Reliable reports suggest that these detainees may be coerced into making anti-Pakistan statements and confessions before the media,” they added.
“Operation Mahadev appears to be a continuation of the Indian Army’s long-standing practice of fake encounters in IIOJK (Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir), where it has gained notoriety as a ‘fake encounter specialist’,” the sources said.
“India, having faced humiliation in the Pahalgam false flag operation and the failure of Operation Sindoor, now seems completely disoriented,” the security sources added.
Indian army says three suspected fighters killed in held-Kashmir
Earlier today, the Indian Army said its security forces killed three suspected fighters in India-occupied Kashmir during a clash in a wildlife reserve.
The Press Trust of India reported that the incident occurred in the Mulnar area of Harwan near the Dachigam National Park, around 30 kilometres from the disputed region’s main city of Srinagar.
“Three terrorists have been neutralised in an intense firefight,” the Indian army claimed in a statement on X.  “Operation continues,” it added.
 






The incident took place near the major Hindu shrine of Amarnath, to which more than 350,000 people from across India have travelled as part of an ongoing pilgrimage.
The army did not immediately identify those killed, but a police officer told AFP on condition of anonymity that they were all “foreigners”.
Security forces have been hunting for the Pahalgam attackers, but they remain at large.
Clashes between fighters and government forces have drastically reduced during the last five years, but many local fighters have been killed since the Pahalgam attack.
Last month, the Global Peace Index 2025 placed the disputed region of Kashmir at the forefront of the critical escalation hotspots in the world.
 
 

The index released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) with headquarters in Sydney, stated that the situation in occupied Kashmir exemplified the fragility of ceasefire agreements in volatile geographic settings and underscored the dangers posed by non-state actors capable of triggering international crises.
The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been at the heart of the hostility between old rivals India and Pakistan, both of whom claim the region in full and have fought two of their three wars over it.
India accuses Pakistan of helping Kashmiri fighters, but Pakistan denies this and says it only provides diplomatic and moral support to Kashmiris seeking self-determination.
India’s defence minister denies bowing to pressure to end fighting
Meanwhile, India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that New Delhi had ended its military conflict with Pakistan in May as it had met all its objectives and had not responded to pressure, rejecting United States President Donald Trump’s stance that he brokered the truce.
Singh was speaking today at the opening of a discussion in parliament on the Pahalgam attack.
“India halted its operation because all the political and military objectives studied before and during the conflict had been fully achieved,” Singh said. “To suggest that the operation was called off under pressure is baseless and entirely incorrect.”
Pakistan thanked Trump for brokering the agreement, but India said Washington had no hand in it and that New Delhi and Islamabad had agreed between themselves to end the fighting.
During today’s parliament session, Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi slammed Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, noting that it had been 100 days since the Pahalgam attack but the government “has not been able to catch those five terrorists”, ANI reported.
Indian opposition groups have questioned what they say is the intelligence failure behind the Pahalgam attack and the government’s inability to capture the assailants — issues they are expected to raise during the parliamentary discussion.
They have also criticised Modi for coming under pressure from Trump and agreeing to end the conflict, along with Indian jets being shot down during the fighting.
Pakistan said it downed six Indian planes in air-to-air combat. India’s highest-ranking general said in late May that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.</p><small>2025-07-28 13:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/28174524aa20d5d.jpg?r=174734' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927185/jaffar-express-derailed-by-explosion-near-shikarpur' target='_blank'><strong>Jaffar Express derailed by explosion near Shikarpur</strong></a><br><p>Three coaches of the Jaffar Express train were derailed near Shikarpur in Sindh due to an explosion on Monday, leaving one injured, The Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
According to the report, rescue teams from Sukkur were dispatched to start repair work after the incident.
Sukkur Railways Divisional Superintendent Jamshaid Alam said that the Jaffar Express was travelling from Peshawar to Quetta when it was caught in the explosion near Sultanpur.
“Following the blast, train operations have been suspended,” Alam said, adding that passengers “faced serious difficulties due to the train’s derailment”.
Railways officials stated that it may take up to another five hours to restore the track.
Meanwhile, the Sindh government authorities have taken notice of the explosion on the track and ordered an investigation.
This is not the first time the train service has been attacked.
In June, the detonation of a remote-controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks derailed four bogies of the Jaffar Express near the cattle market in Jacobabad.
No one was hurt in the incident, but the attack was reportedly claimed by the banned Baloch Repu­blican Guards in a statement.
On March 11, the train became the target of an unprecedented hijacking, when terrorists fired on the locomotive and took over 400 passengers hostage.
Media reports said that security forces had surrounded the area and launched a clearance operation to rescue all passengers. Radio Pakistan reported that security forces had rescued 80 hostages held by the terrorists.
Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the clearance operation, launched after the train’s unprecedented hijacking in Balochistan, ended with all 33 terrorists being killed.</p><small>2025-07-28 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/28175441185d988.jpg?r=183445' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927183/new-us-acting-envoy-discusses-economic-ties-with-finance-minister-aurangzeb' target='_blank'><strong>New US acting envoy discusses economic ties with Finance Minister Aurangzeb</strong></a><br><p>United States Chargé d’Affaires in Pakistan and acting top diplomat Elizabeth Horst on Monday met Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in Islamabad, according to a press release by the Finance Division.
On Thursday, the  US State Department appointed Elizabeth Horst as the acting ambassador to Pakistan.
Horst, a senior career diplomat, was serving as the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs before arriving in Pakistan to take charge of her position.
“Horst welcomed the economic progress and the government’s reform-driven approach, emphasising the US commitment to strengthening economic and trade ties with Pakistan,” the press release said.
The meeting served as an opportunity to exchange views on matters of mutual interest and to reaffirm the positive trajectory of bilateral relations between Pakistan and the US.
The finance minister expressed appreciation for the longstanding support extended by the US towards Pakistan’s economic development. He particularly lauded the continued US support for macroeconomic stability achieved over the past year and a half, and welcomed the healthy momentum in bilateral engagement across various sectors.
“Recalling his recent visit to the United States, the minister shared insights from his productive meetings with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer in Washington, DC,” the statement continued
He noted the encouraging progress in deepening trade and economic ties between the two countries.
Aurangzeb underscored the importance of the US as Pakistan’s largest trading partner and highlighted Pakistan’s keen interest in broadening bilateral cooperation beyond traditional sectors. He specifically pointed to the promising potential in information technology, minerals, and agriculture as avenues for mutually beneficial collaboration.
The finance minister also briefed Horst on Pakistan’s recent macroeconomic indicators, including sovereign rating upgrades and renewed investor confidence.
He outlined the government’s reform agenda focused on critical areas such as taxation and energy, aimed at unlocking sustainable, long-term economic growth.
“Furthermore, he shared updates on Pakistan’s successful entry into Middle Eastern capital markets, its upcoming plans for issuing the inaugural Panda bond, and future access to euro and US dollar markets,” the press release added.
 
 

The acting US ambassador reiterated US support for continued economic and political stability in Pakistan and expressed optimism for an enduring and robust business partnership between the two nations.
The meeting concluded with a mutual commitment to building on the momentum of current engagements to further deepen bilateral cooperation.
Last week, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio lauded Pakistan’s role in “global and regional peace” in his first meeting with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, the Foreign Office (FO) had said.

Mandi Bahauddin Police Sub-Inspector Zohaib Warraich confirmed the incident, stating: “A deeply tragic event took place in Asadullahpur village where a young man shot and killed his parents and wife.
“Evidence has been collected, and search teams have been formed. The suspect will be arrested soon.”
A first information report (FIR) was registered at the Bhagat police station under Section 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, the police “received a call about the suspect allegedly shooting and killing his father, mother, and wife over a disagreement involving the sale proceeds of agricultural land”.
The deceased father had recently sold four kanals of agricultural land for approximately Rs20 million. His son, who returned to his native area from Kuwait just four days ago, demanded his share of the sale proceeds from his father, police said.
But as his father refused, the man pulled out a pistol in a fit of rage and opened fire. As a result, his 75-year-old father, 70-year-old mother, and 35-year-old wife died on the spot. The suspect fled the scene with the murder weapon, according to the FIR.
A police team from Bhagat police station arrived at the scene immediately and started an investigation. The bodies were taken to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital for an autopsy.
Police cordoned off the crime scene to collect evidence, and a forensic team was summoned, per the police.
 
 

Mandi Bahauddin District Police Officer (DPO) Waseem Riaz Khan visited the scene of the incident and instructed police to immediately apprehend the suspect.
Punjab Inspector General (IG) Dr Usman Anwar took notice of the incident and sought a report from DPO Riaz and Gujranwala Regional Police Officer (RPO) Tayyab Hafeez Cheema.
The IG directed the police officers to apprehend the suspect without delay and bring him to justice while also instructing them to provide legal assistance to the aggrieved family.
Earlier this month, four members of a woman’s family were shot dead in Nowshera’s Tatara area, allegedly by her husband and in-laws over a domestic dispute, police said.
In February, a man and his sons killed three women and injured three others of his brother’s family over a property dispute in the suburbs of Sargodha.</p><small>2025-07-28 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2817564408cdc2a.jpg?r=175659' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927128/thailand-and-cambodia-agree-truce-after-5-days-of-fighting' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand and Cambodia agree truce after 5 days of fighting</strong></a><br><p>Thailand and Cambodia’s leaders agreed to an “unconditional” ceasefire on Monday, after five days of combat along their jungle-clad frontier that has killed at least 36 people.
More than 200,000 people have fled as the two sides fired artillery, rockets and guns in a battle over the long-disputed area, which is home to a smattering of ancient temples.
The flare-up was the deadliest since violence raged sporadically from 2008-2011 over the territory, claimed by both sides because of a vague demarcation made by Cambodia’s French colonial administrators in 1907.
Reading a joint statement from the leaders of both countries after peace talks, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said they had agreed “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire” with effect from midnight on Monday (10pm PKT).
“This is a vital first step towards de-escalation and the restoration of peace and security,” he said at a press conference in Malaysia’s administrative capital Putrajaya, flanked by Thai acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai and Cambodia’s PM Hun Manet.
 


Anwar said a meeting of military commanders from both sides would take place on Tuesday morning, before the countries’ cross-border committee would meet in Cambodia on August 4.
As the deal was being announced, an AFP journalist in the Cambodian city of Samraong — 17 kilometres from the fraught frontier — reported hearing continuing artillery blasts.
‘Very good results’
US President Donald Trump — who both nations are courting for trade deals to avert the threat of eye-watering tariffs — intervened over the weekend, and said both sides had agreed to “quickly work out” a truce.
“Today we had a very good meeting and very good results,” said Cambodia’s Hun Manet, thanking Trump for his “decisive” support and saying the truce would serve as “a foundation for future de-escalation”.
Ahead of the summit, Thailand and Cambodia had traded fresh fire and barbed accusations.
Cambodia’s defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said it was “the fifth day that Thailand has invaded Cambodia’s territory with heavy weapons and with the deployment of a lot of troops”.
 
 

As he departed Bangkok airport, Phumtham told reporters he did not believe Cambodia was “acting in good faith”.
After the talks hosted by Anwar — chair of the ASEAN bloc of which both Thailand and Cambodia are members — Phumtham called for the truce to be “carried out in good faith by both sides”.
“Thailand decides for peaceful resolution, while continuing to protect our sovereignty and the lives of our people,” he said.
‘Highly tense’
On the eve of the talks, Thailand’s military said Cambodian snipers were camped in one of the contested temples, and accused Phnom Penh of surging troops along the border and hammering Thai territory with rockets.
It said there was fighting at seven areas in the rural region, marked by a ridge of hills surrounded by wild jungle and fields where locals farm rubber and rice.
“The situation remains highly tense, and it is anticipated that Cambodia may be preparing for a major military operation prior to entering negotiations,” the Thai military statement read.
Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn marked his 73rd birthday on Monday, but a notice in the country’s Royal Gazette said his public celebrations scheduled for Bangkok’s Grand Palace had been cancelled amid the strife.
Trump has threatened both countries with high levies in his global tariff blitz unless they agree to independent trade deals — but said he would “look forward” to signing them once “peace is at hand”.
Each side had already agreed to a truce in principle, while accusing the other of undermining peace efforts and trading allegations about the use of cluster bombs and targeting of hospitals.
Nationalist sentiment
Thailand says nine of its soldiers and 14 civilians have been killed, while Cambodia has confirmed eight civilian and five military deaths.
The Thai military said it had returned the bodies of 12 Cambodian soldiers killed in combat.
More than 138,000 people have fled Thailand’s border regions, while around 140,000 have been driven from their homes in Cambodia.
With the skirmish enflaming nationalist sentiments, Thailand warned its citizens to “refrain from any kind of violence, whether in speech or action” against Cambodian migrants living in the country.</p><small>2025-07-28 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2816151887c0daa.jpg?r=161533' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927142/fact-check-viral-video-of-firing-on-demonstrators-is-not-from-kps-tirah-valley-but-july-2024-bannu-rally-violence' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video of firing on demonstrators is not from KP’s Tirah Valley but July 2024 Bannu rally violence</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple users and politicians on social media platform X on Sunday shared a video of children ducking to the ground as firing could be heard in the background, claiming it was footage from firing on demonstrators in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah Valley. However, the video was shared as far back as July 2024 when demonstrators at a Bannu peace rally were fired upon.
A day ago, seven people were shot after a protest outside a military installation in Tirah took a violent turn. Hundreds of tribesmen had brought the body of a girl, who they claimed was killed in a mortar strike in the Darbar locality of Peer Mela in Zakhakhel a day earlier, to the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz.
The situation turned violent when an angry mob, comprising mostly young men, ignored calls by local elders to remain calm. They first torched an excavator parked outside Brigade Headquarters, and then tried to force open the garrison’s main gate. Security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly opened fire to control the crowd.
There was no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike or the deaths.
On Sunday, PTI KP President Junaid Akbar shared a video on X featuring a group of people, including children, ducking to the ground as firing could be heard in the background.
The caption of the post read: “During the peace march in Tirah Valley, as a result of firing on unarmed tribal elders, youths, and innocent children, seven innocent individuals, including children, were martyred, and several others were injured. No religion, state, or law permits the killing of innocent children even during war. Consider and reflect: will this act of the state reduce or increase terrorism? Do the rulers have any sense of awareness? To what extent are the distances growing between the Pashtuns, bullets, and the state?”
The video, shared at 4:10pm, gained 203,700 views.
The video with the same claim was also shared by Qasim Khan Suri, former deputy speaker of the National Assembly, on Instagram with the caption: “These are not visuals from Gaza but from Tirah Valley of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa … innocent Pakistanis are being targeted for minerals worth Rs8 billion.”
The post was viewed over 79,000 times and gained over 5,000 reactions.
Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari also shared the video on X with the caption: “Where is KP govt and KP chief minister? This is on your watch.”
The post was viewed over 70,000 times.
The video was also shared by former anchor Imran Riaz Khan, PTI leaders Mirza Shahzad Akbar and Amir Mughal, and other social media users as seen here, here, here and here, racking up over 900,000 views collectively.
The clip was also shared by an Indian propaganda account, gathering nearly 10,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality, keen public interest in the evolving situation in Tirah Valley and to address the potential harmful impact of such videos.
Investigating the social media posts that shared the video showed comments from users who flagged the clip as being old.
One X user provided a screenshot of a post featuring the same video, which was dated July 2024 and shared with the hashtag “Bannu Peace March”.
 


Akbar, who shared the video on his X account at 8:39pm, also later at night clarified that the clip was from Bannu.
 


A keyword search for “Bannu Peace March” and “NCRC” to corroborate the responses in the comments yielded the same video shared on X by a local news outlet focusing on Pakhtun rights, on July 23, 2024, with the caption: “A viral video on social media showed children participating in a peace protest in Bannu last Friday where the Pakistan army opened a straight fire, killing a young man and injuring 27, including several kids.”
The authenticity of the video could not be confirmed because it was not shared elsewhere or by any credible media outlets.
However, a keyword search to corroborate the post’s caption led to a news article by Dawn published on July 20, 2024, titled: “One killed, scores hurt as violence mars Bannu rally”.
As per the report, one person was killed and over a dozen others were injured in Bannu city when gunfire caused a stampede at a peace rally, attended by thousands demanding security in the region.
Quoting eyewitnesses, the report stated that tensions escalated when the crowd marched towards the Bannu cantonment, setting fire to tents set up by security forces. “According to official accounts, shots were fired from an adjoining area towards the tents. Security forces returned the fire, and in the ensuing gunfire and melee, at least one person was killed and scores were injured,” it added.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows recent firing at demonstrators in KP’s Tirah Valley is misleading. The video was shared as far back as July 2024, when violence broke out at a Bannu peace rally and demonstrators were fired at.

Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu this month.
Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com: “A terrorist group was attempting to plant an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Nurar area.”
Upon receiving timely information, police and security forces took immediate action and surrounded the area, he added.
During the action, the police targeted the terrorists through drones and thwarted their plans.
“According to initial reports, the terrorists were killed while attempting to plant the IED,” the police official added.
“Bannu police are fully alert and ready to deal with any kind of threat, and all resources are being utilised to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the public,” DPO Kulachi said.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.
Last week, in a series of assaults in KP, a police official was martyred in Karak district while police thwarted a separate late-night terrorist assault on a police station in the Basyakhel area of Bannu, officials said.
Also last week, a Frontier Corps constable was killed and two others were injured when terrorists attacked their vehicle in the Daryoba area of Bannu district, according to the police.</p><small>2025-07-28 10:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/28144407f890589.jpg?r=144705' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927159/pakistan-and-kyrgyzstan-agree-to-enhance-trade-volume-up-to-100m' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan agree to enhance trade volume up to $100m</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan reaffirmed an agreement to enhance their bilateral trade volume up to $100 million at a session of their inter-governmental commission on Monday.
Pakistan and the Kyrgyz Republic share longstanding relations, founded on deep-rooted cultural, historical and spiritual affinities. However, the bilateral trade volume has declined significantly, from $11.2m in 2022-23 to $5.18m in 2024-25.
Addressing the fifth session of the Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade-Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation, Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari said: “We acknowledge the pressing need to revitalise our trade engagement and reaffirm our shared aspiration to elevate bilateral trade up to $100m.”
He added that Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan’s trade and economic relations would continue to serve as a foundation of their bilateral partnership.
Kyrgyzstan’s Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers Edil Baisalov was present at the session, along with delegates from the Kyrgyz Republic and Pakistan.
Leghari extended appreciation to the Kyrgyz delegates for their continued engagement and commitment to a “prosperous and interconnected future for the two nations”, noting the progress made across various sectors since the formalisation of their economic relationship in 1994.
“This session marks yet another important milestone in our collective journey of strengthening and institutionalising our bilateral partnership,” he said.
 
 

“Under the framework of this commission, our cooperation has steadily expanded across a broad spectrum — ranging from trade and investment to tourism, agriculture, energy, science and technology and education.
“It is heartening to witness the growing momentum, despite the challenges that continue to affect global and regional economic landscapes,” the minister added.
He highlighted the need for consistent and collaborative efforts between the two countries across multiple sectors to achieve their goals.
“The revival of the Pakistan-Kyrgyz Joint Business Council, sustained business-to-business (B2B) interactions, and the early finalisation of a key Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on electronic data interchange between customs authorities, are essential steps forward,” he said.
Leghari took positive note of the inaugural meeting of the Joint Working Group on Trade and Investment, saying that the two parties were now looking ahead to expediting progress on the Pakistan-Kyrgyz Transit Trade Agreement, a key initiative aimed at “enhancing regional connectivity and facilitating seamless cross-border trade”.
He added that the signing of an MoU and cooperation in halal trade were a step towards achieving shared goals.
Leghari stated that investment remained a key area of priority and potential for both countries, drawing attention to the signing of the MoU between the National Investments Agency of Kyrgyzstan and the Board of Investment of Pakistan.
He said that the agreement provided a “solid foundation for targeted engagement” in high-potential sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, minerals, tourism, and information technology.
He appreciated Kyrgyzstan’s offer of access to the At-Bashi Logistics Centre for Pakistan’s National Logistics Corporation (NLC), saying that it stood “as a commendable example of enterprise-level cooperation, and one that we also hope to replicate across other domains”.
To foster broader private sector participation, he encouraged both sides to enhance the online visibility of investment opportunities by providing comprehensive and up-to-date information on Special Economic Zones, tax incentives, and priority sectors.
Leghari said that tourism and cultural exchange served as “powerful conduits” for deepening people-to-people connectivity.
“Both Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan, endowed with stunning natural landscapes and rich cultural heritage, stand to gain significantly from closer collaboration in this domain,” he said.
“We look forward to finalising the MoU on tourism, hospitality, and investment, and to expanding the exchange of tour operators and tourism-related information, including active participation in international exhibitions.”
He called the signing of an MoU on cooperation in the field of agriculture a “pivotal step” towards promoting trade in Kyrgyz legumes and the export of Pakistan’s basmati rice, among other value-added food products.
“Enhanced collaboration on veterinary and phytosanitary controls will further facilitate safe and efficient food trade,” he added.
 
 

The minister noted both Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan shared a vision of green and sustainable development, adding that they were aligned on exploring Pakistan’s participation in the proposed 500-kilovolt Torugart–XUAR–Gilgit-Baltistan transmission line, which would establish a strategic Kyrgyzstan–China–Pakistan electricity grid.
He also welcomed Kyrgyz interest in investing in Pakistan’s mining sector, particularly in copper and gold exploration.
The minister stressed that strengthening transport and communication infrastructure remained “critical for the realisation of our economic potential”.
“We anticipate progress on the postal cooperation agreement, operationalisation of cargo under the 1995 International Motor Transportation Agreement, and improvements in e-commerce connectivity,” he said, adding that he was encouraged by discussions on expanding air and rail links, including flight frequency increases.
He called attention to the financial sector, saying that it served as a vital engine for economic growth.
“We appreciate the mutual interest in enhancing inter-bank and financial cooperation, particularly in Islamic banking and financial innovation,” he said.
He also praised the recent agreement between the State Bank of Pakistan and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic for joint training programmes, calling it “a constructive step toward deepening institutional collaboration”.
He added that the health sector also offered significant and strategic opportunities for advancing bilateral cooperation, saying, “We remain optimistic about the early finalisation of the MoU on higher medical education.”
The minister commended Kyrgyzpharmacia for its engagement with Pakistani pharmaceutical firms, particularly in exploring the supply of Pakistani pharmaceutical products to the Kyrgyz Republic and potential joint ventures in vaccine production in collaboration with the National Institute of Health.
He further underscored the importance of regulatory alignment and the need to streamline the registration process for Pakistani medicines in Kyrgyzstan, saying that they would help ensure timely access and promote greater commercial collaboration in the health sector.
“The cultural sector serves as a vital bridge, fostering mutual understanding and enriching the shared heritage between our nations. It is essential that we translate these affinities into formal institutional mechanisms.”
Leghari asserted that the finalisation of the Agreement on Culture and the organisation of joint cultural events would “significantly deepen” connections.
He also highlighted youth engagement as a “dynamic platform for cultivating future leaders and strengthening the bonds of friendship” between the countries, saying that younger generations could be empowered to advance the partnership via conferences, seminars on youth policy issues, and “the exchange of experiences”.
“Education forms the cornerstone of our partnership, serving as a catalyst for knowledge exchange and capacity building to advance sustainable development,” the minister said. “Our efforts remain focused on collaboration in STEM training, academic exchanges, and joint research initiatives.”
Leghari reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting Kyrgyz students through the Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme (PTAP), encouraging the strengthening of institutional partnerships between the two countries’ universities.
The minister said in his concluding remarks that the commission’s fifth session offered a renewed opportunity to “transform (the countries’) shared vision into enduring outcomes”.
“Let us reaffirm our commitment to fostering a stronger, integrated, and resilient partnership, anchored in mutual respect, cooperation, and regional peace,” he said.
Alongside bilateral relations, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan are both members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa­tion, a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose other members include China, Russia, India, and Iran.
Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia’s naval chief met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi last Thursday, while Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir met with Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.</p><small>2025-07-28 10:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/28135856a0c340d.jpg?r=140050' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927139/babusar-highway-partially-reopened-as-search-operations-continue-in-gb' target='_blank'><strong>Babusar Highway partially reopened as search operations continue in GB</strong></a><br><p>The Babusar Highway was partially reopened on Monday as the search for missing people continued after heavy rains last week prompted flash floods in Gilgit-Baltistan.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
On July 21, floods swept across GB, causing landslides and leaving many stranded, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure. At least 10 people died and four were injured as a result.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: “The Babusar-Naran Highway has been reopened for one-way traffic.”
He noted that heavy machinery was used to reopen it, while work for complete restoration was underway. He also advised passengers to be cautious and avoid unnecessary travel.
Faraq further said, “Several families, including five members of a TV anchor’s family, have contacted the government about the missing people and appealed for help in the search.”
The wallet of the TV anchor Shabana Liaquat was found among the flood debris, which also included her and her child’s student cards, he added.
“The provincial government has enlisted the help of Pakistan Army sniffer dogs to search for those buried under the rubble,” the spokesperson said.
Separately, the National Highway Authority (NHA) initiated swift road restoration operations in northern areas after orders by Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan, APP reported.
 
 

Aleem said that key highways, including the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad (N-15) and Skardu-Jaglot Road, were blocked due to landslides and cloudburst. “NHA teams have cleared multiple obstruction points, ensuring partial restoration of traffic and improved accessibility for travellers,” he said.
The minister described the 242-kilometre-long N-15 as a “critical route for tourism and regional connectivity”, which was blocked at various locations.
According to officials, landslides along the route were successfully cleared, while restoration work from Naran to Babusar Top and Chilas was ongoing, he added.
Communication Secretary Ali Sher Mehsud and NHA chairman were present on-site to oversee the restoration activities, the report said.
“We are committed to restoring all major highways at the earliest,” Mehsud said, adding that travel towards Kaghan and Naran had resumed.
NHA managed to clear 20 out of 25 landslide-affected points on the Skardu-Jaglot Road.
“To maintain pace, NHA has placed all field officers on 24-hour alert, cancelled staff leave and activated its emergency response plan across Gilgit-Baltistan. Heavy machinery remains operational across the region to tackle any further disruptions,” the report added.
NDMA issues alert for rains
Separately, the National Disaster Management Authority issued an alert for the northern areas of the country, predicting rainfall from July 28 to 31 and warning about risks of urban flooding, glacial surges and landslides, APP reported.
It advised citizens to avoid travelling to vulnerable areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.
 


According to the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC), rain was expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, and Shigar areas of GB, as well as in Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, and Bagh in Azad Jammu and Kashmir during the forecast period.
“These rains may lead to flooding, while heavy showers in hilly regions may also trigger landslides,” it stated.
In Chitral Valley, Buni and Reshun areas, rainfall combined with melting glaciers may raise the water flow of River Chitral, according to NEOC. “Urban flooding is also likely in Muzaffarabad and Bagh due to heavy downpours,” it added.</p><small>2025-07-28 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/281506239baacf9.png?r=151027' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927149/kp-govt-says-cm-in-contact-with-administration-over-tirah-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>KP govt says CM ‘in contact’ with administration over Tirah shooting</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Monday said Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur was “in contact” with the relevant administration over the incident of protesters being shot in Khyber district’s Tirah Valley.
Seven people were shot on Sunday after a demonstration outside the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz against the death of a minor girl in a mortar strike in Tirah’s Zakhakhel.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by khawarij” — a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to sources and protesters, security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.
Besides the seven killed, at least 16 others also received bullet injuries, sources said. There has been no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike or Sunday’s killings.
“The chief minister is in constant contact with the relevant administration,” CM Gandapur’s public relations adviser, Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, said in a statement today.
He said the KP chief minister was “monitoring” the Tirah incident himself. “The KP government is extremely saddened over the incident,” Saif added.
“The provincial government is standing side by side with the affected families in this moment of sorrow and grief,” the official asserted.
 






Saif also again slammed the KP opposition parties for not attending a multi-party conference (MPC) held last week over the security situation in the province, stressing that the moot had been organised “to prevent such incidents”.
The statement recalled that the provincial government will be holding a series of jirgas with tribal elders next week, including one in Peshawar. This is also based on the MPC’s decision to convene a jirga comprising elders, parliamentarians and stakeholders from each district.
According to CM Gandapur, a grand jirga, whose members will be nominated by the first jirga, would be organised 15 days after that to devise a strategy to implement the MPC’s declaration.
Protest and shooting
On Sunday, hundreds of tribesmen had brought the body of a girl, who they claimed was killed in a mortar strike in the Darbar locality of Peer Mela in Zakhakhel a day earlier, to the Brigade Headquarters.
 
 

Sources and eye-witnesses said the situation turned violent when an angry mob, comprising mostly young men, ignored calls by local elders to remain calm.
They first torched an excavator parked outside Brigade Headquarters, then tried to force open its main gate, following which security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly opened fire to control the crowd, according to sources.
However, in a statement from his office, PM Shehbaz said TTP terrorists were behind the incident as he expressed his grief over the “martyrdom of innocent and peaceful civilians”. The statement, carried by state-run Radio Pakistan and APP, did not mention any protest.
He directed the authorities to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured.
“The nefarious designs of terrorists cannot shake our resolve,” the premier asserted, reaffirming the government’s commitment to eliminate terrorists and terrorism.
 






Videos circulating on social media showed an excavator on fire. Some protesters were also seen pelting stones at the Brigade Headquarters while trying to forcibly open the main gate. In the footage, protesters could be seen running for cover as gunshots rang out.
The injured were transported to the Frontier Corps Hospital in Shah Kas Jamrud, Dogra Hospital in Bara and Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar. One of the injured is said to be in critical condition.
Following the incident, security officials met with a delegation of Tirah elders at Brigade Headquarters and announced compensation for the victims on their demand. The KP government has also announced separate Rs10 million for the deceased and Rs2.5m for the injured.
Security officials said the local sector commander met with the Tirah elders and assured them of his full support in meeting their legitimate demands.
PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi from NA-27 Khyber and MPA Abdul Ghani, while backing the protesters’ stance, have demanded a transparent judicial enquiry into the incident. The lawmakers and their supporters also held a protest at Bab-i-Khyber in Jamrud yesterday against the shooting incident.
 






Residents in Peer Mela have claimed that mortar shelling by security forces has so far killed at least three persons over the last 10 days. They claimed that mortars were being fired as security forces conducted operations against armed militant groups in Zakhakhel, Shalobar, Adakhel and Malakdin Khel localities.
While a report on the mortar strike that was being protested could not be found, similar incidents in the Zakhakhel area took place in April this year and December 2024, killing a child in each.
Recently, two children were killed on July 22 in a mortar shell blast in Raghzai village of the Tank district, Rescue 1122 said.
 
 

Tribal elders in Tirah and some other KP districts have long opposed any military operation, citing concerns over displacement.
Earlier this month, a massive rally of peace campaigners from Tirah Valley and Bara tehsil of the Khyber tribal district opposed an imminent military operation in Tirah. Tribal elders have also ardently criticised terrorist groups, recently deciding not to pay them any ushr (tax).</p><small>2025-07-28 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2814471205dc4e1.jpg?r=144719' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927147/unidentified-bodies-of-man-woman-recovered-from-karachis-china-port-police' target='_blank'><strong>Unidentified bodies of man, woman recovered from Karachi’s China Port: police</strong></a><br><p>The unidentified bodies of a man and a woman were recovered from Karachi’s China Port area on Monday, police said.
The deceased remain unidentified, but their age was estimated to be between 25 and 30 years old, according to South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza.
“There are bullet marks on the body,” he said, adding that two 9mm shells were also recovered from the site of the incident.
“Evidence is being collected from the crime scene,” the DIG said. “The identification of the deceased and further investigation are underway.”
Situated near Clifton beach, China Port, also known as Oyster Rocks or the South Asia Pakistan Terminal (SAPT) breakwater, is a man-made structure built by China to protect the port from waves. It’s a popular spot for locals, offering views of the port, cargo ships, and cranes.
Last month, a partially decomposed body of a young man was found in a desolate area in Karachi’s Scheme 33.
Sachal Station House Officer Aurangzeb Khattak had said the body of the man, who appeared to be in his mid-20s, was recovered from bushes outside the wall of Karachi University’s Teachers Society near the Superhighway.
The body bore marks of torture, he said, adding that the victim had sustained head injuries. The officer hinted at the possibility that the body might have been thrown there by suspects travelling in a car. The corpse was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital but his identity could not be ascertained immediately.
In February, the body of a trader, who was allegedly kidnapped, was found at Seaview.
Last year, the bodies of a man and a woman were recovered from a pond inside the sprawling Bagh Ibne Qasim in Clifton on the second day of Eidul Azha.

No tourists were killed or injured in the shooting incident, said Sanong Saengmani, a police official in Bangkok’s Bang Sue district, where the market that mainly sells agricultural produce is located.
Tourism is a key economic driver in Thailand, Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, where growth has been sluggish and such incidents can potentially dampen sentiment.

In 2024 and 2025, the country’s major cities have been lashed by record-breaking downpours, overwhelming fragile drainage systems and displacing thousands. The latest wave of flooding in 2025 has already claimed the lives of at least 242 people, with more fatalities feared as fresh storms loom.
These floods, while destructive, highlight a squandered opportunity — the inability to store excess water. Limited dam storage and poor urban watershed management result in the loss of floodwaters as runoff, rather than their storage for dry spells.
Climate scientists have repeatedly warned about extreme weather volatility, with floods and droughts alternating as the new normal for South Asia. Without resilient water storage infrastructure and rainwater harvesting, both urban and rural areas in Pakistan will remain trapped in a cycle of water excess followed by water scarcity.
A strategic and economic threat
By various measures of water availability, from the Falkenmark index — an indicator used to measure water scarcity — to the water poverty index, Pakistan currently stands as the 15th most water-stressed nation in the world.
 
 

Per the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), Pakistan is predicted to slip into absolute water scarcity by 2035 — a frightening prospect for the world’s fifth most populous country. According to the World Wildlife Fund-Pakistan (WWF-P), the country’s annual per capita water availability has plummeted from about 5,600 cubic meters in 1947 to just 930 cubic meters in 2023 — dangerously below the level conventionally defined as water scarcity. According to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, Pakistan’s water stress is among the highest globally, underscoring that securing the resource is now a matter of national survival.
Put simply: we are hurtling toward an inevitable crisis of catastrophic proportions.
Water woes and climate change go hand in hand
Adding to Pakistan’s water crisis is the relentless pressure of climate change. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, although Pakistan contributes only a fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions, it ranks among the top 10 countries most impacted by climate change. The country has faced unprecedented heatwaves in recent years — extreme temperatures that have caused water reservoirs and dams to lose up to 20 per cent of their capacity through evaporation.
Meanwhile, global warming has accelerated the melting of glaciers in the Hindu Kush–Himalayan region, which supplies over 75pc of the Indus River’s flow. These trends threaten to destabilise the timing and volume of river waters that Pakistan has relied upon for millennia. Looking ahead, the World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal (CCKP) stated that Pakistan’s average temperature is projected to rise by 4.9°C by 2090, foretelling even greater hydrological volatility. Erratic monsoon rains and a vicious cycle of drought followed by flood have already become the new normal.
The human and economic toll of this volatility is mounting. Rainfall patterns across the country have grown increasingly unpredictable, And when it rains, it often unleashes devastating downpours. The catastrophic floods of 2022 are a case in point: nearly one-third of the country was submerged, causing almost $30 billion in economic losses and 1,765 fatalities.
Such climate-exacerbated disasters devastate infrastructure, displace millions, and directly undermine water infrastructure by silting up dams and contaminating freshwater supplies. In essence, climate change is amplifying Pakistan’s water stress, making dry seasons drier and wet seasons wetter — a recipe for sustained crisis.
Indus Waters Treaty under strain
Water scarcity in Pakistan is not just a domestic issue but a regional geopolitical flashpoint. The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, a model of water sharing between Pakistan and India, is now facing a severe threat.
 
 

The treaty gave Pakistan exclusive rights to the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers (the western rivers of the Indus basin), which together provide over 80pc of Pakistan’s irrigation water and around one-third of its electricity generation capacity. For decades, this arrangement maintained a fragile peace over water. However, today a combination of factors — ranging from climbing demand and geopolitical tensions to climate-induced flow variability — are testing the limits of the treaty.
A study in 2021 stated that there are signs of declining flows in the western rivers, a trend some attribute to changing weather patterns and upstream diversions. Pakistan has repeatedly raised concerns over India’s construction of large upstream hydropower projects like Kishanganga and Ratle, fearing they could eventually diminish downstream flows. These concerns have even been taken to the World Bank indicating how contentious the issue has become.
Tensions spiked further in early 2025, when India announced to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam in Indian occupied Kashmir. India, without presenting evidence or conducting a thorough investigation, hastily placed blame on Pakistan — following its repeated pattern of blame and making this a poor pretext to suspend the treaty. This unprecedented declaration sent shockwaves through Pakistan.
The New York Times reported that if India were to unilaterally withhold or redirect waters, Pakistan’s farming heartlands in Punjab and Sindh could face up to a 35pc reduction in water availability in critical growing seasons. Such a scenario is nothing short of a nightmare for a country whose economy and food supply are so deeply tied to these rivers.
Fortunately, immediate disruption is constrained by geography and infrastructure — during the summer monsoon, the Indus system carries huge flows that India currently lacks the capacity to fully capture or store. Nevertheless, the risk is very real in drier months: India could manipulate flows, potentially causing drought-like conditions or conversely releasing water without warning to create flash floods downstream.
Pakistan’s vulnerability is compounded by its own limited storage capacity. The country can only store about 30 days’ worth of water, far below the 120-day international benchmark for water security. With this limited capacity, Pakistan cannot effectively bank surplus rainwater or glacial melt for lean times. This precarious situation makes Pakistan highly exposed to any upstream disruptions and to any extreme weather event.
Food security under threat
With a heavily water-dependent agricultural sector, the implications of dwindling water supplies for food production are both immediate and severe.
A study reported that approximately three-quarters of the freshwater is consumed by just four crops: wheat, sugarcane, cotton, and rice. The policies favoring these corps over the decades, have made farmers gradually shifting away from traditional, more drought-tolerant crops like millet and barley to these cash crops. This unsustainable cropping pattern is further straining groundwater and river systems. These cash crops are already experiencing the impact. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) stated in a report that in recent years, cotton production plummeted by about 41pc, largely due to flood damage and waterlogging, which in turn dealt a blow to the textile industry and rural employment.
 
 

Wheat yields have increased slightly, but its growth rate (under 2.5pc per year) lags behind the global average, partly because water shortages and erratic weather have hampered productivity. The 2022 floods alone destroyed 2.4 million hectares of cropland, wiping out food stocks and farmers’ livelihoods overnight.
In light of these challenges, the SBP recorded a slowdown in agricultural growth, attributing it to climate stress and water scarcity undermining the output of key crops. With agriculture still employing a large share of Pakistan’s workforce and feeding its population, such water-driven shocks propagate a broader economic crisis. The sustained water stress could ignite a vicious cycle: poor harvests, rising food prices, rural unemployment, and ultimately threats to economic and social stability.
Policy gaps and the way forward
Given the gravity of the situation, one would expect a swift and robust policy response. Unfortunately, meaningful actions have been hindered by slow policy response and poor execution. The National Water Policy of 2018 and infrastructure projects like the Diamer-Bhasha dam were deemed as long-term solutions to Pakistan’s water stress. While these initiatives were steps in the right direction, progress on them has been painfully slow.
The key challenges in addressing are funding issues, bureaucratic red tape, and inter-provincial mistrust over water sharing. In addition to that, politically tough but crucial measures — such as installing water meters to curb waste, regulating groundwater extraction, and incentivising crop diversification — remain largely sidelined.
Breaking out of this paralysis requires both institutional reform and international diplomacy. On the diplomatic front, Pakistan must take a proactive role in engaging India — and, where necessary, involve mediators like the World Bank or other international partners — to adapt and reinforce the Indus Waters Treaty.
Multilateral forums could help update the treaty’s frameworks, incorporating climate adaptation (such as data sharing on glacial melt and monsoon forecasts) so that the spirit of equitable water sharing endures despite new pressures.
Moreover, the government urgently needs to enforce water-use regulations — for instance, by rigorously metering large consumers and clamping down on illegal wells — to prevent wasteful usage. Investing in modern irrigation techniques is equally important: moving from traditional flood irrigation to drip irrigation and other water-saving technologies can dramatically reduce agricultural water consumption.
 
 

Likewise, incentivising rainwater harvesting and watershed rehabilitation would help capture rainfall and recharge aquifers rather than letting precious water simply flow out to sea. Expanding the country’s water storage capacity (through both large dams and small local reservoirs) is crucial to buffer against seasonal variability; Pakistan cannot afford to remain a country that runs on a month’s worth of water.
Finally, farmers should be encouraged to diversify crops and adopt climate-smart agriculture — for example, by shifting incentives and support toward less water-intensive grains and developing varieties that can withstand droughts or floods. These adaptations in farming practices will be key to aligning the country’s agricultural demands with its water reality.
Pakistan’s water scarcity truly is a ticking time bomb, but it is not one without a defuse mechanism. What is needed is the political will to act before it’s too late. Delaying the policy action narrows the options and multiplies the economic and environmental costs. Adopting multi-faced solutions through the combination of institutional reforms at home and effective diplomacy abroad, we can begin to secure our water future. The challenge is immense, but the cost of inaction would be far greater.
Ensuring water security is not just about avoiding droughts or floods; it is about safeguarding Pakistan’s very viability as a stable and prosperous nation.

Over 50 live donkeys were also confiscated during a raid on the premises and a foreign national was taken into custody on the spot.
According to a spokesperson for the Islamabad district administration, an FIR has been registered against the foreign national following the recovery.
Authorities believe the meat was being prepared for supply to foreign restaurants and individuals.
“We are investigating where the donkey meat was being delivered. Local accomplices involved in the supply chain are also being traced. The case is being pursued from multiple angles,” the spokesperson said.

Islamabad Food Authority orders cases against all suspects to dismantle network

The raid was carried out by a team led by IFA Deputy Director Dr Tahira Siddique. The arrested individual was handed over to police for further investigation.
Dr Siddique directed the police to register cases against all parties involved and to dismantle the entire network.
She also ordered the confiscated meat to be destroyed, adding investigators were working to identify the end recipients of the supply.
Sources within the food authority, however, said that initial findings had suggested the meat was intended for foreigners. They noted that the packaging found on-site was sophisticated, indicating it may have been prepared for export or high-end distribution.
The sophisticated packaging shows that it was intended to be exported or supplied to some foreigners in the federal capital. As there were over 50 alive donkeys so it is out of question that they were selling the meat of donkeys who occasionally die, they said.
They said that, according to initial investigation, the business was being run by a foreigner living in the area for a long time. However, they said the farmhouse was not registered for such an activity.
Meat sellers hail action
In response to the incident, the Jamiatul Quresh Meat Welfare Association praised the swift action by the IFA and renewed its longstanding demand for the establishment of a regulated slaughterhouse in the capital.
During a meeting held in Aabpara Market, chaired by Association President Khursheed Ahmed Qureshi and attended by other members, including Javed Qureshi, Sardar Zaheer Ahmed, Zahid Masood Khan, and Iqbal Qureshi, the group said the absence of a government-managed slaughterhouse had allowed such illegal operations to thrive.
They urged President Asif Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to take immediate notice of the matter and ensure preventive measures are in place.
The association called for the immediate establishment of a slaughterhouse in I-11/4, emphasising that doing so would help stop the sale of unregulated and unhygienic meat. They also demanded strict legal action against all individuals involved in illegal meat trade.
Pakistan exports donkey hides and meat to China.

On November 5 last year, two Chinese nationals were shot at and wounded by a private security guard in a textile mill in Karachi’s SITE area. At that time, investigators had suspected that it was a targeted attack.
Following the incident, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement that the attack was being probed, adding that Pakistan was committed to the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects, and institutions in the country. A first information report (FIR) was registered two days later against the security guard who had fled after the incident.
“A terrorist who masterminded an attack on Chinese engineers in November last year has been killed during an operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area,” Additional Inspector-General of Police, Counter-Terrorism Department Azad Khan told Dawn.com.
Khan said the slain terrorist was identified as Zafran, while two of his accomplices were also killed in the operation.
Senior CTD official Raja Umer Khattab said that the operation was jointly carried out by the CTD and personnel of intelligence agencies. “The teams raided a house in the Manghopir area and killed the terrorists during an operation,” he said. “They belonged to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).”
At the time of the incident, Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG-South) Syed Asad Raza told journalists that the incident had occurred as a result of a verbal altercation between the engineers and the guard, but a further probe was underway to ascertain the exact reason.
He had said that a supervisor and three guards of the private security company had been detained for questioning, while efforts were underway to arrest the guard involved in the shooting.  The DIG had added that the suspect’s residence had been traced, and investigators were collecting information about him from his neighbours.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. However, Chinese nationals have also been targeted inside Pakistan over the last couple of years.
According to a report by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) published in 2024, 20 Chinese citizens have been killed and 34 injured in terrorist attacks in the country since 2021.
In October 2024, a suicide attack near Karachi airport, claimed by the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), left two Chinese citizens dead and injured ten others.
In March 2024, Chinese workers were targeted in KP’s Besham, reportedly carried out by affiliates of either the TTP or Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), resulting in five Chinese fatalities.
At least four people, including three Chinese nationals, were killed while four others were injured in a suicide attack outside the University of Karachi’s (KU) Confucius Institute in 2022.
The escalation in violence against Chinese nationals had amplified Beijing’s security concerns, especially over progress on China-Pakistan Econo­mic Corridor (CPEC) projects.  Speaking at the event in late October last year, the Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong had expressed frustration over the attacks, stating it was “unacceptable” and urging Islamabad to strengthen security measures for Chinese nationals and crack down on anti-China elements.
Former Foreign Office spokes­person Mumtaz Zahra Baloch had called the statement “perplexing” and a stark departure from the longstanding diplomatic norms between the two nations.</p><small>2025-07-28 06:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/281101000d5f8fb.jpg?r=110208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926995/leopard-mauls-teenage-boy-a-day-after-killing-girl-in-ajks-jhelum-valley' target='_blank'><strong>Leopard mauls teenage boy a day after killing girl in AJK’s Jhelum Valley</strong></a><br><p>MUZAFFARABAD: A teenage boy narrowly escaped death on Sunday afternoon when a leopard attacked him in Nalai Dabra’n, a border village in Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) Jhelum Valley district — less than 24 hours after the same predator had mauled an eight-year-old girl to death in the same locality.
The boy, identified as Mudassir Ali Awan, a student of 10thgrade, was returning home after attending the funeral prayers of the deceased girl when the big cat pounced on him. In a desperate attempt to save his life, he cried for help and tried to fight off the predator. His shouts alerted nearby villagers who rushed to the scene, making loud noises and attacking the leopard with sticks and stones, eventually forcing it to flee back into the forest.
Although the teenager sustained only minor injuries and scratches, his clothes were torn in the terrifying encounter, which has sent shockwaves through the small mountainous community.
“It’s a miracle that he survived. Had the villagers not been nearby, the consequences could have been catastrophic,” Naseer Awan, a resident of Nalai Dabra’n, who was present on the occasion, told Dawn by telephone.
A day earlier, the same leopard had snatched a minor girl from her home’s courtyard and dragged her into the nearby forest, where her mutilated body was found hours later.
The tragic death of the young girl has sparked anger and fear among the villagers, who said the authorities had failed to respond adequately despite repeated incidents involving wild animals in human settlements.
“The Wildlife Department and the district administration did not take any action even after a child was killed,” lamented Mr Awan. “We are now living in constant fear. The government must either catch or relocate this leopard before more lives are lost.”
On July 24, local journalists had also sounded the alarm on social media, warning of the leopard’s increasing presence in human-populated areas and calling for urgent intervention — but to no avail.
Former AJK Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider also expressed grave concern over the incident, warning that the unchecked rise in the leopard population posed a growing threat to human life in the region.
“Yesterday’s incident reflects an extremely alarming situation,” he said. “While the preservation of wildlife is important, it cannot come at the cost of human lives. There is nothing more precious than a human life.”
Mr Haider urged the Wildlife Department to consider relocating or exporting the increasing number of leopards from populated areas. “If people begin killing them in self-defence, they cannot be blamed,” he remarked.
He also offered condolences to the bereaved family and urged the government to offer them compensation. “Special preventive measures must be taken immediately in this and other vulnerable regions to protect children and ensure such tragedies are not repeated,” he added.
Efforts to reach officials from the Wildlife Department for comment remained unsuccessful.
The incidents underscore a growing pattern of human-wildlife conflict in AJK, particularly in forested and hilly areas where shrinking habitats have pushed wild animals closer to human settlements.
Wildlife experts and local communities have repeatedly called for a sustainable management plan to address the issue, but action on the ground remains limited and reactive — mainly due to scant fiscal and human resources allocated to the Wildlife Department.

Rescue 1122 and police reports said that accused Muhammad Yasin went to the house of his in-laws for reconciliation with his wife. However, his wife refused to go back with him over which he allegedly opened indiscriminate fire. As a result, his mother-in-law Khursheed Bibi (75) and wife Rukhsana Bibi (40) were injured. 
Later, his mother-in-law succumbed to her injuries on the spot, while his wife was shifted to the DHQ hospital and referred to the Faisalabad Allied Hospital.
Meanwhile, a woman was allegedly strangled to death in Chak 6 JB Faisalabad. Complainant Umar Hayat informed the Nishatabad police that his wife Daulat Bibi (45) was asleep at the outhouse when he was away working in the fields. He claimed that unidentified accused strangled her with a cloth. 
SENTENCE: Faisalabad District and Sessions Judge Abdul Raheem sentenced a man to death on two counts and fined him Rs2 million in a double murder case on Saturday.
The Dijkot police arrested Shoukat Ali four years ago for murdering his wife Sumera Bibi and her paramour Zeeshan Ahmad for honour.
ARRESTED: The Mamukanjan police of Tandlianwala tehsil, Faisalabad on Saturday night arrested a tailor for allegedly raping, blackmailing and extorting a woman. 
In the FIR, the victim’s husband said that his wife disclosed that her tailor had allegedly forcibly raped her some time ago and made a video of the incident. The suspect had demanded Rs500,000 for deleting the video but she was able to give him only Rs10,000. However, after taking the money, he continued to blackmail her and repeatedly raped her. He claimed that when she refused to pay money, he uploaded the video on social media. 
Police said the police had arrested the accused and seized his mobile phone.
ACCIDENT: A man died and another was injured when a trailer hit a mini truck on Sunday near Qasim Bagh, Khanewal due to over-speeding. 
The deceased was identified as mini truck driver Aurangzeb (31) and the injured as his helper Muhammad Umar (25). He was shifted to the Khanewal DHQ hospital.
ATTACKED: The Faisalabad Khurrianwala police booked 31 persons, including 16 nominated, for attacking revenue department officials and restraining them from retrieving the state land in Chak 76 RB. 
In his complaint, revenue department qanoongo Bahadur Ali claimed that the land grabbers, including eight nominated men and as many women, attacked the team.  
Police registered the FIR and made some arrests.

A decision to this effect was taken last week by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet, which chose to keep secret the steep revision in charges, although it confirmed the rates had been revised.
According to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), which tabled the proposal, the RBS spectrum and licence fees had remained unchanged since 2000 despite inflation rising by over 700pc in the same period.
Official record seen by Dawn suggests that a hike of about 361.3pc has been approved in RBS charges for 748 licensees of private radio networks to Rs350 million from Rs76m, an increase of Rs274m per licence.

PTA to collect Rs463m under revised fee structure

Likewise, a 300pc increase in RBS rates has been allowed for mobile stations used by a total of 144 licensees of aircraft and ships to Rs2.852m from Rs713,000, showing an increase of Rs2.139m per licence.
Similarly, the charges for licensees of 165 Amateur Radio, 17 Inmarsat and 19 Microwave DRS links have been doubled. The revised fee for Amateur Radio licences has increased from Rs160,000 to Rs320,000 per licence. Inmarsat licence charges have risen from Rs625,000 to Rs1.25m, while the fee for Microwave DRS links has been raised from Rs53.92m to Rs107.84m.
The PTA estimates that the increase in service charges would increase its revenue to about Rs463m from the existing Rs131.4m, an increase of 252pc or Rs331.44m.
The increase in RBS rates in terms of foreign exchange, on the other hand, has been estimated to actually drop by 18pc to $1.66m per year from the existing revenue of $2.021m.
Informed sources said the ECC expressed displeasure at the fact that relevant stakeholders, including PTA and the Ministry of IT and Telecom, had been sleeping over the issue for two and a half decades.
The ECC “directed the ministry to ensure periodic revision of RBS charges every three to five years, aligned with ongoing economic changes and technological advancements in the sector”, an official statement said.
The PTA is responsible for frequency allocation, licence issuance and fee adjustments for RBS services, including PRNs, Mobile Station Aircraft/Ship, Inmarsat, Amateur, and DRS/Microwave links.
The Ministry of IT and Telecom informed the ECC that the outdated fee structure had led to a significant mismatch between service charges and the costs incurred in managing licences and spectrum oversight.
It said the economic landscape had undergone a significant transformation since the implementation of the previous fee structure. Further, the monetary value and technological sophistication of services rendered through RBS licences and authorisations also increased substantially, driven by technological advancements and the evolving requirements of contemporary communication systems.
This significant evolution in both economic parameters and service delivery frameworks required an immediate and comprehensive revision of the RBS fee structure.
Under Sections 5(2a), 5(2c) and 43(5) of the Pakistan Tele-communication (Re-organisation) Act, 1996, the PTA is mandated to regulate the issuance and renewal of licences, the processing of frequency assignment requests and the charging of relevant fees.
Moreover, Clause 8.7.5 of the Telecommunication Policy 2015 mandated the PTA to propose to the federal government the methods of assigning and pricing frequency spectrum after consultation with stakeholders. Based on an industry consultation in August 2024, the PTA then proposed a revision in the RBS fee structure.

The satellite, developed by Suparco, is designed to provide early warnings for natural hazards such as floods, earthquakes, and landslides, while also supporting crop assessment and urban planning.
“This marks a significant step in Pakistan’s space and scientific development,” Suparco said in a statement, adding that the satellite will “enhance our ability to respond to disasters and improve food security and environmental monitoring.”
The launch comes amid a deepening partnership between Islam­abad and Beijing in space science.
In May, Pakistan became the first foreign nation to join China’s space station training programme, sending two astronauts for training under a landmark agreement with the China Manned Space Agency.
One of the astronauts is expected to join a future mission aboard China’s Tiangong Space Station as a scientific payload specialist.
In January, Pakistan launched its first home-made observation satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northern China, Pakistan’s space agency said.
The PRSC-EO1 satellite aimed to boost Pakistan’s ability to monitor and manage natural resources, respond to disasters, and improve urban planning and agricultural development
In November last year, Suparco announced its rover will join China’s Chang’E 8 mission to the moon’s south pole in 2028—a move hailed as a “significant milestone” for the country.
Officials say these initiatives underscore Pakistan’s commitment to leveraging space technology for national development and disaster preparedness, as the country seeks to build resilience against climate change and natural disasters.

• TV anchor, family among 15 feared swept away in Babusar
• Partial reopening of Babusar Road expected today
GILGIT: People displaced by flash floods across multiple areas of Gilgit-Baltistan have complained of severe shortages of clean drinking water, electricity, road access and communication services.
Survivors in the flood-stricken Babusar and Thore valleys of Diamer said they had been hit by one of the deadliest floods in recent memory, which left many homeless and swept away their belongings.
In the Gilgit region, thousands of residents in Danyor and Sultanabad areas remained without drinking water for three consecutive days after a flash flood from Danyor Nallah damaged the main supply pipeline and several irrigation channels.
Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res­tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.
They said that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again. No restoration work has been initiated, they lamented and gave a one-day ultimatum to the government for action or they would launch protests.
Meanwhile, residents of Kondus and Haldi in Ghanche district also complained about a lack of relief supplies, electricity, drinking water and road access.
 
 

A devastating landslide in Kondus swept away over 50 homes, leaving scores of families homeless and in urgent need of food, shelter, medical care and emergency services. Locals also lamented the unavailability of the internet, making it even harder to communicate or call for help.
In the Shigar district, flash floods hit the Tisar and Garchahma areas. Resident Sajid Ali said electricity had been out for the last three to four days and that many families had evacuated their homes in search of safer ground. Drinking water was also unavailable, he added.
 
 

People in Jutal and other flood-affected regions of Gilgit-Baltistan also complained about the lack of basic facilities and criticised the government for its slow response and failure to deliver timely relief.
‘15 tourists swept away’
Meanwhile, a private TV anchor, her husband and their four children are also among the tourists reported missing in Babusar Valley, it emerged on Sunday.
Gilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that the family of an anchorperson for a Pashto-language TV channel had contacted authorities, reporting that she, her husband and their four children had gone missing during the recent flash floods.
Mr Faraq said they had recovered a wallet belonging to the anchorperson, adding that the body of an unidentified woman was recovered from the Indus River in Chilas’s Minar area. The woman is believed to be among the tourists who were swept away by flash floods on Babusar Highway.
He said that according to eyewitness accounts, between 10 and 15 tourists were swept away by floodwaters on the Babusar Highway. So far, seven bodies have been recovered.
“The search for the remaining missing persons is ongoing with the help of sniffer dogs and drones and personnel from Diamer Police, Rescue 1122, the Pakistan Army and GB Scouts are participating in the operation,” he said, adding that the effort would continue until all missing individuals are located.
He said additional rescue operations were also underway in Ghanche, Ghizer and Gilgit. Human remains were also recovered during a search operation in the Thak Bhasha area of Diamer, and DNA testing will be required for identification.
Federal Secretary for Commun­ications and Works Sher Alam Masood visited the Babusar Highway site in Chilas alongside local officials to assess the damage.
He told the media that restoration efforts using heavy machinery were ongoing, with the road blocked in 15 locations and partial clearance achi­eved at 13 of them. He hoped that the highway would be partially reopened for traffic by Monday (today).

“Six fishermen were on board when the boat capsized,” an official said. Rescue teams, assisted by local fishermen, later recovered the bodies of the five deceased men.
The bodies of two fishermen were sent to Karachi, while three remain in the custody of Edhi authorities in Gwadar. One of the victims, a resident of Ali Akbar Shah Goth in Ibrahim Haideri, was laid to rest following funeral prayers held after Zuhr.
Further investigation into the incident is underway.
