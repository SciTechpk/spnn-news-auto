<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/3010291213308dd.jpg?r=102951' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907535/psx-slumps-over-3000-points-as-pakistan-expects-indian-action' target='_blank'><strong>PSX slumps over 3,000 points as Pakistan expects Indian action</strong></a><br><p>Bears took control of the trade floor as shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) plunged by more than 3,000 points in intraday trade — a development that analysts attributed to investor anxiety over potential Indian military action against the country.
The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 1,717.35 points, or 1.5 per cent, to stand at 113,154.83 from the last close of 114,872.18 at 9:53am.
At 10:38am, the index declined by 2,073.42 points, or 1.8pc, from the last close.
By 1:50pm, more selling pressure ensued at the stock market as the KSE-100 index plunged by 3,255.42 points, or 2.83pc, from the last close.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to “news of likely attack in next few days”.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “Investors are worried about potential Indian military action against Pakistan, concerns that have intensified following the information minister’s press briefing.”
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, echoed the same sentiments.
He said that the market was under pressure following the information minister’s “statement last night suggesting that India may take military action within the next 24–36 hours”.
“The market in the short term will most likely follow newsflows of Pakistan-India tensions,” he added.
Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, also credited the slump primarily on geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan.
Earlier in the day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the next 24 to 36 hours amid tensions between the two countries after the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir last week that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad, albeit without proof.
On Tuesday, India gave its military “operational freedom” to respond to the Pahalgam attack.
Speaking to the media hours after the development, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”
He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region”, adding that it was completely “reckless”.
Yesterday, the KSE-100 index had bounced back on the trading floor after the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed that the Fund’s Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new $1.3 billion arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme.
Pakistan dollar bonds drop amid rising tensions
Pakistan’s international bonds dropped more than 1 cent after the information minister’s statement.
The 2036 bond suffered the biggest decline, falling 1.3 cents to be bid at 71.85 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed, though bid-ask spreads of around 1 cent pointed to limited liquidity.
Indian shares flat as HDFC Bank offsets Bajaj Finance losses, Pakistan jitters
Meanwhile, Indian shares were muted as gains in heavyweight HDFC Bank helped offset pressure from tensions with Pakistan, while Bajaj Finance declined despite posting a rise in fourth-quarter profit.
The Nifty 50 was down 0.05pc at 24,324 and the BSE Sensex lost 0.07pc to 80,236.6 as of 10:43am.
Both benchmarks swung between 0.2pc gains and 0.2pc losses in early trade.
“For now, geopolitical tensions (with Pakistan) have overtaken (US) tariffs in investors’ minds,” said Anita Gandhi, founder and head of institutional business at Arihant Capital Markets.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi granted military chiefs freedom to respond to last week’s attack in Pahalgam, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
The Nifty volatility index has risen in five of the six sessions since the attack.
Six of the 13 major sectors declined on Wednesday, while the small- and mid-caps fell 0.6pc and 0.1pc, respectively.
Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance fell 5.4pc, leading losses on the Nifty, despite posting a higher quarterly profit, as brokerages flagged weak pre-provision profit and higher credit costs as negatives.

Pakistan last played international cricket against New Zealand earlier this month, where the Green Shirts lost both the One-day International series (3-0) and the Twenty20 International series (4-1).
The Pakistan Super League is currently ongoing in the country with the final set to take place on May 18.
 

The schedule for the series. — PCB

The PCB said in a press release: “The series, which is part of the Future Tour Programme (FTP), originally consisted of three ODIs and three Twenty20 internationals (T20Is).
“However, with the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup scheduled for next year, both the boards have mutually agreed to replace the ODIs with two additional T20Is.”
The five-match T20I series will be played in Faisalabad and Lahore from May 25 to June 3, the PCB added.
Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad, which successfully hosted the inaugural Champions One-Day Cup in September last year and National T20 Cup last month, will stage the first and second T20Is of the series, scheduled on May 25 and 27.
Iqbal Stadium, which has previously hosted 24 Tests and 16 ODIs between 1978 and 2008, will welcome back international cricket after a 17-year hiatus, the press release noted.
The historic venue’s last international fixture was an ODI between Bangladesh and Pakistan in April 2008.
Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium will host the remaining three T20Is, scheduled on May 30, June 1 and 3 with all five matches set to begin at 8pm.
The Bangladesh team will arrive on 21 May and will undergo training sessions at the Iqbal Stadium from 22 to 24 May, the press release concluded.
Bangladesh last toured Pakistan in September of last year for two tests, where they beat the hosts 2-0 to complete their maiden whitewash over Pakistan in that format of the game.

The incident took place in the vicinity of Saddar police station near Kot Adil.
According to Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan, Station House Office (SHO) Waseem Sajjad and his personnel were on a routine patrol when two unidentified men opened fire on them.
“The policemen fired back at them, killing one of the attackers and injuring the other, who managed to escape from the scene,” he continued.
The official further said the SHO and a constable named Hayatullah suffered injuries and were shifted to the hospital. Both of them are out of danger.
The RPO said that he and Bannu DPO Saleem Abbas Kalachi immediately reached the hospital to enquire after the health of the injured.
“A police operation is under way to find the person, while the deceased attacker has been shifted to the hospital for identification,” he added.
“Modern weapons, hand grenades, Kalashnikovs, and ammunition were recovered found on the slain attacker.”
Last week on Friday, security officials killed six terrorists in Bannu and injured four in a military operation, according to the ISPR.</p><small>2025-04-30 09:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/301238234bcdfd5.jpg?r=124201' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/indian-rafales-patrolling-above-held-kashmir-retreat-after-paf-scrambles-jets-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>Indian Rafales patrolling above held Kashmir retreat after PAF scrambles jets: state media</strong></a><br><p>Indian fighter jets patrolling above occupied Kashmir were forced to flee after the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) scrambled its jets, state media reported on Wednesday, adding to tensions between the two countries in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan’s political and military leadership have strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
The tensions between the arch-rivals have intensified in the past few days, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Pakistan had reinforced its forces and was ready for any incursion by India, while on the other side, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military “operational freedom” to act on the Pahalgam attack.
PTV News and Radio Pakistan, citing security sources, said that four Rafale fighter jets of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were spotted conducting “patrolling overnight” in occupied Kashmir without crossing the Line of Control.
“PAF jets promptly detected the presence of these Indian warplanes,” Radio Pakistan added.
“As a result of PAF’s diligent action, the Indian Rafale jets panicked and were forced to flee,” PTV News reported. The security sources also reaffirmed that the armed forces were “fully prepared and vigilant to give a befitting response to any aggression from India”.
The government and the military have yet to provide details on the incident.
The development comes after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar earlier today said “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the “next 24 to 36 hours”.
In a televised statement issued shortly after 2am, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”
The April 22 attack killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
Tarar said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” and it was completely “reckless”.
 


“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” the minister said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”
Being a responsible state, Tarar noted, Pakistan “openheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.
“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” he stressed.
The information minister said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives”.
“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” he  added.
Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.
“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of [an] escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India.”
He reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.
Deputy PM Ishaq Dar has said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the right to retaliate. He informed the Senate yesterday that intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.

Today’s incident also comes after the Pakistan Army yesterday shot down two Indian quadcopters after they violated the country’s airspace along the Line of Control (LoC) in two separate areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), official sources said.
The first drone was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops. The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in Poonch division’s Satwal sector.
The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since the night of April 25, breaking a period of relative calm in the region. No casualties were immediately reported.
 
 

Meanwhile, as concerns over a potential breakdown of peace grew, shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) faced a major fall in intraday trade today.
According to IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Indian cyberattack attempts on the websites of some ministries have been foiled as well.
The National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team (N-Cert) has warned media and content creators against sharing sensitive national security information.
Amid fears of airspace closures due to rising tensions with India, authorities yesterday refuted rumours of a possible closure of airports.
A senior official at Islamabad International Airport said the airport was fully functional for both domestic and international flights, while an official from the Lahore airport also confirmed that flight operations were running smoothly.
Ex-PM Imran says peace is ‘priority’, calls for unity
Amid the ongoing situation, the opposition PTI has proposed a multi-party conference with incarcerated former premier Imran Khan in attendance.
A statement posted on Imran’s X account, which is handled by a PTI member, quoted the ex-premier as telling his lawyers yesterday: “Peace is our priority but it should not be mistaken as cowardice.”
Recalling the 2019 Pulwama-Balakot incidents during his tenure, Imran said, “We offered to extend all-out cooperation to India but India failed to produce any concrete evidence.
“[…] Instead of introspection and investigation, Modi sarkar is again placing the blame on Pakistan,” the former prime minister added.
 






He urged India to act responsibly instead of messing with a region already known as a “nuclear flashpoint”.
“I have always emphasised the importance of the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination, as guaranteed by United Nations resolutions,” Imran stressed.
India okays ‘operational freedom’ to army amid calls for restraint
A week after the Pahalgam attack, Modi yesterday told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source who was not authorised to speak to the media told AFP.
The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi holding a closed-door meeting with his army and security chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.
Last week, Modi vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.
“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.
 
 

Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. Analysts say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.
Amid escalating tensions, friendly countries and global powers have urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, advising them to solve the matter through diplomatic engagement.
Last night, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan “as early as today or tomorrow”.
She said the US was reaching out to both parties regarding the Kashmir issue, and is expected to tell both sides not to escalate things any further.
Bruce said that Rubio was also encouraging leaders and foreign ministers from other nations to reach out over the issue.
Following the Pahalgam attack, US President Donald Trump had extended his “full support” to India. He later downplayed the regional tensions, saying the dispute would get “figured out”.
 


Iran has already offered to mediate, and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”. In the past few days, Dar has also spoken to the foreign ministers of China, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary to brief them about Pakistan’s concerns.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint”, with its chief Antonio Guterres yesterday offering “his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”.
In his phone call with the UN chief on Tuesday, PM Shehbaz encouraged him to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.
The worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, killing 40 and wounding 35.
Indian fighter jets carried out air strikes on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, Pakistan Air Force undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.</p><small>2025-04-30 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/301155494849445.jpg?r=120529' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907544/fire-at-hotel-in-indias-kolkata-kills-15' target='_blank'><strong>Fire at hotel in India’s Kolkata kills 15</strong></a><br><p>A fierce fire ripped through a hotel in the Indian city of Kolkata killing at least 15 people, police said Wednesday, with some clambering out of windows and onto the rooftop to escape.
Several people were rescued from rooms and roof of the budget hotel, Kolkata police chief Manoj Verma told AFP, after the fire broke out on Tuesday evening.
“The death toll has risen to 15, including two children and a woman,” said Verma, adding an investigation had been launched to find out what triggered the blaze.
“The hotel turned into a gas chamber and it appears that many people suffocated to death.”
The Rituraj Hotel, which had 88 guests when the fire broke out, is located in a congested business district of central Kolkata. About a dozen people suffered burn injuries and were undergoing treatment.
Building fires are common in India due to a lack of firefighting equipment and a routine disregard for safety regulations.
Last year, six people were killed in a fire at a hotel in Patna in the eastern state of Bihar.
The Press Trust of India news agency, which filmed images of soaring flames from the Kolkata building, reported that “several people were seen trying to escape through the windows and narrow ledges of the building”.
Kolkata’s The Telegraph newspaper reported that at least one person died when he “jumped off the terrace trying to escape” the fire.
Verma said the fire had been tackled and that “cooling operations are underway”.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to the families of those killed. “May the injured recover soon,” his office said in a statement.

Having lost five of their six matches so far in this Pakistan Super League season, and two on the bounce, they were gasping for air in stifling conditions; looking for some inspiration.
The Quetta Gladiators, on a two-game winning streak, had their tails up and they would give the Sultans no way out; Fah­eem Ashraf picking a wicket each in his first two overs. Two days after ripping apart Peshawar Zal­mi, they scythed through the Sultans and bundled them out for 89 with only skipper Mohammad Rizwan offering a semblance of resistance.
The Gladiators then cruised to their target  off just 41 balls without losing a wicket — skipper Saud Shakeel hitting four sixes and three fours in a 20-ball 42 and Finn Allen striking five sixes and two fours in a 21-ball 45 — to climb up to second place in the standings.
On a pitch laid using soil from Western Australia and offering bounce, the Sultans — who are now only mathematically in the playoffs race — never got going after they had been put into bat.
Fast bowler Khurram (4-23) struck with the first ball he delivered; opener Yasir Khan spooning a catch to Mohammad Wasim Jr at mid-on. Three balls later, he was followed by Usman Khan, who tried to hit his way out of pressure but only found Mohammad Amir at mid-on.
 


The incoming Kamran Ghulam saw Hassan Nawaz drop a sitter on the last ball of the third over but was gone next ball as Khurram returned to have him caught at slip and then had Curtis Campher lbw four balls later; the Sultans in all sorts of trouble at 20-4 before ending the powerplay with no further losses but the scoreboard reading just 31.
Opener Rizwan was running out of partners and soon lost another when Faheem — on the back of a five-wicket haul against Zalmi — came into the attack; Iftikhar Ahmed going long only to be caught in the deep in the eighth over before Michael Bracewell edged to the keeper in the 10th as the Sultans reached the midway point of their innings at 47-6.
Such was the Gladiators’ dominance that the Sultans couldn’t even capitalise on missed chances. Abrar Ahmed had dropped David Willey in the 12th over off Mohammad Amir but made amends when he settled under a skier from the Englishman in the next over by Wasim.
Number eight batter Usama Mir finally got the first six of the innings in the 14th over, hitting Faheem over the square leg fence, having cut the bowler away for four the previous delivery as the Sultans looked for a late flourish.
But Usama (11), the only Sultans batter to reach double figures apart from Rizwan, was run out on the first ball of the next over. Another run out followed soon after, seeing Mohammad Hasnain return to the dugout.
Rizwan, who made a painstaking run-a-ball 44 not out with just four fours, pulled away Wasim for the only six of his stay but the fast bowler soon put the Sultans out of their misery when he had last man Ubaid Shah caught behind with the last ball of the 17th over.
Quetta began their chase tentatively, just eight runs coming off the first two overs with just one four by Allen. But once they made sure there were no demons on the pitch, the Sultans were thrashed to all parts; Allen depositing Willey for two sixes and a four in the third over and Saud getting a six and a four off the next by Hasnain.
Any flickering Sultans hopes had been extinguished and as Saud got going, it became a matter of how soon the Gladiators would win. Ubaid was hit for two sixes and a four in the fifth over by Saud, who then hit another six and a four off the sixth over by Hasnain.
Allen also hit a six in the same over as the Gladiators ended the powerplay at 74-0 before the New Zealander ended the game with a couple more big hits off Usama in the seventh over.

Published in Dawn, April 30th, 2025</p><small>2025-04-30 06:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30102058fae806c.jpg?r=102117' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907507/rs152-cut-in-power-tariff-delayed-to-may' target='_blank'><strong>Rs1.52 cut in power tariff delayed to May</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Amid official warnings about looming higher fuel costs in peak summer, a Rs1.52 per unit cut in average electricity tariff promised by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not reach consumers in the current month.
During a public hearing on Tuesday presided over by Chairman National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) Waseem Mukhtar, representatives of the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) said there was the possibility of increasing monthly fuel cost adjustments in the coming months given 20pc higher load demand and lower hydropower availability.
Responding to a question, a case officer of Nepra reported that the impact of about Rs52bn reduction in quarterly tariff adjustments would be about Rs1.52 per unit for the coming three months — May, June and July. Conveners representing export sector demanded that its application should come into force in April to June for which the prime minister had announced and on that basis they had booked export orders.
Nepra did not go beyond the earlier explanation of its application for May to July but it was evident that April bills were already out in some areas and could not be called back.

Consumers will not see relief in their April bills as promised by PM Shehbaz

The Nepra chairman disallowed representatives of Hyderabad, Multan and Quetta electric supply companies for the absence of their senior leadership and called for their explanations.
Mr Mukhtar also expressed displeasure over the absence of power division representation and directed that a letter should also be written to the federal secretary of power.
The CPPA reported about 4.4pc increase in power consumption in March over last year and sought about Rs1.52 per unit negative quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) for the January-March 2025 period and another three paise per unit negative fuel price adjustment (FCA) for electricity consumed in March.
The Rs1.51 per unit negative QTA, involving a total of Rs51.5bn already overcharged by all Discos for the third quarter of FY25, was already made part of the tariff reduction announced by the prime minister for three months –April to June 2025.
The lower QTA stems from a combination of lower capacity charges, operations and maintenance costs, fixed costs on account of incremental sales and fewer system losses mainly because of relative stability in the exchange rate and decline in interest rates.
The decline in fuel cost is mainly because of substantially higher costs allowed by Nepra through a 20pc increase in base tariff effective July 1, 2024. About 75pc of the total power supply during March came from domestic fuel sources, almost 20pc of that at zero fuel cost.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), which filed the petition for negative adjustment of fuel cost for March, said the power consumption was 4.4pc higher than the same month last year and almost 22pc higher than February. It reported that electricity delivered to Discos stood at 8,114 gigawatt hours (GWh) in March against 6,666 GWh in February.
The power companies have claimed in their petitions that the average fuel cost amounted to Rs9.22 per unit in March compared to Rs9.34 per unit in the same month last year.
The CPPA said about 8,409 GWh of electricity was generated at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs79.5bn (Rs9.46 per unit) in March, of which 8,114GWh energy was delivered to Discos at a cost of Rs74.85bn (at Rs9.22 per unit). However, the reference fuel cost already charged in March stood at Rs9.256 per unit, hence a refund of three paise per unit.
Hydropower lost its top position with about 15.42pc share in the overall grid owing to unfavourable hydrological conditions. Last year, hydropower contributed 28pc electricity to the grid in March. Nuclear energy emerged as the largest electricity supplier to the national grid with 26.4pc share.
The third biggest share in the national grid came RLNG at 18.17pc, followed by local coal at 16.57pc. This was followed by 11.64pc share from local local gas. Imported coal contributed 6.5pc to the national grid.

The leakage in main supply line is set to add to water woes of residents in most parts of the city as they would suffer nearly 40 per cent water shortage for the next four days due to the ensuing repair works.
The affected neighborhoods include Chanesar Town, Jinnah Town, Liaquatabad, Nazimabad, Pak Colony, Golimar, Shershah, Old City Area, Landhi, Korangi, and PAF Base Masroor.
The city that requires over 1,200 million gallons of water daily (MGD) will get 400 MGD water out of regular supply of 650MGD due to repair work on the Siphon No. 19, the 84-inch diameter pipeline that developed the leakage near Karachi University.
KWSC spokesman Abdul Qadir Shaikh said that the repair work was expected to be completed in 96 hours and water supply to different parts of the city would be partially suspended.

Campus inundated; repair work will take several days, says official

He said that the leak developed on Tuesday morning, prompting swift emergency action by the water utility. The repair would cause partial disruption in water supply in various areas of the city, he added.
He said that KWSC Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Ali Siddiqui had directed the relevant teams to begin repair work without delay.
He said that the water supply from the Dhabeji Pumping Station had been suspended immediately after the leakage and the repair work would start as and when the water receded. “To ensure the safety of repair crews and facilitate the operation efficiently, water pressure in the affected pipeline has been temporarily reduced,” he added.
The spokesperson said that the full-scale repair activities had already commenced and would continue uninterrupted around the clock.
The water utility advised the people to store water in advance and use it carefully to avoid any inconvenience.

Ironically, these are the very two tenets the SBCA was established to safeguard more than four decades ago.
Through a notification issued in March, the authority amended certain provisions of the Karachi Building and Town Planning Regulations 2002 (KBTPR), blurring the lines between amenity, residential and commercial use of plots and effectively permitting the utilisation of residential plots for commercial activities.
 
 

The effect of the amendment is not only illogical and contrary to regulatory intent, but is most certainly going to lead to further chaos in the already dysfunctional town planning and zoning regulations. Moreover, it ultimately defeats the very purpose of designating plots for different uses. These sentiments have also been expressed most recently in a 2024 judgment by the Sindh High Court (SHC).
Meanwhile, media reports have quoted Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani as saying that the subject amendments have been introduced to provide legal cover to commercial establishments functioning in the residential areas of Karachi for the last many years. This, in essence, is akin to ‘regularising’ the admitted existing violation of residential leases and land use prohibitions contained within the KBTPR 2002 itself.
What does the law say?
In this regard, it is important to mention that the parent statute, the Sindh Building Control Ordinance (SCBO) 1979, does not contemplate the regularisation of any unauthorised construction. Instead, Section 6(1) of the law prohibits the construction of any building before obtaining an approval in respect of the proposed construction, and the grant of a no-objection certificate in respect thereof.
Moreover, Section 6(3) of the SBCO clearly stipulates that no building can, except without the permission of the SBCA, be used for a purpose other than for which its plans were approved. Even then, Section 6(4) only contemplates such permission to be granted if the building authority is satisfied that the purpose for which the building is desired to be used is consistent with the approved building plans and the imposition of such conditions and payment of such fees as the SBCA may fix.
To this end, it would be difficult to imagine a scenario where the SBCA may be satisfied that approved building plans for a residential accommodation would be consistent with use as a restaurant or for other social recreational purposes.
The consequences for a violation of Section 6(1) of the SBCO are set out in Section 7-A which clearly states that where the provisions of Section 6(1) are violated, the building may be sealed, its occupants ejected and the structure itself be demolished at the cost of the builder in the case of public buildings and the owner in other cases.
It is clear that the only remedy the parent statute ever contemplated in the event of a violation of building construction in the absence of an approved plan and use for a purpose other than for which a plan was approved is sealing, ejectment of occupants (if any) and demolition of the building. The concept of regularisation is simply not contemplated in the parent, that is, the SBCO 1979 statute.
What do the courts say?
In connection with and in support of the above, the Sindh High Court, in 2018, held that while Section 7A of the SBCO 1979 — pertaining to the preparation of building plans — only refers to Section 6(1), it must be read together with Section 6(3) at all times as they are interconnected and if there is a violation of Section 6(1), it squarely applies to a violation of Section 6(3).
The concept of regularisation takes its roots in Regulation 3-2-20 of the KBTPR, introduced in 2011. This too contemplates the regularisation of violations in the existing structure after payment of a fee, depending on the nature and merits of the case. However, here too, it expressly prohibits the regularisation of violations of the master plan.
At the outset, it is arguable that as the parent statute does not contemplate any regularisation of unauthorised construction, the provisions of the KBPTR in this regard, exceed the provisions of the SBCO 1979 and are therefore, ultra vires.
Further, the apparent regularisation via the subject amendment arguably violates the provisions of Section 6(3) and 6(4) of the SBCO 1979 and renders it redundant altogether by permitting an existing building to be used for a purpose other than for which its plans were approved. In this regard, it is settled law that the powers conferred under a regulation, being delegated legislation, cannot go beyond the perimeters of the statute under which such regulations are passed.
 
 

This argument was also supported by the SHC in a 2022 order. Moreover, the Supreme Court also held in 2022 that the SBCA has a right to regularise construction which does not change the ‘complexion’ or ‘character of the originally proposed construction’ and does not have the right to regularise construction which would prejudice the rights of third parties.
The meaning of the expressions ‘character’ and ‘complexion’ should be interpreted in the light of the court’s decisions in the case of Abdul Razak v. Karachi Building Control Authority and others, which was related to the construction of a ground plus two-storey structure later converted into apartments. Both the SHC and SC declined the regularisation of the building and ruled it incapable of the same.
It would therefore seem that where approval is given of a structure, the SBCA may regularise a change in the number of storeys in the building as that would alter the “complexion” — the face of it — and not the “character” of the building — they cannot convert the nature of the approval, for example, from a residential bungalow to apartments, shops or offices.
In addition, and as held by the SC, the construction must not prejudice the rights of third parties. This means that it is incumbent on the SBCA, while considering an application to regularise a construction, to not mechanically look at the matter from a mathematical point of view, but rather to examine the regularisation application maintained by the owner of the construction and to see as to whether the regularisation would or would not:
“ … ensure safe and hygienic conditions of living for the citizens in general. They do not concern any one individual alone.“
The top court further elaborated this point in the decision reported as Ardeshir Cowasjee vs Karachi Building Control Authority, wherein it held that:
“The Regulations should be applied for the benefit of the public and not for favouring an individual. Simpliciter the factum that on account of tremendous increase in ’the population in Karachi the situation demands raising of high-rise buildings, will not justify the conversion of residential plots originally intended to be used for building ground-plus-one and allowing the raising of high-rise buildings thereon without providing for required water, electricity, gas, sewerage lines, streets and roads etc.“
Sanctioning chaos
While the above judgments considered the negative effects of the conversion and regularisation of residential plots into high-rise buildings, the same argument can be made in respect of the effect of the subject amendments to the KBTPR, i.e., they would completely change the complexion of the construction and locality and negatively affect and prejudice third party rights.
In addition to the apparent regularisation of existing unauthorised use of residential buildings for purposes other than for which they were intended, the subject amendments also, in effect, operate to override the underlying lease conditions of the plots as regards usage, zoning regulations and master plan designations of such plots.
Previously, through various amendments to the KBTPR, residential plots could be utilised for education and health purposes, subject to following the checks and balances set out in the ‘prescribed procedure’ of the KBTPR.  The consistently colourable and unprofessional exercise of powers in the implementation of the ‘prescribed procedure’ in letter and spirit is evident for all to see.
 
 

Now, in addition to the ability of residential plots to be utilised for education and health purposes, such plots may also be used (as they are already in most cases) for ‘recreation purposes’ including activities, facilities and spaces that enable leisure, social interaction and community well-being, and encompass dining and social establishments such as cafes, food courts and similar venues. However, citizens can take heart that such use will only be sanctioned if the recreational purposes contribute to the communal experience of the neighbourhood.
As highlighted above, the effect of the amendment is not only illogical and contrary to regulatory intent but is most certainly going to lead to further chaos in the already dysfunctional town planning and zoning regulations, and ultimately defeats the very purpose of designating plots for different use.
As observed by the courts numerous times, the mess created from non-conforming use of residential properties for commercial purposes has already disrupted the entire civic fiber of the city, and is an increasing threat to the quiet and comfortable living of residents of the vicinity as a whole at cost of the business interests of a few.
Citizens continue to be at the mercy of the SBCA and other government authorities regarding implementation of the ‘prescribed procedure’, which is Change of Land Use and Master Planning Bye Laws 2003 vide Resolution 383 dated 06/01/2004 passed by CDGK/KMC. Under it, 28 roads in Karachi were commercialised — this evil is another story for another day.
Karachi will once again be exploited for the benefit of a very small percentage of its citizens. These amendments and many more to come will make the daily life of the majority miserable. Those brave enough to seek legal redressal will be thwarted by red tape, secrecy, stonewalling, busy or unwilling courts, the futility of past legal failures will make citizens think and of course, the financial cost.
The SBCA has succeeded in further dividing Karachi; cantonment areas remain exempt, and so do old city areas, not because they are favourites but simply because the spaces, roads and plots in these areas do not meet the requirements necessary for private schools, new kinds of recreation, restaurants and other modern social activities.
And so while the building authority goes about its discriminatory actions and treats citizens unfairly, ‘competent authorities’ continue to function as willing enablers.</p><small>2025-04-30 05:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/301052155949c6e.jpg?r=105245' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907487/will-catholic-cardinals-pick-another-outsider-like-francis-to-be-pope' target='_blank'><strong>Will Catholic cardinals pick another outsider like Francis to be pope?</strong></a><br><p>VATICAN CITY: When Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio was elected in 2013 as Pope Francis, he was a near total Vatican outsider. He had never been a Vatican official, instead spending decades in local ministry. And he came from Argentina, the first pope from the Americas.
As the world’s Catholic cardinals meet this week to discuss who should succeed Pope Francis, the deliberations may boil down to a simple choice:  Do they want another outsider? Or is it time now for an insider, someone more familiar with the Vatican’s arcane ways of operating?   “Pope Francis… shifted the Church’s attention to the outside world,” said John Thavis, former Rome bureau chief for the Catholic News Service, who covered three papacies.
“Some cardinals will now be tempted to pick an insider, someone with the skills to manage church affairs more carefully and quietly than Pope Francis did.”  Pope Francis, who died on April 21 aged 88, focused much of his papacy on outreach to places where the Church was not traditionally strong.
Many of his 47 foreign trips were to countries with small Catholic populations, such as South Sudan, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, and he was especially committed to Catholic-Muslim dialogue.
He was also known for giving freewheeling press conferences, where no topics were off the table and the pope might respond to a query with an unexpected quip. Asked about the Catholic ban on birth control in 2015, Pope Francis reaffirmed the ban but added that Catholics don’t have to have children  “like rabbits”.
The late pope’s unusually open style attracted criticism from some Catholics, but also global interest. His funeral on Saturday and a procession through Rome to his burial place at the Basilica of St. Mary Major attracted crowds estimated at more than 400,000.
German Cardinal Reinhard Marx, one of the leading Catholic prelates in Europe and once a senior adviser to Pope Francis, said the cardinals who will meet in a secret conclave to elect his successor would not be looking for a  “functionary”.
“We do not need a manager,” Marx told reporters.  “What’s essential is that it be a courageous person… People around the world need to be comforted, lifted up.”  Other cardinals are expressing sharp disagreement.
“We need to give the Church back to the Catholics,” Italian Cardinal Camillo Ruini told the Corriere della Sera newspaper.
Ruini, who is 94 and too old to enter the conclave, said Pope Francis sometimes appeared to favour those who were distant from the Church,  “at the expense” of devout faithful.
Others argue that it is precisely a more managerial pope that is needed at this time to tackle the Church’s financial woes, which include a widening budget shortfall and growing liabilities for its pension fund.
Cardinals’ speeches
The cardinals are meeting daily this week to discuss general issues facing the 1.4-billion-member Church before those under the age of 80 enter the conclave on May 7.

On Monday night, Canada delivered a verdict that seemed less an embrace of Mark Carney and more a desperate clinging to the idea that someone — anyone — could out-think Donald Trump.
Carney, the rookie Liberal leader once better known for polishing interest rate forecasts than kissing babies, managed the improbable: he steered the battered Liberal Party to a fourth consecutive mandate. If not quite a coronation, it was nonetheless a remarkable reversal of fortune in a political landscape that had seemed destined, mere months ago, to turn Tory blue.
Victory, however, came with an asterisk. The Liberals are perched at 168 seats — enough to govern, but short of the 172 needed for a majority. Carney will lead a minority government, where survival will depend on managing a fractured parliament.
The election, a compressed five-week sprint, had been pitched as an epic duel between Carney’s supposed steadiness and Pierre Poilievre’s populist fervour. In the end, neither man’s vision truly captured Canadian hearts. Instead, it was Donald Trump, Canada’s accidental kingmaker, who overshadowed all.

With a fractured parliament at home and a belligerent Trump abroad, new PM now faces a daunting road ahead

Trump’s incendiary musings about annexation, his tariffs on Canadian goods, and his open contempt for Canadian sovereignty spooked voters more effectively than any Liberal attack ad could. A contest that would have been about housing affordability and carbon taxes turned into a referendum on national survival.
 
 

In an eerie echo of old fears, Carney sounded the alarm across the land: America is trying to break us so they can own us.
The Liberals’ campaign, with Carney at the helm, became less about Trudeau’s legacy and more about existential dread. The message: steady hands were needed to navigate the storm.
It worked — just enough to secure another mandate.
It is tempting to paint Carney as a man forged by the moment. A political outsider, coaxed into leadership by a desperate party. The narrative writes itself, and Carney leaned into it: “My government will work for and with everyone,” he declared early Tuesday morning, promising to heal divisions and govern for all Canadians.
But the shiny technocratic armour came with dents. Throughout the campaign, Carney struggled to reconcile his carefully crafted image of competence with the blood sport of electoral politics. And while voters may have ultimately chosen his brand of managerial steadiness over Poilievre’s ideological fury, it was no sweeping endorsement. The Liberals squeaked past, not soared.
For a man whose career had been built in the vaulted halls of global finance, the House of Commons will feel claustrophobic.
Meanwhile, Pierre Poilievre, who had appeared just months ago to be on the verge of a major breakthrough, faced a significant setback in his own backyard.
Losing ground to Liberal Bruce Fanjoy in Carleton, Poilievre delivered a concession speech with the tone of a politician determined to regroup and re-engage. The Conservatives may have lost the election, but they made tangible gains, particularly in Ontario, where they clawed back blue-collar ridings and suburban belts.
The irony? Poilievre was punished not for fighting Trump, but for not knowing how. His early campaign was a confused mess — one part MAGA cosplay, one part grievance-mongering — while Trump steamrolled his way into the centre of the Canadian electoral conversation.
By the time Poilievre tried to pivot, it was too late.
And then there was Jagmeet Singh — the man who lost not just his party’s relevance but his own seat.
The NDP’s collapse, especially in BC and Atlantic Canada, turned the 2025 election into a two-party race. Singh, ever the optimist, defended his legacy even as he walked off the stage. But there was no mistaking the NDP’s irrelevance; Canada’s progressive heartland shifted, not left or right, but inward — voting for survival in an age of trade wars and nationalist sabre-rattling.
Singh’s resignation was not a shock. It was an inevitability.
Carney now inherits a challenging mandate. His task: to stare down a belligerent US president while holding together a minority parliament that may not share his urgency or priorities.

Domestically, he has pledged to end interprovincial trade barriers, build infrastructure, and craft a unified economic policy. Lofty promises. Delivering them will require dealing with a parliament where support is tenuous, and enemies lie in wait.
Internationally, he must sit across from Donald Trump and navigate a negotiation that often feels more like a hostage situation.
Carney’s much-vaunted technocratic competence may keep the wolves at bay for now. But competence alone rarely stirs lasting loyalty. And as history shows, minority governments in Canada often falter — whether through ambition or inertia.
The Liberals have bought themselves time. How long it lasts, and at what cost, is still to be seen.
In an election shaped by uncertainty and hard choices, Canadians have once again opted for caution over upheaval.
The coming months will test whether this can deliver the stability Canadians hope for.

Addressing a press conference at the bypass, Ka­­rachi Bar Association Pre­sident Amir Nawaz Wara­ich and Sindh High Court Bar Association President Sarfraz Ali Metlo said the decision to end the sit-in was made after receiving assurances from the government and the issuance of an official notification addressing their concerns.
They confirmed that the notification issued by the government incorporated all points raised by the lawyers’ community. Based on this, the lawyers’ committee decided to end the protest, they said, adding that further meetings regarding the canals issue will continue.
The lawyers’ leaders said the government had pledged to provide the ne­­cessary legal documentation by May 7.

Traffic restored on National Highway after protest camps removed

These documents will detail all matters related to the legal and professional rig­hts of lawyers. Following this as­­surance, the lawyers’ committee expressed satisfaction with the outcome.
The lawyers reiterated their commitment to def­ending national interests and pledged that the legal community would maintain an active role in monitoring the government’s implementation of its pro­mises.
 
 

They expres­sed hope that similar issues would not arise in the future and that lawyers’ rights would be fully safeguarded. They descri­bed their movement as a successful struggle ag­­­­a­­i­nst injustices done to Sindh.
The lawyers’ leaders appealed to their colleagues to return to their professional responsibilities, highlighting the importance of unity in resolving national issues through dialogue.
Meanwhile, the process of dismantling protest camps began, and two-way traffic was restored on the National Highway.
Earlier, the Sindh government delegation held talks with the lawyers’ co­­mmittee at the High Court Bar Association office in Sukkur. The delegation was led by Law Minister Zia Lanjar and included District Council Chairman Kumail Haidar Shah, Suk­kur Commissio­ner Fayyaz Abbasi and Deputy Com­missioner M.B. Dharejo.
The lawyers were represented by Amir Nawaz Waraich, Sarfraz Ali Metlo, Qurban Ali Malano and others.
After the meeting, Zia Lanjar and Kumail Shah held a joint press conference. “We came here for negotiations with the lawyers’ committee and appe­aled to our friends to end the sit-in at Babarloi Bypass,” Mr Lanjar said.

The court announced the discharge of 11 individuals, including Mr Ash­raf, in the long-running Karkey Ship Rental Power reference, where the Nat­ional Accountability Bur­eau had alleged corruption amounting to Rs22 billion.
The Turkish energy com­pany involved, Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uret­­im A.S., had also filed a $1.2bn arbitration claim against Pakistan at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The claim was later withdrawn, reportedly following backchannel negotiations facilitated by the Pakistani government.
In a second reference concerning the Bakhi Power Project in Sheikhu­pura, the court discharged six more individuals, in­­c­luding a former chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda).
Separately, in the Sha­rqpur Power Project reference, the court acquitted all accused, effectively closing proceedings in all three major cases.
The Rental Power Pro­jects were introduced during the PPP’s tenure to ad­­dress the chronic power shortages plaguing the co­­untry. However, the initiative was marred by widespread allegations of corruption, inefficiency and lack of transparency.

The first drone was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops.
The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in the Satwal sector of Poonch division.
Security sources said the swift action by the Pakistan Army foiled the enemy’s nefarious attempt at spying and once again demonstrated the force’s vigilance, professionalism, and combat readiness.
“The Pakistan Army is fully prepared to respond promptly and effectively to any aggression by the enemy,” a military source said.

Troops continue to trade fire in Leepa Valley

The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since Friday night, breaking a period of relative calm in the region.
The Indian army, which often stokes tensions under the BJP government, claimed that its troops and Pakistani forces had exchanged fire overnight. While the Pakistan Army did not release a formal statement, military sources confirmed that Pakistani troops were responding to Indian shelling.
 
 

A video clip shared by military sources showed two Indian posts being precisely targeted by Pakistani forces in the Leepa sector. No casualties were immediately reported.
Tuesday’s incidents add to a string of similar aerial violations by Indian surveillance drones over the years, most of which have been swiftly countered by Pakistani forces.
In 2020 alone, three Indian quadcopters were downed after intruding into Pakistani territory. On May 29, a drone was shot in the Nekrun sector of Neelum Valley after crossing 700 metres from India’s Kanzalwan sector.
Just two days earlier, another was intercepted in the Rakhchikri sector of Poonch district after breaching airspace by 650 metres. On April 9 the same year, a drone was destroyed in Sankh sector of Haveli district after intruding 600 metres.

Barrister Aqeel Malik, the minister of state for Law and Justice, told Reuters that the government was working on plans for at least three different legal options, including raising the issue at the World Bank, which is the treaty’s facilitator.
It is also considering taking action at the Permanent Court of Arbitration or at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where it could argue that India has violated the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, he said.
“Legal strategy consultations are almost complete,” Barrister Aqeel said, adding that a decision on which cases to pursue would be made “soon”, and would likely include pursuing more than one avenue.

Barrister Aqeel says issue will be taken up on multiple fronts; SCBA forms body to provide legal assistance in the matter

Indian officials did not immediately respond to a Reuters request seeking comment.
 
 

New Delhi had last week held the World Bank-mediated Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 in abeyance after an attack in the Pahalgam tourist resort in occupied Kashmir, saying the suspension would last until “Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”.
Islamabad flatly denies any involvement in the attack, and in response to New Delhi’s actions, also suspended all trade and closed its airspace to Indian airlines.
Barrister Aqeel added that a fourth diplomatic option that Islamabad was considering was to raise the issue at the United Nations Security Council.
“All the options are on the table and we are pursuing all appropriate and competent forums to approach,” he told Reuters.
“The treaty cannot be suspended unilaterally and cannot be held in abeyance, there is no provision within the treaty,” said Malik.
Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately because the treaty has allowed it to only build hydropower plants without significant storage or dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.
But things could start changing in a few months and farmers, already hit by climate-change related water shortages, have raised concerns.
SCBA body to assist govt
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has constituted a committee to provide legal assistance to the federal government to help raise the issue of Indus Water Treaty of 1960 at appropriate forums.
The committee will be chaired by its president along with SCBA Secretary Salman Mansoor, Balochistan High Court Bar Association President Mir Attaullah Langove, Sindh High Court Bar Association President Barrister Sarfraz Metlo, as well as Barrister M.H. Subhani and Hafiz Ahsan Khokhar.
In a statement, the country’s apex body of lawyers said it remains steadfast in its role as a watchdog for the protection of fundamental rights, adherence to international treaties and the preservation of national dignity and sovereignty.
 
 

Beyond being a formal accord, the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 is essential to Pakistan’s very existence and prosperity.
The treaty, which was mediated by the World Bank, expressly asserts that none of its signatories can unilaterally terminate, withdraw from, or hold it in abeyance, the statement said.
Yet, India has suspended this very treaty in contravention of international laws, the statement said, adding that the association viewed the unilateral suspension of the treaty as an unnecessary move, aimed at disrupting the downstream water flow.

In an official statement issued on Tuesday, the Pakistan High Commission condemned the latest attack, which took place at approximately 5:18am on April 27.
The assailant, identified by British police as Ankit Love, reportedly hurled stones and splashed saffron paint on the outer wall of the High Commission, shattering several windows and staining the building’s nameplate. He was apprehended shortly after the incident by the Metropolitan Police.
The High Commission linked the act of vandalism to a larger, more aggressive protest that occurred days earlier on April 25, involving members of the Indian and British Indian community.

UK minister calls for calm among diaspora communities

Protesters shouted anti-Pakistan and Islamophobic slogans, and clashed with law enforcers.
 
 

“We expect that the British law enforcement agencies would prosecute Ankit, as well as the raucous protesters detained on Friday, in accordance with the relevant British laws,” the statement said.
Expressing concern over the escalating hostility, the statement from the mission reminded the UK government of its obligations under the Vienna Convention to protect diplomatic missions. It also reiterated its demand for enhanced security at Pakistani diplomatic posts across the UK.
“This is not the first incident where the High Commission of Pakistan or our Consulates in the United Kingdom have been attacked,” the statement read.
The Pakistan High Commission confirmed it is in contact with British police to obtain further details about Ankit Love, whose nationality has not yet been disclosed.
Reuters adds: Meanwhile, UK Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer has called for calm between Indian and Pakistani communities, after lawmakers voiced concerns that tensions over the Pahalgam attack in India-held Kashmir could spill into the diaspora.
“These issues have long been discussed with passion on British streets  and we call on sides, all community leaders, all involved to call for  calm at a time of tension in the region,” Hamish  Falconer told parliament.
Falconer appeared in parliament to answer an urgent question  on the situation, where lawmakers raised concerns about media reports of  ill-tempered protests outside India and Pakistan’s high commissions in London.
The British government’s long-standing position is that India and Pakistan are responsible for finding a solution to the situation in held Kashmir that takes into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people, he told parliament.

• PPP lawmaker endorses call for Imran’s participation in proposed multi-party moot
ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the right to retaliate, as he concluded his speech in the Senate on the recent tensions with India and diplomatic overtures deployed by Islamabad to contest New Delhi’s allegations in light of the Pahalgam attack.
The Senate session also witnessed a call by PPP lawmaker Syed Masroor Ahsan, who endorsed the idea floated by the PTI seeking the involvement of PTI chief Imran Khan in the multi-party conference to send a “message of unity” in the country.
The idea initially floated by PTI’s Ali Zafar was recalled by PTI’s Aon Abbas in his speech on Tuesday, in which he said PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, and PTI founder Imran Khan should participate in the moot to send a strong message.
 
 

PPP’s Masroor Ahsan, while endorsing the idea, observed that the government should show flexibility and listen to the opposition. “Both sides need to set aside egos,” he remarked. Earlier, at least three senators, Allama Nasir Abbas, Gurdeep Singh and Dost Muhammad, called for the release of Imran Khan from the Adiala jail.
However, PML-N Senator Nasir Butt said Imran Khan would have to face the law and prove his innocence to secure his freedom.
Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI chided former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for his purported silence over the Pahalgam attack and demanded that the political leadership make strong statements over the issue.
Stern response
Meanwhile, FM Ishaq Dar said Pakis­tan would pay back India in the same coin, but it would not initiate an attack.
Sharing details of Pakistan’s diplomatic overtures following the escalation in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, he said foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary have been taken on board about Pakistan’s concerns.
He said he also spoke directly to the prime minister of Qatar. Mr Dar praised China and Turkiye for expressing clear support for Pakistan in the wake of the crisis.
“I walked them through what happened — India’s psyche, its history and our concerns about what intentions it may have in light of that history,” he told the House. Mr Dar said intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.

Referring to the 2019 Pulwama attack that killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel and was blamed on a Pakistan-based militant group, the deputy prime minister noted that New Delhi had used the incident as a pretext to revoke Article 370 of its constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.
The region was subsequently absorbed into India’s union territory framework, a move Pakistan has repeatedly condemned. Ishaq Dar also said that India had been attempting to alter the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which determined the water-sharing mechanism between both countries, for the past two years, citing changing circumstances.
“I have my doubts, much like other people, that this drama was staged to suspend this treaty,” he said while referring to the Pahalgam attack. He said there was no evidence that it was a false-flag operation. “What we do say with full confidence is that Pakistan has nothing to do with this [attack].”
According to Mr Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered an independent investigation into the Pahalgam attack fully knowing that Pakistan had nothing to do with it. He also made it clear that any meddling with Pakistani waters by India will not be tolerated at any cost and will be taken as an act of war.
Meanwhile, the House unanimously passed “The Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention (Implementation) Bill, 2025” and “The National Commission for Minorities’ Rights Bill 2025 brought before it as a supplementary agenda.

• Says not a single shred of evidence shared by New Delhi to substantiate allegations against Islamabad

• Pakistan tells UN it has evidence of regional adversaries’ involvement in Jaffar Express incident
ISLAMABAD: Military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tues­day accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
Lt Gen Chaudhry was sp­e­aking at a press conference convened to show “how India is executing” terrorism inside Pakistan and said terrorism was the “basic thing” in the ongoing tense phase of ties bet­ween the neighbours. Pak­is­tan and India downgra­d­ed ties after tensions spi­ked in light of the April 22 att­ack in Pahalgam, in which 26 people were killed.
“It has been seven days since the Pahalgam att­ack, yet not a single shred of evidence has been provided to substantiate the baseless allegations levelled against Pakistan,” Gen Chaudhry said.
Based on intelligence ava­ilable with the Pakis­tani security agencies, he claimed India had activa­ted its terror networks to carry out attacks inside Pakistan.

“…they tasked all their assets, terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Kha­w­arij (the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan) and the ind­e­pen­dent terrorist cell like one presented today to inc­r­ease their activity,” he said.
He specifically cited the killing of 54 TTP fighters — described as the largest ever in a single incident — during a recent cross-border attack attempt from Afg­hanistan. He said the attack by the TTP’s largest formation, or “Tashkeel”, was “sponsored, facilita­ted, and abetted by India”.
India’s terror network
Gen Chaudhry provided details of Abdul Majeed, a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India, who was arrested last Fri­day (April 25) and linked to one of the terror networks.
“We will present to you how India has been found to operate a terror network inside Pakistan in which explosives, IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and other materials are being provided to terrorists to target not only military but also innocent civilians,” he said. He added that the evidence could be examined by any independent agency.
According to Gen Chaudhry, Majeed was apprehended from a bus terminal in Jhelum, where he was planning to carry out an attack. “An IED, two mobile phones, and Rs70,000 were recovered from him,” he said.

Investigations revealed that the network he was a part of included four Ind­ian military personnel in addition to Majeed. These Indian operatives were part of Indian military intelligence.
Majeed was allegedly recruited by Major Sandeep, an officer stationed in India-occupied Kashmir. His handler was identified as Subedar Sukvinder, a junior commissioned officer (JCO) of the Indian Army. Major Sandeep and Subedar Sukvinder were said to have tasked and guided Majeed. Other network members included Havildar Amit, also known as Adil Aman, and an unidentified Indian soldier.
Intercepted conversations between Majeed and his handlers were also played during the briefing and a timeline of Majeed’s activities and the funds he received was also shared. Majeed is accused of involvement in four sabotage attempts, including a botched one.
The first IED was delivered to Majeed last September in Parnala, Bhimber district. He used it to attack a military vehicle on Oct 13 in Pir Kanthi, Bagh district, injuring three Pakistan Army soldiers. He received Rs180,000 for the attack.
The second IED was delivered on Nov 22 near Head Marala. The drone used in the operation crashed, and its wreckage was retrieved by Majeed. He later used the device to attack a military vehicle in Jalalpur Jattan, resulting in four “casualties.” For this, he received Rs656,000.
On March 18, Majeed planned a third IED attack near Kotli. He became cautious after observing troop movements in the area. The following day, local schoolchildren discovered and reported a suspicious package. Two IEDs were recovered from the site.
Following the recovery, Indian media falsely claimed that five bombs had been discovered in occupied Kashmir, which Gen Chaudhry dismissed as “blatant propaganda.” The fourth IED was delivered near Nadala on April 22. Majeed was instructed to target a bus station in Barnala or Bhimber, but he instead suggested Jhelum due to higher passenger traffic.
“While he was in Jhelum to do this nefarious act of terrorism, he was apprehended by law enforcement agencies,” Gen Chaudhry said. “What’s this happening? And they are serving officers, serving JCOs, serving NCOs. This is what you call state-sponsored cross-border terrorism,” he added.
‘Credible evidence’
In a late-night statement, Federal Minister for Information Atta Tarar warned that India intended to launch military action against Pakistan.
Using the baseless allegations levelled in the wake of the Pahalgam attack as a justification, India could try to launch an incursion within the next 24-36 hours, he said.
The international community should realise that India would solely be responsibility for any destruction in the case of a conflict, he said.
 


Separately, Pakistan Mission to the United Nations on Tuesday said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the Jaffar Express attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”, according to a press release.
As per the statement, Pakistan possessed “credible evidence establishing that the attack on the Jaffar Express passenger train — in which at least 30 Pakistani nationals were slain and dozens taken hostage — was externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), three terrorists were killed during an operation near Turbat in Kech district. The operation was launched based on intelligence about the presence of militants in the area.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively eng­a­ged the khawarij location, as a res­ult of which, three terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a sta­tement, adding that a heavy exc­h­ange of fire took place between sec­urity forces and armed terrorists.
Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, who the ISPR said were involved in numerous attacks against security forces and the killing of civilians.

PM praises security forces, terms terrorists enemies of peace

“A sanitisation operation was conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area as the security forces of Pakistan are det­e­rmined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country,” it said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for the successful operation in Kech. In a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, he lauded the professionalism and bravery displayed by the troops and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to eradicating terrorism.
The terrorists are enemies of peace in Balochistan and oppon­e­nts of the province’s prosperity, he said, adding that the governm­ent would continue the journey of progress and development. The prime minister also reiterated that the entire nation stands by the security forces in defence of the motherland.
Ziarat IBO
In a separate incident, security forces killed seven   terrorists during an operation conducted on intelligence reports in the Choteer area of Ziarat district.
 
 

Officials said the targeted operation took place between the Chot­eer and Sanjavi areas between Mon­day night and early Tuesday. Armed militants hiding in the area opened fire on the security forces, who retaliated after taking positions.
“Heavy exchange of fire continued for two hours, during which hand grenades were also used by the militants,” an official said, adding that seven bodies were recovered from the area once the firing ceased.
Ziarat Deputy Commissioner Zakaullah Durrani confirmed the deaths and said the bodies were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Ziarat, by Levies personnel.
He said residents had earlier blocked the Sanjavi-Ziarat road in protest against the presence of militants in the area, suspending all traffic. They initially refused to reopen the road despite negotiations by the assistant commissioner.
However, following talks led by Deputy Commissioner Durrani, the protesters agreed to end their blockade and traffic was restored in the afternoon.

Victoria McCloud, a retired High Court judge, said she would bring  “one or more cases” against Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government, accusing it of breaching the European Convention on Human Rights.
Earlier this month, Britain’s top court handed down a landmark ruling that gender and sex were defined by a person’s sex at birth in the country’s anti-discrimination laws.
The government has embraced the ruling and said trans women should use men’s facilities and vice versa, with Britain’s equality watchdog announcing interim guidance along the same lines.
McCloud said in a statement that the ruling and official response  “is a serious infringement of the Convention Rights of EU and UK citizens, including in relation to sex, sexual orientation, and privacy”. “I intend firmly to re-assert my convention rights and other rights under the convention,” added the former judge, who now works as a litigation strategist.
The UK Supreme Court ruling also threw into confusion the validity of gender recognition certificates, which allow trans people to gain legal recognition in their chosen gender.
McCloud has a gender change certificate but according to the ruling she would be defined as a man under the Equality Act, leaving her with  “two sexes at once”, she alleged. The court’s decision was a victory for gender critical activists who brought the appeal to London after losing previous cases in Scottish courts.
McCloud said she and one other trans applicant were not allowed to present arguments to the Supreme Court during its hearing last year. The UK apex court hears appeals on points of law  “of the greatest public importance”, and can choose to hear arguments from  “interveners” at its discretion.

The standalone app comes as Meta looks to boost the AI assistant’s usage, apart from being available within the company’s family of platforms — WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.
It also signals CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s move to strengthen the company’s position in the competitive AI landscape, taking on major rivals such as OpenAI and Google.
Meta’s separate app will provide more personalised responses based on context and other user-specific elements related to the user’s Facebook and Instagram accounts.
Llama 4, Meta’s latest large language model, powers the Meta AI assistant and is designed to rival the latest AI models from OpenAI, Google, Deepseek and Anthropic, with improved reasoning, multilingual capabilities and efficiency.
The new app will integrate with Meta’s AI glasses and merge with the existing companion app, the company said. Meta is hosting its first-ever AI developer event, dubbed LlamaCon, on Tuesday, which will center around its Llama family of AI models.
The Instagram owner is set to report its first-quarter results on Wednesday after markets close. Meta will start testing a paid subscription for the AI chatbot’s advanced versions in the second quarter.
However, the subscription service might not rake in meaningful revenue until next year at the earliest, a source had said.

At a press conference marking the president’s 100 days in office, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters she had discussed Amazon’s reported move with the president and claimed it represented “another reason why Americans should buy American”. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon”. “Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” she added.
Earlier Tuesday, Punchbowl News reported that the e-commerce site will soon start showing “how much Trump’s tariffs are adding to the price of each product,” citing a person familiar with the matter. US President Donald Trump also called Amazon Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos to complain about the report of Amazon’s plan to detail the tariff impact for customers, according to multiple media outlets. 
However, Amazon insisted on Tuesday it has not approved any such proposal and said it never considered listing tariffs on its main retail site and nothing was implemented on any company site. “The team that runs our ultra-low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen,” said Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle. 

Trump calls Bezos to complain about report

Leavitt cited a 2021 report by Reuters that the tech company had partnered with a “Chinese propaganda arm.” Amazon in 2021 said it “complies with all applicable laws and regulations, wherever we operate, and China is no exception”. Amazon shares were down 2.2 per cent in premarket trading but later rebounded and were trading nearly flat.
Amazon set up Amazon Haul in November for products which could be impacted by tariff changes. This allows shoppers to purchase $5 handbags and $10 sweaters from China-based sellers, although they face longer shipping times. 
The uncertainty kicked up by the on-again, off-again tariff rollout has shaken financial markets, briefly pushing volatility up to levels not seen since the Covid-19 pandemic. While the endpoint of Trump’s tariffs is currently unknown, they are already starting to have an impact on businesses in the United States.
Trump this month signed an executive order that closes a trade loophole known as “de minimis” that has allowed low-value packages from China and Hong Kong to enter the United States free of duties. The order takes effect on May 2. Reuters reported on Monday some third-party merchants who previously sold China-made goods during Amazon’s premier July Prime Day shopping event are sitting it out this year or reducing the amount of discounted merchandise they offer.

A meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Petroleum presided over by Syed Mustafa Shah asked the Petroleum Division, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association to present their detailed reports on the subject for a way forward.
Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA) presented its case before the committee and protested the non-implementation of the government committee. They said the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had decided in September 2023 to revise their sale margins by Rs1.64 per litre for dealers and Rs1.87 per litre for oil marketing companies in four phases that year based on PSO’s operating cost.
The government had also committed to annual revisions in line with the inflationary trend, the PPDA representatives said, adding that early this year, the dealers had worked out a Rs2.20 per litre increase in their margins. Ogra, however, proposed to the government an increase of Rs1.40 per litre in the existing rate of Rs7.87 per litre for dealers and Rs8.64 per litre for OMCs. However, it has not been notified over the past nine months of the fiscal year.
During the ensuing discussion, a proposal for converting CNG filling stations into petrol pumps also cropped up. Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik clarified that such cases could be examined individually on a case-to-case basis under the existing petroleum policy, and there would be no immediate revision in the policy. The committee decided to defer further deliberation on this matter to its next meeting.
Addressing concerns regarding fuel quality, the minister pointed out challenges related to GST and LPG margins. He said Ogra was empowered to oversee these matters and that relevant issues would be addressed in the upcoming budget.
Ogra Chairman Masroor Khan informed the committee that petroleum prices were set every 15 days with the government approval and about 50pc of petroleum products demand was met by state-owned PSO.
