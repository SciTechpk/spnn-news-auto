Yaum-i-Ashura is observed every year on Muharram 10 with solemnity to pay homage to Imam Husain — the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) — and other martyrs of Karbala.
Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a traffic plan for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.
Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as army deployment as well as a crackdown on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of Ashura (Muharram 10), being observed today.
The Ashura majlis in Karachi commenced at Nishtar Park, according to an alert from the police. “The number of participants is approximately 3500 to 4000 and it is being led by Shahenshah Hussain Naqvi.”
Traffic has been closed from main Numaish to MA Jinnah Road up to Kharadar  Husseinia Irania Imam Bargah, with the exception of Bab-e-Urdu Chowk, Karachi traffic police said in a post on X.
 






A total of 7,004 police personnel are present for surveillance and security for the main procession.
Additionally, 733 NGOs, as well as senior officers of Karachi Police, and 6,271 head constables and constables are performing duty today. Expert police snipers have also been deployed alongside the main procession.
“Traffic police officers and personnel have been deployed to maintain traffic flow on the main procession routes and crossings, including alternative traffic routes arranged for the 10th Muharram procession, so as to keep the traffic flowing by keeping the public safe from any inconvenience,” said a statement from the office of Karachi’s additional inspector general of police.
“Karachi Police is providing complete security to the mourners participating in the 10th Muharram processions.”
The statement urged the public to keep an eye on their surroundings and immediately inform the police on Madadgar 15 of any suspicious or unusual situation.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid rich tribute to the sacrifice of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his companions, saying that Ashura gives us a message of sacrifice, truthfulness, sincere determination, and standing up for the truth.
In their separate messages on Yaum-i-Ashura, they urged the nation to uphold the values and principles of fortitude and courage demonstrated by the martyrs of Karbala and to exhibit perseverance in the face of trials, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. “This day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.”
In his message, PM Shehbaz said: “Karbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.”
He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p><small>2025-07-06 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/06104558d1f36af.jpg?r=104607' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922451/police-file-three-cases-against-pakpattan-hospital-staff' target='_blank'><strong>Police file three cases against Pakpattan hospital staff</strong></a><br><p>SAHIWAL: Following Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s directive, Pakpattan police on Saturday registered three FIRs in connection with the death of 20 babies at the paediatric ward of Pakpattan District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital between June 16 and 22.
Two FIRs have been registered against hospital officials and lab technicians for what the CM described as “criminal negligence” during a briefing on investigation findings. A third FIR was filed against the hospital’s parking stand contractor and staff for allegedly overcharging token fees and threatening patients. All nine suspects were presented before the local duty magistrate Mr. Gulzar who gave two-day physical remand.
Pakpattan District Police Officer (DPO) Javed Iqbal Chadhar told Dawn that all suspects were handcuffed and transferred to city police station lock-up. The medical superintendent and the health CEO were transported in their official vehicles under police custody.
City Station House Officer (SHO) Mr. Hashim said the FIRs were registered early in the morning on the basis of written complaints by the victims’ families.

Health CEO, MS among nine suspects remanded in police custody for two days

The first case, FIR No. 738/25, under Sections 322 (causing death by negligence) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), names health CEO Dr. Sohail Asger, MS Dr. Adnan Ghaffar, Medical Officer Dr. Ahsan, lab technicians Muhammad Tufail, Muhammad Murtaza, and Mumtaz.
The complainant, Ali Hyder of Mohalla Gulzarabad, said his newborn daughter Minhaj Fatima died due to lack of oxygen and proper treatment. He claimed that after raising concerns with the CEO, no action was taken. He also alleged the records of deceased children were deliberately removed. The FIR includes names of 15 grieving parents citing negligence and oxygen shortages.
The second case, FIR No. 739/25, was lodged by Muhammad Waseem of Chak 93/E under Sections 382 (theft with preparation for harm), 341 (wrongful restraint), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 148/149 (unlawful assembly). It accuses lab technicians Muhammad Tufail, Muhammad Murtaza, Mumtaz, of DHQ Hospital, along with Shahid Iqbal, Javed of Shafqat Lab, Irfan of Janoom Lab and Faisal of Alshifa Lab. The complainant alleged that these individuals were illicitly selling hospital oxygen to privately run facilities in which they had financial stakes. Waseem claimed he was threatened after exposing the theft on June 19.
The third case, FIR No. 737/25, was filed against parking stand officials under Sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 506, and 384 (extortion) on the complaint of Muhammad Ashraf. Those named include contractor Rana Nasir, Ali Raza, Rao Naveed, Shahzeb and two unidentified staff members. The complainant alleged that when he objected to excessive parking fees, he was held hostage by armed personnel and later released.
The DPO confirmed that all nine suspects were presented before the local duty magistrate Mr. Gulzar who remanded them in police custody for two days.

In an X post, Bilawal had used the word ‘Sindhu’ for the River Indus, warning that “an attack” on its flow (by India) would not be tolerated. Mr Chaudhry commented that Bilawal should not have used the word ‘Sindhu’. He wrote: “This is an attack on Pakistan, not on Sindh, unless you have also joined Sindhu Desh.”
 






This was a rather uninformed comment by Chaudhry. Bilawal was livid. He responded by posting that Sindhu is the ancient name of the Indus. He is right. Many folks outside Sindh aren’t aware of this. This is not something that is taught in Pakistani textbooks. So, whenever they hear the word ‘Sindhu’, the first thing that comes to their mind is ‘Sindhu Desh’, a term coined for an independent Sindh by the Sindhi scholar G.M. Syed.
The River Indus originates from a mountain spring in Tibet. Fed by glaciers, it flows through the Ladakh region into Pakistan. The majority of its journey towards the Arabian Sea unfolds within Pakistan’s borders. It is the country’s largest river and is often referred to as ‘Pakistan’s national river.’

Like most fed only on Pakistani textbooks, the former minister of information Fawad Chaudhry is woefully ignorant about the etymology of the word ‘Sindhu’ that he took offence to. It is, in fact, one of the oldest names for the River Indus and very much in continuous usage

About 5,000 years ago, a major civilisation emerged on the banks of the river. Archaeologists call it the Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC). It extended from northeast Afghanistan, to what today is Pakistan and northwest India.
No one’s sure what the river was called during the IVC period — even though, according to the American linguist Franklin Southworth, it was likely called ‘cintu’. However, the word ‘Sindhu’ first appeared in the oldest Vedic text, Rigveda (second millennium BCE). It is a Sanskrit word and Southworth suggests it may have been derived from ‘cintu’ by the people who dislodged and replaced the IVC population.
The ancient Persians pronounced ‘Sindhu’ as ‘Hindu’. Present-day Punjab and Sindh in Pakistan were part of the Achaemenid Persian Empire (550-330 BCE). The Persians referred to the people living in these regions as ‘Hindu’ or ‘people of the river.’
In the fifth century BCE, ancient Greeks encountered these people. The Greek rendering of the word ‘Hindu’ was ‘Indos’. They called the river ‘Indos’ and the region ‘Indoi’, or ‘the land/people of the Indos River.’
So, the word ‘Hindu’ is an ancient Persian word derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Sindhu’ referring to the river. ‘Indos’ was derived by ancient Greeks from the Persian word ‘Hindu’. It is from ‘Indos’ that we get the name ‘Indus’ (and India). None of this had anything to do with religion. There was no Hinduism as such at the time. The word ‘Hinduism’ is relatively new.
According to the historian Abraham Eraly, it was in the 16th century that non-Muslim populations of India began being referred to as ‘Hindu’, to distinguish them from the ruling Muslims. However, the word ‘Hinduism’ was only coined by British writers in the first decades of the 19th century. It referred to culminated traditions, texts and practices that date to the 2nd millennium BCE. But it wasn’t until the 19th century that the word ‘Hindu’ was given a monolithic religious context. Yet, there are still ‘Hindus’ who reject this word and claim to be followers of ancient ‘Vedic beliefs.’
The word Sindhu is still in use in India and Pakistan. For example, in Pakistan, Indus is also referred to as the ‘River Sindh’ (Darya-i-Sindh in Urdu). Again, the word ‘Sindh’ (in this regard) is obtained from the word Sindhu and not from ‘Sindh’ — the region that has a Sindhi-speaking majority. So where did the word Sindh come from?
Since a large part of the Indus runs across this region, the ancient Persians called it ‘Abisind’, the Greeks referred to it as ‘Sinthus’, the Romans called it ‘Sindus’, the Chinese ‘Sintow’ and the Arabs called it ‘Sind’. It is this eight century name that the Arabs gave to the region that has lasted to this day.
In 1843, British colonialists conquered Sindh and merged it with the ‘Bombay Presidency.’ This fostered a sense of deprivation among the Sindhis. For the next nine decades, Sindhi intellectuals and politicians worked to establish the status of Sindh as a province. In 1936, they succeeded. In 1947, Sindh voted to become part of the newly created Pakistan.
 


However, the sense of deprivation among the Sindhi-speakers returned when Sindh’s capital Karachi was put under federal control. Also, after the country’s creation, millions of Urdu-speaking Muslim migrants (mohajirs) from India settled in Sindh, leading to a significant demographic shift. This altered the ethnic composition of the province, especially in Karachi and Hyderabad.
New grievances rekindled the Sindhi nationalism that had emerged during British rule to establish Sindh as a province. In Pakistan, it was largely an intellectual project, led by the likes of G.M. Syed, Ibrahim Joyo and Sheikh Ayaz. In the 1960s, they formulated a ‘history’ of the Sindhi people which, according to the academic Dr Asma Faiz, “expressed the political and ideological aspirations of a community in search of its lost glory, hearkening back to a past that included a period of territorial and political autonomy before the onset of colonialism.”
Sindhi nationalism then took a more militant turn after the Bengali-majority East Pakistan broke away to become Bangladesh in 1971. A year later, Syed launched the Sindhu Desh movement, which aspired to separate Sindh from Pakistan. Ironically, at the time, a Sindhi, Z.A. Bhutto, rose to power. Bhutto and his PPP were staunch federalists, popular in Sindh as well as in Punjab. The Bhutto regime launched a scheme to neutralise Syed’s separatist politics. Bhutto co-opted Syed’s Sindhi nationalist narrative and put it in the context of Pakistani federalism.
In this, one can find the seeds of a federalist nationalism that posits that Pakistan is a continuation of civilisations that have been emerging on the banks of the Indus for 5,000 years. According to this narrative, Sindh is but just one part of this continuation, which otherwise includes all of Pakistan. This narrative has continued to erode the more aggressive conduits of Sindhi nationalism.
So, Mr Chaudhry should relax. Technically, being a Punjabi from Jhelum, he too is a part of civilisations which emerged in regions fed by River Indus, which also happened to be called Sindhu centuries before anything known as Sindhu Desh even existed.
Published in Dawn, EOS, July 6th, 2025</p><small>2025-07-06 05:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/06083504bcf5c3e.jpg?r=094311' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922404/pti-slams-bilawal-over-extradition-remarks-demands-explanation' target='_blank'><strong>PTI slams Bilawal over extradition remarks, demands explanation</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: PTI has denounced PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s remarks suggesting Pakistan could extradite citizens to India as a confidence-building measure (CBM), accusing him of undermining national security and appeasing a hostile neighbour.
According to reports, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said Pakistan had no objection to handing over “individuals of concern” to India, provided New Delhi showed a willingness to cooperate.
In a hard-hitting statement on Saturday, PTI CIS Sheikh Waqas Akram criticised the PPP chairman’s stance, calling him an “immature political child”. He said the proposal was ill-advised and detrimental to Pakistan’s national security narrative, adding that such statements humiliate the country on international platforms.
Mr Akram accused the “fraudulently imposed” government of bringing Pakistan to its knees.

Accuses PPP chairman of appeasing India, undermining national security

“We fail to understand why Bilawal is so keen on appeasing India,” he asked, alleging that the PPP chairman was proving time and again that he lacked political wisdom, vision and understanding of regional geopolitics.
“Instead of holding India accountable for its continued aggression, water terrorism and cross-border interference, Bilawal was proposing CBMs that compromise Pakistan’s sovereignty and integrity,” he said.
He emphasised that it was imperative to ask Mr Bhutto-Zardari on whose behalf he issued such a statement and what he intended to achieve by offering such concessions to a belligerent India by humiliating Pakistan on an international stage. Mr Akram also criticised the PPP chairman’s inconsistency.
 
 

“Bilawal has become a symbol of confusion and contradiction in Pakistan’s foreign policy discourse,” he said. “PPP was founded by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on the legacy of Kashmir, but today, Bilawal is betraying that legacy by pursuing political gains at the expense of Kashmiri blood.” Mr Akram went on to mock Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s political credentials, stating that leadership is earned, not built through media appearances and styling. “If PPP’s intelligentsia truly cares about Bilawal, they should let him contest local body elections first and appear on regional TV channels instead of being pushed on international media, where he only embarrasses Pakistan,” he stated.
He said the PPP chairman would lead the party to complete elimination, advising that if the party wanted to survive, he must step aside and hand over its leadership to Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, “who, at the very least, shows more promise and sense than him”.

It could lead to a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) from northern Gaza.
A ‘ceasefire’ was agreed to during the run-up to Trump’s inauguration — the outcome of considerable arm-twisting of Israel’s psychopathic regime in which even Netanyahu’s extreme views were dwarfed by those of his coalition partners who wish to ethnically cleanse occupied Palestine of its rightful Palestinian owners. The latest cessation may be shaky too. The earlier ceasefire lasted from February to March and Israel’s massacre of civilians resumed after it reneged on the promise to move to the ‘second phase’, which would have delivered a permanent ceasefire.
The details of the new agreement emerging in different media reports suggest a 60-day ceasefire followed by the phased release of Israeli hostages — numbering 50, including nearly three dozen bodies — in Hamas captivity since Oct 7, 2023, in return for the release of Palestinian hostages. (The Western media calls them prisoners in Israeli jails but since most have been imprisoned without due process, on the military court’s ‘administrative orders’, they, too, are hostages).
 
 

According to Western media reports, the new agreement will allow for the provision of direly needed food and other humanitarian aid through established international aid organisations, and not the infamous ‘Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’. The US-backed GHF rose to infamy when some of its employees discovered their conscience and anonymously told the BBC among others that they saw starving Palestinians, who were queuing for sacks of flour, shot by sadistic security contractors without provocation. IOF whistle-blowers also mentioned shooting starving Palestinians in queuing pens.

While the widely quoted death toll of Palestinians stands at around 57,000, some researchers have mentioned far higher numbers.

The new deal will also see IOF withdraw from some parts of northern Gaza where it has increased its occupation footprint, but till it happens, any withdrawal will be questionable because Israel has progressively squeezed the Gaza population into tinier and tinier ‘secure’ zones and even bombed those with heavy bombs and missiles.
While the widely mentioned death toll of mostly civilian Palestinians killed by IOF stands at around 57,000, and includes over 12,000 children, some researchers have referred to far higher numbers. Even an Israeli cabinet member talked of ‘1.8 million people in Gaza’, whereas pre-October 2023, the figure was said to be between 2m to 2.2m. Even if one were to take the lower number, the death toll would be four times than the widely quoted figure.
This is just part of the picture. The systematic destruction of Gaza’s infrastructure — from water, power and sewerage systems to schools, hospitals and some 80 per cent of homes can mean only one thing: ‘elimination of Hamas’, as the Israeli leaders described their war goal, is a window dressing to disguise a far more sinister agenda — the ethnic cleansing of Gaza by rendering the Strip uninhabitable and leaving the battered yet proud and courageous Gaza Palestinians no other option but to think in terms of relocating.
 
 

This view is substantiated by the zeal with which the IOF has gone after healers, doctors, surgeons, nurses, mobile paramedical staff, ambulances and hospitals. Men and women of learning, professors, educators, lawyers and similar thought leaders have been also targeted over the entire 21 months of a mostly one-sided war where US-supplied weaponry, including 500-pound bombs with targeting kits, has been used to slice off the top layers of the Palestinian intelligentsia. The long-term consequences of this ‘brainpower obliteration’ will not be known for months, even years.
After decimating Gaza and waging an unprovoked war against Iran, Netanyahu’s ratings have risen in his country. Also, as the Guardian notes, soon the Israeli parliament and top court will take a three-month recess. This means that Netanyahu will not face a vote of no-confidence by coalition partners more genocidal than him if he agrees to a ceasefire deal. At the same time, he will get respite from prosecution for several weeks, which many sceptics say was the cause of this prolonged genocidal military campaign.
In the Middle East, shaky despotic regimes may heave a sigh of relief. They took one position in public over Palestine and another privately as was evident in their role in ensuring uninterrupted supply to Israel of all its imports including energy and also defending the Zionist state by intercepting (and allowing the US to intercept) missiles and drones fired over their airspace by Iran and Yemen Houthis. There is obviously a gulf between the rulers and the ruled. Where the rulers are docile, the people are angry.
While the starving Gaza Palestinians will, of course, welcome any respite from the ethnic cleansing that each of them has witnessed or been affected by, through the loss of loved ones and the destruction of their homes, it remains to be seen what is in store for them over a longer period — beyond the first 60-day phase. Is the Arab rebuilding and rehabilitation plan still on the drawing board or will the narcissistic Trump push to realise his Gaza Riviera dream? Over the past months, reports of plans to relocate the Gaza population to as far away as Libya have trickled out. Each time Trump or others in the know are asked, they say there will be no forced relocation. Only voluntary.
When there are ruins where your home was; when there is no school or hospital or no civic infrastructure worth its name left standing; no food or water; and when Israeli drones and warplanes are hovering overhead, one wonders if any relocation will be forced or voluntary. The will of the Palestinians has baffled the world previously. Can they display it again, despite suffering relentless and indescribable pain for 21 months?

Under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Extended Fund Facility, the government is pushed towards austerity while raising tax revenue. Meanwhile, under the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), Pakistan is supposed to take measures to adapt to climate change. However, the EFF seems to be negating the effects of the RSF.
“The government has masked taxation levies as climate mitigation efforts,” says Ahtasam Ahmad, Climate Tech and Energy Finance Lead at Renewables First.
“The measures in the name of climate change, such as the carbon levy on petroleum products and the 10 per cent tax on the import of solar panels, are a form of indirect taxation rather than steps towards sustainability. If the government truly wanted to discourage the consumption of fossil fuels, it would not have coal-based electricity,” Mr Ahmad argues.

Experts criticise FY26 budget for prioritising taxation over genuine climate adaptation and sustainability efforts

Under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility, Pakistan has agreed to a climate tagging mechanism whose purpose is to improve the  visibility and accountability of climate-related expenditures. Under it, the country will monitor projects that are eligible under climate goals as per its Nationally Determined Contributions.
However, Mr Ahmad insists that the implementation mechanisms for these initiatives remain largely primitive and inadequately developed. While the government had checked the required boxes under the RSF, it has done so by feeding into the targets of the EFF.
Fugitive emissions
“There is a tax hunger in the budget,” says Aftab Alam Khan, an international consultant on climate resilience and social development. A levy of Rs2.5 per litre on petroleum products in the name of climate support is more a measure of taxing a captive market than a step towards sustainability.
Pakistan is ranked 156th in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, but is among the top 10 methane-producing countries in the world. In terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by sector, agriculture ranks number one and transport is number four in Pakistan, according to data from Climate Watch.
Mr Khan suggests that if the government wanted to rein in GHG emissions, it would have looked towards administrative measures first, rather than disproportionately burdening the poor in the name of climate change — roughly half of petrol consumption is through motorcycles. Agriculture generates the most methane emissions and is convoluted to address, but fugitive emissions can be addressed through administrative measures, Mr Khan explains.
Fugitive emissions are leakages in the oil and gas industries and are the second-largest contributor to methane emissions in Pakistan, he says. Mr Khan stresses that addressing these leaks requires working with oil and gas exploration companies to improve efficiency, an onerous task that would put the burden of action on the government rather than the low-hanging fruit of taxing demand-inelastic products like petrol.
More mitigation, not enough adaptation
A climate-vulnerable company that is overall a low emitter of GHG should focus on adaptation, such as finding ways to sustainably manage floods, rather than mitigation, which involves reducing emissions.
Unfortunately, about 87pc of the climate change budget measures are towards mitigation, says Mr Khan. There is a 30pc cut in disaster preparedness in the budget but a 157pc increase in post-disaster rehabilitation, he points out.
In his podcast “Front Seat to Climate Change”, Dawar Butt points out that most of the “climate money” isn’t new — it’s existing dam projects, now labelled as green. More critically, spending on climate adaptation has shrunk from 40pc a decade ago to just 10pc today.
 


No sector is more exposed to climate change than agriculture, yet it remains underrepresented in this climate budget, says Mr Ahmad. While there are small grants for crop resilience, agricultural adaptation challenges are largely overlooked. Farmers are living with climate change, but they are missing from this climate budget.
The other missing pillar is forestry, essential for absorbing carbon and protecting ecosystems, points out Mr Butt. Despite record deforestation rates, the budget for forest programmes has plummeted from Rs14bn during the Billion Tree programme years down to Rs2.4bn today.
The world tends to follow the US’s lead, and under Trump, America is moving away from climate change initiatives. His “big beautiful bill” will slow down US solar and wind power expansion as well as sales of electric vehicles, while potentially adding an extra seven billion tonnes of emissions to the atmosphere from now until 2030.
As a non-emitter and climate-vulnerable country, Pakistan needs to look towards itself and not the West for climate solutions. The underwhelming commitments under COP29’s climate finance targets attest to that. Without walking the talk and taking adaptation measures, tragedies like the deaths of 18 tourists in the Swat River flash floods are likely to continue.

The world’s richest person — and Trump’s biggest political donor in the 2024 election — had a bitter falling out with the president after leading the Republican’s effort to slash spending and cut federal jobs as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
Musk has clashed with Trump over the president’s massive domestic spending plan, saying it would explode the US debt, and vowed to do everything in his power to defeat lawmakers who voted for it.
Now he has created the so-called America Party, his own political framework, through which to try and achieve that.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” the SpaceX and Tesla boss posted on X, the social media platform that he owns.
“Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
 






Musk cited a poll — uploaded on Friday, US Independence Day — in which he asked whether respondents “want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system” that has dominated US politics for some two centuries.
 






The yes-or-no survey earned more than 1.2 million responses.
“By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!” he posted on Saturday.
Musk also shared a meme depicting a two-headed snake and the caption “End the Uniparty.”
 






‘Laser-focus’ on vulnerable lawmakers
It is not clear how much impact the new party would have on the 2026 mid-term elections, or on the presidential vote two years after that.
The Trump-Musk feud reignited in dramatic fashion late last month as Trump pushed Republicans in Congress to ram through his massive domestic agenda in the form of the One Big Beautiful Bill.
 
 

Musk expressed fierce opposition to the legislation and ruthlessly attacked its Republican backers for supporting “debt slavery.”
He vowed to launch a new political party to challenge lawmakers who campaigned on reduced federal spending only to vote for the bill, which experts say will pile an extra $3.4 trillion over a decade onto the US deficit.
“They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,” Musk said earlier this week.
After Musk heavily criticised the flagship spending bill — which eventually passed Congress and was signed into law — Trump threatened to deport the tech tycoon and strip federal funds from his businesses.
“We’ll have to take a look,” the president told reporters when asked if he would consider deporting Musk, who was born in South Africa and has held US citizenship since 2002.
On Friday, after posting the poll, Musk laid out a possible political battle plan to pick off vulnerable House and Senate seats and become “the deciding vote” on key legislation.
“One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,” Musk posted on X.
All 435 US House seats are up for grabs every two years, while about one third of the Senate’s 100 members, who serve six-year terms, are elected every two years.
Some observers were quick to point out how third-party campaigns have historically split the vote — as businessman Ross Perot’s independent presidential run in 1992 did when it helped doom George H.W. Bush’s re-election bid, resulting in Democrat Bill Clinton’s victory.

Since June 26, scores of lives have been lost to flash floods and house collapses in the country, bringing back painful memories of the devastating 2022 deluge that killed hundreds, displaced millions and inflicted over $33bn in economic costs. Labelled a “climate catastrophe” by the UN, the floods exposed critical gaps in Pakistan’s flood-warning and disaster-preparedness systems.
The recent tragedy in Swat, where surging river waters swept away several tourists, shows, however, that there was little effort to plug them. An inquiry report has highlighted the glaring flood telemetry gaps across flood-vulnerable areas, indicating that a functioning early flood-warning system could have predicted the sudden rise in the water well in time to save the tourists’ lives. It also points out that the rescue staff did not have the necessary tools to save them.
Pakistan is among the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries. Extreme weather events such as floods, heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainfall have become more frequent due to the rapid climate change in the last couple of decades. But climate change should not be used as an excuse to explain away the gaps in the early flood-warning systems or the lack of disaster preparedness.
The experience of other countries shows that early forecast and timely messaging can drastically bring down the death toll caused by monsoon floods. Likewise, flood-resilient infrastructure can help cut economic losses. Recently, the NDMA chairman emphasised reducing the impact of disaster by being prepared in advance and issuing timely alerts. He also stressed on coordinated efforts among different government departments and agencies. This shows that the awareness is there. However, it is not being backed by action.
 
 

With the frequency of calamitous weather events increasing, Pakistan cannot afford to be in denial after every tragedy. Each year of inaction means putting more lives at risk and increasing the cost of rescue and recovery. Even though the prime minister and other government officials never tire of highlighting the impact of climate change, the lack of adequate investment in flood-warning systems and disaster readiness reflects the old pattern of misplaced development priorities and bureaucratic complacency. But the time for half-hearted measures is long past.
The country will continue to suffer climate-induced tragedies unless we reset our development policies by placing vulnerable communities at the centre of the national policymaking process. It is time the government started prioritising investment in flood-resilient infrastructure, telemetry stations and disaster preparedness to protect the people and the economy from the adverse impacts of a changing climate landscape.

• Online sellers and courier services waiting for clarity over the future of their businesses
ISLAMABAD: Confusion and fear prevail not only among local and international e-commerce platforms regarding the imposition of new taxation regimes with the advent of the 2025-26 fiscal year, but also among sellers and courier services, who are waiting for clarity over the future of their businesses.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has compiled a list of eight key e-commerce platforms that provide tangible and intangible items, including music, movies, and software.
The largest selling platform was Facebook, with transactions worth more than Rs12.31bn. Others include Apple/Tunes, Google, AliExpress, Netflix, Temu, and Spotify, while the largest transactions are held under the category of others.
The total amount of transactions by these international and local online platforms, such as Daraz, OLX, Zameen, and PakWheels, exceeds Rs317.78bn.
The government has added a new chapter to the income tax regime, and taxes have been imposed on sales tax and other levies.
 
 

The overall situation has led to confusion among leading local and international platforms regarding the tax collection mechanism.
Incidentally, international e-commerce platforms have requested that their local partners clarify the tax collection mechanism in Pakistan, effective July 1.
“Our client has tasked us with looking into the outcome and talking to various courier companies to determine the impact on rates and tax filing mechanism,” said a senior executive of a PR company.
Due to a lack of clarity over the situation, neither he nor any executive of Pakistani e-commerce platforms was willing to disclose their identity; however, one executive pointed out that even the upgraded Income Tax law 2025 had not been uploaded to the FBR website.
One of the key stakeholders, the Pakistan E-commerce Association (PEA), has announced a protest against the new taxation regime.
Its Chairman Omer Mubeen warned that the new tax measures would shrink profit margins and put an additional burden on customers.
He added that there are growing concerns over harsh eCommerce taxation policies; the PEA, along with other relevant stakeholders, including the Chainstore Association of Pakistan (CAP), will continue to protest the move on social media and write letters to the concerned authorities.
While the new laws were facilitative for women businesspersons, confusion and a lack of knowledge have created panic among many.
The courier companies have also begun advising e-commerce businesses and individual sellers to complete their tax registrations to continue availing themselves of delivery services.
A local seller from Islamabad stated that e-commerce was still in its early stages in the country. Instead of supporting the industry, the government was making it difficult for entrepreneurs to do business.
Meanwhile, responding to the query, a senior official of the FBR said that the process would materialise after Ashura, which falls on Sunday, and most of the activities in this regard will commence from Monday.
He added that there were three main objectives of the new tax regime on e-commerce: registration of businesses, enhancement of tax collection, and streamlining the process for future regulations.
“There is a need for regulation of e-commerce too for the protection of buyers from frauds or deceptions by any unknown seller and that is not possible without registration of the businesses,” FBR official added.
Under the new regime, without proper registration, courier companies and online marketplaces will not be authorised to process or ship such orders.
Similar to physical retail outlets, an 18pc general sales tax (GST) has been imposed on all goods and services bought online, while additional taxes apply to non-filer purchasers and the platforms as well.
However, banks and online payment intermediaries will be required to maintain records of buyers for quarterly filing. The new tax regime also imposes penalties on intermediaries for failing to collect the due taxes or file the necessary documents with the FBR.

He said the grandson of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), along with his family and companions, sacrificed their lives for the “sake of truth, justice and religion but did not bow down to falsehood.”
“This great sacrifice of his reminds us that protecting principles and standing firm on the truth requires great courage and unwavering faith,” he said in a message on the occasion of Ashura.
He said the battle of Karbala taught us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the way that leads to Allah Almighty.

Strict security arrangements nationwide for majalis, processions

“Today, when our nation is facing many challenges — be it the economy, society or national unity — we need to take guidance from the life of Imam Hussain more than ever.”
He urged the nation to adopt Imam Hussain’s qualities of honesty, tolerance, patience and sacrifice in our national life.
On the day of Ashura, he urged the nation to pledge that they will make “truth and honesty our motto in our lives”.
“We will raise our voice against oppression and try to give our homeland the same peace, justice and dignity that is reflected in the bright character of Imam Hussain.”
Security arrangements
On Saturday, majalis and processions were held across the country in connection with 9th Muharram.
Strict security arrangements were made for around 2,763 processions and 7,598 majalis in Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Sindh, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan on Saturday.
 
 

In Islamabad, 61 majalis and 17 processions were held; in Punjab, 3,805 majalis and 1,677 processions were held; in Sindh, 1,207 majalis and 644 processions were held; in KP, 939 majalis and 261 processions were held; in Balochistan, 115 majalis and 11 processions were held; in GB, 1,290 majalis and 111 processions were held; and in AJK, 181 majalis and 42 processions were held.
Local law enforcement agencies monitored processions through drones and security cameras in 1,129 highly sensitive areas across the country.
Federal and provincial authorities have prepared security plans with zero tolerance for hate speech or sectarian provocations.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi emphasised that religious incitement on social media will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
He stressed that maintaining law and order is the top priority, and that law enforcement agencies are fully vigilant to foil the malicious designs of terrorists.

More than 24 hours after a five-storey residential building collapsed early Friday morning, rescue teams are still clawing through debris — brick by brick, slab by slab — searching for signs of life or closure.
Standing atop the rubble, Rescue 1122 personnel repeatedly press their ears to the debris of the collapsed building, calling out, “Is anyone there? Speak up. Make a sound.”
Each time they do, a flicker of hope stirs among the crowd gathered outside — the hope that, perhaps, a voice will respond. But within moments, that hope fades, giving way to fear — the haunting thought that maybe there is no life left beneath the ruins.
With every passing moment, hope dims while fear deepens. On Saturday, the recovery of eight more bodies from the rubble pushed the death toll to 21 — a grim reminder of the tragedy’s growing scale.

Over 580 buildings across Karachi officially declared dangerous — 107 of them in Lyari alone

Among the dead are nine women, eight men and a 13-year-old girl. Yet, for many, the waiting hasn’t ended. As evening falls on Saturday, families camped near the site cling to fading hopes that their loved ones may still be pulled out alive.
“My daughter and her son are still inside,” sobs 57-year-old Manohar, his face streaked with dust and tears. “I’ve been here since yesterday morning. Every sound from the rubble gives me hope — and then breaks my heart again.”
Manohar is not alone in his despair. Beneath the makeshift tents lining the edge of the rubble on main Fida Hussain Sheikha Road, dozens wait in silent hope for a miracle — one that might bring their loved ones back from beneath the debris.
Abid Hussain, a Rescue 1122 director overseeing the operation, offered a grim assessment that only deepened the community’s anxiety.
“We’re not sure,” says Mr Hussain when asked how many people are still missing or possibly trapped beneath the rubble. “Just moments ago, we spotted two more bodies under the debris — now we’re working to retrieve them safely. I can’t say anything with certainty, but I estimate there are still eight to ten people inside.”
The narrow alleys of Lyari, once echoing with the clamour of life, are now choked with emergency vehicles, volunteers, journalists, and live broadcast vans.
“Our machinery can’t get through the main street,” said the Rescue 1122 director. “We’ve had to carry heavy equipment by hand for over 300 metres. In some cases, stretchers couldn’t pass without dismantling nearby fences and stalls.”
 
 

The area, known for its age-old buildings and unregulated construction, presents a persistent risk. According to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), 588 buildings across Karachi have been officially declared dangerous — 107 of them in Lyari alone. In a neighbourhood already burdened by decades of neglect, these numbers reflect a ticking time bomb that residents have long feared.
“This was bound to happen,” said Iqbal Hussain, a local resident. “There are so many buildings like this — cracked walls, tilted rooftops — but no one acts until disaster strikes.”
Despite the bravery on display, cracks are also appearing in the city’s emergency response system. Witnesses recount a lack of coordination among agencies and moments of chaos when first responders arrived. A local resident claimed that the initial response team lacked proper equipment — some members, he said, didn’t even have helmets.
But Humayun Khan, chief of the KMC Fire Department and Urban Search and Rescue (USAR), firmly dismissed any suggestion of negligence.
“Just last Monday, a six-storey residential building collapsed near the Barra Imambargah in Kharadar, trapping at least 22 people,” he noted, citing the incident to support his case. “Can you believe it? All 22 were rescued — not a single life lost.
As clouds gathered over Karachi on Saturday afternoon, the threat of rain brought new concerns. Drizzle in parts of the city, threatens to soften the debris and further endanger both survivors below and rescuers above.
“If it rains tonight, our operations may be halted,” says a rescue official requesting anonymity. “The debris will become unstable and slippery, increasing the multiple risks.”
Plastic sheets were seen being hurriedly set up over portions of the site, an improvised shield against worsening weather.
Officials confirmed that the collapsed building had been illegally extended by several floors — one of which housed at least three separate residential units.
“This isn’t just a tragedy; it’s criminal negligence,” says Muhammad Hassan Bakhshi, Chairman of the Association of Builders and Developers (ABAD). He blamed officials within building control and development authorities for colluding with “mafias”.
The Sindh government claims to have initiated an inquiry into the tragedy and, as a first move, suspended the relevant SBCA officers. But locals remain sceptical. Many point fingers at the same regulatory bodies now promising justice.
“Where were these people when construction was going on?” asked Ishaq Baloch, a neighbourhood elder. “Everyone knew the building was too tall for such a small plot. But nothing happens until there’s a body count.”
Lyari is once again in the headlines for reasons no one wants.
“This could’ve been prevented,” said Jawad Shoaib, a Lyariite and city councilor of KMC who spent the night helping distribute food to victims’ families. “But for people in Lyari, prevention is a luxury. We only get attention when we bleed.”

Asked about Hamas’s positive response to the latest ceasefire proposal, an Israeli official said “no decision has been made yet”.
It came ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s departure for talks on Monday in Washington, where US President Donald Trump has intensified calls for an end to the war.
 
 

Gaza civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said Saturday’s dead included eight people killed in two strikes on schools in Gaza City. He also reported that eight people were killed by Israeli fire near an aid distribution centre in southern Gaza.
On the other hand, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he asked US President Donald Trump to intervene to stop shootings at Gaza aid centres, which the UN says have killed more than 500 people.
Erdogan said when he met Trump at the Nato summit in June, he asked him to step in and halt the bloodshed.
“I asked him to intervene in the Gaza process telling him, ‘You are the one who will best manage this process with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’. There are people who are being killed in food queues in particular.
“You need to intervene here so that these people are not killed’,” he said, his remarks reported Saturday by Anadolu state news agency.
“Hamas has repeatedly demonstrated its good will in this regard,” Erdogan said just days after his spy chief and foreign minister met separately with senior Hamas officials.
US pressure on Israel would be “decisive” in securing the success of the latest proposal for a 60-day truce in Gaza, he remarked, saying the issue of guarantees was “especially important”.

• Democrats worry ‘big beautiful bill’ will slash health, welfare support
• New legislation poised to add $3.4tr to US deficit over 10 years
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump signed his flagship tax and spending bill into law, capping a grandiose White House Independence Day ceremony featuring a stealth bomber fly-by.
“America is winning, winning, winning like never before,” Trump said before signing the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” on Friday, flanked by Republican lawmakers who helped push it through Congress.
Trump also played down criticism by Democrats that the unpopular legislation will slash social welfare programmes, saying: “You won’t even notice it.”
With First Lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump watched from the White House balcony as two B-2 bombers — the same type that recently struck Iranian nuclear sites — roared overhead, accompanied by F-35 and F-22 fighter jets.
The 79-year-old’s victory lap came a day after Republicans fell into line and passed the sprawling mega-bill, allowing him to sign it as he had hoped on the Fourth of July holiday.
The bill honours many of Trump’s campaign promises: extending tax cuts from his first term, boosting military spending and providing massive new funding for Trump’s migrant deportation drive.
‘Never been anything like it’
The legislation’s signing caps two weeks of significant wins for Trump that have seen him tighten his grip on power and his party alike. The successes include the recent Iran-Israel ceasefire that was sealed after what he called the “flawless” US air strikes on Iran.
Pilots who carried out the bombing on Iran were among those invited to the White House event, which included a picnic for military families on the South Lawn.
“The last two weeks, there has never been anything like it, as far as winning,” said Trump.
Trump had however forced through the tax bill despite deep misgivings in the Republican Party that it would balloon the national debt. The legislation is expected to pile an extra $3.4 trillion over a decade onto the US deficit.
It squeezed past a final vote in the House of Representatives 218-214 after Republican Speaker Mike Johnson worked through the night to corral the final group of dissenters. Trump thanked Johnson at the White House event, saying: “What a job.”
Democrats and many voters have meanwhile expressed concerns that the “big beautiful bill” will slash health and welfare support.
The bill will force through the largest cuts to the Medicaid health insurance programme for low-income Americans since its 1960s launch, while also shrinking federal food assistance programs.

Talking to journalists informally, the chief minister emphasised that he never contested the Feb 8 general elections as an independent candidate but rather as a PTI nominee. He said this would form the foundation of his legal challenge and vowed to go to any extent to secure PTI’s share of reserved seats in both the national and provincial assemblies.
The development come in the wake of the Constitutional Bench’s recent ruling on June 27, which effectively overturned the earlier Supreme Court verdict that had declared PTI eligible for the reserved seats for women and non-Muslims.
The CB decision, handed down by a majority of seven judges, nullified the Supreme Court’s July 12, 2024 ruling by eight judges and transferred the reserved seats to rival parties.

Cites his own nomination as basis for contesting case in court

Mr Gandapur reiterated that while PTI-backed lawmakers are now technically considered independents under the new verdict, he is not among them. Citing his nomination papers that clearly identified him as a PTI candidate, he expressed determination to fight PTI’s case in court on that basis.
With the CB’s decision rendering PTI ineligible for reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies, the number of opposition members in the KP Assembly is expected to jump from 27 to 52.
Presently, out of 27 opposition MPAs, nine each belong to the JUI-F and PML-N, five to PPP and two to each ANP and PTI-P. The strength of the opposition, however, will now include 19 from the JUI-F, 16 from PML-N, 11 from PPP and three each from ANP and PTI-P.
Currently, the 120-strong house has 93 PTI-backed MPAs, with mostly elected as independents, while 25 seats reserved for women and non-Muslims were vacant due to the cases pending before the Supreme Court.
After the increase in their strength, the opposition members will be in a position to requisition assembly sessions. So far, they did not have sufficient numbers for the purpose. The Friday’s judgement restored several March 2024 notifications of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to declare 25 candidates of opposition parties elected to reserved seats in the KP Assembly.
Apart from the provincial assembly, the eight MNAs elected on reserved seats for women from KP also stood restored. These MNAs include four from PML-N and two each from JUI-F and PPP. In addition to electoral matters, CM Gandapur discussed regional issues, reiterating his willingness to engage with the Afghan interim government to help resolve bilateral challenges, provided he is given the mandate. He strongly criticised the forced return of Afghan nationals, terming it a violation of human rights and international law. “We cannot humiliate Afghan nationals and will never force them to leave for their country.”
Mr Gandapur also argued that open borders and continued legal trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan would significantly contribute to reducing militancy in the region.

“We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.” — Winston Churchill 
Every year on the 29th of Zilhaj, a powerful transformation sweeps across Karachi’s imambargahs. Vibrant flags give way to sombre black, publicly signalling the solemn start of Muharram, the month of mourning for Imam Hussain (AS). 
This deeply symbolic act ignites a city-wide flurry of activity — from setting up of sabeels [water stalls] to final touches on meticulously pre-planned majalis [religious gatherings] and shab-bedaari [night-long vigils].  Sir Winston Churchill’s profound insight into the symbiotic relationship between human agency and the built environment finds its ultimate expression. 
Karachi’s 200-plus significant imambargahs transcend mere structures. Deeply woven into the city’s soul, these spiritual anchors, founded by passionate individuals, are a powerful testament to how the fusion of history, faith and culture narrates incredible stories of human fortitude. The following are snapshots of some of the earliest landmarks.

From humble pre-Partition origins, and born out of unwavering devotion, Karachi’s earliest imambargahs organically evolved into dynamic spiritual anchors that have defined the city’s cultural fabric over the decades. On the occasion of Ashura, Eos sheds light on some of Karachi’s most iconic Shia landmarks...

IMAMBARGAH SIRAJ,
LYARI (CIRCA 1775)
Dr Aqeel Abbas Jaffery, in his seminal work Karachi Ki Azaadari — Ibtidaai Nuqoosh: 1950 Tak, unearths a compelling truth: the city’s oldest imambargah, dating back approximately 250 years, stands near Sarafa Bazaar in Kharadar, Lyari. Originally named Imambargah Siraz — a name echoed on its Sindhi script plate as “Imam Warah Siraz” — it paid homage to the indigenous Sindhi Shias, known as Siraji, who inhabited Moosa Lane. 
Their distinct tradition of lamentation is characterised by slow, low-tempo chest-thumping. It is widely inferred that this venerable institution later evolved its name to Imambargah Shiraz, a graceful concession to the renowned city of Shiraz, Iran. Concurrently, the adjacent neighbourhood, once intimately known as Siraz Jo Parro, has been transformed into what is now recognised as Siraj Colony.
GHAREEBUL GHURBA IMAMBARGAH,
NAYA ABAD (1830)
Behind Bishu Imambargah, in a narrow street in Naya Abad, lies the Ghareebul Ghurba Imambargah. Established in 1830 by a remarkable woman named Fatima, affectionately known as “Phappan”, a member of the Khoja Shia Asna Ashri Jamaat. This sacred site holds a rich history, deeply intertwined with the stone-crafting profession. It was originally known in the local Sindhi lexicon as Phappan Ka Pirr, a term where “pirr” signifies a revered space.  
Over time, Phappan Ka Pirr evolved into its current, more formal name: Ghareebul Ghurba Imambargah. Yet, the echoes of its founder and the skilled hands that shaped its stone walls continue to resonate, reminding visitors of its humble beginnings and profound significance.
BISHU IMAMBARGAH, NAYA ABAD (1835)

Another documented presence of Shia communal life in colonial times centres around the Bishu Imambargah in Naya Abad, a historic quarter of Karachi. Established in 1835, it predates many other well-known landmarks, including the Barra Imambargah in Kharadar. The Bishu Imambargah was founded in Baghdadi by a trader named Bishu. 
Initially a single room, it was later expanded to a double-storey structure with stone walls. For almost two centuries, it has served as a pivotal hub for religious gatherings, mourning rituals for Imam Hussain, and a focal point for communal life for Karachi’s Shia community.

IMAMBARGAH BARAH IMAM,
BHIM PURA (FROM 1836)
Dedicated to the 12 spiritual leaders of Shia theology, Imambargah Barah Imam, located in Bhim Pura on Nishtar Road, is a composite of five (another tradition recounts 12) smaller imambargahs and was constructed in 1836 by devout follower Chaudhary Allah Ditta. This historic site famously hosted Allama Aqeel Turabi as a prominent zaakir [religious speaker] for many years. During Muharram and Youm-i-Ali (the death anniversary of Imam Ali (AS), Ramazan 21), processions from this imambargah traditionally traverse Napier Road before merging with the main juloos [procession] at Denso Hall.
BARRA IMAMBARGAH, KHARADAR (1868)


Photographs by Tahir Jamal

 
Built in 1868, Kharadar’s Barra Imambargah stands as a pre-Partition landmark, a central hub for deeply poetic annual rituals. According to Yousuf Ali Ghadir, whose forefathers migrated from Bushehr, Iran, the imambargah observes “alam nehar kar dena” on the 27th of Zilhaj, meticulously lowering revered alams [sacred flags]. Just two days later, on the 29th of Zilhaj, the community gathers for “alam kushai”, the ceremonial raising of these alams for ziarat. The air fills with Sache Bhai’s ‘Ooncha rahe apna alam’ [May our flag fly high], as one main alam is hoisted. Simultaneously, an alam dedicated to Hazrat Abbas (AS) rises to the heart-wrenching ‘Abbas, tere khoon se rangeen hai alam tera’ [Abbas, your flag is coloured by your blood]. 
These poignant moments mark the official start of majalis at Barra Imambargah. This tradition beautifully fuses Sindhi and Irani cultures, centralising traditional drumming. The Sindhi naqqara [drum] symbolises local heritage, while the majestic senj-o-dammam echoes deep Irani influence. Originating from Bushehr, senj refers to cymbals and dammam to drums. 
IMAMBARGAH HUSSAINIA IRANIAN,
KHARADAR (1948)

In Kharadar, the  Imambargah Hussainia Iranian stands as a pivotal religious site. Originally a pre-Partition community centre owned by a Hindu or Sikh family, it was acquired post-Partition by an organisation of immigrant Iranians. A significant transformation occurred in 1960, when a nearby Khoja Asna Ashri mosque was renovated and its sacred taburukaat [artefacts] moved to what was then formally designated Hussainia Anjuman-i-Iranian, solidifying its role as an imambargah.

Another compelling narrative recalls the fervour of the first Muharram in newly independent Pakistan, just three months after its birth. Destitute muhajireen [refugees] from India commemorated the month with profound devotion. It’s said the 10th Muharram procession, traditionally ending at Barra Imambargah Kharadar, spontaneously diverted to Hussainia Iranian. Local Iranian bakery owners promptly distributed fresh buns as taburak [blessings] to the immense gathering of mourners.
The imambargah’s renown was further amplified by Allama Rasheed Turabi. Upon his 1949 migration to Pakistan, this revered Islamic scholar began delivering powerful majalis within its walls, heard by both Shia and Sunni communities across the city.

IMAMBARGAH
MEHFIL-I-SHAH-I-KHORASAN, SOLDIER BAZAAR (1948)
Established in 1948, just a year after Pakistan’s independence, the Imambargah Mehfil-i-Shah-i-Khorasan in Soldier Bazaar became renowned for hosting significant Muharram majalis. Its inception addressed the immediate post-Partition needs of prominent Shia families, the Habib and Gokal groups, who settled in Catholic Colony Number 1. 
Their initial Muharram observance in a makeshift tent sparked a vision for a permanent imambargah. The community responded fervently, with Qasim Ali Gokal’s house donated for ziarat [visitation]. Crucially, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah himself allotted the land for both a mosque and the imambargah. 
Masterfully designed by Muhammad Ali Habib, both structures arose within 18 months. Khoja Shia Asna Ashri women named it, echoing pre-Partition Bombay traditions. Subsequently, Nishtar Park, conveniently located near Mehfil-i-Shah-i-Khorasan, replaced Jahangir Park as the central assembly point for religious and political gatherings. 
QAIMIA IMAMBARGAH,
MALIR (1948)
As narrated in Professor Syed Imran Zafar’s Karachi Ki Aazadari (Volume 1), in 1947, Syed Abu Jafar Zaidi, a railway employee and mohajir from India’s Awadh region, arrived in Karachi, carrying little but the unwavering flame of his faith. After a cramped start in Kharadar, Zaidi and his family settled in a vacant building (known as Seth Daulat Ram’s haveli) in the Malir Mandir area in 1948. 
Zaidi arrived from India with sacred relics for his home-imambargah, seeking fellow mourners in an unfamiliar land. The first majlis [religious gathering] was held in the abandoned Daulat Ram building and this led to the formal establishment of Qaimia Imambargah in 1948, named after his ancestral one in Safipur.
The path was arduous. Zaidi’s property claim was rejected, and the building itself became contested. But his devotion was legendary; his family even saved their sugar ration and consumed jaggery all year to be able to offer tea to mourners during Muharram. This is the enduring human story of Qaimia Imambargah: a relentless testament to faith, born from displacement, forged in sacrifice, and sustained by an unwavering community.
IMAMBARGAH SHAH WILAYAT, GOLIMAR (1960) 
The azadari in Karachi’s Ali Basti in Golimar pulses with centuries of history, originating from Aligarh and Jalali (UP) in India — hubs of Muslim resurgence and Shia devotion. After Pakistan’s creation in 1947, a considerable number of Syeds and devout Jalali residents arrived in Karachi as destitute migrants, finding solace in makeshift camps. By 1950, as Karachi expanded, many settled in Ali Basti. With Muharram’s arrival, the community swiftly established spaces of faith. A mosque (Masjid-i-Haideri) rose in 1950, later managed by the Haideri Trust. Simultaneously, the Hussainia Imambargah, also known as Jalali walon ka imambargah [the imambargah of the Jalalis], was founded. 
Syed Istijab Hassan Naqvi, an Amroha migrant, established Imambargah Shah Wilayat in 1960, hosting its first Muharram majalis despite initial hardships. Today, with redeveloped sections and installed zarih [shrine replicas], Imambargah Shah Wilayat remains a vibrant azadari hub, echoing centuries-old devotion that found its resilient home in Karachi. 
It is traditionally held that the iconic noha [religious lament] ‘Ya Abbas, har dil ne pukara ya Abbas’ from Anjuman-i-Haidery Ali Basti, began with a couplet by Hussain Qaiser Rizvi (Ali bhai) in 1969-70. His relative Waheedul Hassan Hashmi completed it, and Ali bhai began reciting it. In 1973-74, Naseem Amrohvi further enriched this powerful lament with additional couplets.
IMAMBARGAH JAFFAR-I-TAYYAR, MALIR (1960) 



 
In Malir’s Jaffar-i-Tayyar Society, the vibrant history of azadari [mourning] predates the locality itself, a testament to unwavering communal resolve. The narrative began in 1960, with the establishment of the adjacent F-South locality, sparking a critical need for a dedicated mosque and imambargah. By 1963, a 2,000-square-foot adjacent plot was allotted for the purpose. 
Yet, construction faced trials. Walls were repeatedly erected only to be mysteriously razed each night. To counter this, a dedicated team of 12 volunteers, headed by Ali Hasan Zaidi (also known as Darogha Ji) instituted nightly vigils, their charpoys placed directly within the nascent imambargah, ensuring its survival. 



 
Today, Jaffar-i-Tayyar’s Muharram programmes are a meticulously orchestrated display of profound devotion. The entire locality transforms: black flags adorn every corner, azakhanas [places for azadari] are readied, and the central road becomes a vibrant sea of sabeels, offering refreshments and stalls brimming with Islamic literature. 



 
SHAH-I-KARBALA TRUST (RIZVIA) IMAMBARGAH, RIZVIA SOCIETY (1960)



 
In 1948, Maulana Aneesul Hasnain, a dedicated schoolteacher, and Advocate Qazalbash envisioned a new settlement. Their goal: to create decent dwellings for those building new lives in a nascent nation. Most initial residents of their new settlement were migrants from India’s historic Awadh region, particularly Lucknow. These families, carrying centuries-old religious traditions, found fertile ground for expression in their new 56-acre habitat. 
Pakistan’s very first 8th Rabi-ul-Awwal procession emerged from what was by then known as Rizvia Colony. It was Musseab Ali Zaidi, a visionary and devout individual, who initiated this profound tradition that continues to wind through the streets of Rizvia Society to this day. The community’s spiritual heart quickly emerged with the construction of the central mosque, reverently known as Shah-i-Karbala Masjid. Its foundation was laid in 1960-1961 on a 6,000-square-yard plot, and it was completed by 1964. The Shah-i-Karbala Trust was officially registered on January 3, 1962. The prime anjuman [association] here is Anjuman-i-Ghum Khawaraan-i-Abbas, and their signature noha is ‘Kartay hain maatam haram Abbas ka….ho gaya marna sitam Abbas ka.’

THE UNSUNG ARCHITECTS OF KARACHI’S CULTURAL LANDSCAPE
Far beyond a handful of prominent landmarks, Karachi’s imambargahs are living chronicles of faith, culture and history. They’re the powerful crucible where human agency, brick, mortar and steel converge to forge incredible stories of courage and enduring spirit. 
Carved in stone and spirit, these institutions reveal how resilient, often displaced, communities meticulously recreated their heritage, fundamentally negotiating the city’s soul. They stand as powerful proof of endurance against immense odds, demanding urgent, academically robust documentation to make it a part of urban planning and decision making.

The agreement was reached during the 9th round of Bilateral Political Consultations (BPC) between Pakistan and Poland held in Warsaw.
According to the Foreign Office, Pakistani delegation was led by Ambassador Muhammad Ayub, Additi­onal Foreign Secretary (Europe), while the Polish delegation was headed by Secretary of State at the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs Wadysaw Teofil Bartoszewski.
The Ambassador of Pak­is­tan to Poland, Muhammad Sami-ur-Rehman, and the Polish Ambassador to Pakistan, Maciej Pisarski, were also present during the consultations. The two sides reviewed the entire spectrum of bilateral relations.
 
 

The additional foreign secretary reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further broadening and deepening its ties with Poland in various fields, including trade, investment, energy, security and defence cooperation, science and technology, agriculture, migration and mobility and higher education. Regional and global issues of mutual interest, including developments in South Asia, the Middle East, and Europe were also discussed in depth.
The two delegations found convergence on key issues and agreed to continue cooperation at multilateral forums, including the United Nations. It was mutually agreed that the next round of consultations will be held in Islamabad in 2026.

• Interior minister dismisses reports about president’s removal, says two parties, army ‘on same page’
• PPP leader claims party in no mood to join federal or Punjab cabinet
LAHORE: Two key federal ministers on Saturday dismissed speculations regarding the disintegration of the PML-N-PPP alliance, saying the two parties, and even the army were “on the same page”.
However, the enthusiasm regarding the coalition was a bit more diminished among PPP leaders who accepted having differences with the ruling party and also stressed the party has no desire to take ministries in the federal government.
While talking to the media in Lahore, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that the PML-N’s total seats in the National Assembly have increased after the distribution of reserved seats in light of the Supreme Court’s order but the party was in no mood to shun PPP.
“The Bilawal-led party stood by the government during difficult times and we have instructions from Nawaz Sharif that in the times of stability, we must not abandon those who had supported us in challenging times.”
He said the PPP was a key ally of the federal government and would remain so. “We have an ideal working relationship. We [the PML-N] had formed the government with the help of the PPP,” he said while talking to reporters.
He acknowledged the critical support by PPP, without which the ruling coalition wouldn’t have come to power after the 2024 general elections.
‘No change in top office’
Also, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi during an interaction with the media in Sukkur said that there were no plans to remove President Asif Zardari and dismissed the reports about any such move.
He said the government, army, and the president were “fully aligned and on the same page”.
“Those who don’t want to see them united are spreading such rumours.”
Speculations about widening gap emerged as both parties, allies in the Centre, started jostling to strengthen their ranks by wooing disgruntled PTI leaders in Azad Jammu and Kashmir while the PTI leadership addressed pressers to declare that they would foil attempts to dislodge KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur amid political wrangling over reserved seats.
In AJK, the PML-N formally inducted a PTI defector into its parliamentary party, raising its strength in the 53-member Legislative Assembly to nine. Chaudhry Akmal Sargala, who was elected in 2021 from LA-37 (Jammu-IV), a Kashmiri refugees’ constituency in Punjab, announced his switch to PML-N on Friday.
Mr Sargala’s decision comes just days after the PPP pulled off a similar move, managing to break away four lawmakers elected on PTI tickets in 2021. These lawmakers included Ali Shan Soni, Shahida Sagheer, Chaudhry Rafique Nayyar and Javed Butt.
Following these inclusions, the strength of the PPP parliamentary party in AJK Assembly has risen to 17.
 
 

Earlier, speculations that the PPP might join the cabinet in Centre and Punjab started making rounds after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif claimed, “There is a growing possibility of an arrangement between the PML-N and PPP that will allow both parties to jointly pursue a national agenda.”
When Deputy PM Dar was asked about the move, he told reporters in Lahore that the PPP had not demanded any ministries from the PML-N.
While PPP, over the past year, publicly shunned the idea of joining the federal and provincial cabinets, some of its leaders proposed taking the ministries as all the party has supported the PML-N on every other matter.
‘Take ministries or quit’
Senate chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, a PPP leader, also recently proposed to the party leadership that they either join the government or leave the coalition and go to the public.
Some party leaders believe that after 17 months of robust support for the PML-N in the Centre, the time has now arrived for the PPP to consider whether it should take ministries in both the federal and Punjab governments.
One issue where PPP leaders think the party went above and beyond its role as a “silent coalition partner” to support the government was in the aftermath of the conflict with India.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari travelled to different countries “playing the role of a foreign minister” to fight Pakistan’s case against India in the world, a PPP leader from Punjab told Dawn on Saturday.
The PPP called Foreign Minister Dar’s portfolio “ceremonious” and added that it would be better if his party joined the government and Mr Bhutto-Zardari became the foreign minister officially.
Amid this jostling, Mr Dar said the PML-N would work with all parties, including those in the opposition.
‘Wishful thinking’
However, he ruled out any meeting between PML-N president Nawaz Sharif and PTI patron-in-chief Imran Khan at Adiala Jail in the coming days, calling it “wishful thinking”.
“We don’t need to go to someone … However, [with regard to Imran Khan], the law will take its own course.
Meanwhile, PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan said his party had been offered ministries by the PML-N in the Centre and Punjab, but it was not interested in joining the cabinets.
“The PML-N has offered cabinet positions to us, but the party is not interested in joining the cabinet as it has reservations on some issues,” said Mr Khan
He said the two parties have “different ideologies and stances” on various issues.

The alert said that heavy to very heavy rainfall from Sunday to Monday may trigger flash floods in local streams of Murree, Galiyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan and Islamabad/Rawalpindi.
Flash flooding is also possible in the hill torrents of D.G. Khan, northeast Punjab, Kashmir and parts of Balochistan.
Officials warned that landslides and mudslides could cause road closures in vulnerable hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Murree, Galiyat and Kashmir during the wet spell.

Chilas records its highest temperature since 1997, hitting 48.5 degrees Celsius

The department said heavy downpours may also cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar.
 
 

An official said moist currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are entering the country and are likely to strengthen. “A westerly wave is also expected to affect upper part from Sunday evening,” he said.
“Mainly hot and very humid weather in most parts of the country with rain-wind/thundershower is expected at isolated places in Kashmir, upper/central Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, southeastern Sindh and north/southern Balochistan”
He added, “Heavy falls are also likely at few places in Kashmir, northeastern Punjab, Potohar region and upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the period.”
On Saturday, heavy rain fell in Rawalpindi and Islamabad in the early hours. The maximum rainfall of 75 millimetres was recorded in Saidpur.
Separately, the Met Office reported that Chilas in Gilgit-Baltistan recorded a temperature of 48.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday, its highest since 1997. The last record was set on July 17, 1997.
On the other hand, people in many parts of Balochistan braved a very hot day, as 48 degrees Celsius was recorded in Naukundi, 46 degrees in Dalbandin, and 45 degrees in Sibi.

“We sold about $450m to banks in June, highlighting our growing role in supporting the country’s exchange rate stability,” said Zafar Paracha, Secretary General of ECAP.
Exchange companies have welcomed the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) recent decision to include them in the Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI). For years, these companies have demanded similar incentives to those offered to banks, arguing that they also play a crucial role in channelling remittances.
“This incentive will certainly boost remittance inflows through exchange companies, and I believe FY26 could witness a new record,” Mr Paracha said. He estimated the total remittances handled by exchange firms during FY25 to be around $5bn, although he noted the figure is not yet officially confirmed.
The SBP issued a circular this week confirming the inclusion of exchange companies in the PRI framework. Under the new arrangement, exchange firms will receive Rs22 per dollar transaction, a substantial increase from the previous Rs2 they had been receiving for years.
Pakistan received $35bn in remittances during the first 11 months of FY25. With June inflows added, the total figure is expected to surpass the revised target of $38bn for the fiscal year.
Despite the significant contribution of remittances, the country’s export performance remained weak. Exports grew by only 6pc in FY25, far below the government’s ambitious goal of increasing exports to $60bn. Stronger remittance inflows have partly offset the shortfall.
Nonetheless, the government managed to maintain exchange rate stability for more than a year, encouraging exporters to release their holdings and helping importers plan over longer time horizons. Pakistan also secured rollover agreements worth approximately $16bn from friendly countries, including China, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, enabling the SBP to raise its foreign exchange reserves to $14.5bn by the end of FY25.
However, in recent weeks, the rupee has begun to slide against the US dollar despite healthy inflows in the currency market. Over FY25, the dollar appreciated by at least Rs5. On July 3, the interbank rate stood at Rs284.06 per dollar, while in the open market, the rate reached Rs286.40.
Globally, the US dollar has been under pressure, losing ground against major currencies, including the euro and the pound. Analysts note that increasing risks associated with the US dollar are prompting investors to diversify into other currencies and commodities like gold.

A day earlier, a pet lion escaped from a home and chased a woman and two children down a busy street in Lahore. Police arrested three suspects who had fled from the spot, while the lion was confiscated and sent to a wildlife park.
A press release issued today from the provincial government said that the wildlife department launched a “major province-wide crackdown” on the special directives of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz against those keeping lions without a licence.
“This operation is being carried out under a zero-tolerance policy and has already led to significant progress,” the press release said, adding that authorities conducted inspections of 22 locations across the province.
“So far, the wildlife department has taken 13 lions into custody. Five individuals have been arrested, five first information reports (FIR) have been registered and two further actions are pending.”
A video shared by the chief minister’s social media team also showed a leopard being seized.
 






The press release said four lions were recovered in Lahore, with four individuals arrested, one premise sealed and three FIRs registered.
In Gujranwala, four lions were confiscated, with one FIR currently under process, it added.
Two lions were confiscated in Faisalabad, one premise was sealed and one FIR was in progress, while three lions were recovered, one person was arrested and two FIRs were lodged in Multan.
“The illegal trade of wildlife is intolerable and there will be no compromise on public safety,” Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb was quoted as saying in the press release.
She said that keeping lions illegally was not only a violation of the law but also posed a serious social threat.
Aurangzeb stressed that strict enforcement of wildlife laws would be ensured and indiscriminate action would continue against individuals involved in unlawful activities.
“The wildlife department has reiterated that the law is equal for everyone and no exceptions will be made,” the press release said, urging citizens to report any illegal possession of lions.
Keeping exotic animals, especially big cats, as pets has long been seen as a sign of privilege and power in Punjab.
In December 2024, an adult lion escaped from its enclosure in another neighbourhood of Lahore, terrorising residents before being shot dead by a security guard.
The incident prompted the provincial government to pass new laws regulating the sale, purchase, breeding and ownership of big cats. The law now requires owners to obtain licences for the animals which are barred from being kept in residential areas.
Breeders have to pay a hefty fee for registration, while farms have to be a minimum of 10 acres in size.</p><small>2025-07-05 19:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/05230750905c5b4.jpg?r=231034' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922323/maximum-temperature-record-shattered-in-gbs-chilas-and-bunji-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Maximum temperature record shattered in GB’s Chilas and Bunji: PMD</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Saturday reported that new extreme maximum temperature records were set in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Chilas and Bunji areas, according to a press release.
The country is currently experiencing high summer temperatures, with the PMD reporting in June that ‘Feels Like’ temperatures crossed 50 degrees Celsius in four cities.
According to today’s press release, both cities recorded extreme temperatures that shattered previous records.
The PMD recorded a maximum temperature of 48.5°C in Chilas today, breaking the previous historical extreme maximum record of 47.7°C on July 17, 1997.
Meanwhile, the temperature recorded in Bunji was 46.1°C. The previous historical extreme maximum record was 45.6°C on July 12, 1971.
“These persistent high temperatures over northern areas may accelerate snow and glacier melt, triggering Glof (glacial lake outburst flood) and flash floods incidents, in vulnerable valleys and surrounding regions during upcoming week,” the PMD warned, citing a warning issued on Friday.
Glof refers to the sudden release of water and debris from a glacial lake, leading to the loss of lives, property and livelihoods in mountain communities. Over 7.1 million people in Gilgit Baltistan and KP are vulnerable, according to the Ministry of Climate Change.
A day ago, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) had warned the administrations of five districts about the high risk of Glofs due to a significant rise in temperatures and upcoming weather system.
In an advisory issued to the deputy commissioners of Upper and Lower Chitral, Upper Dir, Swat and Upper Kohistan, the PDMA said that the PMD had formally informed it that as there was a significant rise in temperatures and upcoming weather system in northern parts of the country, the risk of Glofs was very likely to increase in glaciated areas of the province.
The PDMA said that in view of the above weather conditions, officials were requested to take all necessary precautionary measures to avoid any loss of human and animal life and damage to infrastructure and crops.
It urged authorities to undertake proactive monitoring and surveillance of vulnerable Glof sites to ensure timely early warning and response, conduct evacuation drills in at-risk communities to ensure full preparedness and ensure that safe evacuation sites are fully stocked and ready for utilisation in case of any eventuality.</p><small>2025-07-05 18:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/051623499739af8.jpg?r=162539' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922268/80pc-of-rescue-operation-complete-as-death-toll-from-lyari-building-collapse-rises-to-19' target='_blank'><strong>80pc of rescue operation complete as death toll from Lyari building collapse rises to 19</strong></a><br><p>Rescue teams pulled more bodies from the rubble of a five-storey building collapse in Karachi overnight, taking the toll on Saturday to 19 as the recovery continued for a second day with eighty per cent of the operation completed.
South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso told Dawn.com: “Eighty per cent [of the] rescue operation has been completed and it is still ongoing.”
He added that there were “19 confirmed deaths and 13 injured” so far in the incident.
However, South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Syed Asad Raza earlier told a higher toll of 21 to Dawn.com. The same figure was reported in an update by the Edhi Foundation and according to the data from the Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute Of Trauma (SMBBIT) at Civil Hospital Karachi, seen by Dawn.com, which showed that 20 bodies were brought to the facility while one person died during treatment.
The data showed that 11 injured people were brought for treatment with 10 later discharged.
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, which was further weakened by recent rains, said DIG Raza.
“Rescue operation is still underway in Baghdadi, Lyari where the building had collapsed on Friday,” DIG Raza told Dawn.com.
“On one side, debris has been removed up to the ground floor, while on the other side, the rescue team has removed debris up to the third floor,” the police officer added.
 
 

Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.
Karachi, home to more than 20 million, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.
“My daughter is under the rubble,” 54-year-old Dev Raj told AFP at the scene.
“She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago.”
Rescue teams worked throughout the night, and families said that at least eight people were still believed to be trapped as temperatures climbed to 33 degrees Celsius in the morning.
Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, leading the Rescue 1122 efforts at the scene, told AFP that the operation continued through the night “without interruption”. “It may take eight to 12 hours more to complete,” he said earlier today.
Up to 100 people had been living in the building, senior police officer Arif Aziz told AFP.
The incident came days after a portion of a building collapsed in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.
The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over 570 buildings declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.
 


The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) said it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.
The authority said it had issued three ejectment notices to the residents since then, as well as asked K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to disconnect utility services.
But Imran Khaskheli, an owner and resident watching the rescue operation on Saturday, denied receiving notices.
“Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?” he said, speaking to AFP. He said he had seen cracks in the pillars of the building early on Friday morning.
 
 

“I knocked on all the doors and asked families to leave immediately,” Khaskheli said, adding that around 40 families lived in the building but that many did not heed his warning.
More than 50 buildings in the district have been declared unsafe, with six evacuated since yesterday, DC Khoso told AFP.
‘Hinderances’ in rescue efforts
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said the incident had reportedly occurred between 9am and 9:30am. However, they said they received the information late due to the suspension of communication networks, he added.
Mobile services are usually suspended in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.
Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said yesterday there were hindrances during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.
Heavy machinery faced difficulty in reaching the site amid the narrow alleys of Lyari, a low-income neighbourhood.
Police even had to baton-charge a crowd that had gathered around the site to make way for machinery, officials added.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report on the collapse and details of dilapidated buildings from the SBCA.
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a high-level committee has been formed that will submit a report on the incident by Monday. He lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously.
The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.
‘Sindh government answerable for last 17 years’
Sindh Assembly opposition leader and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan MPA Ali Khurshidi blamed the Sindh government for Karachi’s administrative collapse and the Lyari building tragedy.
“Call the tanker mafia and you’ll get water in 30 minutes,” he said during a press conference, pointing out rampant corruption and institutional failure across civic bodies.
Khurshidi said if the provincial administration was to blame and held responsible if it had not passed laws in 17 years to make this a criminal offence.
“Instead of saying ‘this should be done,’ you should be admitting, ‘we should’ve done this, but we failed to.’”
Addressing President Asif Ali Zardari and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, he said: “This is a question of your and your party’s credibility.”
He said the suspensions of officials would not work, insisting that termination and legal consequences were necessary. He condemned the “harassment” of Karachiites through traffic police extortion, pleading for urgent administrative reform, saying the public was fed up.
“This isn’t about point-scoring politics,” Khurshidi said. “We’re doing politics so we can solve genuine issues faced by people.” He concluded by calling on President Zardari and Bilawal to stop issuing mere condemnations and to instead fix the broken system under their party’s governance.
Previous deadly building collapses
In April, a 10-year-old girl died when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.
In October 2023, five people were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.
 
 

The city witnessed two such incidents within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.
Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when 22 people were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments collapsed.
A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed 27 people. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took 33 lives.</p><small>2025-07-05 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/051452539c66226.jpg?r=150800' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922283/muharram-9-central-procession-peacefully-concludes-in-karachi-amid-tight-security' target='_blank'><strong>Muharram 9 central procession peacefully concludes in Karachi amid tight security</strong></a><br><p>Karachi’s central mourning procession of Muharram 9 entered its destination of Hussainiya Iraniyan Imambargah in Kharadar on Saturday and peacefully concluded amid tight security, according to police.
Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a traffic plan for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.
Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as army deployment as well as a crackdown on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of Ashura (Muharram 10), which will be observed tomorrow.
In Karachi, the Muharram 9 majlis started at Nishtar Park at 12:15pm, according to an alert from the police. “The number of participants is approximately 800 to 1000, and it is being led by Shahenshah Hussain Naqvi,” the alert read.
Another alert at 1:29pm said that the procession had departed the park, while another at 1:54pm read that head of the procession reached Aza Khana Zuhra, while the tail was still at Nishtar Park. A later alert at 2:16pm stated that the procession head had reached Shah Khurasan, with the tail still at the park.
The police said the procession entered its destination of Hussainiya Iraniyan Imambargah in Kharadar at 7:07pm with the tail still at Baghdadi Crossing. The procession concluded around 7:53pm.
Cellular services were also suspended in the areas adjoining the central procession’s route as well as the smaller procession’s routes across the city, according to a letter by the Sindh police chief.
 


According to the Karachi police chief, a total of 7,507 police personnel were deployed to monitor the main procession and its routes and passages.
“Expert police snipers have been deployed along the main procession and at the crossings and large contingent of police personnel, including senior officers of Karachi Police” is active, according to a statement from the additional inspector general of police’s office.
Traffic police personnel were also deployed to maintain traffic flow along crossings intersecting the main procession routes, as well as the alternative traffic routes arranged for Muharram 9.
Meanwhile, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Sindh IG Ghulam Nabi Memon and Senator Waqar Mehdi reviewed security arrangements for the procession at Numaish, Nishtar Park and the Hussainiya Iraniyan Imam Bargah, a statement read.
Lanjar reviewed the security package and received a briefing from the Sindh IG and met the procession organisers.
“Peace and order in the city is our priority,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. He also directed the law enforcement agencies to take foolproof security measures, according to the press release.
Meanwhile, Wahab said, “Cleanliness arrangements have been ensured along the procession’s passageways. Proper lighting arrangements have also been made in the passageways and around them.”
On Friday, more than 5,500 police personnel were deployed across Karachi for the security of 8th Muharram processions.
 






Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that 27,063 processions were taking place nationwide, with 7,598 majalis.
“Everything is going well,” he told reporters in Sukkur. “Sukkur has the largest procession, with approximately 1 million participants.”
The minister added that there were few blockages and praised the Sindh chief minister and other officials for taking care of the participants by arranging for special fans along procession routes, among other measures.
Punjab arrangements
Punjab Home Secretary Ahmad Javed Qazi briefed Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman on the security situation across the province, a statement by the Public Relations Office said.
According to Qazi, more than 37,000 Muharram gatherings and 9,800 processions were being live monitored across the province. He said that Pakistan Army and Rangers personnel were also deployed to assist the police.
The chief secretary reviewed the arrangements for the Urs of Baba Farid and the Data Darbar Ghusl ceremony in Pakpattan. He also reviewed the social media monitoring process with the Cyber ​​Patrol Cell of the Home Department.
Chief Secretary Zaman said, “All administration and police should be present in the field and follow the rules and regulations,” directing the control rooms to remain alert. He said that the main processions and gatherings are being monitored with CCTV cameras.
Meanwhile, Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran visited different areas of the city to review the security. He met with the organisers of the processions and instructed all officers to remain alert.
According to him, 386 gatherings were to be held and 81 mourning processions would be taken out in the city today. He said, “Over 8,000 officers and soldiers are performing security duties.”
He said that full security was being provided at all places, adding that the district administration, security agencies and other institutions were providing assistance.
“The streets on the route have been sealed with barbed wire and barriers,” he said, adding that snipers were deployed on high-rise buildings along the procession routes.
Police and community volunteers were deployed at various checkpoints, including ladies police personnel to check the mourning women, he added.
DIG Kamran advised citizens to immediately report abandoned goods, motorcycles and suspicious persons to the police.
A ‘Peace Caravan’ was launched under the supervision of DIG Kamran, which included scholars, the peace committee and police officers.
It was led by Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Tasawur Iqbal, who, along with the superintendent of police (security(, met with leaders of different faiths.
“The aim of the peace caravan is to promote unity and solidarity in the city,” DIG Kamran said.
He said that “interfaith harmony” was a clear message to the enemies of the country, stating, “Lahore Police is taking every possible step to strengthen interfaith relations. Maintaining peace in Muharram is a shared responsibility of all of us.”
In Multan, police issued a statement outlining that 166 majalis and 80 processions were scheduled for Muharram 9.
Multan City Police Officer (CPO) Sadiq Ali Dogar said that 5,092 police personnel were deployed to protect the processions.
“We are prepared for any emergency,” Dogar was quoted as saying. “In addition to rooftop duty, police personnel in white uniforms are also present along the routes for secret surveillance. The procession routes have been sealed with barbed wire.”
The CPO added that alternative traffic routes had been provided and urged citizens to report anything suspicious to the police.
“Citizens should support the police in keeping the peace and promoting religious harmony,” Dogar said.

The control room was also inspected, where the officials were briefed that all processions and gatherings in Multan were being monitored and controlled with the help of CCTV  cameras.
Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman and Punjab IG Dr Usman Anwar met with members of peace committees, community leaders and the organisers of mourning processions and gatherings, who appreciated the efforts of the Punjab government to maintain peace and security during Ashura and Muharram.
Peshawar
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa IG Zulfiqar Hameed visited the mourning procession in Saddar are and reviewed security arrangements.
He told Dawn.com that there were 115 processions in the city and over 10,000 security personnel are present on duty with 50,000 personnel deployed across the province.
“Fourteen districts of the province have been declared sensitive, eight as extremely sensitive. Paramilitary and army are performing security duties in the most sensitive districts. We are fighting terrorism, operations are carried out wherever necessary.”
He said the processions were proceeding as usual throughout the province.</p><small>2025-07-05 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/05170502209a810.jpg?r=230406' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922304/chinese-taipei-lead-group-knock-out-pakistan-from-afc-womens-asian-cup-qualifiers' target='_blank'><strong>Chinese Taipei lead group, knock out Pakistan from AFC Women’s Asian Cup Qualifiers</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan were knocked out of the qualifiers for the 2026 Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Women’s Asian Cup on Saturday despite a 2-1 victory over Kyrgyzstan, as Chinese Taipei scored the most points in their group.
The national squad was drawn in Group ‘D’ of the qualifiers in Jakarta alongside Chinese Taipei, Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan. Pakistan lost their first match of the campaign to Chinese Taipei 8-0 on June 29, but beat hosts Indonesia 2-0 in their second group match this week.
Mariam Mahmood scored her first international goal in the very first minute of the match.
“Layla Aliya won possession at the halfway line and threaded a pass that initially looked to be claimed by Dilnura Abibulla, only for the Kyrgyz Republic custodian (goalkeeper) to drop the ball, allowing Mariam Mahmood to roll it into an unguarded net,” said an AFC press release.
 






Mahmood then doubled Pakistan’s tally by converting a penalty in the 18th minute.
 






Kyrgyzstan scored their only goal of the match when Alina Gaparova scored a low drive into the bottom corner in the 69th minute, the AFC said.
The Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) marked the team’s campaign with a lengthy post on Instagram, hailing their overall first-ever outing in the AFC Women’s Asian Cup Qualifiers.

“For the first time in history, Pakistan took part in the AFC Women’s Asian Cup Qualifiers and what a statement they made,” the federation wrote.
“After a tough start against Chinese Taipei, the team bounced back with incredible determination and heart, securing back-to-back victories against Indonesia (2-0) and Kyrgyzstan (2-1). With these wins, they’ve written a new chapter in Pakistan’s football journey.”
The PFF called the campaign “a moment of pride for every supporter of the game”, congratulating the team, coaching staff and officials.
The body later said: “Despite the impressive win and finishing second in the group, Pakistan could not advance to the next round, with Chinese Taipei securing qualification.”
It said Chinese Taipei finished at the top of Group D with nine points, having won all three of their matches, while Pakistan placed second with six points and two victories in their three games.
PFF President Syed Mohsen Gilani praised Pakistan’s performance in their maiden campaign in the AFC Women’s Asia Cup Qualifiers.
“Our national women’s team displayed great character and fighting spirit during their debut campaign at the AFC Qualifiers,” he said. “Despite winning two matches and finishing second, we were unfortunate not to progress to the next round. But this is just the beginning.”
Gilani added, “With continued support and sincere efforts, I am confident that our team will perform even better in future international events.”

The sheriff’s office in Kerr County, Texas, said more than 800 people had been evacuated from the region as flood waters receded in the area around the Guadalupe River, about 137 kilometres northwest of San Antonio.
“We will not stop until every single person is found,” Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at a news conference.
At least 23 to 25 people from the Camp Mystic summer camp were missing, most of them reported to be young girls. The river waters rose 29 feet rapidly near the camp.
The US National Weather Service said that the flash flood emergency has largely ended for Kerr County, the epicentre of the flooding, following thunderstorms that dumped as much as a foot of rain early on Friday. A flood watch, however, remained in effect until 7pm for the broader region.
Kerr County sits in the Texas Hill Country, a rural area known for its rugged terrain, historic towns and other tourist attractions.

Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said up to 500 rescue workers were searching for an unknown number of people who were still missing, including many who had come to the area for an Independence Day celebration by the river.
“We don’t know how many people were in tents on the side, in small trailers by the side, in rented homes by the side, because it was going to be the Fourth of July holiday,” he said on Fox News Live.
US President Donald Trump said the federal government was working with state and local officials to respond to the flooding. “Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy. Our brave first responders are on site doing what they do best,” he said on social media.
 


Dalton Rice, city manager for Kerrville, the county seat, told reporters on Friday that the extreme flooding struck before dawn with little or no warning, precluding authorities from issuing advance evacuation orders as the Guadalupe River swiftly rose above major flood stage in less than two hours.
State emergency management officials had warned as early as Thursday that west and central Texas faced heavy rains and flash flood threats, citing National Weather Service forecasts ahead of the holiday weekend.
The forecasts, however, “did not predict the amount of rain that we saw”, W Nim Kidd, director of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, told a news conference on Friday night.
The weekend disaster echoes a catastrophic 1987 Guadalupe River flood in which 10 teenagers drowned when trying to leave a church camp, according to the National Weather Service.</p><small>2025-07-05 17:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/052214141251483.jpg?r=221446' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922319/paris-opens-river-seine-for-public-swimming-for-first-time-since-1923' target='_blank'><strong>Paris opens river Seine for public swimming for first time since 1923</strong></a><br><p>Parisians rushed for a dip in the Seine on Saturday as authorities opened the river to public swimming for the first time since 1923 after an extensive clean-up operation spurred on by it being used last year as a venue in the Paris Olympics.
Three sites along the banks of the Seine in the city will be able to welcome over 1,000 swimmers daily until August 31, local officials said, to the delight of the Parisians and visitors who were among the first to take the plunge.
“Really nice, I’m impressed, surprised,” said 24-year-old Victoria Cnop, a Brazilian who lives in Paris. “I never imagined being in the water close to the Eiffel Tower.”
“The water is clean, it’s warm, it’s clear. There is a bit of algae, but that’s normal,” said 51-year-old Karine. “Come here everybody, it’s great!.”
The reopening of the Seine for public swimming follows efforts by authorities to improve its water quality so it could be used for Olympic events last summer.
Investments included connecting tens of thousands of homes to the sewer system, upgrading water treatment facilities and constructing large rainwater storage reservoirs to prevent sewer overflow during heavy storms.
While delays, triggered by the health impact of heavy rains, impacted some Olympic training sessions and the men’s triathlon event, competitions in the Seine eventually went ahead, bolstering confidence in the river’s safety for public swimming.
Daily water quality tests will be conducted during the swimming season, with green and red flags — similar to beach safety systems — indicating whether swimming areas are open or closed.
“It’s wonderful,” said John Drummond, a 54-year-old visitor from Canada. “It’s great for the environment, it’s great for the city, it’s great for the people that live here. So very good initiative.”
As well as the three sites within Paris, 14 swimming areas outside the capital’s boundaries will be set up on the Seine and the Marne rivers. Two of those already opened on the Marne in June.</p><small>2025-07-05 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/052103020278ee0.png?r=210432' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922314/kp-police-arrest-suspect-after-13-year-old-maid-allegedly-raped-murdered-in-abbottabad' target='_blank'><strong>KP police arrest suspect after 13-year-old maid allegedly raped, murdered in Abbottabad</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect after a 13-year-old maid was allegedly raped and murdered in Abbottabad last night.
Azam Mir Afzal, public relations officer (PRO) for the Abbottabad district police officer (DPO), told Dawn.com today that the victim was working as a maid in the house where she was allegedly raped and murdered. “The house owner has been arrested, and further investigation into the case is underway,” the PRO said.
“The incident took place in Habibullah Colony, within the limits of Mirpur Police Station,” the PRO said. “According to the initial reports, the victim’s body was brought to the hospital last night, where doctors examined it and found evidence of torture and rape.”
Afzal added that a postmortem was conducted at Ayub Medical Complex in Abbottabad.
According to the initial investigation, the victim’s mother was separated from her husband for the past 12 years and was living in Mansehra, Afzal noted. “The girl had been working as a household maid for a long time,” Afzal said.
The police registered a first information report (FIR) at Mirpur Police Station today at the complaint of the victim’s father under Sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 53 (sexual abuse) of the KP Child Protection Act.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across all provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objectives of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages.
“Other goals are to contribute to existing information on Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) in Pakistan and to contribute towards spreading awareness and information about different forms of CSA to all segments of society,” said Sahil.</p><small>2025-07-05 17:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/05205524353277d.jpg?r=211735' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922313/uk-re-establishing-full-syria-ties-fm-lammy-says-during-visit' target='_blank'><strong>UK re-establishing full Syria ties, FM Lammy says during visit</strong></a><br><p>The United Kingdom is re-establishing full ties with Syria following the toppling of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, foreign minister David Lammy said during a visit to Damascus on Saturday.
“After over a decade of conflict, there is renewed hope for the Syrian people. The UK is re-establishing diplomatic relations because it is in our interests to support the new government to deliver their commitment to build a stable, more secure and prosperous future for all Syrians,” Lammy said in a statement.
The statement came following Lammy’s meeting with Syria’s leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus, the Syrian presidency said, in his first visit since Assad’s ouster.
Interim President Sharaa received Lammy alongside Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani, according to photos of the meeting released by the presidency.
The talks addressed “bilateral ties … and ways of strengthening cooperation, as well as regional and international developments”, Sharaa’s office said in a statement.
The Syrian foreign ministry issued a similar statement following a separate meeting between Lammy and Shaibani.
Syria has seen a flurry of diplomatic activity since rebel-led forces ousted Assad in December after more than 13 years of grinding civil war.
In May, Syrian Defence Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra met with an official British delegation, the defence ministry said at the time.
In April, the UK government announced it was lifting sanctions imposed on Syria’s interior and defence ministries under Assad.
It also said it was lifting sanctions against various media groups and intelligence agencies, as well as on some sectors of the economy including financial services and energy production.
A month earlier, it lifted sanctions on 24 entities including Syria’s central bank.
Syria’s new authorities have welcomed the moves, which came as they seek to rebuild the country and reboot its moribund economy, both ravaged by the conflict and crippling sanctions.</p><small>2025-07-05 16:17</small></div><hr>
