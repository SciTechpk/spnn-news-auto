<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/052146089d993b0.jpg?r=214633' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928921/malik-riaz-calls-for-truce-amid-bahria-towns-legal-woes' target='_blank'><strong>Malik Riaz calls for ‘truce’ amid Bahria Town’s legal woes</strong></a><br><p>Property tycoon Malik Riaz on Tuesday called for “dialogue and a dignified solution” amidst Bahria Town’s legal troubles.
His appeal comes as the Islamabad High Court (IHC) reserved its verdict on petitions against the proposed auction of Bahria Town properties. The assets were attached in connection with a plea bargain agreement reached in the £190 million case. The development adds on to the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) previous actions against Riaz, who owns Bahria Town and is an absconder in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
In 2019, the National Crime Agency (NCA) of the United Kingdom had agreed to a settlement worth £190 million with Riaz’s family. Earlier that year, the Supreme Court had accepted Riaz’s offer of Rs460 billion as settlement dues by his Bahria Town after it was found to have illegally acquired thousands of acres of land on Karachi’s outskirts in district Malir. Hours after the NCA verdict, Riaz had tweeted that the recovered amount would go to the Supreme Court against the fine worth Rs460bn. Subsequently, the money was transferred to the Supreme Court’s accounts, instead of the government’s account.
On October 20, 2023, the Supreme Court had noted that “only Rs60.72bn out of Rs460bn was paid. Even out of this payment, Bahria Town paid only Rs24.26bn”.
In a post on X today, Riaz said: “I would like to make a final appeal from the bottom of my heart that we be given a chance to return to serious dialogue, and a dignified solution.
“For this purpose, we assure you that we will participate in any arbitration and implement its decision 100 per cent,” the property tycoon added. “On this occasion, I also assure you that if the arbitration decision requires payment of money from our side, we will ensure its payment, God willing.”
Riaz said that he had confidence that the institutions of Pakistan would act “with justice, wisdom, and prudence, and they will play a positive role in leading us out of this difficult juncture”.
 






Riaz also said that Bahria Town’s operations across the country had been severely paralysed.
“Our cash flow has been completely destroyed, it has become impossible to provide daily services, we are unable to pay the salaries of our tens of thousands of staff, and the situation has reached a point where we are being forced to completely shut down all Bahria Town activities across Pakistan,” Riaz said.
However, he added, “We are certainly one step behind this last step, but the situation on the ground is getting worse by the minute.”
 
 

Last month, the IHC issued notices to respondents on a petition of NAB seeking to vacate the stay order on its move to auction six properties of Bahria Town in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
In June, NAB ordered the freezing of over 450 immovable properties owned by various individuals named in the Bahria Town Karachi land grab case.
In the same month, the IHC had issued a stay order halting the NAB’s planned auction of Bahria Town’s properties. The auction was scheduled to be held the same day, i.e. June 12.
Riaz had said in May last year that he was being pressured for “political motives”, but asserted that he would not bow before anyone. The real estate tycoon said he had been pushed to the wall and was facing constant losses in his business.
But he did not mention who was pressuring him, and for what. Riaz is known for his links with political parties, the media, as well as the civil and military establishment, and has been considered ‘untouchable’ in the past.
Dawn had contacted a number of political experts and politicians, but nearly everyone was reluctant to comment on his ‘sad tale’, saying he had not disclosed who he was holding responsible for his woes, and the reason why he was being pressured.</p><small>2025-08-05 18:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05150956aa19c67.jpg?r=151008' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928884/police-detain-pti-activists-in-lahore-karachi-amid-protests-marking-2-years-of-imrans-imprisonment' target='_blank'><strong>Police detain PTI activists in Lahore, Karachi amid protests marking 2 years of Imran’s imprisonment</strong></a><br><p>Police personnel detained PTI protesters in Lahore and Karachi on Tuesday after party activists took to the streets to officially kick off a nationwide movement for the release of ex-premier Imran Khan, who has been in jail for two years now.
Imran, imprisoned since Aug 5, 2023 in a case related to state gifts, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials in alleged terrorism cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
Imran had issued a nationwide protest call, with a statement attributed to him saying that the “movement that begins on August 5 will continue until democracy is restored in its true spirit”. According to PTI leader Asad Qaiser, August 5 was the inception of the protest, but it should not be considered a “final call”.
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (operations) Faisal Kamran told Dawn.com: “More than 30 PTI activists trying to block roads in different areas of the city were taken into custody.”
He denied reports of the police arresting hundreds of activists.
At around 1pm, the PTI claimed that one of its leaders, Rehana Dar, had been detained by the police in Lahore.
“An elder like Rehana Dar is being dragged by the shameless Punjab Police, a disgraceful sight,” the PTI said on its official X account.
It shared a video showing Dar, who contested the 2024 general elections in Sialkot against PML-N’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, being dragged into a police van by personnel with riot gear.
The PTI said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Punjab Inspector General Dr Usman Anwar “have sunk to a new low with this act” and “abandoned all sense of shame and decency”.
 






Raja Shahbaz Bhatti, president of the PTI’s Insaf Youth Wing in north Punjab, claimed on X that he was injured due to police action and that four others were arrested.
The PTI’s Multan chapter alleged that its Lahore rally was “attacked by police”, with multiple vehicles participating in it facing damage. Visuals shared by it showed the back window of a car shattered with a hole in it.
 






PTI Balochistan President Dawood Shah Kakar claimed “several” PTI workers, including five leaders, were arrested after they gathered at a place in Balochistan’s Kohlu district for a protest.
 






Qaiser yesterday said raids had begun in Punjab and Kashmir, while PTI Punjab media cell head Shayan Bashir claimed that the police carried out some 200 raids and picked up party workers, who were released after allegedly submitting affidavits.
Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari mocked the protest turnout, alleging that the PTI was inflating the crowd size by stopping traffic.
 






 






Separately, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam criticised the PTI for choosing today’s date for its protest and said it took away attention from the Kashmir dispute, PTV News reported.
Opposition leaders stopped while heading to Adiala Jail
Ahead of today’s planned protests, the Rawalpindi administration banned all assemblies and gatherings till August 10 under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, citing an “imminent threat”.
Today, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Achkazai, MNA Shandana Gulzar and others departed for Adiala Jail, where Imran is imprisoned, the party said at 3pm.
“We will record our protest under any circumstance as it is our Constitutional right,” Achakzai said on X.
However, they were stopped by the Punjab police, with the TTAP sharing a video of Achakzai’s exchange with the personnel. “This route is closed,” a cop was heard saying.
 






Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur also separately led a convoy in Peshawar.
 






According to other videos it posted, the party organised rallies in various cities across the country.
Former Azad Jammu and Kashmir premier Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi, who was recently detained under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance, also led a rally after his last-night release, the PTI said.
KP protests
The PTI also shared a video of convoys departing from Peshawar, Mansehra and other cities for Swabi.
The Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway was closed at 5pm at Swabi Interchange and both lines from Peshawar and Islamabad remained closed despite the various attempts made by the Motorway Police. The police failed to persuade the PTI workers, due to which the motorway has remained closed and commuters were forced to wait on the side of the road in scorching heat.
The motorway was opened at 7:30pm when the gathering was dispersed.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser alleged that Imran was offered to be allowed to go home, but he turned down such offers and declared that he would not go anywhere but continue the struggle for Pakistan from jail.
He criticised the parties in government for losing the people’s trust and lashed out at them for the sugar scandal.
“The people will not allow the operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa under any circumstances. This is the decision of the people and the general public does not want any more operations here,” he said.
He said that their agenda was constitutional supremacy, true authority of the Parliament according to the Constitution and democratic principles and norms.
“We have launched a movement today which will focus on releasing of our leader, Imran Khan, immediate withdrawal of all fake cases against him, supremacy of the Parliament, upholding of country’s Constitution in all circumstances and people’s civil rights, independence of judiciary and let the people and leaders and religious parties to express thier views without any fear and hesitation.”
He announced that the second phase of the PTI’s efforts would take place on August 14, after which the party planned to head to Sindh. “We will unite the entire country to rid ourselves of this oppressive government,” he concluded.
 






PTI workers from Malakand division gathered at Lower Dir’s Chakdara interchange, where their local leaders addressed the major rally.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan led a rally from his home district of Buner.
Provincial Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs Syed Fakhar Jahan addressed a big protest demonstration at Sawari Chowk, Buner. Barrister Gohar was also present on the occasion.
The provincial minister said on the occasion that Imran was unjustly imprisoned for two years. He said PTI MNAs and MPAs were also being intimidated, illegally arrested and the rights of people were being violated, while their families were also being harassed.
Another big rally was held in the Khairabad area of Nowshera district where MPAs and provincial ministers were present.
The protest demonstration in Khairabad escalated into chaos as workers and party leaders clashed. The workers demanded that the protest leadership travel to Islamabad, saying that they had not come to listen to rote speeches but to engage in practical action.
They expressed frustration over being repeatedly asked to rally in the streets only to return without taking further action.
Party leaders and MPAs present on the stage abruptly left without delivering their speeches. Consequently, the workers exited the pavilion, sat down on GT Road, and began a protest that blocked the road, refusing to open it despite persistent requests from party leaders.
Police resort to tear gas shelling, baton charge to foil PTI rally in Karachi
In Sindh, the Karachi Police resorted to tear gas shelling and baton charge to disperse the PTI rally in the city, according to witnesses, police and party officials.
PTI Sindh spokesperson Muhammad Ali Bozdar told Dawn.com that as part of the party’s call, small rallies were held across the metropolis, which reached their scheduled protest venue at Hassan Square in Gulshan-i-Iqbal.
The protest rally was being led by PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh. When they reached near Jail Chowrangi, contingents of the police that had already blocked the main University Road by parking vehicles in the middle of it or creating temporary barriers resorted to “massive” tear gas shelling and baton charge.
He alleged that around 25-30 workers, including females, were injured who took shelter in nearby homes where the residents provided them first aid, while around 15-20 others were arrested.
 






He said such actions were also taken by law enforcers in other parts of Sindh, as over 200 workers were allegedly arrested.
The police justified their action over the lack of permission for the rally, the alleged blockade of the road and creating a law and order situation.
Karachi Police chief Javed Alam Odho told Dawn.com that when protests tended to take place against power shortage, law enforcers took action against any road blockade and violence.
Without going into details of the police action, the city police chief said: “The rally was taken without permission from the concerned authorities. They blocked the road and created a law and order situation, necessitating police action.”
However, Bozdar told Dawn.com that when other parties took out rallies without permission, they were not subjected to the same treatment and wondered why such a discriminatory attitude was meted out against the PTI.
He said the party did not block the main University Road and had instead held a rally on only one side of the road.
 






Meanwhile, an incident report from the Bilal Colony station house officer said two PTI protesters were arrested from 4K Chowrangi.
Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry lament Imran’s imprisonment
Separately, former PTI leaders Asad Umar and Fawad Chaudhry, both of whom had parted ways with the party in the wake of the May 9 riots, also lamented Imran’s two-year-long incarceration.
Umar, a former finance minister, said on X: “Even two years after Imran Khan’s imprisonment, the anti-Khan narrative did not sell, and the public believes that Khan is imprisoned on political grounds, not legal ones.
“Do not waste more time; the entire national leadership should sit with the PTI and carve out a solution in accordance with the Constitution,” he suggested, adding that there was no other way to end the ongoing political crisis.
 






Chaudhry said Imran was in jail “just for the sake of democracy in Pakistan and people’s sovereignty”.

On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Faisalabad last week senten­ced over 100 leaders and workers of the PTI, including several key opposition figures, to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the May 9 riots. Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan, Opposition Leader in the Senate Shibli Faraz, MNA Zartaj Gul, Raza, Sheikh Rashid Shafique (nephew of former interior minister Sheikh Rashid), Kanwal Shauzab, Farah Agha, Rai Haider Kharal and Muhammad Ahmad Chattha were among those sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.
A notification from the ECP today said Faraz, Ayub, Kharal, Raza, MNA Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan, Gul, MPA Muhammad Ansar Iqbal, MPA Junaid Afzal Sahi and MPA Rai Muhammad Murtaza Iqbal were now disqualified under Article 63(1h) (a person shall be disqualified from being elected [if] … he has been, on conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years) of the Constitution and their seats were vacant.
Ayub lambasted the ATC’s “bogus verdict” in a post on X today, saying that he would contest it and the ECP’s disqualification in court.
He also posted a video of himself at the Peshawar High Court with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.
 






The development follows other recent disqualifications of PTI leaders and lawmakers.
On July 29, the ECP had disqualified MNA Abdul Latif from the NA-1 constituency (Upper and Lower Chitral), raising questions over the haste with which a flurry of similar decisions were taken in recent days.
On July 28, the commission had disqualified Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chatta and MPA Ahmad Khan.
On December 21 and 26 last year, a military court had sentenced over 50 PTI leaders and activists, including Imran Khan’s nephew Hassaan Niazi, to up to 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 riots.
The ATCs have been hearing May 9-related cases daily to meet a deadline set by the Supreme Court for the conclusion of trials by August.
Faisalabad ATC sentencing
The ATC had convicted the PTI lawmakers under Section 109 (punishment for abetment) and Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in FIR No. 835/2023, registered at Ghulam Muhammadabad police station.
In FIR No. 1277/2023 of the same police station, 60 out of 67 accused were convicted, while seven were acquitted.
In FIR No. 832/2023, registered at the Civil Lines police station, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment while one person received a three-year sentence. The judge acquitted 77 accused in this case, stating that the prosecution had failed to establish charges against them.
Former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry, MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI’s Shah Mehmood Qureshi), MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro and Faizullah Kamuka were acquitted in all three FIRs.
The judge had issued arrest warrants for those convicted who were not present in court and had directed the police to arrest all convicts and bring them before the court for imprisonment.</p><small>2025-08-05 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0521421242fad50.jpg?r=214241' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928922/ptv-secures-domestic-broadcasting-rights-to-all-acc-events-from-2025-2027' target='_blank'><strong>PTV secures domestic broadcasting rights to all ACC events from 2025-2027</strong></a><br><p>State broadcaster Pakistan Television on Tuesday announced that it had secured domestic broadcasting rights to all Asian Cricket Council (ACC) events from 2025 to 2027.
“PTV Sports proudly announces the acquisition of television rights in Pakistan for all ACC events from 2025 to 2027!” it said in a post on Instagram.
It said the events included in the package were the Men’s Asia Cup 2025 and 2027, Women’s Asia Cup 2026 and the U19 and Emerging Asia Cup tournaments.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The Men’s Asia Cup is scheduled to be held from September 9 to 28 at its new venue — the United Arab Emirates — where it was shifted from original hosts India, due to Pakistan-India political tensions and also due to stra­ins between India and Bangladesh.
Dawn previously learnt that this year’s Asia Cup was facing a fresh challenge from the broadcaster.
A highly exorbitant rate set for Pakistan’s region by the official broadcaster of the Asia Cup based in India, plus the uncertainty prevailing over the pinnacle clash of the event between Pakistan and India, the chances were bleak that any sports channel in Pakistan could buy the broadcasting rights for the continental showpiece.
According to well-informed sources, Asia Cup’s official broadcaster had set a significantly higher rate for Pakistan’s region. It was learnt that the broadcaster, having secured Pan-Asia broadcast rights in a $170 million deal valid until 2031, was demanding that Pakistani broadcasters pay a staggering 25 per cent of the total broadcasting rights value, whereas the country was contributing no more than 10pc of the event’s regional broadcast worth.
“A 10-12pc value rate for Pakistan’s region is decided in the books of the ICC and the ACC but the Indian broadcaster is demanding a very high rate from Pakistan’s sports channels that are interested in covering live matches.
“It ultimately may force all Pakistan-based channels, either to make a joint consortium to buy the rights or to quit the race altogether,” one of the officials close to the situation had told Dawn on the condition of anonymity.
“They [Indian broadcasters] are over-leveraged and gambling with market stability. If this backfires, the repercussions could destabilise the entire ecosystem,” the official had added.
He had continued: “The consortium [of Pakistan sports channels] may agree to pay higher rate but there is no clarity if an Indo-Pak match will be played [during the Asia Cup].”
With television advertising revenue in Pakistan down more than 22pc year-on-year, and corporate sponsorship budgets in freefall, these inflated demands from the (Asia Cup) broadcaster appeared not only unrealistic, but dangerously detached from commercial reality, sources were claiming.
Another point of worry for Pakistan sports channels was also increased manifold as the Indian broadcasters had sold out the Asia Cup digital rights to a Pakistan-based consortium for approximately $4.3m.
In case India and Pakistan reach the Asia Cup final, they will have played three matches against each other in the event, a big deal for broadcasters.
“[The] Indian cricketers are facing pressure from their fans at home, creating a situation which may compel India’s top players to refuse to play the Asia Cup or even the BCCI to quit as hosts,” the source had added.
“In such a negative situation prevailing [currently] while time is running short to meet the Indian broadcasters’ demand, it does not seem possible for a single sports channel in Pakistan to strike the [broadcasting] deal on these [higher] rates.
“While the negotiations are on with the Asia Cup’s official broadcaster, it is not ready to demand less from Pakistan’s region even in case there is no Pakistan-India clash in the continental event,” the source had revealed.
In the past, when a Pakistan-India bilateral series was part of the ICC’s decided schedule of activities, the Pakistan Cricket Board had to sign a deal with broadcasters for the entire calendar for two different likely scenarios — first, if India and Pakistan play in a bilateral series and second, if they do not face each other.
Also, a PTV official, on the condition of anonymity, had told Dawn that uncertainty was prevailing for Pakistan over the Asia Cup broadcasting rights.
“In negotiations with the official broadcasters, we are trying to resolve the matter to ensure Pakistan fans watch live matches of the Asia Cup. However, the situation is tricky and no one can say what will happen in the end,” the PTV official had said.</p><small>2025-08-05 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/052047284edeaf6.jpg?r=205618' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928869/bangladesh-to-hold-elections-in-february-2026-yunus' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh to hold elections in February 2026: Yunus</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh will hold elections in February 2026, interim leader Muhammad Yunus said on Tuesday, the first polls since a mass uprising overthrew the government last year.
“On behalf of the interim government, I will write a letter to the chief election commissioner requesting that the election be arranged before Ramazan in February 2026,” Yunus said in a broadcast on the one-year anniversary of the ousting of ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Yunus, 85, is leading the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections, and has said he will step down after the vote.
“We will step into the final and most important phase after delivering this speech to you, and that is the transfer of power to an elected government,” he said.
Yunus had earlier said elections would be held in April, but key political parties have been demanding he hold them earlier and before the month of Ramazan.
“I urge you all to pray for us so that we can hold a fair and smooth election, enabling all citizens to move forward successfully in building a ‘New Bangladesh’,” he added.
“On behalf of the government, we will extend all necessary support to ensure that the election is free, peaceful and celebratory in spirit. “
In an earlier address, he said: “Together, we will build a Bangladesh where tyranny will never rise again.”
He paid tribute to those who sacrificed their lives.
“Fallen autocrats and their self-serving allies remain active,” however, he added, urging unity to protect the gains of the uprising while his government holds reform talks with political parties and civil society.
His interim government had launched sweeping reforms, he added, while trials for those responsible for the “July killings” were progressing swiftly.
 
 

Police were on high alert throughout the capital, with armoured vehicles patrolling the streets to deter any attempt by Hasina’s banned Awami League to disrupt the day’s events.
“Let this anniversary not be a day of retrospection, but a rallying cry for a brighter tomorrow,” Hasina said in an open letter to the people of Bangladesh, adding that she had never resigned from her duties as prime minister.
“Bangladesh has overcome adversity before, and we will rise again, stronger, more united, and more determined to build a democracy that truly serves its people.”
The July Declaration formally recognises the 2024 student-led uprising and the shift away from authoritarian rule to democratic renewal.
Despite some opposition, it is backed by major political groups, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former premier Khaleda Zia.
Supporters see the charter as a foundation for institutional reform; critics have warned its impact could be largely symbolic in the absence of a legal framework or parliamentary consensus.</p><small>2025-08-05 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05192951975f13f.jpg?r=195741' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928913/mother-of-seven-children-killed-by-husband-over-honour-in-karachis-lyari-police' target='_blank'><strong>Mother of seven children killed by husband over ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Lyari: police</strong></a><br><p>A mother of seven children was shot dead allegedly by her husband in an ‘honour’ killing case in Chakiwara area of Lyari on Tuesday, according to police.
“Bakhtawar, 40, was shot and killed by her husband at Miranaka [in Chakiwara, Lyari],” Chakiwara Station House Officer (SHO) Sajid Dharejo told Dawn.com.
“The husband was arrested, and the pistol used in the murder was recovered,” he added.
The police official said that the woman was asleep inside their home near Koyla Godam, Street-7, at around 1:30am when the suspect fired four shots. She sustained three bullet wounds and died on the spot.
“The murder appears to be an outcome of ‘honour’ killing,” Dharejo continued.
During the initial probe, the arrested man told the police that his wife used to talk with a man on her cell phone.
He had warned her not to do it, but she did not give any heed to his warning, the husband claimed.
The SHO said the husband is a labourer and hailed from Mansehra. The body of the victim was shifted to Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for legal formalities.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout last year, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
Last month, two men were shot dead while a third one was injured over ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Manghopir area, police had said.
Also last month, a man was killed over so-called honour in Sharifabad, according to police.</p><small>2025-08-05 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05192941ffe266e.jpg?r=200446' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928915/us-coast-guard-says-titan-submersibles-design-a-primary-factor-in-implosion' target='_blank'><strong>US Coast Guard says Titan submersible’s design a primary factor in implosion</strong></a><br><p>A United States Coast Guard investigative board concluded on Tuesday that the “inadequate design” of the Titan submersible was a primary contributing factor in its implosion in 2023 that left five people dead.
The Titan was on a tourist expedition to the wreckage of the Titanic — a British passenger liner that sank in 1912, killing at least 1,500 on board — when it lost contact with its support vessel during descent. Its remains were found four days later, littering the seabed about 488 metres from the bow of the Titanic wreck.
The implosion was preventable, the chair of the US Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation, Jason Neubauer, said as a 300-page report was released following a two-year probe.
“There is a need for stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework,” he said in a statement.
A media spokesperson at OceanGate, the US-based company that managed the tourist submersible and suspended all operations after the incident, was not immediately available for comment.
The board determined that the primary contributing factors were OceanGate’s “inadequate design, certification, maintenance and inspection process for the Titan”.
 
 

It also cited “a toxic workplace culture at OceanGate”, an inadequate regulatory framework for submersibles and other novel vessels, and an ineffective whistleblower process.
The report added, “For several years preceding the incident, OceanGate leveraged intimidation tactics, allowances for scientific operations and the company’s favourable reputation to evade regulatory scrutiny.”
The board found that OceanGate failed to investigate and address known hull anomalies following its 2022 Titanic expedition. It said data from Titan’s real-time monitoring system should have been analysed and acted on during that expedition.
It also criticised OceanGate for failing to properly store the Titan before the 2023 Titanic expedition.</p><small>2025-08-05 15:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05191315628c4d8.jpg?r=191403' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928911/mudslide-engulfs-indian-village-at-least-four-dead-and-over-50-missing' target='_blank'><strong>Mudslide engulfs Indian village, at least four dead and over 50 missing</strong></a><br><p>Surging floodwaters and a torrent of mud swept through a village in the northern Indian Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, killing at least four people while more than 50 others were missing, authorities and local TV channels said on Tuesday.
Teams from the army and disaster response forces had reached the area, local authorities said, with workers trying to rescue people trapped under debris and sludge.
TV news channels showed floodwaters and mud surging down a mountain and crashing into the village, sweeping away houses and roads as people ran for their lives.
The mudslide cleaved through Dharali village, burying some houses, according to a video update shared by the state chief minister’s office.
Four people were killed and many more had been rescued so far, Uttarkashi district administrator Prashant Arya told local media.
“A massive mudslide struck Dharali village in the Kheer Gad area near Harsil, triggering a sudden flow of debris and water through the settlement,” the Central Command of the Indian Army said in a post on X.
 






Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences to those affected and said teams were making every attempt to provide assistance.

Research and development (R&D) in women’s health remains chronically underfunded worldwide, with limited investment in areas like gynaecological and menstrual health, obstetric care, contraception, sexually transmitted infections, and maternal nutrition, the foundation said in a statement.
Citing a 2021 McKinsey & Company analysis, it said just one per cent of healthcare R&D targets female-specific conditions beyond cancer. Common issues like preeclampsia, endometriosis, and menopause remain largely overlooked despite affecting hundreds of millions.
“Investing in women’s health has a lasting impact across generations. It leads to healthier families, stronger economies, and a more just world,” said Bill Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation. “Yet women’s health continues to be ignored, underfunded, and sidelined. Too many women still die from preventable causes or live in poor health. That must change. But we can’t do it alone.”
Speaking about pregnancy-related complications globally, Gates said the topic remained vastly under-studied. He made the remarks at Women’s Health, Unstuck, a Tuesday morning event organised by digital media company STAT at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Massachusetts, where he joined global health experts to discuss breaking barriers in women’s health before a live and virtual audience.
“Giving birth is still … very risky, particularly in low-income countries. Even conditions like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes aren’t as well understood [in] the rich world as they should be.

Discussing the decision to invest in women’s health, Gates said the foundation had made significant progress in reducing child mortality by 50pc since 2000, but maternal deaths have only dropped by 20pc to 25pc.
“So, the team looked into causes of maternal deaths. We shifted resources to high-impact areas as we gained insights into the burden of disease.”
He said while conditions like postpartum haemorrhage have seen progress, “nobody else was funding issues such as anaemia, improving the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine, and nutrition.”

Closing innovation gap in women’s health
Pointing out the pressing need to address the innovation gap in women’s health, Dr Anita Zaidi, President of the Gender Equality Division at the Gates Foundation, emphasised the long-standing exclusion of women from medical research and its impact on health outcomes.
“…When women are left out of research, they are left out of solutions,” she said. “Here in the US, women were not even routinely included in clinical trials until 1993. And 90pc of the medications that we use today have never been tested in pregnancy.”

She called for urgent change: “Millions of women [are] being misdiagnosed, ignored, or misunderstood. Closing the innovation gap in women’s health is not just overdue. It’s essential.”
Shedding light on the transformative potential of new technologies in women’s health, Dr Zaidi stressed the urgency of greater investment.
“These include low-cost AI-enabled ultrasounds, low-cost tools for safer births, such as sensors, and next-generation contraceptives designed for women’s needs. This is why, earlier today, the Foundation announced $2.5bn through 2030 to support innovation in women’s health,” she said.
Acknowledging the significance of the commitment, she said that it was only a starting point: “Yes, it sounds like a big number. And it is a big number. But given the need, it’s just a drop in the bucket.”
 
 

Dr Zaidi urged other funders to act, adding: “We need the investment and the commitment from others to make sure these innovations reach the women who need them.”
High burden of disease in Pakistani women
Although the Gates Foundation frames the initiative as global, most projects target health innovations in low- and middle-income countries — including Pakistan — where the needs are most urgent.
When asked what the new fund meant for women’s health in Pakistan, Dr Zaidi —  who previously worked at Aga Khan University — told Dawn in a separate comment: “Pakistan is one of the Gates Foundation’s priority countries because of the high burden of disease among women and children.”
She recalled her experience as a practitioner in Pakistan, saying, “I would see children come in with their health problems or malnutrition and I would be telling the mother … to breastfeed properly to take care of the infant, but then I would look at the mother and I’d say ‘Oh my God, her own health is so poor, who is looking after her health, why is her health not important’.”
She added, “A lot of the problems that we were seeing in the babies were actually problems in the mother’s health. Without addressing the mother’s health, it was not possible to address the children’s health.”

Highlighting the crisis, she said, “Newborn mortality in Pakistan, where one out of 25 babies dies in the first month of life, is the highest in the world, and that is because of the neglect of women’s health.”
At present, the foundation is supporting a range of women’s health initiatives in Pakistan, with an emphasis on family planning, maternal health, and reproductive rights. It has committed over $2 million to Shirkat Gah Women’s Resource Centre in Lahore to strengthen community-led advocacy and expand access to family planning services.
The foundation is also partnering with the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) to improve maternal and child health through the Nashonuma cash transfer initiative, which addresses nutrition, health awareness, and access to essential services.
A $12.5m grant has been awarded to the University of Manitoba in Canada by the foundation for research into barriers to maternal and newborn care in regions, including Sindh.
In addition, the foundation is backing innovation through projects like Awaaz-e-Sehat, an AI-powered mobile tool developed at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (Lums) to help women record and access maternal health information via voice technology.
On the foundation’s local partnerships, she said, “From the Gates Foundation perspective, we have been working in Pakistan for a long time… many of these innovations are also locally informed by research, which is done locally with our partners and many civil society organisations and academic institutions.”
Despite the foundation’s work in the country, she emphasised that it was ultimately up to Pakistanis to change the reality that women face, and that it was the responsibility of the government and society to implement good policies to transform women’s lives.
“Without recognising that women should be at the heart of the development agenda, Pakistan will not prosper,” she stressed. “Pakistan will not prosper without recognising that women’s development has to be central to the country’s development.”
Five priority areas to improve women’s health
The foundation’s $2.5bn commitment will target innovation across five critical areas of a woman’s life, according to the statement. They include:

Obstetric care and maternal immunisation: Making pregnancy and delivery safer
Maternal health and nutrition: Supporting healthier pregnancies and newborns
Gynaecological and menstrual health: Advancing tools and research to better diagnose
treat, and improve gynecological health and reduce infection risk
Contraceptive innovation: Offering more accessible, acceptable, and effective options
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs): Improving diagnosis and treatment to reduce disproportionate burdens on women

Breakthrough opportunities include research on the vaginal microbiome, new treatments for preeclampsia, and non-hormonal contraception. The investment also covers data generation and advocacy efforts to ensure product adoption and real-world impact.
“The five priority areas were selected based on a combination of data and evidence about where innovation can save and improve the most lives, direct insights from women in low- and middle-income countries about their needs and preferences, and the persistently high rates of misdiagnosis caused by gaps in medical knowledge and training,” it said.
“They also reflect the unique challenges faced in low-resource settings, making these areas especially ripe for broader public and private investment to drive meaningful, scalable impact.”
Innovations funded under commitment
The foundation provided a list of more than 40 existing projects it has funded that could fall under the commitment. They range from the very low-tech to the extremely high-tech.  For instance, a simple, low-cost plastic drape — think of a V-shaped plastic bag — that can be placed under a patient during childbirth to collect lost blood. Markings in the bags allow health care providers to rapidly identify when there is too much maternal blood loss.

The foundation was also funding the most expensive type of project in health care — the creation of new medicines.
Comanche CEO Scott Johnson, who spoke on a panel at the event, said the focus on maternal health in the US had made a difference. He said, “I think we’re considering women’s health more as public. As one of my board members said to me, women are not a special population, they’re half the population.”

He continued: “We need more successes. Success attracts capital and interest. And we’ve had too many efforts, at least in the pharmaceutical industry and drug development, to simply repurpose drugs.”
Johnson also told STAT News that although funding was incredibly important, the Gates Foundation’s resources were great. “They have biostatisticians, drug modellers, lawyers who understand regulatory challenges in third world countries and can help you figure out how to do a clinical trial in Ghana. They have enormous and useful resources.”
In exchange for the foundation’s support, Johnson explained, his company agreed to a provision: if it fails to develop the drug for low- and middle-income countries, the foundation will gain access to its intellectual property, allowing it to ensure the product reaches those markets. He acknowledged this arrangement might raise concerns among potential venture capitalists or pharmaceutical partners, according to the outlet.
Even so, Johnson emphasised that both Comanche and the foundation shared the goal of making the drug widely accessible. “We’ve got to be able to find a way to deliver this drug in these countries or it’s not going to achieve its full value, and I mean its full societal value,” he said.
Call for broader support beyond foundation funding
Gates pointed out that in areas like malaria, tuberculosis, and non-hormonal contraception, the foundation was already among the largest funders globally. While R&D projects will continue under Gates Foundation support, he made it clear that funding for service delivery is not permanent — long-term success depends on other players stepping in.
Despite his personal wealth, Gates acknowledged the foundation’s limitations.
“We’d love to have other people work on this stuff,” Gates said. “It’s crazy that this stuff isn’t better funded. Drawing governments and other philanthropists in — we’ve had some success at that, and I’m putting more time into talking with other philanthropists about how impactful this work is. So I think we’ll have a lot of additional partnerships, certainly at the end of the 20 years.
“Then we’re gone, and so other people will have to step up in these areas.”</p><small>2025-08-05 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05180115a588068.jpg?r=180424' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928904/gb-govt-fails-to-reopen-gilgit-chitral-road-even-after-5-days' target='_blank'><strong>GB govt fails to reopen Gilgit-Chitral road even after 5 days</strong></a><br><p>The Gilgit-Chitral road, which was submerged in the flood in the Ghizer district of Gilgit-Baltistan, has not been restored even after five days, officials confirmed on Tuesday.
Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since June. These extreme weather events have resulted in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the GB region among the hardest hit.
“Five days ago, heavy stones and debris accumulated in the river due to the flood at Gopis Khatam, which diverted the river towards the Gilgit-Chitral road, from which the road is now submerged for 2,000 feet,” said Ghufranullah Baig, the deputy director of Disaster Management Authority in GB’s Ghizer district.
“Due to this situation, inter-provincial land connectivity between GB and Chitral regions has been cut off,” he added.
He said that due to the difficulty of accessing the hard rock and debris on the road, the road could not be restored immediately. “Heavy machinery is being used to restore the road, but the restoration will take a few more days,” the official continued.
“Water has risen hundreds of feet due to the flood debris. Efforts are being made to restore another connection through the road, but there is difficulty in delivering heavy machinery.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced Rs4 billion for mapping damage to infrastructure in GB and reconstruction efforts following recent floods in the region.
The prime minister was on a one-day visit to GB to review monsoon damages and distribute relief funds to flood-affected people.
The situation worsened when deadly floods swept across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.
On Friday, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley caused the death of one person, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.
Earlier on Thursday, cloudburst-induced floods in Ghizer and Hunza districts caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in upper Hunza’s Gojal, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.</p><small>2025-08-05 13:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05135700ffb0524.jpg?r=135912' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928872/youm-i-istehsal-pm-notes-indias-occupation-of-kashmir-defining-conflict-in-south-asia' target='_blank'><strong>Youm-i-Istehsal: PM notes India’s occupation of Kashmir ‘defining conflict’ in South Asia</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed India’s occupation of Kashmir the “defining conflict” of South Asia as Pakistan marked six years on Tuesday since New Delhi deprived the held region of its special autonomy.
Pakistan is observing Youm-i-Istehsal (Exploitation Day) today to mark the sixth anniversary of India revoking Kashmir’s special autonomy and to show solidarity with Kashmiris.
On Aug 5, 2019, India’s Narendra Modi-led government stripped the Muslim-majority territory of its special status by repealing Article 370 of the constitution, splitting the former state into two territories directly ruled by New Delhi.
“India’s illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir remained the defining conflict of the South Asia region, and the driver of India’s continued rogue behaviour,” PM Shehbaz said in a statement.
 


The premier also recalled the recent India-Pakistan conflict, noting: “India’s unprovoked aggression against Pakistan in May 2025, and its swift and comprehensive military defeat are only the latest evidence of the urgent need for the international community to ensure that the resolution of the Kashmir dispute becomes a global priority.
“The will and aspirations of the Kashmiri people, in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, are the only path forward,” he stressed.
PM Shehbaz noted that a “just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was a key pillar of Pakistan’s foreign policy”.
The prime minister reiterated “strongest condemnation” of India’s illegal and unilateral actions to alter the demographic structure and political landscape of India-occupied Kashmir (IoK).
 
 

He also flayed India’s efforts to silence genuine Kashmiri leaders as part of the “wider hegemonic and extremist agenda” that informed its illegal occupation of the disputed region.
“The imprisonment of Kashmiri leaders and activists, including Shabbir Ahmed Shah, Muhammad Yasin Malik and Masarrat Alam Bhatt, will never dim the resolve of our Kashmiri sisters and brothers,” he asserted.
Urging the international community to play a role in halting human rights crimes in IoK and reversing the 2019 action, the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unflinching” stance, moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people.
Meanwhile, in his statement, President Asif Ali Zardari also referred to the recent conflict with India, emphasising that “this year’s ‘Youm-e-Istehsal’ assumes greater significance”.
“While the resounding success of the ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ is a matter of great pride for the people of Pakistan, the day also underscores the need for a settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people, for a lasting peace in South Asia,” the president said.
 






He highlighted that Indian authorities had taken a number of steps, aimed at changing the IoK’s demographic structure and political landscape, during the last six years.
“These measures include gerrymandering of the electoral constituencies, allowing addition of non-Kashmiris to electoral rolls, issuance of domicile certificates to outsiders, granting more powers to the lieutenant governor in administrative matters, and introduction of new laws on ownership of land and property,” he noted.
“The Kashmiri people are confronted with the danger of becoming a disempowered community in their own land. The genuine leadership of the Kashmiri people remains behind bars. The intimidation of innocent people, arbitrary detentions, and the so-called ‘cordon and search’ operations have become a matter of routine,” Zardari said.
To mark Youm-i-Istehsal, a rally was taken out from Parliament House to D-Chowk in Islamabad to express solidarity with Kashmiris.
 






Special walks and events are being held across all four provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan. A one-minute silence was also observed at 10am to express solidarity with Kashmiris, Radio Pakistan reported.
Pakistani missions abroad were also set to organise special events in connection with Youm-i-Istehsal.
Dar condemns reports of India planning to maintain held Kashmir as union territory
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar underscored that Kashmir was an internationally recognised dispute, and its future cannot be determined through internal legislation or court rulings, Radio Pakistan reported.
Addressing the rally in Islamabad, Dar expressed concern over media reports suggesting that Indian authorities are attempting to grant statehood to Jammu while retaining the Kashmir Valley as a union territory.
He condemned such moves as “unacceptable and provocative”.
India’s top court is also set to hear a petition tomorrow that seeks directives to the federal government to restore the statehood of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, Hindustan Times reported, citing Live Law.
 


The foreign minister reaffirmed Islamabad’s desire for friendly relations with all neighbouring countries and its preference for dialogue and diplomacy over confrontation.
However, he warned that Pakistan’s armed forces and its people were “fully capable of delivering a resolute response to any act of aggression, as demonstrated” during the May conflict.
Addressing the rally, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar noted that the bonds between Kashmiris and Pakistan were “eternal which can never be broken by any Indian conspiracy”.
Recalling that bodies of Kashmiri icons, such as Burhan Wani, were wrapped in the “colour of Pakistan’s flag, which was a manifestation of Kashmiris love and affection for Pakistan”.
Also mentioning the India-Pakistan conflict, Tarar asserted that the “victory in Marka-i-Haq has boosted the morale of Kashmiri masses”.
NA passes resolution condemning ‘all forms of Indian state violence’
In its session today, the National Assembly passed a unanimous resolution, condemning “all forms of Indian state violence and coercive tactics aimed at erasing the identity, culture, and political aspirations of the Kashmiri people, which have failed and will continue to fail”.
The lower house of the parliament reiterated that “Pakistan will never compromise on the right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination as guaranteed under international law and UN resolutions”, Radio Pakistan reported.
The resolution was moved by Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam in Urdu and by PPP MNA Shazia Marri in English.
 


The resolution stressed that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was “not an internal matter of India but a global issue requiring a just resolution in accordance with UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people”.
It called upon the global community to “stand for justice, not silence, in the face of Indian oppression and human rights abuses” in IoK.  The NA declared that “from Srinagar to Islamabad, the heart beats as one for the freedom and dignity of Kashmir”, Radio Pakistan added.
The NA affirmed that Pakistan’s moral, political and diplomatic support for the Kashmiri people remained “unshakable and enduring”, and committed to continue raising the Kashmir issue at every regional and international forum.
The House demanded the immediate implementation of all relevant UNSC resolutions, which call for a free and impartial plebiscite.
India’s repressive actions only perpetuate human suffering: ISPR
The armed forces also emphasised that it was “unequivocally evident that durable peace in South Asia remains unattainable without the just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute”.
In a press release, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu and the armed forces reaffirmed their “unwavering solidarity with the resilient and courageous people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK)”.
“India’s repressive actions, coupled with its belligerent posture and incendiary rhetoric, serve only to exacerbate regional instability and perpetuate human suffering,” the ISPR noted.
 






It added: “The armed forces of Pakistan fully support the legitimate and ongoing struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination, as enshrined in international law and UN Security Council resolutions.
“The continued illegal occupation of IIOJK by Indian security forces — characterised by an unrelenting military siege, systemic human rights violations, and demographic engineering — constitutes a grave breach of international norms and remains a matter of deep concern.
The armed forces “pay solemn tribute to the martyrs of IIOJK and reiterate their enduring commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Kashmiri people in their just and rightful struggle for freedom”.
India’s top court to hear Kashmir statehood plea
Separately, court officials said today that India’s top court will hear a plea for the restoration of Kashmir’s federal statehood later this week.
The hearing, scheduled for August 8 in the Supreme Court, follows an application filed by two residents.
The removal of Article 370 of the constitution, which enshrined the region’s special status, was challenged by Kashmir’s pro-India political parties, the local Bar Association and individual litigants.
The Supreme Court in December 2023 upheld removing the region’s autonomy but called for Jammu and Kashmir to be restored to statehood and put on a par with any other Indian federal state “at the earliest and as soon as possible”.
“We have moved an application seeking a definitive timeline for the restoration of statehood,” said the petitioners’ lawyer, Soayib Qureshi.
“It has been quite some time since the court asked for it and elections have also been successfully held.”
Last November, the territory elected its first government since it was brought under New Delhi’s direct control, as voters backed opposition parties to lead its regional assembly.
But the local government has limited powers and the territory continues to be, for all practical purposes, governed by a New Delhi-appointed administrator.

“India has not been a good trading partner, because they do a lot of business with us, but we don’t do business with them. So we settled on 25pc but I think I’m going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they’re buying Russian oil,” he told CNBC in a televised interview.
“They’re fuelling the war machine, and if they’re going to do that, then I’m not going to be happy,” Trump said, adding that the main sticking point with India was that its tariffs were too high.
He did not provide a new tariff rate for India.
Trump last week said he would impose a 25pc tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world’s fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty, but gave no details. Later, Trump mou­nted a sharp attack and said: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told Reuters that India will keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump’s threats. In turn, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had accused India of effectively financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow.
Trump had made the same threat about substantially raising tariffs a day ago.
Responding to the threat, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a statement claiming that the US and the European Union “targeted” New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.
“India began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,” the statement read. “The US at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy market stability.”
The MEA highlighted in its statement that the very nations criticising India were engaging in trade with Russia themselves, adding that the goods exchanged include energy, fertilisers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.
“Where the United States is concerned, it continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its electric vehicle industry, fertilisers, as well as chemicals,” the MEA statement added.
“In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.”
 






India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, is the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.
The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.
Last week, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India’s arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports.
Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.
Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.
By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.
But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.
The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.
That appears to have hit a dead-end.</p><small>2025-08-05 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0516094573c79ad.gif?r=161217' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928899/gwadar-port-authority-chinese-firm-agree-to-boost-investments' target='_blank'><strong>Gwadar Port Authority, Chinese firm agree to boost investments</strong></a><br><p>The Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) and a Chinese company agreed to boost investments at the port, the maritime affairs ministry said on Tuesday.
Pakistan recently increased efforts on the commercialisation of the Gwadar Port, which was built more than a decade ago but remains a non-starter. In January, the government sought the private sector’s support in routing their cargoes through the port, seeking detailed proposals to enhance trade.
“China’s Xinning Enterprise have signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) with Gwadar Port Authority to stimulate major industrial and commercial investments at Gwadar Port and its Free Zone, underscoring Gwadar’s growing role as a key regional hub for trade and economic activity,” the maritime affairs ministry said in a press release today.
The ministry said that the LoI, which outlines plans for diverse ventures, was signed between Xinning Enterprise’s Yi Jiang and maritime affairs ministry’s additional secretary Umer Zaffar Shaikh, while GPA Chairman Noorul Haq Baloch attended the event online.
“These ventures include developing Gwadar Port as a regional transhipment centre, launching new industrial projects, optimising existing facilities within the Gwadar Free Zone, and relocating industries,” the press release read.
It further said that the Chinese business delegation met with Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry to discuss ways to boost the performance of the Gwadar Port.
While lauding the partnership as a “significant milestone in strengthening Gwadar’s strategic importance”, Chaudhry highlighted Xinning Enterprise’s potential to “boost the port’s capacity, attract foreign investment, and contribute to the broader economic development of the region”.
“Both parties committed to adhering to Pakistan’s legal and regulatory framework governing Gwadar’s port and Free Zone operations,” the ministry stated, “They also pledged continued good-faith discussions to identify investment opportunities, finalise operational details, and establish mechanisms for cooperation.”
Chaudhry also reiterated “the government’s commitment to transforming Gwadar into a global maritime gateway and industrial powerhouse” and said that such collaborations will accelerate Pakistan’s maritime and economic ambitions, the ministry added.
On July 1, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs announced an ambitious plan to expand Gwadar Port’s operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Subsequently, five private companies proposed routes for the ferry service.
The move is expected to provide an affordable, direct maritime link for passengers and cargo, particularly benefiting expatriate communities and cross-border traders.</p><small>2025-08-05 12:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05153615730dca0.jpg?r=154541' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928897/roof-collapse-kills-17-year-old-girl-injures-3-family-members-in-punjabs-gujar-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Roof collapse kills 17-year-old girl, injures 3 family members in Punjab’s Gujar Khan</strong></a><br><p>A roof collapse due to heavy rains killed a 17-year-old girl and injured three other family members in Punjab’s Rawalpindi district in the early hours of Tuesday morning, rescue officials said.
Starting in late June, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas. Roof collapses are a particularly common occurrence due to a large number of mud houses that are unable to withstand the heavy downpour.
According to Rescue 1122, the roof collapse occurred on Daultala Road of Gujar Khan tehsil.
A neighbour of the family reported that the side walls of their house collapsed and the roof caved in at about 1:30am while they were sleeping.
According to the neighbour, “all the people in the neighbourhood rushed to the rescue” upon getting the information. The victims were pulled out of the rubble and taken to the hospital.
Rescue 1122 District Emergency Officer Muhammad Sibghtullah said that one family member, a 17-year-old girl, was seriously injured and died before reaching the hospital.
“Unfortunately, despite all efforts, she succumbed to her injuries, primarily due to severe head trauma,” Rescue 1122 confirmed.
“Her mother and two elder sisters were also wounded,” he said, adding that they all were transported to Daultala’s Rural Health Centre.
After treatment, the family returned to attend the victim’s funeral.
The neighbour added that the family had been injured by girders and iron bars in their sleep.
He further added that the head of the household was a “poor barber, the only breadwinner of the family”.
This was confirmed by a number of other neighbours, who urged Punjab’s Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif to provide an urgent relief package to the affected family for the reconstruction of their house.
Rawalpindi Commissioner Engineer Aamir Khattak told Dawn.com that the assistant commissioner of Gujar Khan had been directed to visit the collapsed house and submit estimates for rehabilitation of the victim family under the CM’s flood relief programme.
A number of houses have also collapsed in the vicinity during the recent rain spells, resulting in the death of cattle in Nata village.
In July, a man died and three others were injured by a roof collapse during heavy rain in Lahore, which also wreaked havoc in various other cities of Punjab.
Meanwhile, three people were reported dead in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat last week when the roof of a room in their house collapsed amid heavy rain, while at least two others in Bannu were injured when the roof of their house collapsed due to heavy rain.</p><small>2025-08-05 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/011115059d80f4f.jpg?r=111551' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927824/digital-rights-foundation-issues-alert-for-rising-scam-compromising-whatsapp-accounts' target='_blank'><strong>Digital Rights Foundation issues alert for rising scam compromising WhatsApp accounts</strong></a><br><p>The Digital Rights Foundation (DRF) issued an alert this week, warning against an ongoing scam aiming to compromise WhatsApp accounts via fake calls requesting a code.
WhatsApp is an especially widely used messaging service across Pakistan, with the World Population Review reporting about 52 million Pakistani users of the platform in 2024 — the seventh-largest number in the world by population. Its use has even been advocated in the legal sector for greater efficiency. However, rising digital scams threaten users’ data security and can cause accounts to be compromised.
According to the alert, DRF — a not-for-profit organisation based in Pakistan that has been working on digital rights freedoms since 2013 — received “multiple reports of an ongoing scam to hack WhatsApp accounts”.
“Victims receive calls from delivery riders, or from individuals pretending to be from the HEC (Higher Education Commission), and are prompted to share a code that compromises their WhatsApp,” the alert said.

“Victims receive calls from individuals pretending to be representatives of the HEC. They claim the victim’s educational degrees need urgent verification and ask for a verification code,” DRF told Dawn.com. “Sharing the code results in the victim’s WhatsApp account being compromised.”
 
 

The foundation emphasised that while some courier companies used codes for deliveries, these codes were always sent from the company’s official number.
“Always check the sender’s name and consult the courier company’s official helpline before you share,” it said. “Remember: never share any other codes with anyone, no matter how much they insist.”

It also advised citizens to report scam calls to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s official complaint cell at 0800-55055.
In infographics also shared by the foundation, it recommended turning on two-factor authentication for all social media apps as well as checking the ‘linked devices’ function of WhatsApp to monitor who had access to an account, and removing unfamiliar devices.

It advised affected parties to reach out to its Digital Security Helpline team for guidance via the number 0800-39393 — open every day from 9am-5pm — or via social media.
 

Infographics provided by the DRF warning against a recent WhatsApp scam, on July 30, 2025. — DRF

According to data shared with Dawn.com by the helpline team, 233 cases of scam calls have been reported to the DRF since January 2025.
Other types of scams reported include JazzCash helpline impersonation to gain access to an account, kidnapping scam calls demanding large sums for the “release” of a victim’s family member, and phishing links, where scammers hack the victim’s social media account and then impersonate them to ask for “urgent financial help”.
The DRF Digital Security Helpline guides victims of hacking through steps to raise an awareness message on social media, recover their hacked account, and report their hacked account for legal action. It also provides digital security tips and escalates cases to relevant platforms for high-risk individuals.
“Unfortunately, despite awareness messages, people still regularly fall into the trap of these scams and end up sharing their OTP (One-Time Password),” said DRF’s Digital Security Helpline Lead Hyra Basit.
“Yes, these scams have also evolved and are becoming increasingly difficult to verify, particularly those that use AI systems to conduct the scams on a scale,” she added.
“But there is also a need to enforce a human rights–compliant data protection law to ensure that people’s private information is made secure and people are not left vulnerable at the hands of data leaks.”
She also stressed the need for accessible mechanisms for the public to report such scams.
Earlier this month, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency conducted a successful raid on an illegal call centre in Islamabad and arrested five foreign nationals, according to a press release.
Meanwhile, in May, the national Cyber Emergency Response Team issued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan had been stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures.</p><small>2025-08-05 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05142928e1ea0b7.jpg?r=160012' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928890/turkiye-confers-highest-military-award-on-pakistan-naval-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Turkiye confers highest military award on Pakistan naval chief</strong></a><br><p>Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) Admiral Naveed Ashraf was conferred Turkiye’s highest military award — titled Legion of Merit of the Turkish Armed Forces — for his efforts towards “defence and maritime cooperation” between the two nations, the Pakistan Navy said on Tuesday.
Pakistani armed forces routinely conduct joint military exercises with other nations to increase combat readiness and identify problems in logistics, training, and current military doctrine.
Pakistan Navy, in its statement, said the commander of Turkish Navy, Admiral Ercument Tatlioglu, “presented [the] award to Adm Naveed Ashraf in recognition of his efforts to strengthen defence & maritime coop b/w the two countries”.
 






The award ceremony was held at the headquarters of the Turkish Naval Forces, where he was also given a guard of honour.
Pakistan’s naval chief called upon Turkiye’s Defence Minister Yasar Guler, Chief of General Staff Metin Gurak, and the Commander of the Turkish Navy Fleet, Admiral Kadir Yildiz.
The two sides discussed collaborative avenues between Pakistan and Turkiye’s navies, mainly “regional maritime security, defence cooperation,” and increased interaction via “joint exercises, mutual visits, training and exchange programmes”.
The CNS visited the Istanbul Naval Shipyard, where he was briefed on the Pakistan Navy’s Milgem project.
Pakistan Navy signed the contract for four Milgem class corvettes with Turkiye in 2018.
Under the contract, two ships are to be constructed at the Istanbul Naval Shipyard and the other two at the Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works.
The naval chief also observed submarine construction at Golchuk Naval Base. Following this, he visited Turkish naval ships, including “TCG Oruçreis, S/M PIRIREIS and NDU”, the statement said.
The naval chief paid his respect to Turkiye’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, by laying a wreath at his mausoleum.
On July 10, a delegation led by Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Güler called on  Pakistan Air Force Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, where both sides agreed on the establishment of dedicated joint working groups to streamline and accelerate progress across various sectors of mutual interest.</p><small>2025-08-05 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05165631cb24287.jpg?r=172436' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928880/death-of-a-delta-pakistans-indus-sinks-and-shrinks' target='_blank'><strong>Death of a delta: Pakistan’s Indus sinks and shrinks</strong></a><br><p>Salt crusts crackle underfoot as Habibullah Khatti walks to his mother’s grave to say a final goodbye before he abandons his parched island village on the Indus delta.
Seawater intrusion into the delta, where the Indus River meets the Arabian Sea in the south of the country, has triggered the collapse of farming and fishing communities.
“The saline water has surrounded us from all four sides,” Khatti told AFP from Abdullah Mirbahar village in the town of Kharo Chan, around 15 kilometres from where the river empties into the sea.
As fish stocks fell, the 54-year-old turned to tailoring until that too became impossible with only four of the 150 households remaining.
“In the evening, an eerie silence takes over the area,” he said, as stray dogs wandered through the deserted wooden and bamboo houses.

Kharo Chan once comprised around 40 villages, but most have disappeared under rising seawater.
The town’s population fell from 26,000 in 1981 to 11,000 in 2023, according to census data.
Khatti is preparing to move his family to nearby Karachi, a city swelling with economic migrants, including from the Indus delta.
The Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum, which advocates for fishing communities, estimates that tens of thousands of people have been displaced from the delta’s coastal districts.
However, more than 1.2 million people have been displaced from the overall Indus delta region in the last two decades, according to a study published in March by the Jinnah Institute, a think tank led by a former climate change minister.
The downstream flow of water into the delta has decreased by 80 per cent since the 1950s as a result of irrigation canals, hydropower dams and the impacts of climate change on glacial and snow melt, according to a 2018 study by the US-Pakistan Centre for Advanced Studies in Water.
That has led to devastating seawater intrusion.
 
 

The salinity of the water has risen by around 70pc since 1990, making it impossible to grow crops and severely affecting the shrimp and crab populations.
“The delta is both sinking and shrinking,” said Muhammad Ali Anjum, a local World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) conservationist.
‘No other choice’
Beginning in Tibet, the Indus River flows through disputed Kashmir before traversing the entire length of Pakistan.
The river and its tributaries irrigate about 80pc of the country’s farmland, supporting millions of livelihoods.
The delta, formed by rich sediment deposited by the river as it meets the sea, was once ideal for farming, fishing, mangroves and wildlife.

But more than 16pc of fertile land has become unproductive due to encroaching seawater, a government water agency study in 2019 found.
In the town of Keti Bandar, which spreads inland from the water’s edge, a white layer of salt crystals covers the ground.
Boats carry in drinkable water from miles away, and villagers cart it home via donkeys.
 
 

“Who leaves their homeland willingly?” said Haji Karam Jat, whose house was swallowed by the rising water level.
He rebuilt farther inland, anticipating more families would join him.
“A person only leaves their motherland when they have no other choice,” he told AFP.

Way of life
British colonial rulers were the first to alter the course of the Indus River with canals and dams, followed more recently by dozens of hydropower projects.
Earlier this year, several military-led canal projects on the Indus River were halted when farmers in the low-lying riverine areas of Sindh province protested.
To combat the degradation of the Indus River Basin, the government and the United Nations launched the ‘Living Indus Initiative’ in 2021.
One intervention focuses on restoring the delta by addressing soil salinity and protecting local agriculture and ecosystems.
The Sindh government is currently running its own mangrove restoration project, aiming to revive forests that serve as a natural barrier against saltwater intrusion.
 
 

Even as mangroves are restored in some parts of the coastline, land grabbing and residential development projects drive clearing in other areas.

India, meanwhile, poses a looming threat to the river and its delta, after revoking the 1960 Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan, which divides control over the Indus basin rivers.
It has threatened to never reinstate the treaty and build dams upstream, squeezing the flow of water to Pakistan, which has called it “an act of war”.
Alongside their homes, the communities have lost a way of life tightly bound up in the delta, said climate activist Fatima Majeed, who works with the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum.
Women, in particular, who for generations have stitched nets and packed the day’s catches, struggle to find work when they migrate to cities, said Majeed, whose grandfather relocated the family from Kharo Chan to the outskirts of Karachi.
“We haven’t just lost our land, we’ve lost our culture.”

Around 10,000 lightning flashes lit up Hong Kong’s skies between 6am (3am PKT) and 6:59am, according to the city’s weather authorities, as up to 90 millimetres of rain per hour continued to drench the city and neighbouring Guangdong province.
Videos showed torrents of water cascading down steep hillsides in the former British colony, breaking into white-water streams as they rushed down staircases linking Hong Kong’s multi-tiered cityscape.
The deluge prompted the weather bureau to extend its highest “black” rainstorm warning until 3pm.
 


The water had risen to ankle-height outside Hong Kong’s largest hospital, as medical authorities announced they would be closing clinics across the city due to the downpour.
Extreme rainfall and catastrophic flooding, which meteorologists link to climate change, pose mounting challenges for officials in mainland China, sweeping people to their deaths, displacing thousands, and threatening billions of dollars in economic losses.
The storms follow deadly flash floods in Southern China over the weekend, which left five dead in Guangdong province and prompted a large-scale search operation involving over 1,300 rescuers.
As of Tuesday morning, four rivers in the province had risen to such a height that were at risk of bursting their banks, China’s state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Hong Kong, Guangdong Province, and Macau — which issued a Red rain warning — form the backbone of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s flagship Greater Bay Area initiative, aimed at fusing Hong Kong’s financial firepower with Guangdong’s manufacturing and technological strength.
Airports across the region reported cancellation rates of around 20 per cent on Tuesday, according to data from Flightmaster, while speed limits on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai Macau Bridge — a flagship GBA infrastructure project — were lowered due to poor visibility.
Hong Kong’s airport has maintained normal operations throughout but said some flights had been delayed and passengers were advised to head to the airport only after their flight time was confirmed.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange remains open, having changed its policy to continue trading whatever the weather late last year, but the judiciary announced that courts, tribunals and register offices would remain shut until at least two hours after the ‘black’ rainstorm alert was cancelled.
“Persistent rainstorm will cause serious road flooding and traffic congestion. Members of the public are advised to take shelter in a safe place,” the Hong Kong Observatory said in a bulletin on its website.
Hong Kong typically receives an annual average of 2,200mm of rainfall, more than half of which usually falls from June through August.
But it is not all doom and gloom.
Hong Kong Disneyland announced it remains open, and its daily “Friendtastic! Parade” is still scheduled to take place later today, according to the park’s website.</p><small>2025-08-05 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05122034614720a.png?r=122401' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928877/pakistan-uk-strengthen-alliance-with-fresh-defence-and-trade-focus' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UK strengthen alliance with fresh defence and trade focus</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the United Kingdom have pledged to deepen their partnership across key sectors, with a renewed focus on defence cooperation and strategic dialogue, during high-level talks in Rawalpindi on Monday, according to a statement by Press Information Department (PID).
Pakistan and UK have been engaged in Enhanced Strategic Dialogue (ESD) since 2011, which has deepened and broadened the dialogue between the two countries, covering areas such as trade, economic growth and development, cultural cooperation, security, and education.
The consensus was reached during a meeting between Minister for Defence Production Muhammad Raza Hayat Harraj and British High Commissioner Jane Marriott in Rawalpindi.
“Pakistan considers the United Kingdom a close friend and a genuine development partner,” Minister Harraj said, according to the statement.
“Frequent interaction has been useful in coordinating our approaches to various bilateral, regional and international issues. The two sides agreed to enhance cooperation in all fields, including defence,” the minister was further quoted as saying.
Harraj also expressed hope that UK-Pakistan bilateral relations will continue to evolve on principles of mutual respect, shared common interest and understanding each other’s perspectives, as per the statement.
“The British High Commissioner expressed her commitment to strengthening the UK-Pakistan relationship and working with Pakistan on shared priorities, including bilateral trade and defence production,” it added.
In July, the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and announced the establishment of the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
The Senate Chairman Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani has also previously stated that Pakistan greatly values its long-standing, close, and enduring relationship with the United Kingdom, built on shared history, values, and traditions.</p><small>2025-08-05 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/051006346a2c6ae.jpg?r=100636' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928861/fo-rejects-unfounded-allegations-of-involvement-of-pakistani-nationals-in-russia-ukraine-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>FO rejects ‘unfounded allegations’ of involvement of Pakistani nationals in Russia-Ukraine conflict</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Tuesday rejected claims of Pakistani nationals being involved in the Ukraine conflict after a statement by Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky.
Zelensky claimed on Monday that his troops in northeastern Ukraine were fighting foreign “mercenaries” from various countries, including China, Pakistan and parts of Africa.
A statement by the FO today said Pakistan “categorically rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations of the involvement of Pakistani nationals in the conflict in Ukraine”.
“To date, Pakistan has not been formally approached by the Ukrainian authorities, nor has any verifiable evidence been presented to substantiate such claims.”
The statement added that the government would take up this matter with the Ukrainian authorities, “and seek clarification in this regard”.
“Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter,” the statement said.
 






In a post on X on Monday, Zelensky said: “We spoke with commanders about the frontline situation, the defence of Vovchansk, and the dynamics of the battles.
“Our warriors in this sector are reporting the participation of mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and African countries in the war. We will respond.”
 






The Russia-Ukraine war began when President Vladimir Putin ordered the latter’s invasion on Feb 24, 2022.
The government has on separate occasions rebuffed allegations that the country was providing arms to Ukraine.
During a visit to Pakistan in July 2023, then-Ukra­inian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba had rejected similar reports, clarifying that the two nations had no deals for the supply of arms and ammunition.
Initially taking a neutral stance on the matter and maintaining that in its diplomatic moves till last year, Pakistan has called for de-escalation and ceasefire in recent months as the war crossed the three-year mark.
Pakistan has historically maintained good relations with Ukraine, having purchased weapons systems from it in the past, but has also been strengthening ties with Russia in recent years.</p><small>2025-08-05 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/051110217aa7873.jpg?r=111304' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928741/cda-blames-typo-for-rs47m-tender-for-ministers-house' target='_blank'><strong>CDA blames typo for Rs47m tender for minister’s house</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: After facing public criticism over a tender worth over Rs47 million for the repair and maintenance of a federal minister’s official residence, city managers clarified on Monday that there was a typographical error.
The CDA on Saturday had floated the tender worth Rs 47.3 million for “repair and maintenance of house No 36 at Minister Enclave, Islamabad,” and called for bids from registered firms.
There was uproar on social media on Sunday, as people criticised the civic agency for its plan to spend such a huge amount on the official residence of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
However, the CDA on Monday came up with a statement saying the tender was originally meant for eight houses in the Minister Enclave, not one. The CDA also issued a corrigendum with an amendment to the tender on Monday edition of newspapers, removing the name of house No 36 and replacing it with eight houses.
 
 

When contacted, a CDA spokesperson stated: “It was a routine matter which was meant for maintenance of 8 houses at the cost of 47 million but there was a typo error in the advertisement published on August 2. The typo error was immediately rectified by the CDA itself and a corrigendum was issued the very next day.”
However, an official source expressed surprise at the CDA’s explanation, pointing out the significant discrepancy between mentioning house No 36 and listing eight separate houses.
“If this was a typo error, a proper inquiry should be conducted to fix the responsibility for such a blunder,” he said.

According to a press release issued by the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (FBISE), Mohammad Aneeq, Ghulam Junaid, Mohammad Saram and Ahmed Imran Malik secured bronze medals for the nation.
“Among 86 participating countries, Pakistan proudly ranked 32nd, outperforming many technologically advanced and developed nations, including Germany, Austria, Turkey, France, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Saudi Arabia,” said the press release.
Last year, the Pakistani team had secured two bronze medals and the overall ranking was 46th.
“This brilliant performance of the Pakistan team is a testament to the transparent and merit-based selection process carried out by FBISE, and it reflects the immense potential and talent of Pakistan’s youth. It marks a significant step forward in promoting excellence in computer science and informatics within the country.”
It said: “FBISE extends its heartfelt congratulations to the students, their families, coaches and partner institutions for this remarkable success, which brings pride and honour to the entire nation.”
 
 

The Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training had entrusted FBISE with organising Pakistan’s participation in the International Olympiad in Informatics each year. In response, FBISE issued official notifications to all educational boards across the country, including the Inter Boards Coordination Committee (IBCC), to encourage students from all streams, including those from the Cambridge stream.
The same notice was also sent to the directorates of education and FBISE-affiliated institutions. As a result, a total of 528 students nationwide registered for the POI.
Additionally, FBISE conducted two rigorous rounds of nationwide testing to identify and select the most outstanding young programmers. The first round of POI was held across 12 examination centres countrywide. Based on these results, 25 students were shortlisted for the second round, which led to the final selection of four students.

Bolsonaro is on trial at the Supreme Court for allegedly plotting to cling onto power after losing 2022 elections to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
President Donald Trump has sought to punish Brazil, a longtime US ally, for what he sees as a politically motivated “witch hunt” targeting Bolsonaro by imposing eye-watering tariffs on Latin America’s biggest economy.
The 70-year-old Bolsonaro is banned from social media for the duration of the proceedings, and third parties are barred from sharing his public remarks.
But on Sunday, his allies defied the order by sharing footage online of a call between the former army captain and his eldest son Flavio at a solidarity rally in Rio de Janeiro.
Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes reacted furiously, declaring that the judiciary would not allow a defendant to “treat it like a fool” because of his “political and economic power.”
Criticising Bolsonaro’s “repeated failure” to comply with the court’s restrictions on him during the trial, he placed him under house arrest at his home in the capital Brasilia.
He also barred the country’s former leader (2019-2022) from receiving visitors, apart from his lawyers, and from using mobile phones, and warned that any new transgression would lead to him being detained.
Several mobile phones were seized at his home on Monday, the police said.
Washington condemned the new restrictions on Monday night, with the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs issuing a statement on X.
“Minister Alexandre de Moraes, already sanctioned by the United States for human rights violations, continues to use Brazilian institutions to silence the opposition and threaten democracy,” the bureau posted. “Let Bolsonaro speak!”
 






US officials added that they would “hold accountable all those who collaborate with or facilitate sanctioned conduct.”
The US post was re-shared by Bolsonaro’s politician son Eduardo Bolsonaro, who had successfully lobbied Washington to take punitive action against Brazil over the case.
In a separate post, he wrote: “Brazil is no longer a democracy.”
He called Moraes, who is presiding over Bolsonaro’s trial and has styled himself a defender of Brazilian democracy in the face of the far right, an “out-of-control psychopath.”
Last month, Moraes ordered Bolsonaro to wear an ankle bracelet and instituted the social media ban.
Trump responded in unprecedented fashion by banning Moraes from the United States and freezing his assets in US banks.
‘Thank you Trump’
Trump’s pressure campaign has angered many Brazilians but endeared him to Bolsonaro’s conservative base.
At rallies in Rio, Brasilia and Sao Paulo on Sunday, some demonstrators waved US flags or held signs reading “Thank you Trump.”
Bolsonaro himself did not attend the rallies, having been ordered by the Supreme Court to stay home at night and at weekends throughout the trial.
Prosecutors say he and seven co-accused tried to overturn his 2022 election defeat in a plot that only failed because the military did not get on board.
He faces a 40-year sentence if convicted at the trial, which is expected to wrap up in the coming weeks.
Bolsonaro’s supporters stormed Brazil’s congress in January 2023, after Lula was inaugurated, ransacking the chambers and attacking police, in scenes reminiscent of an attack by Trump supporters on the US Capitol two years before.
Despite being barred from running, Bolsonaro hopes to mount a Trump-style comeback in Brazil’s 2026 presidential election.
Lula, 79, has said he may seek a fourth term, health permitting.

Officials warn that urban flooding is feared in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Islamabad over the next 72 hours.
According to the PDMA fact sheet, heavy rains have already claimed 163 lives so far this season, besides leaving 579 people injured and 215 homes damaged across Punjab.
The PDMA also predicted moderate to high-level flooding in the Chenab and Jhelum rivers from August 5, with thunderstorms expected in upper catchment areas.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia placed all emergency centres on high alert, stating, “Our field teams are monitoring the situation 24/7, especially in vulnerable areas like Murree where landslides remain a serious threat.”
Meanwhile, the current rains and floods have filled the Tarbela Dam up to 91 percent of its full capacity and the Mangla Dam to 60pc, while major rivers currently show normal flow levels, say officials.
 
 

Residents in low-lying areas of 19 districts, including Faisalabad, Sialkot and Bahawalpur, have been advised to move to safer locations.
The PDMA has activated its emergency helpline 1129 and deployed special teams to prevent water accumulation in vulnerable cities.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has ordered immediate financial assistance for affected families as the province braces for what meteorologists predict could be the heaviest rainfall of this monsoon season.
The PDMA urged people to keep children away from storm drains and waterways. “One moment of carelessness can cost lives in these conditions,” it cautions.

“The body of a man, who was swept away by a glacier over 28 years ago, has been found by locals after the massive glacier melted in recent days,” district police officer Amjad Hussain told reporters on Monday.
According to locals, the deceased, identified as Naseerudden, was buried under the glacier along with his horse while returning from Allai area of Battagram. 
They said the man was associated with cattle trade. His body was found intact and still recognisable, and his national identity card was also recovered from his clothing.
“A group of visitors spotted the body and informed nearby villagers, who buried it at a local site and later informed the bereaved family,” DPO Hussain said.
He said Naseerudden had left behind a daughter and a son, who were still alive and currently residing in the Allai area of Battagram. 
“The rumours are circulating that the man was murdered, but these are entirely baseless. His brother survived the tragedy,” Mr Hussain clarified.
“At the time of the incident, the family and residents even attempted to search 150 feet deep into the glacier but were unsuccessful,” a resident said. “Now, the body would be shifted to our native village in Koz Shayar, Gohir Abad, for formal burial.”

They, however, opposed any military offensive and forced displacement in the region for the sake of peace.
The elders gathered in a “consultative jirga” on the law and order situation in the province here with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in the chair.
This is the second such gathering, held in line with the declaration of the July 24 multi-party conference.

CM chairs jirga on law and order

The first jirga, also presided over by the chief minister, was held on August 2 with elders from Orakzai and Khyber districts, Darra Adamkhel tehsil of Kohat district and subdivision Hassankhel of Peshawar district, at the Chief Minister’s House here. The participants opposed any military operation and forced displacement in the region.
They wondered if authorities would promise in writing that the military operation would eradicate terrorism from the region forever and that there would be no such action in the future.
 
 

Monday’s gathering was attended by adviser to the chief minister Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, Senator Noorul Haq Qadri, the chief secretary, police chief, the relevant commissioners, deputy commissioners and senior police officials, according to an official statement from the Chief Minister’s Secretariat.
The participants thoroughly discussed the law and order situation in Bajaur and Mohmand tribal districts and made several recommendations.
The participants expressed their commitment to peace, saying they want peace, so the government should ensure it.
They said that they’re ready to fully cooperate with authorities for the elimination of terrorism, which was the enemy of all.
The participants opposed military operations or forced displacement, saying such actions are unacceptable.
They recommended the formation of a broad-based and empowered jirga, comprising representatives from the federal and provincial governments, tribal elders and all key stakeholders, to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Afghan government and people to ensure the long-term eradication of terrorism in the region.
The participants said that the initiative of local jirgas was a positive step and called for it to be made more effective so that its outcomes could benefit other regions as well.
The chief minister reportedly asked them about the options available for restoration of peace other than military operations against terrorism.

• Pakistan Railways generated Rs13.9bn from leasing, licensing of land in 3 years
ISLAMABAD: As much as 3,999 acres of land, belonging to the Pakistan Railways (PR), is currently under “illegal occupation” of various “government and defence departments”.
This information was placed before the National Assembly by Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi on Monday, through written replies to two separate, but similar questions posed by MNAs.
“The PR owns a total of 168,858 acres of land across its network in Pakistan, out of which 13,115 acres (7.7 per cent) is under illegal occupation,” said the minister.
In the past five years, PR has managed to retrieve over 2,550 acres of land from illegal occupants. However, the replies have no mention about the retrieval of land from the government and defence departments.
The minister was responding to separate questions asked by PPP’s Shazia Marri and Sher Afzal Marwat of the opposition PTI.
 
 

The minister had been asked to provide the “names of individuals, entities, or organisations currently occupying railways land illegally, with specific locations and extent of each encroachment”.
Besides this, the minister had also been asked to provide a “province-wise bre­ak-up of the encro­ached land as well as the area of the illegally occupied land retrieved by the PR during the last five years”.
The response categorised the occupying individuals or departments into different categories, including “agricultural, commercial, residential, and government/defence departments”.
It says that the largest area of 4,773 acres is under illegal occupation of the individuals or departments related to agriculture, followed by 3,999 acres by the “government/defence departments”.
Moreover, the reply shows that a total of 3,266 acres are under residential use and 712 acres of illegal land is in commercial use.
The government/defence departments have been illegally occupying 2,539 acres in Punjab, 764 acres in Sindh, 349 acres in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 347 acres in Balochistan.
Similarly, the province-wise data of the total land under illegal occupation shows that 5,717 acres are under illegal occupation in Punjab, followed by Sindh (5,590 acres), Balochistan (1,033 acres) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (775 acres).
According to Mr Abbasi, the PR has been successful in retrieving 1,078 acres from the possession of illegal occupants in Punjab and 837 acres in Sindh during the last five years. Moreover, it has retrieved 419 acres in Balochistan and 218 acres in KP.
 
 

The reply, however, shows that when the PR has been successful in getting back some of its encroached land from the possession of individuals and organisations using it for residential, agricultural or commercial use, it has not retrieved even a single acre from the “government/defence departments” in the past five years.
The PR has retrieved 1,594 acres of land which was under agricultural use, 713 acres under commercial use and 268 acres under residential use.
The minister said the PR administration had undertaken several measures over the last three years to retrieve its illegally-occupied land.
“Unauthorised possession of railway land by government departments are being regularised through leases under Railway land policy,” said the minister, adding that commercial encroachments are being reviewed under “Remedial Policy” through lease agreements involving upfront premiums and arrears.
He said any illegal occupation or encroachment was dealt with legal action as per rules and regulations and regular anti-encroachment operations were being carried out to prevent fresh encroachments.
From 2020 to June 2025, he said, a total of 5,182 encroachment cases were reported, with a challan rate of 99.58pc and a conviction rate of 96.71pc.
Out of 5,611 accused, 99.6pc belonged to the general public, with nearly all arrested and only 20 still at large.
He said the PR had launched a comprehensive anti-encroachment campaign in collaboration with provincial government authorities.
The minister claimed that no new encroachment on the PR land had been recorded in the past five years.
Mr Abbasi said the PR had generated a total revenue of Rs13.9 billion from the leasing and licensing of railway land over the last three financial years.
