<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68fec0a87e56b.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951526/a-false-binary' target='_blank'><strong>A false binary</strong></a><br><p>PUBLIC debate on key issues related to politics, law and order, and national security seems to be stuck in a perpetual loop. In the last 10 or so years, we’ve had pretty much the same conversation on what to do with the TLP, what to do with ethnic secessionism, what to do with religious fundamentalism, what to do with the TTP, and what to do with a restive western border. In fact, some of these issues have been debated for much longer than a decade.
The repetitiveness also demonstrates the protracted nature of these problems. Multiethnic societies of all types, especially in the developing world, have struggled with questions of political stability.
Similarly, there is hardly any country where tradition, in name or content, hasn’t been repurposed in modernity for the sake of fundamentalist ideology that explicitly tries to change the nature of culture, law, society and the state, usually in the name of religion. In fact, in nearly every Middle Eastern country for much of the past half a century, the principle opposition to the state was from religious forces, which in some cases even won out (Iran, Syria being prominent examples of the latter).
All of this is to say that the political problems Pakistan faces are simultaneously complex as well as common. Categorical and straightforward solutions are hard to find. Anyone suggesting a quick fix is likely oversimplifying the problem.
But this is not to say that reasoned debate and analysis are not possible. The starting point for any question that (famously) asks ‘what is to be done?’ has to be ‘why does it need to be done?’. Answering this too is not straightforward but at least it gives us a framework that sets a clear target, destination or aspiration.

The debate on what to do with the TLP and TTP is currently caught in a bizarre binary.

For the modern state, legitimate aspirations are usually enshrined in its constitution. Whether or not the state adheres to it is a separate matter, but in the absence of any other categorical answer, there is no other starting point.
The Pakistani Constitution lays out a vision of what the state looks like and what capabilities and rights it wishes to grant its citizens. While it frequently fails at fulfilling this vision, there is a basic republican ideal enshrined within, which recognises citizen equality and the right to life and liberty. The conversation around any political problem needs to use this as its starting premise.
Among the many problems the country is currently dealing with, the TLP and TTP offer two varying dimensions of the same one. The debate on what to do with them is currently caught in a bizarre binary of ‘operations/ violence’ vs ‘talks/ negotiations’. This binary is both meaningless and unproductive.
The ideological vision of both organisations represent a sharp divergence from the ideals put forward by the state itself (through its Constitution). The Taliban seek to disenfranchise half the population and confine them to a heavily regulated private sphere, while the TLP leans on religious ideals to ‘purify’ society from minority and heterodox faith. Both rely on privatised violence and neither is compatible with the constitutional terms laid out by the mainstream political process.
Any negotiation with these organisations shou­­ld never concede on these two basic points — citizenship rights of women and minorities. Granting territorial autonomy in the newly merged districts of ex-Fata, or allowing hate-speech and violence against religious minorities to proceed unencumbered are non-starters. If preventing these require violence, the state will have no option but to rely on it.
But many proponents of the state’s ad hoc strategy seem to stop here. Territorial integrity and the use of violence is put forward as the sole solution, even when the problem emerges from more than just a failure of law and order (in the case of TLP) or a failure of the state to retain its monopoly on legitimate violence (in the case of TTP).
Both organisations are outputs of deeper social and political processes. They exercise a degree of legitimacy, at least among their members, and are connected to wider issues, including but not limited to geopolitical conflicts, globalisation and urb­­anisation, and economic and social inequality.
The conditions that lead to the creation of violent actors cannot be undone merely through violence. But neither can it be undone through sporadic ‘talks’ or ‘negotiations’, which some believe is a ‘political solution’ to the problem. Such a proposal is akin to relegating the entire issue to the domain of conversation; that somehow the other side can be convinced of the futility or error of their violent ways.
 
 

Instead, any solution that is sustainable and lasting has to be one that challenges their societal foundations and legitimacy. This is what would be a truly political solution to the problem. And this is precisely where the state has failed, either through its expediency or through its actions serving other ends.
In merged districts, the state has undermined its own legitimacy by frequently intervening in and suspending the political process. It has quelled alternative and even mainstream popular movements for representation and rights in favour of cultivating strategic assets (that have now proven to be non-strategic liabilities). It has forgone the process of effective state-building and development, choosing instead to see the area from a geopolitical and border-management perspective.
In its ongoing conflict with the popularly elected representatives of KP, the state has created a situation where justifiable use of force is being widely called into question. The entire debate has thus predictably devolved back to the false binary of operation versus negotiation, when neither offers a viable, stand-alone answer to the problem. The real path out of the quagmire is one that restores legitimacy to the state and the political process, but it seems there are no takers for this solution.

Gen Z refers to those born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s. In almost every continent their protests have led to the ouster of governments or put rulers on notice of the price they have to pay for misgovernance. Popular demonstrations led predominantly by youth have been sweeping the world since the ‘Aragalya’ movement in Sri Lanka in 2022. Mass student protests produced the downfall of the long-entrenched regime of Hasina Wajed in Bangladesh in 2024. This September, Gen Z protests forced the resignation of the Nepalese prime minister.
 
 

Earlier this month, youth-led protests helped to topple the government in Madagascar. Gen Z has also been prominent in pro-Palestinian demonstrations across the world to express solidarity with the people of Gaza. In Morocco, Indonesia, the Philippines, Kenya and Peru, Gen Z has taken to the streets to voice its rejection of the political status quo.
What lies behind this global wave of youth discontent? The drivers and triggers of these protests vary as do the underlying causes because the issues and political contexts are different and specific to each country. But there are common features. The protests are principally against the abuse of power, authoritarian governance, incompetent rule, elite privileges, nepotism, corruption, rising inequality and joblessness amid deteriorating economic conditions.
These protests have occurred in countries with youthful populations so demographics is an obvious consequential factor. The use of social media platforms as mobilising avenues is also a common characteristic for a generation that has grown up in the age of communication technology and internet, and is adept at using these tools to spread their message and rally support. Digital protests have played a pivotal role in all Gen Z political movements.

Youth-led protests reflect anger at the abuse of power, corruption, nepotism and inequality.

A familiar target of Gen Z’s anger is what are popularly known as political ‘nepo-babies’ or ‘nepo-kids’. A political nepo-baby is described as a beneficiary of nepotism — the offspring of someone who achieves high political office and ascends to power by virtue of that (a familiar phenomenon in Pakistan). Nepo-babies also includes spouses or siblings, who make it in politics due to family connections. It extends to their children (nepo-kids) who reap benefits from their parents’ position and lead a life of ostentatious luxury. The domination of political systems by dynasties is generally resented by Gen Z as it is the antithesis of meritocracy, which young people aspire to for their societies. A privileged DNA that advantages nepo-babies reinforces political monopolies, that Gen Z take exception to and associate with corruption.
Antipathy towards nepo-babies has been evident in protests in several countries including Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In Nepal, anger against the plush lifestyle of children of political leaders played a key role in revving up Gen Z protests. Hashtag #nepokids in social media found tens of thousands of followers. Posts of privileged offspring of politicians photographed with their luxury cars and designer accessories went viral. This offered a sharp contrast to the living conditions of ordinary Nepalese and contributed to protesters’ fury. In Indonesia too #nepobabies became a social media trend.
The demonstration effect of Gen Z protests has been widely noted. Youth protesters in one country have been inspired by and learnt lessons from others. The revolt against the status quo and demand for change obviously connects protesters in solidarity across different countries. In media interviews, protesters in Nepal, for example, said they were inspired by the youth movement in Bangladesh and demonstrations in Indonesia. Madagascar’s youth looked to Nepal as an example to emulate. Some have called these “contagious uprisings”. The lexicon of young protesters has also been similar.
In Bangladesh the spark that fuelled student-led mass demonstrations was discriminatory quotas for public sector jobs. Although the courts abolished the quotas that did not end the protests. The ‘July uprising’ morphed into a movement against the government and attracted wider public support. Popular discontent with the government had been building up over the years on several counts, including Hasina’s autocratic conduct, corruption and youth unemployment. When a violent crackdown on demonstrators left hundreds dead, it provoked furious protests and led to a nationwide civil disobedience movement. This culminated in the toppling of Hasina Wajed’s government. Student leaders were part of a coalition that influenced the army to name Muhammed Yunus as interim prime minister.
In Nepal, the trigger for Gen Z protests was a social media ban by the government. This was seen as an effort to muzzle freedom of expression and silence dissent. Again, there were deeper causes for discontent — a governing elite out of touch with the people, social inequality, corruption, and deteriorating economic conditions. A crackdown on youth demonstrators, that claimed scores of lives, only intensified the protests. They eventually forced the resignation of prime minister K.P. Sharma Oli.
In Madagascar, water shortages and power cuts were the trigger for the unrest and youth-led protests. But the backdrop was the country’s poverty, public revulsion for nepotism and long-standing grievances with bad governance. Protests led to the fall of the government and a military coup. Morocco, too, has witnessed youth-led protests calling for better healthcare and education. An online group named Gen Z 212, representing a grassroots movement, organised the protests which were driven by resentment against corruption and inequality. This compelled the government to announce social reforms.
The various youth-led protests have produced varying outcomes. They range from the ouster of governments and promise of reforms to military coups. None of the outcomes — thus far — have involved a fundamental break from the status quo or yielded the social changes hoped for by Gen Z protesters. This may be disappointing. But they have put governments on notice about the consequences they face for their misrule, corruption and incompetence. In marginalising established political parties by their protests, Gen Z has also shown how out of touch they are with public grievances and unless they reinvent themselves, they might become politically irrelevant. In any case, all indications are that Gen Z protests will continue as a global trend.

According to official sources, the abducted officials, both from Punjab, were working on the Diamer-Bhasha Dam project.
Police said that on Saturday, their off-day, the officials went to the Gabar area of Thore to buy walnuts, accompanied by six local colleagues. Upon reaching the area, they were intercepted and abducted by militants, who took them into the nearby mountainous region.
An official, requesting anonymity, told Dawn that the area was a known haven for militants.
In August, two Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts personnel were  martyred and another injured when terrorists opened fire on a checkpoint  along the Karakoram Highway (KKH) near Thore.
The official said that local religious leaders had been engaged to negotiate with the abductors for the safe release of the officials.
So far, three rounds of talks have been held, though the militants have made certain demands, which the source declined to disclose.
Jirga held
Meanwhile, local residents of the Thore valley, where the two men resided, held a jirga on Sunday to condemn the abduction and demand strong action against the militants. A large number of people participated in the gathering, which unanimously passed a resolution declaring that the abduction had nothing to do with the people of Thore.
The resolution stated that the incident was an individual act, strongly condemned by the local community. It urged the government and administration not to harass innocent residents, but to arrest those involved and punish them according to the law.
“The government should take strict action against these terrorists so that no one dares to commit such an act in the future,” the resolution said.
It further clarified that the terrorists involved in the abduction have no connection with the people of Thore.

It now remains to be seen how effective and equitable the crackdown proves to be.
The decision, taken during a Friday meeting presided over by the provincial chief executive, entails the introduction of new laws in the province, integrated security measures and the regulation of licensed arms through strict scrutiny of their bearers. Separately, the provincial police chief has announced the Punjab Surrender of Illegal Arms Act, 2025, which is to be implemented in a phased manner.
The first phase will seek the surrender of all illegal weapons, which will then be destroyed in the second phase. Finally, the provincial police force will move to enforce more strictly various arms-related laws. It appears that its recent confrontation with a religio-political party has shaken the Punjab government into action, and it now wishes to reassert the state’s monopoly over violence.
 
 

This is all well and good, and the initiative must be supported if the intention is to secure peace for the province. At the same time, it must be highlighted that Punjab Police itself has recently been at the centre of a serious controversy involving extrajudicial killings. If the bearing of arms is to be strictly regulated, it follows naturally that those who are allowed to carry deadly weapons should be held to a very strict standard of conduct.
The Punjab government and its police force seem keen to enforce strict standards on civilians, as they should, but what seems missing is any standard for self-accountability, even as the number of deadly police ‘encounters’ continues to rise. It is here that the Punjab government must demonstrate that the measures being taken to prevent gun violence are meant for everyone’s protection. It must hold errant officers to account as well.
That said, the other provinces would do well to also pay attention to the problem. Gun-toting guards have become a sought-after symbol of power in urban areas, especially Karachi, and the rapid proliferation of this practice has made it very difficult to ascertain who bears arms rightfully and who bears them just to intimidate others. Ideally, no display of weapons in public should be allowed at all, but given the country’s perennially troubled security environment, armed guards may be necessary in some contexts.
For such cases, apart from extensive checks and scrutiny of arms licences, as well as mandatory psychological examinations of those who seek to bear them, the state must also consider measures like requiring private guards to wear a universally recognisable uniform so that it is easier for the public to feel more at ease among those carrying arms openly. Peaceful citizens should feel safe wherever they go. Much needs to be done to ensure that.

Newsom has made some moves this year to test the waters for a potential presidential run and has gained prominence within his party in confronting Republican President Donald Trump on a range of issues.
“I’m looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment,” Newsom said on the CBS News programme Sunday Morning.
Asked if he was considering a run, Newsom said,  “Yeah, I’d be lying (if I said) otherwise.” Under the US Constitution, Trump is prohibited from running for a third term but has floated the idea regardless, saying earlier this year, “there are methods which you could do it.”
Newsom has pushed California to the forefront of Democratic efforts to redraw congressional maps to counterbalance similar efforts by Republican-led states as the two parties fight for control of the US House of Representatives, a chamber where Republicans now hold a narrow majority, in the 2026 elections.

A swarm of investigators had been mobilised to track down the thieves who robbed the world-renowned museum in broad daylight on Oct 19, making off with jewellery worth an estimated $102 million in just a few minutes.
Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said they had “carried out arrests on Saturday evening”.
“One of the men arrested was about to leave the country” from Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport, Beccuau said.
A source close to the case told AFP the man was about to board a plane for Algeria.
The second man had been detained not long afterward in the Paris region, media reports said.
The two men were taken into police custody on suspicion of organised theft and criminal conspiracy. They could be held up to 96 hours.
Beccuau deplored the public revelation of the arrests, first revealed in media reports, warning they “can only hinder the efforts of the 100 investigators mobilised” in the hunt for the jewels and the perpetrators.
Interior Minister Laurent Nunez also called for confidentiality while congratulating the investigators “who have worked tirelessly”, in a post on X (formerly Twitter).
 






In the heist last Sunday, the robbers clambered up the extendable ladder of a stolen movers’ truck and, using cutting equipment, broke into a first-floor gallery that houses royal gems. They dropped a diamond- and emerald-studded crown as they fled down the ladder and onto scooters, but managed to steal eight other pieces, include an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon Bonaparte gave his wife.

• Official figure shows 1,083 dengue cases across the province in 2025
KARACHI: Keeping in view a big difference between the number of dengue cases reported by the provincial government and the situation on the ground, the Sindh health minister has clarified that official data includes only cases reported from government hospitals.
While the number of cases in Karachi and Hyderabad has increased alarmingly over the past few weeks, the Sindh health department stated in its latest report on Sunday that the total number of confirmed cases has reached 1,083 in 2025.
 
 

However, figures collected recently from the Indus Hospital, Liaquat National Hospital, the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Centre and the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre showed over 4,000 confirmed cases only in Karachi alone. Hyderabad is also facing an alarming situation, where many deaths had been reported. However, the health department has confirmed only two deaths — one in Karachi and another in Hyderabad.
The government has been facing strong criticism over this disparity, with a senior Pakistan Medical Association office-bearer had said that official figures did not represent the ground reality.
Against this backdrop, Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho said in a statement that “if a patient undergoes testing at a private laboratory, that report is not included in our official data”.
She said that the health department maintained “complete records of all confirmed dengue cases received from government hospitals”.
The minister emphasised that the figures released by the health department are verified and authentic.
She urged the public not to believe unverified information or rumours circulating on social media, adding that “data of all patients admitted to hospitals or treated in outpatient departments (OPDs) is properly maintained by the department”.
Govt confirms 439 cases in October
In the report, the health department said that 439 new cases have been reported so far in October, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in 2025 to 1,083.
Karachi Division remains the most affected, with 188 cases reported this month, followed by Hyderabad Division with 154 cases, Mirpu­rkhas 83, Sukkur 10, Shaheed Benazirabad 3, and Larkana Division with one case.
The health minister stated that the Sindh government was working seriously to curb dengue across the province. “Anti-dengue measures, including fumigation, spraying and drainage improvement, have been intensified in all districts.”
 
 

She said deputy commissioners and district health officers had been instructed to ensure that no stagnant water remains, as it serves as a breeding ground for mosquitoes.
She added that equal attention was being given to both urban and rural areas, and separate dengue units have been established in all government hospitals where free treatment and testing facilities are being provided.

• Urges reforms as circular debt rises due to price distortions, market imbalances
ISLAMABAD: Despite population projections of 325 million over the next 15 years and rising overall energy needs, Pakistan may have to put off gas import options owing to declining demand until 2040 and the surplus of liquefied natural gas (LNG) going beyond 2031.
Sources told Dawn that an “all-of-government” approach is under consideration to slow-pedal both pipeline imports — from Turkmenistan and Iran — and readjust LNG supply schedules, while pushing through structural reforms to underpin sustainable growth.
The rethink follows a study by UK-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which projects a three per cent decline in national gas demand during 2025-40 under a business-as-usual scenario, even as total gas availability — including take-or-pay LNG — rises into the early 2030s.
The total gas supply, including that of LNG contracts, has been estimated to peak at five million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) by 2031 from around 3.8mmcfd today, up 31pc.
Demand, on the other hand, is projected to decline by 3.8pc by 2031 and 2.5pc in the subsequent nine years, with a cumulative average of 3pc between now and 2040. This takes into account more than a 12pc fall in the power sector’s gas needs and 2.8pc and 4pc growth in industrial and domestic needs, according to the study reviewed by Dawn.
“A clear pathway to address the structural market issues and towards greater market liberalisation is required as circular debt continues to escalate due to price distortions, inefficient resource allocation and market imbalances,” suggested the consulting firm, pointing out that addressing the root cause of the problem was to fix structural issues that have contributed to the issue of circular debt and to evolve the sector to Pakistan’s needs.
 
 

The reform areas would include constraints to investments for fresh exploration and production, weighted average costing of all gas sources, power sector gas offtake issues, forced curtailment of domestic fields, runaway gas losses, limited gas storage and increasing solarisation.
One of the key takeaways from the study is that Pakistan will not require as much LNG as originally anticipated, even in the near to mid-term, hence the need to develop an LNG import strategy to determine measures to deal with existing contractual arrangements, “assessing all options on the table”.
The low demand and higher import contracts are already taking a heavy toll on exploration and development activities in the country, with long-term adverse consequences — gas import costs in any shape are more than double the local production.
On the other hand, the report anticipated a new wave of LNG supply, indicating pricing cuts as the US and Qatar account for more than half of global LNG supply over the next decade, but Pakistan hardly benefits.
“The new wave of LNG supply will start putting pressure on prices from 2026, with the expectation of long-term prices being set by marginal US LNG cargoes,” it said. Simultaneously, LNG demand will be rising by 3pc over the 2025-40 period from over 400 million tonnes per annum to 675 mpta, mainly due to LNG demand growth in the Asia Pacific.
At present, fossil fuels account for about 88pc of total end-use consumption in Pakistan, of which gas and oil account for around 42pc and 29pc, respectively.
By 2040, while still dominant, consumption of fossil fuels is estimated to decline to about 84pc, with gas share coming down to 30pc and share of oil going up to 34pc, mainly owing to growing demand in the transportation sector.
Primary energy demand is expected to grow from about 88 million tonnes of oil equivalent now to over 99 million tonnes by 2030.
The power sector remains the key problem. Pakistan is going through a paradigm shift, both in terms of a reduction in demand (especially power and captive power plants) and the premise of greater availability of domestic supply.
“Full alignment and commitment of the plan for gas offtake from the power sector is crucial as it will shape how Pakistan’s overall gas demand will evolve,” the report said, but warned that challenges of the exploration and production sector will need to be addressed to realise forecasted supplies, as the LNG glut has forced closure of local gas fields.
It noted that while the country had made progress towards macroeconomic stabilisation, further reforms were required to sustain economic growth as the population was expected to reach 325 million by 2040, at a steady growth of 2pc and a young demographic, maintaining its position among the top five most populous countries.
Between 2025-40, economic activity is expected to grow with a long-term GDP compound annual growth rate of 3.7pc. Economic activity is expected to continue recovering, as the economy benefits from the availability of imported inputs, easing domestic supply chain disruptions and lower inflation,” it said.
The study forecast the industrial production achieving an annual growth rate of 4pc over the next 15 years. It also noted that while Pakistan’s growing population offered potential demographic dividend, the country faced significant challenges in harnessing this potential due to existing resource constraints, infrastructure deficits and employment issues. The population growth will nevertheless increase energy demand in residential sectors for heating and cooking and power generation to meet rising electricity needs and transportation.

According to sources, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has recently approved Rano’s shifting to the IWMB’s rehab as well as the release of Rs2.5 million funds required for the task, which would be carried out in two stages.
 
 

In the first phase, the female brown bear would be transferred to the rehab and in the second, she would be relocated to her natural range in Gilgit-Baltistan — a key recommendation of the Sindh Wildlife Department (SWD) presented during the case’s second hearing that got the court’s nod.
The sources said the hearings also saw the SWD raising objections to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) suggestion of inviting the international animal welfare organisation Four Paws for Rano’s transfer to Isla­mabad. The court, they said, agreed with the SWD’s proposal to do the job.

CM approves funds to eventually shift female brown bear to her natural habitat in Gilgit-Baltistan region

A recent official letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, states, “Considering that Islamabad doesn’t fall within the natural climatic range of the species, and subject of the consent of the Forest and Wildlife Department, Government of Gilgit-Baltistan, the animal shall be subsequently relocated to its natural range in Gilgit-Baltistan with coordination of Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Gover­nment of Pakistan.”
It further adds: “Since the species has remained in captivity for an extended period, its natural survival instincts have diminished; hence it’s deemed unfit for release into the wild. A properly sized and secured enclosure at a suitable site within the Gilgit-Baltistan region is required.
 
 

“Members of civil society and welfare organisations are encouraged to contribute towards the construction of such an enclosure on land provided by the concerned department. The committee notified shall take steps in this regard in consultation with the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Government of Pakistan,” it says.
The members of the committee notified by the government to facilitate Rano’s relocation include World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan president Nadeem Khalid, Azhar Khan representing the Field Sports and Conservation Society, certified wildlife healer Ariana Noor Magsi, journalist Naziha Syed, Deputy Director of Karachi zoo Abida Rias, Karachi zoo vet Dr Amir Ismail Rizvi and Yusra Sami Askari (member of Sindh Council of Conservation of Wildlife).
 
 

“In recent years, the department has successfully transferred over a dozen bears to the sanctuary in Balk­assar (Punjab) after rescuing them from illegal confinement and abuse,” shared Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar, part of the committee and the focal person for coordination in Rano’s relocation.
The department, he emphasised, would take care of all aspects of animal welfare to ensure Rano’s smooth relocation. “We are looking at it as a high-priority task and right now are busy finalising transport arrangements.”
It might be recalled that the SHC has ordered the KMC to relocate brown bear Rano, a critically endangered species in zoo captivity since 2017, to the sanctuary managed by the IWMB within two days.
The SHC also ruled that the transfer of the female Himalayan bear must take place through air cargo under the supervision of a senior official of the wildlife department and directed the KMC to extend cooperation and ensure the shifting.
The orders came on a petition raising concern over Rano’s condition.

• PM Shehbaz forms panel for talks with PPP; PML-N regional president rules out plan to join AJK set-up
ISLAMABAD: The PPP see­med to be in a comfortable position to take the helm in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) after as many as 10 lawmakers from the AJK Legislative Assembly joined the party.
The PPP now appears to be ready to install its own man to lead the regional government in light of the imminent exit of the incumbent prime minister, Anwarul Haq, through a no-confidence motion or resignation.
The plan to form the regional government was approved by President Asif Ali Zardari, who met the AJK lawmakers on Saturday, and the decision seemingly led to lawmakers from the ‘forward bloc’ joining the PPP, a coalition partner of the PML-N in the Centre.
If things go according to the PPP’s plan, AJK will have its fourth premier in the four-and-a-half years of the assembly.
After his meeting with the AJK lawmakers, President Zardari also spoke with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to take him into confidence over his party’s decision and strategy to form a government in Azad Kashmir.
The premier subsequently formed a three-member committee, comprising Ahsan Iqbal, Rana Sanaullah, and Amir Muqam, to discuss matters regarding the change of government in Kashmir. The PML-N team in talks with the PPP is expected to seek a say in administrative and financial matters in Azad Kashmir.
On the other hand, the regional leadership of the PML-N said it would not become part of the upcoming government, citing previous failed experiments of the coalition government. AJK PML-N President Shah Ghulam Qadir told Dawn that they would sit on the opposition benches.
 
 

In light of a possible vote against the AJK PM, he said the PML-N had not even promised to vote against Mr Haq if a no-confidence motion against him was tabled in the house. “The experiment of the coalition government has failed and we have decided to sit on opposition benches,” he remarked.
A PPP insider, however, said the party could send the AJK premier packing even without the support of the PML-N, which has nine members in the house. He said the party had the support of at least 30 members in the house — more than the required 27 to oust the AJK PM. He said Sardar Atiq of the Muslim Conference and Hasan Ibrahim of the Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party will also support the no-trust motion against PM Haq.
Lawmakers join PPP
In their separate meetings with Faryal Talpur, who heads the PPP’s women wing and the AJK political affairs wing, at Zardari House in Islamabad, Ch Yasir Sultan, (minister) Sardar Muhammad Hussain, (minister) Ch Muhammad Ikhlaq, (minister) Ch Arshad Hussain, (minister), and Ch Muhammad Rasheed (minister) announced their decision to join the PPP.
Similarly, AJK Minister for Higher Education Zafar Iqbal Malik also met Ms Talpur and formally announced his decision to join the PPP.
Another group of ministers from AJK, including Faheem Akhtar Rabbani, Muhammad Asim Sharif, Ch Muhammad Akbar, and Abdul Majid Khan, met Faryal Talpur to announce their decision to join the PPP. Senior PPP leader Ch. Muhammad Riaz was present at all these meetings.
Numbers game
The AJK Legislative Assembly has 52 members and to achieve a simple majority, a party requires the support of 27 members. Presently, the PPP has 17 seats, the PML-N nine, the PTI four, and the Muslim Conference and Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party each have one member. The PPP’s ranks swelled to 27 after ten more lawmakers from the forward bloc joined it on Sunday. The new entrants announced their decision a day after Mr Zardari met his party lawmakers from AJK and reaffirmed his commitment to the politics of reconciliation and tolerance. The Saturday meeting had reviewed governance challenges in AJK, the evolving political landscape, and the party’s strategy for forming a new government in the region.
Sources said President Zardari briefed the AJK parliamentary party on the decision to take charge of the AJK government, calling it an “extraordinary and challenging step” for the PPP. “The PPP is assuming responsibility in difficult circumstances, but I am confident the party will deliver in AJK just as it has in the past,” Mr Zardari was quoted as saying.
Sources said Ch Yaseen is likely to be nominated for the coveted slot. However, President Asif Zardari is expected to finalise the party’s nominee for the AJK premiership after further consultations.
With almost six months remaining in the assembly’s term, this will be the fourth prime minister in AJK in as many years. In August 2021, the PTI picked Abdul Qayyum Niazi as the premier after he was named for the slot by then-PM Imran Khan.
Mr Niazi secured 35 votes against the joint opposition candidate Latif Akbar, who bagged only 15 votes, in the 53-seat house. After nine months, Mr Niazi resigned from the position and was replaced by PTI regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas.
In April 2023, Mr Ilyas was disqualified by the full court bench of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) High Court from being a member of the legislative assembly for contempt. He was then replaced by Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, who is likely to be replaced by a PPP candidate after spending over two years in power.

Within days, K-Electric’s share price slid, foreign sponsors weighed international arbitration and analysts warned that a once-profitable utility could be pushed deep into the red, imperilling Karachi’s power supply and perhaps the government’s privatisation plans.
At the heart of the shock is a sharp cut in K-Electric’s multi-year tariff. Last week the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) reduced the rate by Rs7.6 per unit, from Rs39.97 to Rs32.37, effectively overturning its own May determination made after more than two years of consultations and public hearings.
The revision followed review motions filed by the Ministry of Energy and others, who argued for parity with models elsewhere in the power sector after negotiations with private producers. The government has defended the review as a landmark step promoting fairness and regulatory consistency for Karachi’s consumers.
The previous tariff for K-Electric was almost 40 per cent higher than the national average of Rs28 per unit projected for 2025-26 for state-owned distribution companies (Discos). The federal government covered the difference by providing subsidies to K-Electric’s consumers.
To bring in the Titanic analogy again, K-Electric is like a multi-storey cruise ship in which different parts are vertically integrated. And just like those travelling in Titanic, its customers are divided into many categories — with varying degrees of access to electricity depending on their affordability.
Now that this giant ship has hit an iceberg, its financiers are wondering if they could survive the blow.
K-Electric is Pakistan’s only privatised and foreign-owned electricity utility, with investors from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait holding 66.4pc stakes in it.
The abrupt tariff change reinforces the fears of these investors about regulatory inconsistency and political interference — risks that analysts say could deter future investment and further complicate the government’s plans to privatise its loss-making state-owned power distribution companies.
Worryingly, from a Pakistani perspective, these fears are a major reason why K-Electric’s foreign owners are threatening to take the government to some international litigation forum.
K-Electric’s shares plunged on the stock exchange following the tariff cut, as investors sold heavily. Analysts warn that the tariff revision, regulatory uncertainty and threat of legal action could hurt the company’s finances and cast doubt on the future of power-sector privatisation.
Market and sector analysts warn the new tariff leaves KE with little or no profit margin over the seven-year control period to 2030.
 
 

“It is clear that the company cannot survive on this tariff,” says Shankar Talreja of Topline Securities, flagging potential “going concern” risks.
Muhammad Shahid, an analyst at AKD Securities, calls it a “loss-making” tariff.
“Nepra’s revised tariff determination introduces significant alterations across K-Electric’s generation, transmission, distribution and supply functions,” he says.
Mr Shahid notes that K-Electric’s Rs4 billion profit in FY24 under the earlier tariff approval could flip to a Rs70-80bn loss once accounts are restated. Mr Talreja also puts the likely hit to the company at around Rs70bn.
KE’s foreign shareholders — Saudi Arabia’s Al Jomaih Group and Kuwait’s Denham Investments — estimate annual losses could reach Rs100bn during 2024-30.
“It places the company in a very delicate position. How things unfold in the coming years will largely depend on how K-Electric manages to navigate this situation,” Mr Shahid argues.
Tighter benchmarks
The revised tariff determination makes significant adjustments in K-Electric’s ROE, T&D and theft loss benchmarks, as well as its bill recovery assumptions.
While each one rupee cut in K-Electric’s tariff translates into roughly Rs15bn in annual losses for the company, energy sector analysts estimate that this will be compounded by the fact that the government is also reducing its subsidy payments to K-Electric by Rs7.6 per unit.
The government is justifying this subsidy removal by stating that it will alleviate a financial burden of nearly Rs700bn over seven years from the federal budget, shifting it to the company.
Though the revised tariff has retained the dollar-based return on K-Electric’s generation business, Nepra has converted its dollar-indexed transmission and distribution tariff into rupees, substantially reducing its return on equity.
Nepra has also terminated the company’s four aging gas-fired power plants citing redundancy and altered the capacity purchase price formula for the remaining two facilities.
Now, only 35pc of capacity payments will be guaranteed, with the remaining dispatch shifted from a take-or-pay to a take-and-pay basis — similar to the arrangement with independent power producers (IPPs).
Under the revised tariff, the company’s recovery benchmark has been raised to 100pc from around 93.3pc, with write-off claims capped at 3.5pc. This too will be reduced to 1pc by 2030.
This means that if K-Electric is supposed to recover Rs100 from its customers as invoiced bills but manages to collect only Rs91.5 (the actual recovery rate in FY24), it can now claim only Rs3.5 under this mechanism to write off its bad debts — or unrecovered bills — and that too after meeting the required criteria and providing evidence of strenuous recovery efforts.
The remaining Rs5 will be recorded as the company’s loss. In effect, the criteria for claiming write-offs are so stringent that the company will hardly be able to avail any, forcing it to absorb the entire shortfall in bill recovery on its books.
“The write-off criteria require the company to produce irrefutable, documented evidence of efforts made to recover dues from defaulters, a near-impossible feat for the company,” Mr Talreja says.
Likewise, the T&D loss benchmarks have been further tightened: the distribution loss target has been reduced to 9pc from 13.9pc, comprising 8pc technical losses and 1pc allowance for law and order issues, with a cumulative reduction of 0.97pc planned through FY30. Transmission losses have been revised to 0.75pc from 1.3pc, cutting the law and order margin to 1pc from 3.39pc in FY24.
Mr Shahid notes that these alterations drastically shift the government’s annual subsidy burden of Rs100-150bn onto the utility’s own pocket.
However, it’s not just K-Electric that stands to lose from the blow. The new tariff determination revises down the reference fuel cost component for FY24 from Rs15.99 per unit to Rs14.50 per unit, identifying a Rs28 billion shortfall under the previous benchmark.
Karachi-based business leader Rehan Javed says this shortfall, according to the new tariff, will be recovered from K-Electric’s consumers. In addition, the revision in the reference fuel cost component for FY25 will place an additional burden of Rs24bn on consumers.
“Since the company is in no position to absorb this staggering burden of Rs52bn on units sold during FY24 and FY25, it will inevitably pass it on to consumers. So, contrary to popular perception, the revised tariff isn’t ‘neutral’ for consumers,” Mr Javed says.
The revised determination itself acknowledges this outcome — a point also endorsed by Mr Shahid of AKD Securities — unless the government agrees to absorb the cost to provide relief to Karachi’s power consumers.
‘Unusual’ reversal
K-Electric has remained tight-lipped because of the sensitivity of the issue. “You know who is behind this, and I don’t want my software updated,” one senior official quipped with a smile in a pointed reference to past incidents in which politicians, journalists and businessmen were allegedly abducted by unidentified individuals and released only after agreeing to fall in line or stay silent.
The only official comment came via a video message from CEO Moonis Alvi, who warned that Nepra’s recent decision on the company’s tariff would have serious financial consequences that could affect its operations. However, he maintained that the utility would “pursue the route that would be the best possible one for the people of Karachi”.
“Such a reversal after a detailed two-and-a-half-year consultation and analysis is unusual and could impact the company’s investment, planning and long-term sustainability,” he cautioned.
The tariff decision lands after two other blows to sentiment. A recent attempt by investor Zia Chishty to gain control of K-Electric’s parent, KES Power Ltd, through offshore entities collapsed amid disclosure concerns, which K-Electric’s foreign sponsors termed an “orchestrated takeover attempt”. Separately, Shanghai Electric Power withdrew its long-pending $1.77bn plan to acquire K-Electric, citing regulatory bottlenecks and a deteriorating business environment.
In their dispute letter, K-Electric’s foreign shareholders seek $2bn in compensation for alleged breaches of investment protections, including obstruction of transactions, interference in regulatory processes and failure to protect against unlawful third-party actions.
They claim cumulative losses of at least $2bn from the stalled Shanghai Electric sale, depreciation in market capitalisation, higher debt costs and reputational damage. They also say the shift to rupee-based ROE and tighter loss benchmarks could cost nearly Rs100bn annually, threatening the company’s financial viability.
Nepra’s credibility
Critics argue that by revising K-Electric’s tariff, Nepra has inflicted serious damage on its own credibility. The reversal, widely viewed as the result of government pressure, raises fundamental questions about the regulator’s autonomy, consistency and competence.
It also carries troubling implications for the government’s plan to privatise state-owned distribution companies, as investors observe how Pakistan treats its only existing private utility.
“Either the regulator was wrong when it announced the original tariff or it is wrong now,” said a former Nepra chairman, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It is a combination of incompetence and pressure.”
Mr Javed warns K-Electric may now curtail purchases from the national grid to limit losses, risking longer outages for homes and industry.
He notes K-Electric currently imports about 2,000MW from the grid, helping utilise surplus generation and reduce capacity charges on idle plants. If the utility cuts purchases due to financial strain, surplus power will remain under-used despite discounted rates being offered to spur demand.
“The real question now is: who will buy the Discos under such conditions? This situation raises serious concerns for foreign investors, particularly the Saudis, who are exploring opportunities in Pakistan,” he warns.
He further notes that the actual tariff for Discos is actually around Rs39 per unit, not Rs34, since the government absorbs Rs500-600bn in losses each year through the tariff differential subsidy, which ultimately feeds into the circular debt.
“The irony is that while Karachi is not contributing to the circular debt, its citizens are still being forced to pay around Rs40bn annually as a debt surcharge of Rs3.5 per unit,” he argues.
The surcharge, imposed uniformly across the country, is meant to help the government service the mounting circular debt accumulated by the state-owned distribution companies. However, since K-Electric’s consumers do not add to this debt, the charge effectively penalises Karachi’s electricity users for inefficiencies and financial leakages elsewhere in the national grid.
“While Nepra is fixing the subsidy problem for the government, it should also have taken this surcharge out of K-Electric consumers,” he says.
Official viewpoint
The government has described Nepra’s review of K-Electric’s multi-year tariff as a landmark decision that “promotes fairness and regulatory consistency for Karachi’s consumers”.
According to the Power Division, the review eliminated tariff components that conflicted with national regulatory standards — including foreign currency-linked returns and excessive loss allowances — and converted the ROE from a dollar to a rupee basis.
It added that the rationalisation of T&D losses and working capital adjustments was intended to correct structural distortions without undermining legitimate cost recovery.
The Ministry of Energy had challenged the tariff determined for K-Electric, expressing strong reservations over what it termed an unjustified financial burden on both the national exchequer and power consumers.
It argued that the tariff approved for electricity supplied to K-Electric from the national grid was significantly higher than that applied to other distribution companies, warning that this disparity could cost the federal budget around Rs59bn over the next two years.
The petition also objected to the inclusion of recovery losses in K-Electric’s tariff, contending that it would shift an additional Rs200bn onto consumers over the seven-year control period. It further criticised the approval of a dollar-linked return on equity, which was expected to add another Rs37bn to the burden during the tariff period. Concerns were likewise raised about capacity payments to the company’s power plants, projected to exceed Rs82bn.
However, industry observers argue that the rollback undermines investor confidence and sacrifices regulatory stability for short-term fiscal relief, sending mixed signals as Pakistan seeks private capital in its power sector.
They warn that policy volatility will further erode interest in Disco privatisations and that the K-Electric’s case now serves as a cautionary tale of commercial decisions being vulnerable to bureaucratic and political manoeuvring rather than transparent regulatory principles.</p><small>2025-10-27 03:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/27074612618e47c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951378/the-crystal-ice-trails-leads-to-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>The crystal ice trails leads to Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>In a span of 48 hours the Pakistan Navy’s ship Yarmook intercepted two dhow sailing boats in the Arabian Sea and confiscated nearly two and a half tons of crystal methamphetamine, known popularly as ‘Ice’, and about 50kg of cocaine — one of the largest maritime drug busts in history. Altogether that is a market value of around $972 million; only slightly less than the $1billion dollar tranche Pakistan received from the International Monetary Fund in May.
The seizure is curious for two reasons: firstly, the Arabian Sea is not traditionally known as a major drug route; that distinction belongs to Southeast Asian waters and of course the Atlantic and Pacific routes that Central and South American gangs use to funnel drugs to North America and Europe.
Secondly, seizing such a large quantity of ice is something that we would imagine taking place in Southeast Asia, where the lower Mekong countries, in particular Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar, have historically been the epicenters of crystal meth production and trafficking.
 
 

In the past 10 years, meth seizures in Southeast Asia have skyrocketed. At the same time, we have also seen our part of the world emerge onto the map as not only a region where meth use in increasing, but also as a trafficking route and, indeed, a production hub.

Meth from the neighboring country’s lucrative drug production line finds its way to Pakistan, which has become a trafficking route and consumer

In this decade, meth use in Pakistan has reached epidemic proportions, replacing heroin as the drug of choice of hardcore addicts. Proof of this can be found in the increase in meth-related crime and the testimony of drug rehab centres. Today, we find that Ice use is most prevalent in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and in Sindh, drug rehab centres tell us that as many as 70 per cent of their clients are now Ice addicts.
Pakistan isn’t just a consumer, it’s also a stop on the trafficking route. Proof of this was found in November 2020 when a joint operation by the coast guards and the army found over 100kg of ice hidden in the hills of Pasni, on the Balochistan coast; it was stored there to be picked up and loaded onto boats to be smuggled overseas. A year later, the navy and coast guards intercepted a sailing boat off the same coast and nabbed over 200kg of Ice this time, along with 227kg heroin. These are just two such cases.
If they manage to evade detection, the smugglers might make it to Sri Lanka where, in 2020, two trawlers carrying 100kg of Ice and 400kg of heroin were intercepted in what was then billed as Sri Lanka’s ‘biggest ever’ drug bust, valued at $33m. Just four years later that record was broken when another ship carrying 400kg of Ice was intercepted.
So now we know something of where ice is being used in this region and how it is trafficked. But where is it coming from? The answer may surprise you: it’s Afghanistan.
 
 

Don’t take my word for it; the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime raised the alarm in 2023, pointing to Afghanistan as an emerging producer of methamphetamine and noting that meth linked to Afghanistan has been reportedly apprehended “from places as far away as the European Union, the Near and Middle East, South-east Asia and Eastern Africa.” This year the International Narcotics Control Board echoed the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNOD) by saying that the increase in meth production in Afghanistan poses ‘serious challenges’ for neighbouring countries, of which Pakistan, unfortunately, is one.

In November 2020, a joint operation by the coast guards and the army found over 100kg of Ice hidden in the hills of Pasni, on the Balochistan coast there to be smuggled overseas

This begs the question: how do they know this meth was from Afghanistan? To determine that we must first understand how meth is made: crystal methamphetamine production is entirely chemical and requires, among other ingredients, a steady supply of Ephedrine or pseudoephedrine.
These chemicals are used in the legitimate manufacture of pharmaceuticals, but given that Afghanistan has no pharmaceutical or chemical industries to speak of, how are they making so much meth? The answer lies in a local herb named ephedra that can also be distilled to produce ephedrine.
 
 

We first heard about this in the mainstream media from journalist Lynzy Billing who interviewed the then-head of Afghanistan’s counter narcotics police, Khalid Nabizada who explained, “International buyers know it can be made easily and cheaply here, the chemicals used are not controlled, and this ephedra plant is everywhere,” he said.
Experimentations with ephedra reportedly began as early as 2015, and just three years later, became the choice method of production. The Taliban seem to have taken full advantage of this shift, with the Foreign Policy magazine noting in a 2023 article, “After cornering the market on heroin [the Taliban] pivoted to a quicker and more profitable alternative,” namely, Meth.
In fact, the lack of governance (and official patronage) mean that Afghan meth, while comparable in quality, is one-tenth the price of its Southeast Asian equivalent. It’s a lucrative trade and it is estimated that the meth trade in the Bakwa district in Farah province alone was worth $240m in 2021.
And that’s how we know the meth being trafficked and caught is from Afghanistan as the UNODC noted earlier; chemical testings show that they were synthesised by using ephedra and not other, more traditional, methods.
This then adds a new dimension to Pakistan’s already fraught relations with Afghanistan and also adds another factor to why the Afghan Taliban are so insistent that free movement across the Pak-Afghan border be allowed, even going so far as to object to Pakistan’s fencing of the border. As they say, you have to follow the money.

• Supply may dip next year as flood impacts on Punjab’s cultivation manifest
KARACHI: After a sharp rise in tomato prices, reaching Rs600–700 per kilogramme, rates are now declining due to steady imports from Iran — further influenced by limited local supplies from Swat and Sindh.
But if things remain the same, the country is likely to face a shortage of tomatoes in the spring season next year, potentially triggering another cycle of price hikes.
According to traders, floods and heavy rains in Punjab have reportedly washed away the tomato crop. However, they ruled out any serious impact on the Sindh crop, as markets in Karachi have begun seeing arrivals of the new crop from the province, although the majority consists of unripe tomatoes.
Traders are seen offering Iranian tomatoes at Rs200 per kg in Karachi, providing some breathing space to the consumers, who paid up to Rs560 per kg last week in the city.
Local tomato crops in all provinces are produced throughout the year. However, there are often instances of supply imbalances in certain provinces when a crop season ends. At times, only one province produces enough tomatoes to supply the other three. In such cases, the only option to bridge the demand-supply gap is to import tomatoes from Iran and Afghanistan.
The closure of the Pak-Afghan border for over two weeks, combined with years-long suspension of trade with India, has left Iran as the only viable option to meet domestic demand.
However, he added that the supply of tomatoes will decline from March to April next year.
‘Supply to dip’
Syed Khaliq Shah of the Ravi Sabzi Mandi Lahore said the supply of new tomatoes from some areas of Sindh was under way in the last few days, but consumers will see improved supplies during November to February.
He explained that crops in Punjab usually find their way to the market in the middle of the year but the recent rains and floods have destroyed tomatoes.
“The supply of new crops from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will get start from May to August followed by new crops from Balochistan after March. However, negligible arrivals have started from some areas of Balochistan like Quetta.”
Mr Shah said rains had damaged the crop in Swat, causing a drop in the arrival of trucks to 20-30 daily in Punjab instead of 150-200 vehicles on normal days.
He added that Iran’s tomatoes (a pack of 8-9kgs) is available at Rs1,000-1,500 in Lahore against Rs2,500-4,000 a few days ago. While Swat’s tomatoes in a 15-16kg pack are priced at Rs2,500-4,000 compared to Rs 4,500-6,000.
Punjab is currently dependent on tomato shipments from Swat and Iran, with around 70–90 trucks from Iran arriving in the province daily. The journey from Iran takes five to six days, whereas tomatoes from Afghanistan arrive in just two days.
Waheed Ahmed, patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Fruits and Vegetables Dealers, Merchants, Exporters, and Importers Association, said the rains and floods have severely damaged the tomato crop in Punjab, as well as in parts of Balochistan and Sindh. Additionally, supplies from Afghanistan have been suspended due to the tense border situation between the two neighbouring countries.
In a crisis situation, he recalled that a significant quantity of tomatoes used to be imported from India, but these imports were discontinued after a disease emerged in 2016–2017. At the same time, excessive imports from neighbouring countries discouraged local farmers from cultivating more tomatoes.
Given the dollar shortage and low transportation costs, importing tomatoes from neighbouring countries such as India, Iran, and Afghanistan could help stabilise prices, rather than letting local rates collapse. There is also potential to source tomatoes from Commonwealth countries, depending on the border situation and the availability of a smooth supply chain, he added.
“The government can reduce or eliminate duties and taxes on tomato imports to prevent further crises,” he suggested, recalling that Pakistan had previously imported onions from its neighbours to bridge supply gaps caused by limited local production.
Mohammad Rafiq Gujjar, chairman of the Masha Khor Welfare Association at Karachi’s Sabzi Mandi, said that September and October are always crucial months, as the local tomato crop is not yet ready and demand is met through imports. “Unfortunately, floods have caused significant damage in Punjab, while the Sindh crop appears relatively safe due to the low intensity of floodwaters reaching the region from Punjab,” he added.

There is little surprise in this; it has become an annual ritual. In the past, the FBR has continued granting extensions month after month throughout the year.
That the first extension came just hours before the original deadline expired, despite repeated warnings from the Board that no such relief would be offered, is equally unsurprising. In a routine explanation, the FBR said the decision to extend the deadline was made in response to requests from various trade bodies, tax bar associations, and members of the general public.
The extensions are granted in accordance with the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, which authorises the Board to extend the deadline for filing returns when taxpayers face hardships in meeting the prescribed requirements. This provision ensures that taxpayers are not penalised for delays beyond their control.
 
 

However, the matter is not that straightforward. The rationale behind granting extensions is ostensibly to enhance tax compliance by accommodating genuine difficulties. Yet the results consistently prove otherwise. For many observers, this represents a weakening of the FBR’s authority and its ability to enforce compliance. Past experience demonstrates that extensions fail to increase the number of tax filers.

A study finds that when deadlines are extended, individuals delay filing by about 88pc while unincorporated businesses delay by 70pc of the extension period

A study by Muhammad Khudadad Chatta, examining the effects of extending tax filing deadlines in Pakistan, a low-compliance developing country with a narrow tax base, provides empirical evidence of this failure. Using tax return data from 2007–2017 and official records of deadline extensions, the study finds that when deadlines are extended, individuals delay filing by about 88 per cent while unincorporated businesses delay by 70pc of the extension period.
More significantly, extensions actually reduce final compliance rates. The analysis demonstrates that additional time does not motivate more taxpayers to file; rather, these encourage procrastination and undermine compliance. The study concludes that deadline extensions fail to broaden the tax net and instead impose significant costs, such as delayed revenue collection and diminished respect for official deadlines.
FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial, who states that he is personally opposed to extending tax filing deadlines, attributes the need for extensions to taxpayers’ procrastination. “Human beings are slaves of their habits; we only act when the deadline is about to expire,” he remarks. “When everyone starts filing in the last few days, the system inevitably crashes. To prevent this and ensure that everyone gets an equal opportunity to file their returns, we are left with no choice but to grant extensions.”
Procrastination is certainly a factor behind the repeated requests from tax bar associations and trade bodies for more time. However, the FBR is often compelled to grant extensions mainly because of serious technical glitches in its back-end IT systems and the practical difficulties taxpayers encounter in complying with sudden structural and content revisions in the income tax return forms — changes that are frequently introduced during the filing period itself.
Leading tax lawyer Dr Ikramul Haq attributes the FBR’s recurring extensions of the tax filing deadline to the government’s habit of making frequent, sweeping changes to tax laws during the filing period itself. “This does not happen anywhere else in the world,” he observed, noting that other countries maintain stable and easy tax policies that enable taxpayers to file their returns without difficulty.

“The law requires the FBR’s online portal to be ready by July 1, in practice, however, the Iris portal is often unavailable even as the Sept 30 deadline approaches”

“The law requires the FBR’s online portal to be ready by July 1, the start of the new fiscal year. In practice, however, the Iris portal and the updated tax return format are often unavailable even as the Sept 30 deadline approaches,” Dr Haq explained. “This delay undermines public trust in the system and creates serious compliance problems. When everyone rushes to file in the last week or so, the portal crashes under the load of heavy traffic.”
Dr Haq underscored that the wholesale changes introduced by the FBR are possible only because parliament has delegated its legislative powers to the executive. “In which democratic country do parliamentarians hand over their lawmaking powers to the executive? It’s unthinkable,” he remarks, arguing that such abdication reflects lawmakers’ lack of interest in improving the tax system and compliance.
 
 

Since the FBR can make whatever changes it deems fit through executive orders, he adds, the tax return format and requirements are altered almost every year, creating compliance challenges. This situation stands in sharp contrast to many other countries where taxpayers receive pre-filled returns that require only review and minor adjustments by them.
Another major issue, he says, is the disconnect between the FBR’s policy, operations, and IT wings. “PRAL [Pakistan Revenue Automation Pvt Ltd], which manages the FBR’s digital systems, also functions independently of the organisation,” he notes. “As a result, there are too many operational bottlenecks and coordination problems in implementing policy decisions.”
He illustrated his point with a recent case involving Mansoor Beg, who complained to the FBR about serious calculation errors in the Iris system. Mr Beg pointed out that the new online tax return format wrongly computed the surcharge on AOP, or association of persons, shares under Section 4AB of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. The system, he said, first calculated tax on gross income, allowed a tax credit for AOP, and then separately imposed a 10pc surcharge on the gross income by effectively taxing the AOP share twice.
According to him, the FBR’s system restricted the online return fields, leaving taxpayers no choice but to file returns under the erroneous formula. When the FBR failed to respond, he filed a complaint with the Federal Tax Ombudsman (FTO), arguing that by limiting the return fields, the FBR was denying taxpayers their right to appeal against an unlawful interpretation of the law.
The FBR admitted its omissions during the course of the hearing and said it had prepared a Change Request Form to make the necessary amendment in the Iris system. However, the system is still not functioning properly. The FBR admitted to the error and said it was being corrected.
The FTO directed that the mistake be rectified and a compliance report submitted by October 22. Yet, as of Friday, the error still persisted. The FBR’s Director General (IT) informed the FTO on Thursday that PRAL had yet to fix the issue. “This”, Dr Haq concludes, “shows how dysfunctional and inefficient the country’s tax machinery has become”.

• Pakistani officials share photo, documentary evidence of terror groups operating from Afghan territory
• Amid mixed signals from Taliban power centres in Kabul & Kandahar, Islamabad refuses suggestion to directly negotiate with TTP
ISLAMABAD: Stalemate persisted on Sunday at the Pakistan-Afghanistan talks in Istanbul, with the Afghan Taliban delegation appearing reluctant to take verifiable action against sanctuaries of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and other militant groups operating from Afghan soil.
This was the second day of the dialogue, which stretched into Sunday after both sides failed to find common ground on the issue of ending terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan.
After nearly nine hours of intense discussions late into the night, Pakistani security officials said their delegation had presented its “final position” to the Afghan side, insisting that the Taliban regime must take “concrete and verifiable steps to eliminate cross-border terrorism from and inside Afghanistan”.
“Pakistan has made it clear that the ongoing patronage of terrorists by the Afghan Taliban is unacceptable,” the senior security official said.
Taliban responses to Pakistani assertions about terrorism emanating from Afghan soil were rejected as “illogical and opposite to ground realities”.
In a thinly veiled reference to India, which has recently deepened ties with Kabul, the security official said the Taliban delegation “appeared to be following someone else’s agenda”.
This stance seemed to be vindicated when, in the midst of the Istanbul process, Indian forces apparently violated the cea­sefire in the Leepa Sector of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. While there was no official word on losses, locals reported an intense exchange of fire on Sunday evening.
The official cautioned that this position of the Taliban “was not in the interest of Afghanistan, Pakistan, or the region”.
The source added that any further progress in the talks would depend on the “positive attitude of the Afghan Taliban”.
Earlier in the day, the Afghan delegation presented a written response to Pakistan’s demands submitted the previous day, after which Pakistan shared its counter-response.
A second session subsequently began after midday, in the presence of senior Turkish and Qatari mediators.
There was initial optimism following the exchange of documents and the start of a second session that had not been planned earlier. However, after protracted negotiations, the optimism faded as the Taliban delegation refused to provide any written assurances.
The Afghan representatives, who were receiving directions from Kabul and Kandahar, appeared to lack the mandate to make decisions, officials said. Their reluctance to provide written commitments was interpreted by the Pakistani side as a sign of unwillingness to act against the TTP and other militant groups with hideouts in Afghanistan.
During the two days of talks, Pakistan presented photographic and documentary evidence of TTP, BLA, and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory, including details of their leadership and movements. The Pakistani delegation also shared photographs and Afghan identity documents of infiltrators captured during recent border incidents, insiders said.
At one stage, the Afghan Taliban offered to bring the TTP to the table for direct talks with Pakistani authorities. Islamabad, however, categorically refused, reiterating that it would not negotiate with a terrorist group and that it was the Taliban’s responsibility to end their patronage of the TTP.
Echoing Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s earlier remarks, Pakistani negotiators told the Afghan side that Islamabad was ready to pay any price to neutralise the threat emanating from Afghan soil for the safety of its people. They cautioned that the Afghan population would suffer because of the Taliban regime’s continued intransigence.
 
 

Pakistan’s core demand throughout the talks remained decisive action against terrorist proxies operating from Afghanistan.
While the dialogue continued in Istanbul, Pakistan’s military reported major infiltration attempts across the Pak-Afghan border, further casting doubt on the Taliban’s intentions.
The two attempts, occurring in Kurram and North Waziristan, were framed by ISPR as occurring “while delegations of Pakistan and Afghanistan are engaged in talks in Türkiye”.
“This casts doubts on the intentions of the Interim Afghan government regarding its commitment to addressing terrorism emanating from its soil,” the military noted.
The two-day talks followed the Oct 19 Doha ceasefire, mediated by Qatar, which ended a week of deadly border clashes. Türkiye hosted the current round as part of its expanded mediation role, while Qatar acted as guarantor of the truce and facilitator of dialogue.
The Pakistani delegation comprised senior security and intelligence officials, including representatives from the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the Directorate of Military Operations, and the Foreign Office.
The Afghan side was led by Deputy Interior Minister Mawlawi Rahmatullah Najeeb and included senior Taliban figures such as Anas Haqqani, Suhail Shaheen, Noorur Rahman Nusrat, and Abdul Qahar Balkhi.
Diplomatic sources said mediators were attempting to keep both sides engaged to prevent a complete breakdown in communication.

• Says Pakistan also plans to connect with Kazakhstan via Chaman under new agreement
• Rohri-Karachi track rehabilitation to start in July next year; upgraded Shalimar Express to begin running from 7th           
LAHORE: The government has decided to revive the Islamabad–Tehran–Istanbul (ITI) freight train from Dec­e­mber 31, subject to the finalis­a­tion of ongoing discussions reg­a­rding tradable goods and the resolution of administrative, log­istical, and operational issues.
The government is also set to sign an agreement soon to connect Pakistan with Kazakhstan through a rail network via Chaman, according to Federal Minister for Railways Muh­a­mmad Hanif Abbasi.
“We wanted to revive the ITI train earlier, but it was delayed because of the war in the region involving Israel. Now, we plan to resume ITI train operations from December, depending on the finalisation of trade arrangements — what will be exported and imported between Turkiye and Pakistan. The trade ministers are working on it,” Mr Abb­asi told journalists at a press conference at the Pakistan Railways (PR) Headquarters on Sunday.
“There are some other issues as well, which will also be add­ressed. However, our main focus is to resume the ITI train service from December 31,” he added.
The ITI train service was revived on December 21, 2021, after nearly a decade, with trains reaching Turkiye in Jan­u­ary 2022. It operated until Aug­ust that year, with goods transfe­rred to wagons compatible with Iranian and Turkish rail gauges.
The ITI operation was suspended again due to various administrative and operational issues. Although the government planned to revive it in 2023, the effort was hindered by the devastating floods that year, despite the restoration of the rail link between Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan in April 2023.
Additionally, the main Turkish freight forwarder associated with the ITI operations refused to work with Pakistani freight companies due to delayed payments, but later agreed to resume operations directly with Pakistan Railways, the concerned PR officials showed little interest in resolving key issues. This delay hampered efforts to strengthen bilateral trade with Turkiye.
Major issues included a lack of service quality — such as delays in departures and arrivals, inefficient loading and unloading, slow customs clearance, and weak security measures. The high tariff and freight charges were also considered unaffordable for the business community. Consequently, operations slowed significantly in July 2022 and came to a complete halt in August after floods in Balochistan and Sindh submerged railway tracks and caused the collapse of the 140-year-old Hirok Bridge, the only link connecting Quetta with Dozan and beyond.
Speaking about regional connectivity, the minister said that an agreement with Uzbekistan had already been signed, while another with Kazakhstan would soon follow. “We have a rail track up to Chaman, from where we can access Kazakhstan, other Central Asian states, Russia, and eventually Europe,” he said.
Mr Abbasi revealed that the rehabilitation of the 500-kilometre Rohri–Karachi track is being planned with Asian Deve­l­o­pment Bank funding. Inve­stments are also being arranged for the Rohri–Peshawar section. “The groundbreaking for the Rohri–Karachi track rehabilitation is expected to take place in July next year,” he added.
He said the Karachi Railway Station had been modernised and expanded to double the size of the Lahore Station. The upgraded Shalimar Express is expected to be launched on November 7, followed by the Awam, Allama Iqbal, and Rehman Baba Express trains in the coming months.
Mr Abbasi said PR had earned an additional Rs4.5bn through the outsourcing of lugg­age vans and express cargo trains.

Since Hesson took over the role in June, Babar hasn’t featured for Pakistan in T20Is with the national side playing series against Bangladesh, the West Indies and a tri-nation series followed by the Asia Cup during that period.
Hesson had cited the right-hander’s low strike-rate as the reason for his absence. But Babar’s selection for the series, which starts in Rawalpindi on Tuesday raised suggested a change of mind for the coach before the New Zealander clarified it.
 


“I certainly endorse his selection,” Hesson said of Babar while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of Pakistan’s training session at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. “We’ve sent him (Fakhar) back to first-class cricket after a conversation with him.
“He wanted to focus on improving his technique for one-day cricket, so we gave him a bit of a break from T20s. That’s created an opportunity for another top-order player.”
Hesson confirmed that Babar will take the number three spot instead of the batter’s preferred opening position, where he flourished for Pakistan for a substantial period before eventually falling in form and then out of favour.
 






The coach, however, has expectations from Babar to make a strong comeback and suggested he saw him in Pakistan’s plans for the T20 World Cup, which is set to be held in February-March next year in India and Sri Lanka.
“It’s a great chance to have Babar back,” said the coach. “He’s likely to bat at number three, a role I’m confident he’ll perform well in.
“It also gives our squad some flexibility ahead of the [T20] World Cup.”
‘Haris needs to work’
Babar’s unexpected return also coincided with the axing of wicket-keeper-batter Mohammad Haris from the Pakistan squad even after he received ample backing from the team management across Hesson’s tenure so far.
The 24-year-old proved his mettle with a century against Bangladesh back in June but gradually lost form amid frequent change of batting positions.
Hesson believed Haris needed to go back to the drawing board to fix his issues.
“Haris has had a number of opportunities recently, and he’d be the first to admit he hasn’t made the most of them,” he said. “But he’s still young and developing, so I wouldn’t say his career is over.
 






“He needs to work on his decision-making with the bat. Even in domestic T20s, he averages around 17, similar to international cricket, so that’s an area for improvement.”
Haris has been replaced by Usman Khan — who last year gave up on a career in the United Arab Emirates to play for Pakistan before being eventually dropped. He emerged out of nowhere and Hesson said he sees the right-hander, who keeps wickets as well, as a good player of spin.
“We see our wicket-keeper batting more through the middle rather than at the top, especially with spin being such a big factor in Sri Lanka during the World Cup. That’s why Usman has been given this opportunity.”</p><small>2025-10-26 18:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26171453453b1cf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951365/security-forces-kill-25-terrorists-in-two-separate-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 25 terrorists in two separate KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces foiled two major terrorist infiltration attempts from Afghanistan on 24-25 October 2025, killing 25 militants, including four suicide bombers, and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives in separate operations in North Waziristan and Kurram districts, the military’s media wing said on Sunday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), on 24-25 October 2025, security forces detected movements of two large groups of khwarij attempting to infiltrate Pakistan from Afghanistan near Ghaki in Kurram District and Spinwam in North Waziristan District.
“Own troops effectively engaged these groups of khwarij [and] as a result of precise and skilful engagements, fifteen khwarij, including four suicide bombers belonging to [the] Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in Spinwam, North Waziristan District,” the statement said.
It added that another ten infiltrating khwarij were killed in Ghaki, Kurram District, and a large cache of weapons, ammunition, and explosives was recovered from the slain militants.
Fitna al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement added that despite successfully thwarting the infiltration attempt, five soldiers sacrificed their lives during the intense firefights.
The fallen included Havildar Manzoor Hussain (35, District Ghizar), Sepoy Nauman Ilyas Kiyani (23, District Poonch), Sepoy Muhammad Adil (24, District Kasur), Sepoy Shah Jehan (25, District Vehari), and Sepoy Ali Asghar (25, District Pak Pattan), who embraced martyrdom while fighting gallantly.
“It is significant to point out that these infiltration attempts by Fitna al Khwarij are being carried out at a time when delegations of Pakistan and Afghanistan are engaged in talks in Türkiye; casting doubts on the intentions of the Interim Afghan Government with regards to addressing the issue of terrorism emanating from its soil,” the statement said.
It added that Pakistan had consistently been asking the Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border and is expected to fulfil its obligations of the Doha Agreement and deny the use of Afghan soil by Khwarij against Pakistan.
“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” it said.
Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country, it said.
President Asif Zardari lauded the security forces for rendering the infiltration attempts by the terrorists unsuccessful, according to a statement on the PPP’s X account.
He also paid tributes to the martyred “who laid down their live while defending the country”, adding that the “nefarious designs of Fitna-al-Khawarij and their Indian patrons would never be successful”.
 






According to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the five personnel who embraced martyrdom while “bravely fighting” the terrorists.
He prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the martyrs and expressed condolences with their families, the Radio Pakistan report said, adding that PM Shehbaz further stated that the entire nation “salutes the security forces for their courage and sacrifices”.
He reaffirmed the government’s resolve to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned TTP’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Last week, security forces neutralised 34 “India-ba­cked” terrorists during multiple operations across KP.</p><small>2025-10-26 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26234647beb0001.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951386/us-china-reach-rare-earths-tariff-pause-for-trump-and-xi-to-consider-us-officials' target='_blank'><strong>US, China reach rare earths, tariff pause for Trump and Xi to consider: US officials</strong></a><br><p>Top Chinese and US economic officials on Sunday hashed out the framework of a trade deal for US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to decide on later this week that would pause steeper American tariffs and Chinese rare earths export controls, US officials said.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the talks on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur had eliminated the threat of Trump’s 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports starting November 1. Bessent said he expects China to delay implementation of its rare earth minerals and magnets licensing regime by a year while the policy is reconsidered.
Chinese officials were more circumspect about the talks and offered no details about the outcome of the meetings.
Trump and Xi are due to meet on Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea to sign off on the terms. While the White House has officially announced the highly anticipated Trump-Xi talks, China has yet to confirm that the two leaders will meet.
“I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday,” Bessent told reporters after he and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang for a fifth round of in-person discussions since May.
Bessent said he anticipates that a tariff truce with China will be extended beyond its November 10 expiration date, and that China will revive substantial purchases of US soybeans after buying none in September in favour of soybeans from Brazil and Argentina.
 
 

US soybean farmers “will feel very good about what’s going on both for this season and the coming seasons for several years” once the deal’s terms are announced, Bessent told the ABC programme ‘This Week’.
Greer told the ‘Fox News Sunday’ programme that both sides agreed to pause some punitive actions and found “a path forward where we can have more access to rare earths from China, we can try to balance out our trade deficit with sales from the United States”.
Chinese caution
China’s Li Chenggang said the two sides reached a “preliminary consensus” and will next go through their respective internal approval processes.
“The US position has been tough,” Li said. “We have experienced very intense consultations and engaged in constructive exchanges in exploring solutions and arrangements to address these concerns.”
Trump arrived in Malaysia on Sunday for a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, his first stop in a five-day Asia tour that is expected to culminate in a face-to-face with Xi in South Korea on Thursday.
After the talks, Trump struck a positive tone, saying: “I think we’re going to have a deal with China”.
Trump threatened new 100pc tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade curbs starting on November 1, in retaliation for China’s expanded export controls on rare earth magnets and minerals.
China and the United States rolled back most of their triple-digit tariffs on each other’s goods under a trade truce due to expire on November 10.
The US and Chinese officials said that in addition to rare earths, they discussed trade expansion, the US fentanyl crisis, US port entrance fees and the transfer of TikTok to US ownership control.
Bessent told NBC’s “Meet the Press” programme that the two sides have to iron out details of the TikTok deal, allowing Trump and Xi to “consummate the transaction” in South Korea.
Talking points
On the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit, Trump hinted at possible meetings with Xi in China and the United States.
“We’ve agreed to meet. We’re going to meet them later in China, and we’re going to meet in the US, in either Washington or at Mar-a-Lago,” Trump said.
Among Trump’s talking points with Xi are Chinese purchases of US soybeans, concerns around democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, and the release of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai.
The detention of the founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily has become the most high-profile example of China’s crackdown on rights in Hong Kong.
Trump also said that he will seek China’s help in US dealings with Moscow, as Russia’s war in Ukraine grinds on.
Fragile truce
Tensions between the world’s two largest economies flared in the past few weeks as a delicate trade truce, reached after a first round of trade talks in Geneva in May and extended in August, failed to prevent the United States and China from hitting each other with more sanctions, export curbs and threats of stronger retaliatory measures.
 
 

China’s expanded controls of rare earths exports have caused a global shortage. That has prompted the United States to consider a block on software-powered exports to China, from laptops to jet engines, according to a Reuters report.</p><small>2025-10-26 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2623354732d14b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951389/sindh-home-minister-orders-judicial-inquiry-into-custodial-death-of-teenager-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh home minister orders judicial inquiry into custodial death of teenager in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar on Sunday ordered a judicial inquiry into the custodial death of a teenager in Karachi due to alleged torture.
The teenager, 18-year-old Muhammad Irfan, was arrested by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of police along with three of his friends on October 22.
SIU Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Amjad Ahmed Shaikh told Dawn that they were taken to the SIU/ CIA Centre in Saddar at around 5:30pm the same day, and 15 minutes later, the health condition of Irfan deteriorated. He was taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival, he said.
The police claimed that the boy died of a heart attack, while his relatives allege that he was tortured to death. Preliminary findings from his post-mortem examination — conducted in the presence of a judicial magistrate at JPMC —  suggested the presence of multiple injuries on the teenager’s body, according to doctors and the police.
In a statement issued today, the spokesperson for the home ministry said, “The home minister has directed the additional chief secretary (home) to initiate the process of judicial inquiry into the case.”
It has been directed that “a thorough forensic investigation of the incident be carried out, and whosoever is involved should be taken to task”.
“The case should be taken to a logical conclusion with the help of modern techniques,” the statement said.
“I feel sorry that the child has died in the custody of the police,” Lanjar was quoted as saying.
Protest
On Saturday, relatives of the deceased and others staged a sit-in at an Edhi morgue at Sohrab Goth while carrying the coffin of the victim, whose body was kept at the morgue, and blocked the main road.
The hours-long protest ended on Saturday night after assurances by “higher police authorities” that justice would be provided to them, said senior journalist Shahid Jatoi, who was one of the protesters.
He said Irfan’s coffin was taken to his native village, Bait Ahmed, in Ahmedpur East, Bahawalpur district, on Saturday night, where “thousands of people” attended his funeral prayer.
He said that “Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) and Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) SIU spoke to the relatives and promised that after receipt of the final report of the doctors, section 302 (intentional murder) would be incorporated in the first information report (FIR) of the case”.
FIR
An FIR of the incident was registered at the Saddar Police Station on the complaint of SIU and Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Station House Officer (SHO) Mumtaz Ahmed under Sections 34 (common intention) and 319 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against seven nominated SIU/CIA officers.
The FIR said that four people were detained by the SIU police party from Lilly Bridge near Cantonment Station in the limits of Frere Police Station on October 22.
The FIR added that they were detained on information provided by a special informant, a case was registered against the four on the same day, and they were handed over to an assistant sub-inspector (ASI).
SHO Ahmed said he came to know through the investigating officer (IO) of the case that two other assistant sub-inspectors had continued interrogating Irfan when his health deteriorated suddenly and he became unconscious.
The SHO added that the IO took Irfan to the hospital without informing him. SHO Ahmed said the SIU personnel had committed “negligence” during Irfan’s arrest and custody. He said it transpired that the registration of the case against the deceased was also “dubious” and the entire matter raised suspicion.
On Saturday, Karachi police arrested two cops who were named in the FIR. Earlier, on Friday, seven policemen were suspended after the incident came to light.</p><small>2025-10-26 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26150104e68c1c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951357/mother-of-slain-journalist-arshad-sharif-passes-away' target='_blank'><strong>Mother of slain journalist Arshad Sharif passes away</strong></a><br><p>Riffat Ara Alvi, the mother of slain journalist Arshad Sharif, passed away on Sunday, according to her family.
Arshad, a prominent journalist who was awarded the Pride of Performance in 2019 by then-President Arif Alvi, was shot dead in Kenya on October 24, 2022. Politicians and media bodies demanded a probe into his death, but the lack of progress in the investigation has been decried by the Supreme Court and media.
“Arshad Sharif’s mother, who was demanding justice for her son, has passed away,” the deceased journalist’s wife, Javeria Siddique, posted on X today.
 






In a subsequent post, she said Riffat’s funeral prayers would be held today at the “H-11 graveyard [in] Islamabad at 9pm”.
 






Siddique, herself a journalist, in 2023 published a piece for Dawn.com on her husband’s death in which she called for an “independent, impartial, and immediate investigation” to ensure justice for Sharif.
“Everyone is watching, and yet, justice only seems to become more and more elusive,” she said in the article.
Condolences pour in
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed grief over the passing of Alvi.
“I am saddened by the passing of Arshad Sharif’s mother and pray for the forgiveness of the deceased,” a post on PPP Media Cell’s X account quoted Bilawal as saying.
 






Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari rued that Alvi “kept asking for justice till the very end but to no avail”.
“Cruel apathy of the judiciary,” she commented in a post on X.

In a letter dated October 23, the KP government asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs were disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province.
Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed.
Rejecting these “claims”, Bokhari clarified that the inter-provincial transportation of flour was “continuing transparently through official permits, ensuring a clear and traceable record of all consignments being transported out of the province”, the statement carried by APP said.
Criticising the KP government, she said that “if the province’s flour demand has exceeded its production capacity, the provincial government should release its own stored wheat or procure it” from the Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation (Passco).
“Punjab cannot compromise the right of its people to affordable flour for the sake of another [party’s] political theatrics,” she said.
The minister claimed that over 200 flour mills in KP were currently non-operational and said the province’s chief executive should “focus on reviving these mills instead of staging protests outside Adiala Jail” — an apparent jibe at KP CM Sohail Afridi, who had staged a sit-in outside the prison after he was not allowed to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
In May this year, the federal food minister had informed the National Assembly that the Passco was being abolished. The policy has since been reversed under a national wheat policy, but procurement modalities remain contested.
It was also said under the policy that there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat.
Reiterating in her statement that there was “no ban” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat or flour, she said under Article 18 of the Constitution and relevant laws, permits and digital monitoring had been made mandatory to prevent hoarding and profiteering.
The minister further said that the welfare of the people of Punjab remained her government’s top priority and  “the availability and affordability of flour for every citizen have been fully ensured”.
“This pro-people style of governance is what some elements find hard to digest,” she claimed.
Bokhari added that the Punjab government was “utilising taxpayer’s money to provide subsidised wheat to ensure public relief and avert any potential crisis during the dry months”.
“Punjab currently possesses 0.885 million metric tons of wheat reserves, valued at around Rs100 billion. This reflects the farsighted and organised policies of [Punjab] Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.”
Bokhari further stated that flour mills were being supplied wheat at Rs 3,000 per maund (40 kilogrammes) to “maintain steady availability and price stability in the market”.
Wheat restrictions
In the aftermath of floods, the Punjab government began tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage.
The restrictions have also drawn sharp criticism from politicians and flour millers who argue that it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement.
While Punjab officials have de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. Critics, however, argued that these mea­sures are against the spirit of a deregulated market.
In the KP govt’s Oct 23 letter, the province’s food department had said that the inter-provincial wheat restrictions were “inconsistent” with Article 151(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees “freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country”.
“Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, being a wheat-deficient province, heavily relies on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its daily wheat requirement of approximately 14,500 metric tonnes,” the letter read.
“The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,“ it added.</p><small>2025-10-26 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/262049377d7e91b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951381/multan-sultans-saga-a-test-case-for-pcb-chairman-mohsin-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Multan Sultans saga a test case for PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>There is no precedent for it. But, there is never really a precedent for any development in Pakistan cricket.
The happenings of Pakistan cricket outsmart one’s wildest fantasies and the current controversy that the country’s cricketing landscape sees itself embroiled in is one such.
Since it has emerged that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) served a legal notice to Ali Tareen for the breach of the franchise agreement last month, the conflict between the two has played out publicly.
While Tareen, the owner of Multan Sultans, has doubled down his criticism on the social media, the board has dropped subtle hints on the path it plans to venture.
 






Sunday brought more developments as Tareen accused the PSL management for leaking the legal notice to “their favoured media”.
“For the record, we received the legal notice on 12th Sept,” the post said. “Our legal team sent them a detailed reply.
Since then, we had chosen to stay silent and not make the issue public. Because nothing could be more damaging to the league than this.
“But then, the PSL management decided to leak parts of the notice to their favoured media last week.
Perhaps they mistook our restraint for weakness. And one torn notice later, we are where we are. Lets (sic) see where it all ends up.”
An hour later, the PCB, in an update about the meeting between Mohsin Naqvi, its chairperson, and Ernst&Young, the independent audit firm hired for the valuation of the six franchises and the PSL’s brand value, reiterated that it would extend the franchise renewal offer to only those franchisees who have been in compliance with the franchise agreement.
 






Sources tell Dawn that Tareen has sought intervention of politicians and fellow franchisees to mediate with the PCB.
Tareen has been directing his criticism towards PCB in the lead-up to this year’s PSL. He, primarily, reiterated complaints of the ordinary fans by highlighting the substandard fan experience in stadia around the country and criticised the board for the lack of innovation in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), which he claimed resulted in the decline of the league.
He blamed the board for being content with “mediocrity” and questioned the credentials and ability of the PCB staffers.
With the PCB’s contracts with the six PSL franchisees, title and other sponsors, and broadcast right holders lapsing this year, Tareen’s frequent criticism of the league worried the PCB about its implications.
The PCB suspected that Tareen desired to sabotage the league to adversely affect the valuation process and bring down the market value of his franchise — which the board has stated in its legal notice to Tareen.
 






The board officials also lamented that rather than contributing in the PSL governing council meetings during which Multan Sultans owner and representatives remained silent, Tareen resorted to attack the decisions on the social media – again, something that the PCB wrote in its notice.
Tareen took over as the sole owner of Multan Sultans late 2023 after the passing of his uncle, Alamgir Tareen.
He and his uncle had bid USD6.3million — almost the double of the reserve price set by the PCB — for the team in 2019 after the PCB had terminated the franchise agreement with Schon Properties Broker LLC for their failure to meet the financial obligations. (PCB has pegged dollar at PKR170 for the annual franchise fee).
The PCB contemplated sending a legal notice to Tareen during this year’s tournament — which it also mentioned in the notice — but refrained from doing so, fearing it may harm the league’s image.
Tareen responded to the legal notice on 2 October, but the chances of a reconciliation seem bleak after he ripped the PCB’s legal notice on camera.
His act has publicly challenged PCB’s stature as the game’s governing body in the country and pushed its chief into a corner. There are many within and outside the country who are anticipating the response.
Naqvi is embroiled in a conflict with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the Asia Cup silverware matter.
The matter will rear its head once again next month when cricket chiefs gather for an International Cricket Council (ICC) conclave.
The BCCI will be keen to observe how Naqvi responds to the pressure publicly exerted by one of the PSL franchise owners back home and the outcome of this saga will provide a template on how far they can stretch Naqvi.
Similarly, it will also lay marker for other franchisees and stakeholders of the game within Pakistan.
It is unprecedented for an owner of a PSL team to launch searing diatribes against the PCB. And, the outcome of this stand-off will go on to lengthen the list of unprecedented developments in Pakistan cricket.</p><small>2025-10-26 15:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26195755bf31813.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951342/trump-oversees-trade-deal-flurry-on-first-asian-stop' target='_blank'><strong>Trump oversees trade deal flurry on first Asian stop</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump hit the ground running on the first leg of his Asian tour on Sunday, announcing a slew of trade agreements in Malaysia.
Within six hours of landing in Kuala Lumpur for the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Trump announced trade deals with four countries, met regional leaders and held talks with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who said their teams would immediately start tariff discussions.
Trump also said he was confident of hammering out a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of an expected meeting on Thursday, as top trade officials from both sides met for a second day in Kuala Lumpur and agreed on a framework for a trade agreement.
Talks to de-escalate trade war
On arriving in Malaysia, Trump was greeted by Malaysia’s premier and a troupe of ceremonial dancers, stopping briefly on the red carpet to dance with performers.

As he mingled with other leaders, US and Chinese negotiators met on the sidelines to avert further escalations in a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
US negotiators said the meeting had built a “successful framework” ahead of expected talks between Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi, in South Korea.
“I think we’re going to have a deal with China,” Trump told reporters, while Beijing’s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said a preliminary consensus had been reached after “very intense consultations”.
Both sides are looking to avert an escalation of their trade war after Trump threatened new 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade curbs starting on November 1, in retaliation for China’s expanded export controls on rare earths.
Within hours of landing in Malaysia, Trump and the White House had announced six trade agreements with four countries, some unexpected, including deals involving critical minerals with Thailand and Malaysia, amid competing efforts from Beijing in the rapidly growing sector.
Malaysia agreed to refrain from banning or imposing quotas on exports to the United States of critical minerals or rare earth elements, the countries said. They did not specify whether Malaysia’s pledge applied to raw or processed rare earths.
Trump also announced detailed frameworks towards wider trade deals with Cambodia and Thailand, while the White House said an agreement had been reached with Vietnam to allow exporters in both countries “unprecedented” access to each other’s markets.
‘United States is with you 100pc’
The US would maintain a tariff rate of 19pc on most exports from Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia, while a 20pc rate on Vietnam will also be retained, the White House said. In all the agreements, those tariffs could be eliminated on certain products.
Addressing leaders of one of the regions hardest hit by tariffs, Trump said: “Our message to the nations of Southeast Asia is that the United States is with you 100pc and we intend to be a strong partner for many generations.”
Brazil’s Lula will aim to lower 50pc tariffs imposed by Washington on Brazilian goods amid simmering trade tensions. In a post on X, after meeting with Trum,p he said teams from both countries “will meet immediately to advance the search for solutions”.
 






Speaking alongside Lula, Trump expressed confidence in making “some pretty good deals for both countries”.
A meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was not on the cards after talks between the neighbours came to an abrupt end. Trump said on Saturday he was increasing tariffs on Canada by an additional 10pc “above what they’re paying now”.
East Timor, ASEAN’s newest member
Asia’s youngest nation, East Timor, became the 11th member of the ASEAN bloc on Sunday after a 14-year wait, a landmark for a former Portuguese colony that won full independence in 2002 following an at-times bloody quarter-century occupation by neighbour Indonesia.
Also known as Timor-Leste, the country of 1.4 million people is among Asia’s poorest and hopes to see gains from integrating its fledgling economy, which at about $2 billion represents only a tiny fraction of ASEAN’s collective $3.8 trillion GDP.
“This is not only a dream realised, but a powerful affirmation of our journey,” its Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao said.</p><small>2025-10-26 15:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/261856501db81ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951373/kp-cm-afridi-vows-to-strengthen-police-to-restore-peace-in-province' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi vows to strengthen police to restore peace in province</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday vowed to strengthen the police and provide them with modern equipment to restore peace in the province.
The remarks come a week after the newly elected CM blamed the “flawed policy” of the federal government for the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province.
Addressing a rally in KP’s Karak district today, he said, “We are investing in efforts to increase our police capacity and provide them with modern equipment,” promising to strengthen counter-terrorism efforts in the province.
 






“My purpose is to bring peace to KP in line with the vision of Imran Khan,” he said, announcing plans to invest in establishing a “special branch to enhance intelligence” in the province.
He detailed that the KP government had “ordered 70 bulletproof cars for police, out of which they had received 40 so far.”
Two days ago, CM Afridi signed the summary for the purchase of the vehicles after a row with the Centre over allegedly faulty vehicles.
A statement issued by the CM Office said Afridi had signed the summary for the purchase four armoured personnel carriers, 39 single-cabin, 34 double-cabin pick-ups, 15 pick-ups, two Revo pick-up trucks and seven other vehicles.
It quoted the CM as saying that the provision of bulletproof vehicles at a cost of Rs1.89 billion was already under way.
‘Centre building a narrative’
At the rally today, the newly-elected CM assailed the federal government for “meting out stepmotherly treatment to KP”.
“KP has been left behind because of it,” he remarked.
He said that during the merger of districts comprising erstwhile Fata into KP, the people of the region were promised Rs100 billion. But, “they never received it”, he claimed.
On the matter of the National Finance Commission (NFC), the KP CM expressed disappointment that an NFC meeting still had not been called and vowed to bring up the matter of KP’s share post-Fata merger at the session.
At a rally in Khyber yesterday, CM KP made similar remarks, claiming that the federal government owed the province Rs550 billion, and called for immediate reconvention of the NFC meeting.
CM Afridi further alleged today that the Centre was “building a narrative” against him, owing to my middle-class and tribal area background“.
“Top ministers have made accusations against me,” he said, reiterating that he was “a soldier of Imran Khan,” and had not said anything unpleasant in return.
He recalled that “when I went to Adiala jail to meet Imran Khan, I received a call from the prime minister, who congratulated me and I requested him to arrange a meeting with Khan … to which he said I will ask and then tell.”
“Who is he going to ask exactly?” the CM questioned.
On the matter of KP’s natural resources, the chief minister said he stood with the people of KP, stressing that “only the people of KP have a right to decide where their resources should go”.</p><small>2025-10-26 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/261911193fc09dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951364/pm-shehbaz-announces-reopening-of-new-gas-connections-to-domestic-consumers' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz announces reopening of new gas connections to domestic consumers</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced on Sunday the reopening of new gas connections after a ban of nearly four years, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported.
His announcement comes less than two months after the federal cabinet decided in September to lift the ban on domestic gas connections and supply regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG).
Speaking about the cabinet’s decision in a post-meeting press conference, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, flanked by Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik, had said PM Shehbaz decided to lift the ban on new gas connections imposed in 2021, addressing a longstanding public demand.
Addressing a ceremony related to the resumption of RLNG connections in Islamabad today, the premier reiterated that the government’s decision was in response to the “long-standing public demand”.
“In 2022, there was immense public pressure for [new] gas connections but the government was facing challenges,” Radio Pakistan quoted him as saying.
But, “with this landmark decision, the public will now be able to access affordable and quality fuel,” he added.
“Now, RLNG will be supplied throughout the country to a large number of applicants,” a report by state-run APP quoted him as saying.
According to the reports, a video message by Malik was also played during today’s ceremony, in which the petroleum minister said the government was committed to providing maximum facilities to the public.
He added that the Sui Northern Gas Company had brought down its line losses to 4.93 per cent while earning a profit of Rs29 billion in the previous fiscal year.</p><small>2025-10-26 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/261637051b03c7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951363/undefeated-pakistan-crush-china-to-make-volleyball-semis-at-asian-youth-games' target='_blank'><strong>Undefeated Pakistan crush China to make volleyball semis at Asian Youth Games</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan extended their winning streak to advance to the semi-finals of the boys volleyball event after defeating China in straight sets in the quarter-finals at the Asian Youth Games on Sunday.

Pakistan had earlier opened their campaign with a straight-sets victory over Mongolia before defeating hosts Bahrain 3-0 in their Group ‘A’ match. Pakistan then downed Uzebikstan in similar fashion on Thursday in their first Group ‘E’ match of the 1-8 Classification Round.
The team then defeated Saudi Arabia 3-1 on Friday to move top of the group, winning with scores of 25-16, 25-21, 23-25, 26-24. Khizar Hayat, Mohammad Yahya and Mohammad Anas were among the standout performers of the day.
 
 

Pakistan will now play the semi finals on October 27 (Monday) at 9pm local time (11pm PKT).
Pakistan sent a 53-member contingent for the ongoing games being held from Oct 22 to 31, bagging its first medal with a bronze in the boys kabaddi event.
In a post on social media, the Pakistan Volleyball Federation said the “proud achievement” was made possible by Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) Director General Muhammad Yasir Pirzada, “who organised the national training camp for the team’s preparation for this prestigious event.”

He made these remarks during a press briefing on Saturday, during which he was asked whether India had raised any concerns about the “stronger relationship” between the US and Pakistan.
“They really haven’t — I mean, we know they’re concerned for obvious reasons because of the tensions that have existed between Pakistan and India historically.  But, I think they have to understand, we have to have relations with a lot of different countries,” he said, according to a transcript of the briefing on the State Department’s website.
He continued, “We see an opportunity to expand our strategic relationship with Pakistan, and I think we’ve made — that’s our job, is to try to figure out how many countries we can find how we can work with on things of common interest.
“So, I think the Indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature.  Look, they have some relationships with countries that we don’t have relationships with.  So, it’s part of a mature, pragmatic foreign policy.  I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India, which is deep, historic, and important.”
Rubio was also asked whether the recent improvement in ties between the US and Pakistan was based on Islamabad’s “recognition of the US role and President [Donald Trump’s] role in resolving and in avoiding potential war between India and Pakistan?”
“What do you think was the turning point?” a reporter asked him, according to the transcript on the State Department’s website.
To that, Rubio began his response with, “I think they appreciated.”
He then went on to say that “anytime you work with someone, you get to know them and you interact with them, and so I do think there was some sense of happiness about it.  But even before that conflict had started, I had already reached out to them and said look, we are interested in rebuilding an alliance, a strategic partnership with you.  We think there are things we can work together with them on”.
The secretary of state reiterated that the US was “fully aware of the challenges with regards to India and everything else, but our job is to try to create opportunities for partnerships with countries where it’s possible.  And we’ve had a long history of partnering with Pakistan on counterterror and things of that nature.  We’d like to expand it beyond that, if possible, understanding that there’ll be some difficulties and some challenges”.
“But I think it’s a very encouraging thing that that relationship has strengthened the way that it has, and I don’t think it comes at the expense, or instead of a good relationship with India, or anybody else for that matter,” he added.
Earlier this month, a Dawn report highlighted that Pakistan was entering a new phase in its economic and strategic partnership with the US, as the two allies move closer to implementing a deal for the export of rare earth minerals.
The improvement in ties and newfound partnership between the two sides was particularly seen after Pakistan acknowledged US President Donald Trump’s role in resolving a four-day escalation between nuclear powers Islamabad and New Delhi.
Following the development, Pakistan’s chief of army staff, Field Marshal Asim Munir, had gone to Washington on a five-day official visit in June. During the visit, he had met with President Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
During a subsequent visit to the US in August, Field Marshal Munir had termed his second trip to the US in a span of just a month and a half a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad.
In September, he accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in August, during which regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters, were discussed.
Meanwhile, Trump has thanked both PM Shehbaz and “my favourite” Field Marshal Munir for their efforts in securing the ceasefire deal in Gaza.
Earlier today, he called PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir “great people” while stating that he would get the recent conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan “solved very quickly”.
Separately, American metals company US Strategic Metals (USSM) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Pakistan in September to invest rou­ghly $500 million to establish mineral processing and development facilities in the country. It rece­ntly dispatched its first consignment of mineral samples to the US to advance the deal.
The sample shipment, prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation, includes antimony, copper concentrate, and rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium.
In a statement, USSM described the delivery as “a milestone in the Pakistan–US strategic partnership,” noting that the MoU “establishes a roadmap for cooperation across the entire mineral value chain — from exploration and processing to the establishment of refineries inside Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-10-26 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26140120e4ca667.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951352/trump-says-will-get-pak-afghan-conflict-solved-very-quickly' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says will get Pak-Afghan conflict ‘solved very quickly’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he would get the conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan “solved very quickly”, calling Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and COAS Field Marshal Asim Munir “great people”.
Tensions between Islamabad and Kabul flared up earlier this month over accusations of terrorism, as border clashes killed 23 Pakistani troops as well as 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists after an attack by Kabul, which it claimed was retaliation for Islamabad conducting air strikes in its territory. A first round of talks in Doha last weekend led to a ceasefire agreement, with both governments seeking to firm up the agreement in more talks yesterday.
Trump, who was previously involved in brokering a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in May of this year as well as a peace deal between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas, arrived today in Malaysia to attend a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Kuala Lumpur, while also co-signing a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia.
Addressing the border dispute on the sidelines of an Asean summit today, Trump referred to it as “one of eight wars that my administration has ended in just eight months”.
“We’re averaging one a month. There’s only one left,” he said. “Although I heard that Pakistan and Afghanistan have started up, but I’ll get that solved very quickly.”

He added, “I know them both … the Pakistan field marshal and the prime minister are great people, and I know we’re gonna get that done quickly. That one started up a few days ago.”
Referring to his own role in halting wars around the world, the US president said, “I just feel it’s something I can do. I do it nicely.
“I don’t need to do it, I guess,” he added. “But if I can take time and save millions of lives, that’s really a great thing. I can’t think of anything better to do.”
Trump had previously thanked both Shehbaz and “my favourite” Munir for their efforts in securing the ceasefire deal in Gaza, while Shehbaz praised Trump’s “exemplary [and] visionary leadership” and reconfirmed Pakistan’s plan to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize 2026.
When the fighting broke out between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the US president was quick to express interest in assisting with establishing peace, although he was at the time occupied with overseeing a hostage exchange between Hamas and Israel.
“I said, ‘I’ll have to wait till I get back. I am doing another one,’” he told reporters at the time. “Because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace, and it is an honour to do it.”</p><small>2025-10-26 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951237/16-tlp-activists-on-nine-day-remand' target='_blank'><strong>16 TLP activists on nine-day remand</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Saturday granted nine-day physical remand of 16 activists of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) to the police in multiple cases registered under terrorism charges.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill heard the police’s request when the suspects were produced before the court.
 
 

The investigating officer sought a 27-day physical remand, arguing that the custody of the suspects was needed for interrogation in cases of violent protests and attacks on law enforcement officials.
After examining the record, the judge allowed a nine-day remand and directed the police to produce the suspects again on November 3, along with a progress report on the investigation.
The suspects are facing cases registered with the Nawab Town, Kahna and Shahdara police stations under different provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
 
 

CONVICTION: An ATC on Saturday sentenced two members of a banned outfit to five-year rigorous imprisonment each after finding them guilty of possessing explosive material.
Judge Arshad Javed announced the guilty verdict in the presence of convicts Habibullah and Muhammad Jawad.
The judge also ordered the prosecution to confiscate the properties of the convicts as part of the punishment.
 
 

The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) registered the case against the convicts in 2024 under relevant sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
The CTD had recovered explosive material from the possession of the convicts, who were members of a banned organization.
