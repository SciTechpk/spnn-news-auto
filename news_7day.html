The problem, which its report says can be easily solved, causes as much greenhouse gas emissions every year as the aviation industry.
Two billion people across the world still cook on open fires or with rudimentary stoves fed by wood, charcoal, agricultural waste or manure, the IEA report found.
“It is one of the greatest injustices of our time, especially in Africa,” IEA head Fatih Birol told AFP, where four out of five households rely on open fires and burning wood.
These fuels pollute the air both indoors and outdoors with fine particles that penetrate the lungs and cause multiple respiratory and cardiovascular problems, the report said.
It also adds to the destruction of forests, natural sinks that trap carbon and help fight global warming.
 






The IEA estimates that 815,000 premature deaths occur each year in Africa alone due to poor indoor air quality, largely resulting from a lack of access to clean cooking methods.
Women and children suffer the most, spending hours each day searching for fuel and keeping the fire going.
This takes time away from paid employment or education, the report said.
‘Can be easily solved’
A landmark IEA summit on the issue, held in Paris in May last year, raised $2.2bn in public and private sector commitments, as well as political pledges from 12 African governments.
Since then $470 million has been distributed, with concrete results already being seen, Birol insisted, citing a stove factory under construction in Malawi and an affordable stove programme developed in Uganda and Ivory Coast.
The IEA report assesses the progress made a year after the summit and sets out a roadmap for African countries to be able to use clean cooking methods at low cost before 2040.
Since 2010, nearly 1.5bn people in Asia and Latin America, particularly in Brazil, India, and Indonesia, have gained access to modern cooking stoves and fuels.
But the challenge remains immense in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of people without access to clean cooking methods continues to grow.
“For once and for ever, this problem can be solved with an annual investment of $2bn per year,” Birol said.
He stressed that the figure “is about 0.1 per cent of global energy investment, which is nothing”.
Alternative solutions are well known: electricity from solar panels, renewable gas and especially liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a fossil fuel, which, while not ideal, is preferable than the loss of carbon sinks due to tree felling, Birol said.
The IEA said this would prevent 4.7m premature deaths in sub-Saharan Africa by 2040 and reduce the continent’s greenhouse gas emissions by 540m tons per year, as much as the equivalent of the annual emissions of the global aviation sector.</p><small>2025-07-18 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18123841bf5bdfd.jpg?r=124041' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924987/pakistans-muhammad-asif-to-face-indian-cueist-in-ibsf-world-masters-final-today' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s Muhammad Asif to face Indian cueist in IBSF World Masters final today</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani cueist Muhammad Asif is set to face India’s Brijesh Damani in the final of the International Billiards & Snooker Federation (IBSF) World Masters Snooker Championship 2025 in Bahrain’s Manama city on Friday.

In April, three policemen were martyred and at least 16 others were injured in a blast that targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung’s Dasht Road. There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times.
“According to initial reports, the acting deputy superintendent of police’s (DSP) vehicle was targeted,” the spokesperson Rind said in a statement.
The assailants opened fire on the vehicle near the Choto area of Mastung on the National Highway, the statement elaborated.
Rind stated that “a search operation is underway to apprehend the assailants, and security forces have been dispatched to the site of the attack”.
The injured officers were immediately rushed to Shaheed Nawab Ghaus Bakhsh Hospital in Quetta, he added.
On July 16, three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Balochistan’s Kalat. Earlier this month, three cops were injured in an attack on a highway police vehicle in Balochistan’s Nasirabad District.
In a separate incident on July 9, unknown attackers hurled a grenade at a police checkpoint at the Sibi-Harnai railway crossing gate.
The grenade exploded at the post, but no injuries were reported.
On June 21, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured in a bomb attack in Kalat’s Mongochar area.</p><small>2025-07-18 10:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1812594683f85b9.jpg?r=130052' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924989/medium-level-flood-on-indus-river-at-punjabs-kalabagh-due-to-monsoon-rains' target='_blank'><strong>Medium-level flood on Indus River at Punjab’s Kalabagh due to monsoon rains</strong></a><br><p>Flooding at Punjab’s Kalabagh on the Indus river reached a “medium” level on Friday, while low-level floods were reported at four other locations on the river due to heavy monsoon rains and glacial melting, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Friday.
Rescue operations continued in Punjab after recent deadly rains wreaked havoc on and claimed at least 63 lives across the province. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that five more such spells of rain are expected in the coming days, leading to rising water levels, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The next spell is expected to begin from July 21 and last till July 28, while the fifth is expected in the first week of August, the sixth in the second week of August and the seventh in its third week.
“The flow of water in rivers is increasing due to monsoon rains and glacial melting,” a statement issued by the PDMA spokesperson said.
According to the data released by the Met Office’s Flood Forecasting Division at 1pm, there was a medium-level flood at Kalabagh with “steady” water inflow (447,941 cusecs) and outflow (440,391).
There was a low-level flood at Chashma Barrage and Tarbela Dam, as well as at Guddu and Sukkur barrages in Sindh, as of 12pm. While the water inflows and outflows were falling at Tarbela and Guddu, they were rising at Chashma and steady at Sukkur.

Data issued by the PDMA also said there was a “medium” flood at Kalabagh at 6am, while water levels at Tarbela and Chashma were categorised as “low”.
In a statement, the authority said that the water levels at the Ravi, Chenab, and Sutlej rivers were normal, as well as those at Dera Ghazi Khan’s irrigation system.
“The water level in Mangla Dam is 47 per cent and 79pc in Tarbela, whereas the water levels in Indian dams on Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi are up to 36pc,” said the statement.
Most areas of Lahore received light to moderate rain today, with an average of 4.6 millimetres for the region, according to the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa).

From 12:20pm to 1pm, Nishtar Town received the highest amount of rainfall (21mm), with Johar Town following it closely (19mm). The area near Jail Road recorded 6mm of rain; Iqbal Town, Nakhuda Chowk, Lakhshmi Chowk and Gulberg witnessed 5mm each; while Farrukhabad and Pani Wala Talab reported 4mm each.
Upper Mall, Mughalpura and Qurtaba Chowk received “traces” of rainfall, while the Airport area, Tajpura, Gulshan-i-Ravi, and Samanabad did not record any showers during the period.
Yesterday, Section 144 was imposed across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and left dozens dead.
This year’s monsoon intensity “is 60–70 per cent higher than last year, and averaging 65 per cent more than anticipated across the region”, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik was quoted as saying by APP.
According to the NDMA’s website, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 181 people across the country and injured 491 people.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed the administration to stay on high alert.
“PDMA Control Room and District Emergency Operation Centres are monitoring the situation 24/7”, said DG Kathia in a statement, urging the public to take necessary precautionary measures, avoid unnecessary travel, and steer clear of electric wires and poles.
 


Meanwhile, detailing the rescue efforts for floods in Punjab after the province received record rain, he said that “more than 1000 people were rescued along the Potohar plateau, including 398 citizens in Jhelum, 209 in Chakwal, and 450 in Rawalpindi”.
“No loss of life has been reported yet due to anyone getting caught in the floodwater,” the PDMA DG claimed.
The district administration and Pakistan Army personnel participated in the rescue operations, he added. Citizens were evacuated via helicopters in many areas where rescue boats were unable to reach.
DG PDMA stressed that “monsoon rains are predicted to be more than usual this year”, vowing that all resources would be utilised to protect citizens.
Separately, in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Farooq Ahmad, Punjab Rescue 1122 detailed the casualties and damages that occurred due to the recent monsoon rains since June 25.
It said 109 individuals had lost their lives, 438 were severely injured, 307 were given first aid, and 745 people were provided with rescue services.
The Lahore district recorded the most fatalities, with 24 deaths, while 15 died in Faisalabad, 11 in Sheikhupura, 10 in Rawalpindi, eight in Okara, seven in Bahawalnagar, and 34 died in other districts of Punjab.
Rescue 1122 stated that most of the casualties occurred in house collapse incidents  — 351 since June 25 — due to dilapidated buildings. It recorded 61 traffic accidents, 22 electrocutions and four lightning incidents, among others.
According to the statement, 15,000 rescue personnel were on high alert across Punjab with 800 boats.
The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 103 deaths and 385 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 40 fatalities, Sindh 20, Balochistan 16 and one death each in Azad Kashmir and Islamabad.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the NDMA and the climate and planning ministers to engage the provinces for a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year’s devastating rains and cloudburst events.</p><small>2025-07-18 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1814054873c79ad.gif?r=140654' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924990/5-private-companies-submit-proposals-on-ferry-service-from-gwadar-to-gulf-region-maritime-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>5 private companies submit proposals on ferry service from Gwadar to Gulf region: maritime ministry</strong></a><br><p>Five private companies on Friday proposed routes for the newly announced ferry service from Gwadar to the Gulf region, according to the maritime ministry.
On July 1, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs announced an ambitious plan to expand Gwadar Port’s operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The move is expected to provide an affordable, direct maritime link for passengers and cargo, particularly benefiting expatriate communities and cross-border traders.
Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry chaired a meeting on the ferry service today to review the “technical and financial aspects of ferry operations”, a statement by his ministry said.
“Five private companies presented their proposals,” the statement added.
 
 

“The interest of the private sector in ferry service has increased,” Chaudhry said, adding that various routes were under consideration. “The ferry service will promote regional connectivity and trade.”
“The movement of passengers and goods from Gulf countries will become easier,” he noted, adding that the service will highlight Gwadar on the international maritime map.
The ministry also stated that the meeting included instructions to conduct further evaluations of the submitted proposals. “Authorities were directed to ensure that all regulatory, technical, and logistical considerations are fully addressed ahead of the ferry service launch,” it said.
During the meeting, the maritime minister held a phone call with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and discussed provincial cooperation. Bugti “assured full cooperation in the ferry service project”, according to the ministry.
In a statement on X, the Balochistan government said, “The meeting discussed important matters related to the development of Gwadar, public facilities, and increasing employment opportunities for the youth.”
CM Bugti was quoted as saying that the provincial government was giving “serious consideration” to the ferry service from Gwadar to Oman, which will “facilitate pilgrims and ease travelling for the local population”.
“Assuring full cooperation from the Balochistan government, the chief minister stated that this initiative will prove to be a milestone in strengthening regional connectivity,” the statement read.
 






The Balochistan government also vowed to provide cooperation and support at every level for the full operationalisation of Gwadar Port.
“All proposed development projects of the Gwadar Port Authority will be fully supported so that Gwadar Port can play a central role in the national economy,” the statement affirmed.
The statement also said that 1.2 million gallons of clean drinking water will be provided daily to Gwadar citizens through a desalination project that will be established under the Gwadar Port Authority, calling it a “significant step toward a lasting solution to the long-standing water issue”.
 
 

CM Bugti was quoted as saying, “The government is committed to providing world-class training to the youth.”
The youth will be taught various skills under the Pak-China Technical Vocational Centre, while the provincial government’s program to train and provide overseas employment to 30,000 youths will be supported by the Pak-China Technical Vocational Centre, the statement added.
Today’s development comes after Chaudhry visited the Gwadar port on Wednesday to review various ongoing development projects.
 






The country has recently increased efforts on the commercialisation of the Gwadar Port, which was built more than a decade ago but remains a non-starter, turning the multi-billion-dollar infrastructure facility into a white elephant instead of becoming a transhipment hub.
Earlier this year, the government sought the private sector’s support in routing their cargoes through the port, seeking detailed proposals to enhance trade.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had issued directives for devising short- and medium-term strategies to operationalise Gwadar Port effectively within six months. He emphasised the importance of comparing Gwadar’s trade costs with other regional ports.</p><small>2025-07-18 10:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18151705c4b237c.png?r=151908' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925000/quetta-atc-sends-mahrang-baloch-others-on-15-day-physical-remand-again' target='_blank'><strong>Quetta ATC sends Mahrang Baloch, others on 15-day physical remand again</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Friday handed Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers of the group into police custody for 15 days, marking yet another extension of their detention.
In March, Mahrang and other BYC members were arrested for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order.
On July 8, a Quetta ATC handed Mahrang and other activists into police custody for 10 days, extending their three-month detention. The other activists were Gulzadi, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Ghaffar Baloch and Beberg Baloch.
Today’s hearing was taken up by ATC Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen, while Mahrang’s counsel, Advocate Israr Baloch and Advocate Shoaib Baloch, appeared in court.
On the request of the police, the judge handed Mahrang and other activists into police custody on a further 15-day remand.
Advocate Shoaib Baloch told Dawn.com that Dr Mahrang’s lawyers opposed the 15-day physical remand and told the court to ask the investigation team what was achieved in the previous 10-day remand.
“No response was given by the investigation team, and zero progress was made,” the counsel said. “Despite this, the court ordered a 15-day remand.”
Tight security arrangements were made today for the activist’s appearance in court.
On Tuesday, international human rights organisation Amnesty International called upon Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti to “release all detained Baloch activists”.
It called on CM Bugti to drop all charges and overturn detention orders against Baloch activists targeted solely for exercising their rights.
Mahrang was taken into custody under MPO for a period of 30 days (first term) on March 22. Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody last month, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang is included on its list of proscribed persons.
Constitutional petitions seeking the release of Mahrang and two other activists were rejected by the Balochistan High Court (BHC) in May.
Subsequently, Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch appealed to the Supreme Court in June against the BHC decision.
The petition alleged that her “repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion” and labelling her as a “sympathiser of militants” was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons.
The same month, the Kech chapter of the BYC launched a three-day hunger strike in front of the Turbat Press Club in protest of the leadership’s arrests.</p><small>2025-07-18 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18111357c38bf91.jpg?r=111408' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924804/crisis-of-protection-child-rights-violations-surge-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa' target='_blank'><strong>Crisis of protection: Child rights violations surge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is witnessing an alarming rise in violations of child rights, with a recent report revealing 402 incidents in just the last six months, a figure that already surpasses the 392 cases recorded in 2024.
According to a report by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission (KPCPWC), children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuse and neglect, ranging from disappearance, forced labour and corporal punishment to sexual violence and murder.
The report documented 40 cases of missing children, 26 reports of children running away from home, 40 incidents of sexual abuse, 17 cases of child labour, 16 reports of forced begging, 14 incidents of corporal punishment, 13 cases of physical torture, seven cases of child murder, and two incidents of child pornography.
Of the total 402 documented cases, 286 involved boys, while 116 were related to girls.
‘A child protection emergency’
Nadia Khan, a member of the National Commission on the Rights of the Child (NCRC), voiced deep concern about the province’s limited capacity to protect its vulnerable youth.
“We only have one functional child protection unit in Peshawar, while the province is home to over four million children,” she said.
“This should be treated as a child protection emergency. We need long-term, child-centric policies that ensure sustainable protection.”
Her concerns are echoed by data showing that only 19 out of 36 districts currently have operational child protection units, leaving nearly half the province without institutional safeguards.
Need for community role
While government inaction remains a critical issue, some argue that the responsibility doesn’t lie solely with the state.
“We can’t blame the government alone,” said Maham Afridi, a programme lead at the NCRC. “Our society must also play its part.
“There is an urgent need to engage communities, spread awareness and include religious leaders who hold influence and can support awareness efforts.”
Meanwhile, parents of children expressed their own fears and worries.
“I don’t take my 12-year-old daughter outside alone with me anymore,” Aftab Awan, a 46-year-old resident of Peshawar, told Dawn.com. “People stare at my daughter, and that makes me uncomfortable.”
Cultural barriers
Deep-rooted cultural and social stigmas are a major reason why child abuse cases often go unreported in Pakistan, says prominent social activist Rakhshanda Sajid.
“In many communities, issues related to child abuse are seen as a matter of family ‘honour’. People choose silence over justice, fearing shame or social backlash,” Sajid said.
“There’s a fear of disgrace, and often, the victims themselves are made to feel guilty or ashamed. This toxic mindset prevents justice and allows abuse to continue unchecked.”
 
 

Sajid also criticised the prevailing belief that family matters should not be interfered with, even in cases of abuse.
“Many still think that disciplining a child through harsh means is part of good parenting. These outdated beliefs normalise violence and make it harder for children to speak up,” she emphasised.
She urged both the government and civil society to launch widespread awareness campaigns to change public perceptions and empower victims to come forward and seek support.
“We must break the silence and challenge the harmful norms that protect abusers and isolate victims.”
Government vows reforms
In response to the growing crisis, Minister for Social Welfare Qasim Ali Shah stated that new laws to address child rights violations were in the pipeline.
Shah told Dawn.com that there were some legal challenges related to street children’s custody, stating that laws regarding custody would be introduced in the coming days.
“To study the case of such children, we must have custody for 15 days or one month,” he added.
“We are moving towards legislation that will directly address the protection needs of our children,” the minister said.  “We will make Peshawar and the province beggar-free.”
In late June, the KP government inaugurated a separate helpline for the first time for child protection cases. Simultaneously, a centre for continuing professional development was inaugurated, Shah said.
“The centre aims to discuss better policymaking regarding effective child protection,” he said.
Along with the commission, concerned departments and members of civil society, as well as social workers, will also take part in the discussions.
Komal Murad, programme manager at KPCPWC, confirmed plans to expand services across the province.
“We’re working to establish child protection units in more districts,” she added.
Murad told Dawn.com that in 36 districts, there were currently only 19 child protection units, adding that more child protection units would be established in the upcoming days.

“Accessibility is key to prevention and intervention.”

A law with limited implementations
Back in 2010, the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act was enacted to safeguard child rights.
Imran Takkar, A known child rights activist, told Dawn.com that while the laws were brilliant, “what we need is the implementation”.
He added that investment was needed to gain results out of laws, but noted that the government seemed “too slow” regarding the availability of funds.
As per law, child protection courts were to be formed in all 36 districts of the province, Takkar said, but added that “we see only eight as of yet in more than a decade”.
By law, he said, a chief must be appointed to the child protection commission, adding that “since 2014, no chief to the commission has been appointed besides several advertisements”.
Despite repeated announcements, implementation remains slow and fragmented.
Nauman Mohib Kakakhel, a high court lawyer and legal expert, said that there were no loopholes, scarcity of trained personnel, or poor inter-departmental coordination at the NCRC, but a lack of implementation has allowed countless children to fall through the cracks.
“The only thing lacking is the concerned department’s interest to work on it on a full scale,” Kakakhel added. He urged that it was the job of the child protection unit to serve the child, saying, “We see meetings over child protection but with minute implementations.”

The interior ministry said a plane carrying the men took off Friday morning bound for Afghanistan, adding that all the deportees were under expulsion orders and were convicted by the criminal justice system.
The government of Europe’s top economy was forging ahead with a “policy change”, said Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, who was hosting several European counterparts for a migration meeting.
“Deportations to Afghanistan must continue to be carried out safely in the future. There is no right of residence for serious criminals in our country.”
Berlin has had only indirect contact with the Taliban authorities through third parties with Friday’s operation executed with the help of Qatar, said the German interior ministry.
Germany had stopped deportations to Afghanistan and closed its embassy in Kabul following the Taliban’s return to power in 2021.
But expulsions resumed last year for the first time since the Taliban came to power, when the previous government of Social Democrat chancellor Olaf Scholz expelled a group of 28 Afghans convicted of crimes.
Rights concerns
Human rights group Amnesty International strongly criticised the renewed deportations to Afghanistan saying the situation in the country was “catastrophic”.
“Extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, and torture are commonplace,” the group said in a statement.
At the beginning of the month, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders in Afghanistan, accusing them of crimes against humanity over the persecution of women and girls.
Merz told a press conference on Friday that Germany wants to be an “attractive country for immigration”, to attract the best talent and fill gaping labour shortages,
The previous government’s policies had however left local administrations with too large a burden to carry, Merz said.
His government had “initiated corrections” to put migration policy on the right course, he said, including tightening border controls and limiting family reunifications rights for some refugees.
Merz said that policing Germany’s borders with its neighbours was only a “temporary” solution and a durable solution was needed at the European level.
Migration summit
Dobrindt was meeting his French, Polish, Austrian, Danish and Czech counterparts, as well as European Commissioner for Home Affairs Magnus Brunner, in southern Germany on Friday.
The objective of the meeting is to “strengthen European migration policy,” Dobrindt told the Augsburger Allgemeine daily.
A debate over resuming expulsions has flared as migration has risen up the political agenda in tandem with the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
The AfD scored a historic election result of over 20 per cent in February — its highest score at a national level — leaving the party nipping on the heels of Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU bloc.
The controversy over immigration was fuelled by a series of deady attacks last year where the suspects were asylum seekers — including several from Afghanistan.
Germany’s new government, a coalition between the CDU/CSU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), has promised to expel more foreign criminals alongside a crackdown on irregular migration.

“If EU/E3 want to have a role, they should act responsibly and put aside the worn-out policies of threat and pressure, including the ‘snap-back’ for which they (have) absolutely no moral (or) legal grounds,” Araghchi said on X.
 






He added that “any new round of talks is only possible when the other side is ready for a fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial nuclear deal.”
The remarks came after Araghchi held a conference call with his British, French and German counterparts and European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.
The European diplomats told Araghchi of “their determination to use the ‘snapback’ mechanism — which allows for the reimposition of all international sanctions against Iran — in the absence of concrete progress” towards a new deal on Iran’s nuclear programme “by the end of the summer”, the French foreign ministry said.
French officials have previously indicated that this means by the end of August.
Last month, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that the Europeans would be “justified” in seeking a snapback of UN sanctions lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers, later abandoned by US President Donald Trump.
“Without a firm, tangible, and verifiable commitment from Iran, we will do so no later than the end of August,” he told reporters.
Last week, Araghchi urged the Europeans to play “a constructive role” on the nuclear issue.
“The threat of sanctions does not help diplomacy,” Araghchi told French newspaper Le Monde.
There has been much speculation about the status of Iran’s nuclear programme since Israel and the United States bombed key facilities last month.
A clause in the 2015 agreement allows for UN sanctions on Iran to be reimposed through a snapback mechanism in the event of non-compliance.
But the deal expires in October, giving the parties to it a fast-approaching deadline to invoke the clause.
Iran and the United States held several rounds of nuclear negotiations through Omani mediators before Israel launched its 12-day war on June 13. Trump’s decision to join Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities effectively ended the talks.
Since the end of the hostilities, both Tehran and Washington have signalled willingness to return to the table, though Tehran has said it will not give up its right to the peaceful use of nuclear power.
An adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in matter of state, said on Monday that there would be no new nuclear talks with the United States if they were conditioned on Iran renouncing uranium enrichment.</p><small>2025-07-18 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1811114145e58eb.png?r=111354' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924970/lightning-strikes-kill-33-people-in-indias-bihar' target='_blank'><strong>Lightning strikes kill 33 people in India’s Bihar</strong></a><br><p>Lightning strikes during monsoon storms in eastern India this week killed at least 33 people and injured dozens, officials said on Friday.
The deaths in Bihar occurred during fierce storms between Wednesday and Thursday, a state disaster management department statement said, with the victims mostly farmers and labourers working in the open.
More heavy rain and lightning are forecast for parts of the state.
Bihar state’s disaster management minister, Vijay Kumar Mandal, told AFP that officials in vulnerable districts had been directed to “create awareness to take precautionary steps following an alert on lightning”.
The state government announced compensation of 4 million Indian rupees ($4,600) to the families of those killed by lightning.
India’s eastern region, including Bihar, is prone to annual floods that kill dozens and displace hundreds of thousands of people during the peak monsoon season.
South Asia’s annual monsoon season from June to September offers respite from the intense summer heat and is crucial for replenishing water supplies, but also brings widespread death and destruction.
 
 

The region is getting hotter and in recent years has seen shifting weather patterns, but scientists are unclear on how exactly a warming planet is affecting monsoons.
In May, Mumbai was swamped by monsoon rain that began two weeks earlier than usual, the earliest for nearly a quarter of a century, according to weather forecasters.
At least 34 people died over four days in early June in India’s northeastern region after heavy floods caused landslides. Another four lost their lives in Bangladesh.

Ms Shah explained that the Balochistan government holds a 25 per cent partnership in the project without making any direct investment. The overall venture is a 50-50 partnership between the government of Pakistan and RDMC.
The briefing also highlighted the company’s efforts in local workforce development.

But is it enough for half of its children who are out of school?</strong></a><br><p>Education lies at the heart of sustainable development and human capital growth. In Sindh, where nearly half the population is under the age of 16, the state of education holds the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and underdevelopment. While the recently announced Sindh Budget 2025-26 has brought education to the forefront, critical gaps remain in access, quality, and equity. And if we don’t fix the cracks now, we risk losing another generation to the same broken system.
Sindh, Pakistan’s second-most populous province with 55.7 million people, faces significant challenges in education despite having a demographic edge. The province has the country’s youngest population — 30 per cent aged between 5 and 16 years and 80pc under 40 years of age. At the same time, there’s a high number of out-of-school children (OOSC), the curriculum is plagued by poor learning outcomes, public-private-madressah disparities, gender inequality, and weak adaptability of the education system to labour market demands and climate risks.
In this year’s budget, the Sindh government has earmarked Rs613.36 billion for education — with Rs524.32 billion directed towards service delivery and Rs89.04 billion set aside for development — marking a significant increase from last year’s allocation of Rs454 billion. Key allocations include Rs13.5 billion for the Sindh Education Foundation (SEF) and Rs 2.5billion for madressah reforms. But can these investments truly reverse the tide of Sindh’s worsening education crisis?
 
 

While spending commitments for school scholarships and endowment funds — including partnerships with organisations like Akhuwat — signal a push to engage the private sector and civil society, the absence of a comprehensive strategy to bring out-of-school children back into classrooms risks rendering these efforts insufficient.
The problems and their solutions
According to the Economic Survey FY25, Sindh’s gross primary enrolment rate stands at 71pc, far below the national average of 84pc, with even Balochistan slightly ahead at 72pc. Middle school enrolment is just 54pc, again trailing behind the national average.

Notably, 47pc of children in Sindh remain out of school, second only to Balochistan.

The problem is worse in disaster-prone districts such as Khairpur, Larkana, Dadu, and Sanghar, where cumulative enrolment barely reaches 33pc.
While the budget includes allocations for climate-resilient infrastructure, investment in flood mitigation — crucial to safeguarding continuous education — remains limited. Sindh’s education system has repeatedly suffered in the aftermath of disasters such as the 2010 and 2022 floods, which devastated rural communities and damaged over 20,000 schools. Investing in disaster-resilient school infrastructure, mobile learning units, and early warning systems can protect educational continuity in future crises.
Moreover, education must be integrated into disaster risk reduction policies to ensure that rebuilding goes beyond physical infrastructure to address the educational needs of displaced children and vulnerable communities. Schools must not only be rebuilt but also designed with resilience to withstand future disasters. Early recovery planning should prioritise the rapid resumption of education through temporary learning centres, distance education, and psychosocial support for children affected by emergencies. Climate-resilient schools with elevated structures, solar power, and rainwater harvesting systems can serve as community hubs in times of crisis.
Beyond disasters, Sindh’s education infrastructure is weak.

Only 31pc of schools have electricity, 58pc have drinking water, and 57pc have toilets, all below national averages.

The province has responded by expanding public-private partnerships through SEF. Programmes like the Adopt-a-School and Foundation-Assisted Schools aim to enhance management and learning outcomes. The current Rs13.5 billion allocation to SEF is a positive step, but further efforts are needed to improve access for girls and marginalised communities. The success of public-private partnerships hinges on careful regulation, teacher training, and local community engagement.
Evaluations of SEF-supported schools have shown that while these schools often outperform purely public counterparts, challenges around quality assurance, equitable access, and gender disparities remain. Transparent performance monitoring and feedback loops are essential to scaling up such models effectively. Evidence from successful public-private partnership (PPP) models in other countries, such as Bangladesh’s BRAC schools, demonstrates that when communities are actively involved and accountability mechanisms are strong, public-private partnerships can significantly boost enrolment and learning outcomes. Sindh can adapt such models by focusing on scalability, transparency, and gender inclusion.
 
 

Learning outcomes remain dismal
According to the 2023 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), only 22pc of Grade 5 students in rural Sindh can read a basic English sentence, and just 27pc can perform division. Private school students consistently outperform their government school counterparts across all subjects. The absence of relief in the current budget for school expenses such as textbooks, stationery, and unchecked private school fees continues to burden poor families, leading to high dropout rates.
The stark divide in education reflects deep-rooted socioeconomic inequalities. For the poorest, madressahs are the only viable option as they offer food and shelter. Low-income families opt for low-cost private schools, while others rely on underfunded government schools. Despite the Sindh Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2013, reforms have failed to eliminate these disparities. The gap is evident in literacy and numeracy outcomes between urban and rural, rich and poor students, and between boys and girls. Gender gaps are exacerbated by unsafe school environments, lack of female teachers, and absence of transport.

Without targeted investment in girls’ education, including stipends, infrastructure, and security, these gaps will persist.

The government must go beyond policy declarations to implement on-the-ground solutions. Conditional cash transfers for families, free transport for rural girls, and incentives for female teachers to work in remote areas can help narrow the learning divide. In urban areas, the government should regulate private schools to prevent exploitation and ensure quality standards. A universal minimum education standard, enforced across all types of schools — including madressahs — is imperative to reduce disparities.
 
 

Bridging this divide will also require a cultural shift. Engaging religious leaders, tribal elders, and local influencers to advocate for education, particularly for girls, can help shift societal norms. Furthermore, the establishment of community-based schools, especially in sparsely populated rural areas, can provide localised access to education, reducing the distance barrier that disproportionately affects girls.
The silver linings
One promising initiative in the 2025-26 budget is the decentralisation of education funds to school-level cost centres, empowering over 34,000 government schools to manage operational budgets. However, without transparency and accountability mechanisms, this reform risks enabling corruption at grass-roots level rather than driving improvement.
Past reliance on (currently dysfunctional) school management committees has shown limited success, particularly in rural areas where community participation remains low. To maximise the impact of decentralised budgets, there must be robust oversight through digital monitoring systems, community scorecards, and third-party audits. Capacity-building for headteachers and school councils is critical to ensuring that funds are used effectively. Without these safeguards, decentralisation may inadvertently replicate existing inefficiencies.
For children with disabilities, the budget promises to double assistive device outreach, benefiting 40,000 persons with disabilities (PWDs) through NGO collaborations. Monthly stipends will increase, alongside the provision of meals and uniforms, which is a commendable move toward inclusive education. In addition to the proposed stipends, the government should establish specialised teacher training, provide disability inclusive school transport, and enforce building codes for disability-friendly school infrastructure. These interventions will align Sindh’s approach with global standards under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Another focus area is the regulation of madressahs. With over 7,118 registered seminaries, the allocated Rs2.5 billion should be spent not only on grants but also on ensuring their registration, regulation, and integration into the broader education system, bringing these children into the national fold. The inclusion of madressah students in standardised assessments would also help track their progress and ensure consistency with national education goals. Bringing these religious schools into the formal education system is essential for national cohesion and human capital development.
Without structural reform, the budget means little
While the Sindh education budget for 2025-26 introduces some forward-looking initiatives — such as decentralisation, SEF expansion, and disability inclusion — it falls short of addressing the systemic barriers that perpetuate low enrolment, poor learning outcomes, and gender inequality. Without stronger political will, enhanced accountability, and targeted investment in girls’ education, disaster resilience, and rural schooling, Sindh risks falling further behind. Education must be made a true national priority, not just through financial commitments but through sustained reforms and implementation.
Achieving these reforms will require more than financial allocations; it demands strong governance, transparent decision-making, and unwavering political commitment. Without these pillars in place, the current budgetary allocations — already insufficient — risks leaving another generation of Sindh’s youth unequipped for meaningful employment and a secure future.

According to Rescue 1122 sources, some locals dared Shabeer (66), a retired railway employee, to swim across the big and deep canal, setting a Rs1,000 bet on the arduous task for the elderly man, who was not even a trained swimmer.
The old man accepted the challenge and jumped into the canal.
Quoting eyewitnesses, the sources said, as the old man started drowning, the onlookers kept laughing and recording videos of him, instead of trying to save him. They also uploaded the video clip on social media.
When the old man disappeared in the water, someone called Rescue 1122 for help. By the time a rescue team reached the spot the old man had already drowned, they said.
The Rescue 1122 divers retrieved the body and handed it over to the victim’s family.
As the video went viral, many social media users condemned those who instigated the elderly man to jump into the deep canal and did not even help him when he was drowning, demandingtheir arrest. 
So far, Uch Sharif police have not taken any action over the tragic incident.
WOMAN MURDERED: A man allegedly axed his sister-in-law to death and seriously injured his niece over her marriage issue at Chak No 95 on Multan Road in the limits of Thingi police station in Vehari district.

The Journal story says the letter featuring a sketch of a naked woman and Trump’s signature was part of a collection of notes for Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003.
The newspaper says it reviewed the letter but did not print an image.
Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Emma Tucker “was told directly by (White House press secretary) Karoline Leavitt, and by President Trump, that the letter was a FAKE,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network.
“Instead, they are going with a false, malicious, and defamatory story anyway,” he said.
“President Trump will be suing The Wall Street Journal, NewsCorp, and Mr. (Rupert) Murdoch, shortly. The press has to learn to be truthful, and not rely on sources that probably don’t even exist.”
 
 

The Republican president was already facing a firestorm over his past relationship with Epstein, and claims that his administration is covering up lurid details of Epstein’s crimes to protect rich and powerful figures.
Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 — during Trump’s first term — after being charged with federal sex trafficking in a scheme where he allegedly groomed young and underage women for sexual abuse by his wealthy contacts.
He was previously required to register as a sex offender in Florida after pleading guilty to two felony prostitution-related charges.
Later on Thursday, Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to release transcripts of grand jury testimony in the Epstein case, “subject to court approval”.
‘Another wonderful secret’
The alleged letter — which Trump denies writing — is raunchy, as were others in the collection, the Journal reported. It contains several lines of typewritten text, contained in an outline of a naked woman drawn with a marker.
“The future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair,” the Journal reported.
“The letter concludes: ‘Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.’”
Trump denied writing the letter or drawing the figure, telling the Journal: “This is not me. This is a fake thing.”
“I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”
Murdoch, who controls the NewsCorp global media company, was in Trump’s suite on Sunday at MetLife Stadium outside New York City for the FIFA Club World Cup final.
Epstein row
The Trump-supporting far-right has long latched onto the Epstein scandal, claiming the existence of a still-secret client list and that he was murdered in his cell as part of a cover-up.
Trump supporters expected the Republican to answer their questions on his return to office in January, but now find themselves being told the conspiracy theories are false.
The Justice Department and FBI said in a memo made public earlier this month that there is no evidence that Epstein kept a “client list” or was blackmailing powerful people.
 
 

They also dismissed the claim that Epstein was murdered in jail, confirming his suicide, and said they would not be releasing any more information on the probe.
That could change if grand jury testimony or evidence are released.
On Thursday, US media reported that a federal prosecutor who handled Epstein’s case, who is the daughter of a prominent Trump critic, was abruptly fired.
Maurene Comey, whose father is former FBI director James Comey, was dismissed on Wednesday from her position as an assistant US attorney in Manhattan, the reports said.
Comey also prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell, the only former Epstein associate who has been criminally charged in connection with his activities.
Maxwell is the person who compiled the leather-bound book of letters for Epstein in 2003, The Journal reported.
“The WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it. Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it?” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.
 






Meanwhile, Democratic lawmaker Pat Ryan wrote: “I think we now know EXACTLY why Donald Trump refuses to release the Epstein files.”

Mr Gandapur filed a petition with multiple prayers from the high court requesting to declare as unconstitutional Rule 94 of the Election Rules, which provided that a political party which didn’t have a party symbol shall not be treated as a political party for the purpose of allocation of reserved seats.
He requested the court to declare as illegal an impugned letter issued to him by the ECP on July 14 for summoning of the KP Assembly session for administering oath to candidates of other political parties notified on reserved seats.
The petitioner prayed the court to strike down the notification issued on July 4, 2025, by Election Commission of Pakistan whereby reserved seats in the KP Assembly had been allocated to political parties having a lesser electoral mandate than the PTI.

Also challenges ECP letter for convening assembly session

He further sought directives for the ECP to allocate reserved seats to PTI strictly in accordance with the principle of proportional representation, as contemplated under the Constitution and Elections Act, 2017.
The petition is filed through a panel of lawyers including Qazi Mohammad Anwar, Alam Khan Adenzai and Basheer Wazir.
The petitioner claimed that the ECP had misinterpreted a Supreme Court judgment and had declared PTI candidates as independent. He stated that the party had secured 93 provincial assembly seats in the general elections, but as the ECP refused to acknowledge PTI as a political party, the said members were forced to submit declaration of joining Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).
He stated that the ECP had not yet issued any notification announcing PTI candidates as members of the SIC.
He said it was a matter of record that the petitioner and majority of the elected members submitted their nomination papers declaring themselves as PTI candidates and openly contested the election under the PTI banner, notwithstanding the denial of the party symbol.
He stated that the ECP failed to treat them as PTI representatives and instead proceeded to allocate reserved seats to other political parties with far fewer general seats than PTI, thereby violating the principle of proportional representation and defying the electoral mandate of the people of KP.
The petitioner contended that denial of reserved seats to PTI would create an entirely unrepresented provincial assembly that didn’t reflect the will of the people.

“Despite being a former prime minister, Khan was denied both his status and even the basic rights of an ordinary prisoner, which was matter of grave concern, as he was the country’s most popular leader, and the entire nation was deeply worried about his wellbeing and safety,” Mr Akram said.
He said that the PTI founder has been denied access to newspapers, television and books and that meetings with friends and political associates have been suspended.

Waqqas warns of constitutional, humanitarian crises due to judicial and economic failures

Mr Akram added that Khan’s legal team has been blocked from consulting him on more than 200 cases, calling it “an outright violation of his right to a fair legal defence”.
Mr Akram accused jail authorities of repeatedly violating court orders that permit meetings with six designated individuals, showing a “blatant contempt of court.”
He also said Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, has been denied family visits, while Aleema Khan was not being allowed to visit her brother and other sisters were granted visits only occasionally.
Highlighting the condition of other detained party leaders, Mr Akram called the worsening health of former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi “a matter of urgent humanitarian concern.”
Referring to the cancer-surviving politician Dr. Yasmin Rashid, Mr Akram said: “Even if she defeated Nawaz Sharif politically, her basic human rights cannot be ignored.”
Mr Akram criticised the judiciary, noting that senior leader Ejaz Chaudhry remains imprisoned in a case despite being granted bail by the Supreme Court.
“I appeal to the Chief Justice of Pakistan that your directives are being openly discarded by Adiala Jail administration,” he said.

IHC Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas issued the ruling during the hearing of a petition filed by former senator Farhatullah Babar against the government’s decision to repatriate Afghan citizens holding refugee registration cards.
Advocate Umar Ijaz Gilani, representing the petitioner, requested the court to suspend the government’s actions until the case is decided.
However, Justice Minhas made it clear that the judiciary would not intervene in policy matters. “I am completely clear on this — the court will not interfere with the government’s policy,” he remarked.
The judge noted that the government has determined that all Afghan nationals must return by June 30 and emphasised that Pakistan has not signed any binding agreement offering long-term protection to refugees.
“The government says no formal contract exists, and no protection can be extended beyond June 30,” the judge added.
The court subsequently adjourned the hearing.

This was revealed by the Ministry of National Health Services in a statement issued on Thursday.
According to the statement, the issue came up during a meeting between Federal Health Minister Mustafa Kamal and a British High Commission (BHC) delegation, led by Ms. Jo Moir, which was held to discuss the government of Pakistan’s health sector priorities and align them with the United Kingdom’s support portfolio.
According to the statement issued after the meeting, “Key reforms discussed included revisiting the NFC Award, suggesting that the current 80pe weightage assigned to population be reduced to 50pe, with 30pe allocated as an incentive to provinces that successfully reverse population growth trends.”
The minister also advocated for a focused Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) campaign to educate men across the country about population control measures.
He raised concerns about the high fertility rate, calling it a national issue requiring immediate attention. He encouraged efforts to balance population growth through collaboration with stakeholders, including religious scholars and development partners.
Mustafa Kamal highlighted Pakistan’s challenges, including a high burden of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. He stressed the importance of shifting focus to preventive and promotive healthcare by strengthening primary health care systems to reduce the strain on tertiary care facilities.

• Claims opposition didn’t raise issue of reinstating suspended lawmakers
• Bhachar rejects assertion, says no return to house until MPAs’ suspension withdrawn
LAHORE: Negotiations between the trea­­sury and opposition benches in the Punjab Assembly made headway during the third round of talks on Thursday, with both sides reaching an agreement on parliamentary conduct and activation of key house committees.
However, a deadlock persists over the reinstatement of 26 suspended opposition lawmakers and the withdrawal of fines imposed on them — an issue the opposition insists is non-negotiable for their return to the house.
The 26 PTI lawmakers in question were suspended for 15 sittings following their protest during Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s speech on June 27.
Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehm­an told reporters after the meeting on Thursday, “This was the third sitting of the negotiation committee, and today’s session was productive. We have reached a consensus with the op­­­position (on certain issues),” he said.
He added that in future, there would be no use of abusive language, sloganeering or disruptions during assembly proceedings. “When the opposition leader speaks, there will be no sloganeering. Similarly, there will be no disruptions during the chief minister’s speech. The house will operate according to the recommendations of the Business Advisory Committee,” he noted.
Mr Rehman also said the Ethics Com­m­ittee would be made functional and tasked with reviewing any violations of the assembly’s rules of procedure after each session.
He claimed the opposition had not raised the issue of reinstating suspended lawmakers. However, the assertion was rebutted by opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar. Speaking to the media separately, he said, “We will never enter the house without our suspended colleagues.”
Mr Bhachar confirmed that both sides had exchanged proposals and agreed on reactivating the Advisory Committee and the Ethics Committee.
He emphasised that the house would be run under the framework of the Ethics Committee and Rule 223 of the Rules of Procedure, indicating a move towards more structured parliamentary proceedings.
Regarding the heated exchanges that have plagued recent sessions, Mr Bhachar said the government acknowledged the opposition’s right to protest but stressed that abusive language is not a good practice. “We have never called it good either. Abu­sive language will not be tolerated,” he said.
Despite these agreements on parliamentary decorum, the core demand of the opposition remains the reinstatement of their sus­p­ended members and the withdrawal of fines.
“No one asked us for an apology, nor did we apologise,” Mr Bhachar said, warning: “If our people are not reinstated, the opposition will hold an assembly outside the (provincial) assembly.”
He stressed the opposition’s unwavering stance: “We are in the opposition; it never backs down from protest. If the government wants the opposition to come into the house, then they can reinstate [our members].”
He questioned the rationale behind any expectation of an apology. “Why would we apologise when our members are suspended and fined?” he asked. “Fines have not been waived and our people are still suspended. Until they are reinstated, we will not return to the house.” He also underlined a key constitutional right, stating: “No member can be deprived of their right to vote.”
Meanwhile, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, who is abroad on a private trip, participated in the negotiating committee meeting via an audio link. He congratulated all members of the committee on the successful talks and reiterated the negotiation committee’s decision, particularly the agreement on not using indecent language.
He was quoted as saying that “the decisions of the Ethics Committee will be supreme” and urged that “the act of use of abusive language should not be repeated”.
The speaker affirmed that “the opposition has the right to protest, but according to the Constitution”.

Without any evidence, New Delhi had blamed Islamabad for the April 22 attack, which saw 26 people killed in the Baisaran hill station, and used it as a pretext to launch military strikes against Pakistan.
According to a recent BBC News report, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.
Thursday’s statement from the State Department seemed to echo India’s viewpoint, which has claimed that the little-known newly-formed group was actually a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
India also blames the LeT for orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks and several other attacks on military forces. The US earlier designated LeT as an FTO in December 2001.
One of the first mentions of the group came in 2020, when then-Indian army chief M.M. Naravane accused Pakistan of creating a “new terror group” in occupied Kashmir.
“I would rather call it Terror Revival Front. It is another terrorist organisation by another name. This is a terrorist organisation supported by its proxies across the border. They will be dealt with appropriately,” he was quoted as saying. Pakistan’s Foreign Office had rejected the allegation at the time.
“These actions taken by the Department of State demonstrate the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,” the statement said.
In a recent interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that Pakistan was ready to cooperate with India against this group.
At the time, Mr Thapar had claimed that New Delhi’s attempts to have the group designated as a terror outfit by the United Nations had been blocked by China, on Pakistan’s behalf.

The presidential physician found Trump, 79, has  “chronic venous insufficiency” — a condition where damaged leg veins fail to keep blood flowing properly — Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, calling it a  “benign and common condition.”
Responding to speculation over recent photos showing bruising on Trump’s hand, Leavitt said  “this was consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”
Trump became the oldest person in history to assume the presidency when he began his second term this January, replacing Democrat Joe Biden, who stepped down at 81.
She said he had undergone  “a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70.”
“Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease,” she said. All Trump’s test results  “were within normal limits,” she said and he had a  “normal cardiac structure and function, no signs of heart failure, renal impairment or systemic illness.” The hand issue, she said, was linked to the aspirin he takes in a  “standard” cardiovascular health programme.
Leavitt said there was  “no evidence” of more serious conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.

• ANP’s Shahida Waheed wins draw on women seat
PESHAWAR: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Thursday withdrew its candidate in favour of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) for a seat reserved for non-Muslims, paving the way for JUI-F to become the largest opposition party in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly with 18 lawmakers.
As a result, JUI-F’s candidate Gorpal Singh will now be notified as MPA-elect on the said seat by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Meanwhile, Awami National Party (ANP) candidate Shahida Waheed was declared the winner through a draw against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P) candidate for a seat reserved for women. She will also be notified by the ECP as MPA-elect.
 
 

Both developments took place at the office of Provincial Election Commissioner (PEC) Saeed Gul in Peshawar on Thursday, where senior party leaders were present.
PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam and JUI-F’s Maul­ana Attaur Rehman attended the event along with their respective candidates, Gorsaran Lal and Gorpal Singh. The PML-N delegation formally withdrew its candidate in support of JUI-F’s nominee.
Similarly, delegations of ANP, led by MPA Nisar Baz and candidate Shahida Waheed, and PTI-P, led by MPA Arbab Waseem and candidate Somi, were also present for the draw. Following the draw, ECP officials declared Ms Waheed the winner.
Both PML-N and JUI-F were allo­­t­ted one seat each, reserved for non-Muslims, on the basis of the seven general seats won by each of them. The ECP had decided to allot the remaining seat through a draw.
Similarly, both ANP and PTI-P were awarded one seat each reserved for women and the remaining seat had to be allotted through a draw between candidates of these parties.
Following the notifications, JUI-F and PML-N will each hold nine of the total 26 reserved seats for women in the KP Assembly. PPP holds five, while ANP and PTI-P will now hold two and one, respectively.
For the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, JUI-F will hold two, while PML-N and PPP will have one each.
The opposition now holds a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly, including 18 MPAs of JUI-F, 17 of PML-N, 10 of PPP, four of ANP, and three of PTI-P. Presently, Dr Ibadullah of PML-N is the leader of the opposition in the KP Assembly. PTI-backed lawmakers maintain their tally of 92 members.

• Justice Mazhar says critical remarks can permanently tarnish reputations
• In case of doubt over judge’s conduct, matter should be discreetly sent to relevant chief justice
ISLAMABAD: The Supr­eme Court on Thursday cautioned superior jud­g­es over issuing critical orders against their peers as these observations have an “interminable impact” on the reputation of adjudicators.
“It always haunts the judicial officer and causes sev­e­re hardship and disparagement to his name and reputation in judicial service,” remar­ked Justice Muha­mmad Ali Mazhar in an order released on Thursday.
The verdict was issued in a revision application moved by Syed Zakir Hussain, a presiding officer of an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Karachi.
Mr Hussain, who was also the administrative judge of ATC in Karachi, came to the spotlight after refusing the remand of Armaghan Qureshi, the prime suspect in the high-profile Mustafa Amir murder case.
The judge’s action drew flak from the Sindh High Court (SHC), which ordered the provincial government to remove Mr Hussain from his role as the administrative judge of ATC.
Subsequently, the Sindh government, through a notification on Feb 26, withdrew Mr Hussain’s administrative powers as ATC judge.
The judge moved the Supreme Court against the SHC order and sought to expunge adverse observations over his alleged “judicial misconduct” and “procedural improprieties”.
In its order, the three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Mazhar, removed the adverse remarks against Mr Hussain, but kept the Feb 26 notification intact, stripping the judge of his administrative powers.
In the 12-page judgement, Justice Mazhar observed that “strictures” against judges create a “serious impairment and a sense of guilt in the eyes of the subordinates of the judge”.
Besides, it also damages the public’s confidence in the judicial system.
Another important aspect that cannot be ignored is that a judge against whom disparaging remarks or strictures were passed cannot defend their judgment or order in front of superior courts.
Therefore, high courts “should exercise greater caution and judicial restraint”, Justice Mazhar observed.
He added high courts, on a daily basis, review judgements and orders of lower courts and if those judements and orders are found to be deficient or flawed, they should be “modified, remanded or set aside”.
He added that no ulterior motive should be attributed even to a “serious error” committed by a judge without confronting them or seeking their comments.
The high court should be mindful that scornful and demeaning remarks or observations against a judge of the subordinate judiciary, even if expunged, “would not totally restitute the defacement of esteem and dignity”.
The criticism of a judgement or order must be “judicial” in nature and it should only point out errors or flaws in the said judgement.
Justice Mazhar observed that if the court has any doubt regarding the judge’s conduct, the matter should be confidentially referred to the high court’s chief justices, who can deal with the judge as per their “own fine sense of judgement”.
He added the principles of natural justice, due process, fair play and right to fair trial are also afforded to the judges of subordinate judiciary.
“They, too, being dispensers of justice, should be granted the right to a fair trial, rather than being condemned unheard.”
