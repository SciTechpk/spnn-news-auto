The prosecutor’s office said arrest warrants were issued for 137 suspects, of whom 115 have so far been detained, following intelligence indicating that the IS terrorist organisation was planning attacks during the holiday period.
The operation launched after police received intelligence that ISIL members were “planning attacks in Turkiye against non-Muslims in particular”, during the holiday period, it added.
Officers seized firearms, ammunition and what officials described as organisational documents during the sweeps, Al Jazeera reported on Thursday.
Efforts are continuing to locate the remaining 22 suspects.
That sweep, coordinated between intelligence services, police and military forces, netted individuals involved in financing the group’s activities and spreading its propaganda.
The prosecutor’s office said those arrested were in contact with IS operatives outside Turkiye, underscoring the transnational nature of the threat.
Turkiye shares a 900-kilometre (559-mile) border with Syria, where militant groups are still active.
IS leader ‘killed’ in Syria
Also on Thursday, Syr­ian authorities claimed to have killed a senior IS leader in coordination with the US-led coalition, hours after the arrest near Damascus of another leader.
Syrian security and intelligence forces, working in coordination with the international coalition, conducted what the interior ministry described as a “precise security operation”.
“The operation resulted in neutralising the terrorist Mohammad Shahada, known as Abu Omar Shaddad, who is considered one of the prominent IS leaders in Syria,” it added.
“This operation comes as confirmation of the effectiveness of joint coordination between the national security agencies and international partners.”
Hours earlier, authorities said they captured Taha al-Zoubi, also known as Abu Omar Tabiya, an IS leader in Damascus, along with several of his men on Wednesday.
High-value arrest
Earlier this week, in a major operation along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, a Turkish national, who allegedly held a senior role within the IS group, was also captured.
The suspect was identified as Mehmet Goren, who reportedly served in the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) province, Anadolu Agency reported.
According to the report, Goren had been tasked with organising suicide attacks targeting civilians in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkiye and Europe.
The Turkish National Intelligence Organisation (MIT) said that Goren travelled from Turkiye to the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, where he operated in IS camps and rose through the ranks to a leadership position.
IS-K, the regional affiliate of the IS group, has claimed responsibility for some of the worst attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan and beyond in recent years, many of them targeting civilians.

 

In March 2024, IS-K gunmen killed more than 140 people at a Moscow concert hall, and the group has carried out a series of deadly attacks in both Afghanistan and Pakistan since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
Goren allegedly worked alongside Ozgur Altun, known by the code name “Abu Yasir al-Turki”, who was previously arrested, transferred to Turkiye and jailed for facilitating the movement of militants from Turkiye to the region.

KARACHI: Business stakeholders have offered positive views of Pakistan International Airlines’ (PIA) acquisition by the Arif Habib consortium, with some seeing it as a chance to improve service and safety, while others say it could help revive investor confidence and accelerate the privatisation of other state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
Chief Executive and Secretary General of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) M. Abdul Aleem told Dawn he viewed the transaction as a positive step towards privatisation and said the government should be commended for handling the process “professionally”.
“We are positive that once things are stabilised by the new management, PIA will attract foreign investors,” he said, adding that the next few years would be critical and that the new management should be supported by all stakeholders.
Former Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik said the debate on PIA’s privatisation had largely overlooked what matters most to travellers. While policymakers focus on valuation, liabilities and timing, passengers, he said, judge airlines on simpler things such as punctuality, cleanliness, safety, staff response and route reliability. On these basic metrics, PIA had steadily lost public trust, he added.
Mr Malik said passengers today booked PIA not out of preference but compulsion, citing limited alternatives on some routes, especially to smaller cities, lack of competition during peak travel periods and affordability concerns.
Frequent delays, last-minute cancellations, inconsistent communication and poor ground handling had become routine, he said, adding that overseas Pakistanis increasingly viewed PIA as an airline of last resort rather than a preferred flag carrier.
“Privatisation, from a passenger’s standpoint, is not about selling an asset; it is about restoring accountability,” he said. “A privately run airline — properly regulated — has incentives aligned with customer satisfaction. Aircraft utilisation matters, turnaround times matter, complaints matter. Missed connections and lost baggage carry real costs for the operator, not just inconvenience for the traveller.”

 

“Critically, passengers do not need PIA to be ‘nationally owned’; they need it to be professionally run,” he said, adding that “pride in a flag carrier does not come from state ownership but from performance.”
He added, “Turkish Airlines, Emirates and Qatar Airways inspire national pride precisely because passengers trust them — not because of who owns the shares.”
‘Turning point’
Meanwhile, the leadership of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) urged the government to speed up the privatisation of other SOEs, saying the state spends nearly Rs800 billion annually to keep loss-making entities afloat.
Chairman of the Businessmen Group Zubair Motiwalla and KCCI President Muhammad Rehan Hanif said privatising PIA alone was expected to save about Rs100bn a year previously used to cover the airline’s losses. They argued the funds could be redirected towards development, social services and economic growth.
They opined that if more state-owned enterprises are privatised and taken over by capable Pakistani business groups, it would help restore Pakistan’s economic strength and credibility.
Such developments would clearly signal to the international community that Pakistan is an investable destination where local investors have strong confidence in the country’s future and are willing to invest and revive strategic national assets, they added.
PIA, once regarded as one of Asia’s finest airlines and a symbol of national pride, suffered decades of financial losses, operational inefficiencies and governance challenges under state ownership.
The successful privatisation, carried out through a transparent and competitive process, marks a turning point that offers a realistic opportunity to reverse this long decline and restore PIA’s lost stature both regionally and internationally, they added.

 

They hoped that PIA, under professional private management, could once again emerge as one of the most profitable and respected carriers, not only in Pakistan but across the entire region.
Shankar Talreja of Topline Securities, commenting on the historic $480 million deal in the last 20 years, was of the view that the bid value has significantly surpassed the market expectations of Rs80-100bn.
“The potential of turnaround in PIA is quite significant due to its landing rights over 78 destinations and 170 slots. Furthermore, this is a national airline of the world’s fifth most populous nation,” he said.
He said PIA’s deal would boost the morale of the privatisation ministry and set the tone for the next entities up for privatisation, i.e. electricity distribution companies (Discos).

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s current setbacks stem not from a lack of resources, but from political instability, policy inconsistency, weak institutions, neglect of education and absence of discipline, Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Thursday.
He was speaking at a star-studded ceremony, held at the Convention Centre to mark the formal beginning of year-long nationwide celebrations to commemorate 2026 as the ‘Year of Quaid-i-Azam’.
The ‘Quaid’s Pakistan — Uraan Pakistan’ event featured youth video messages, a panel discussion with leading scholars and policymakers and performances of national songs.
Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Mr Iqbal said the occasion was not merely ceremonial, but a moment of deep national reflection.
Introducing Uraan Pakistan, Mr Iqbal described it as a concrete execution framework to translate Quaid-i-Azam’s dream into a modern development strategy to build a trillion-dollar, competitive and knowledge-driven economy.

He said the initiative rests on five pillars: exports, e-Pakistan, equity and empowerment, environment and climate change, and energy and infrastructure development.
The minister emphasised that the nation must advance with unity, collective effort, and consistency to achieve the social and economic progress envisioned by Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
He said rebuilding Pakistan in accordance with Quaid-i-Azam’s golden principles was the need of the hour.
The minister highlighted that Quaid-i-Azam did not inherit power or command armies, yet reshaped history through character, constitutional struggle and moral courage.
Reflecting on Pakistan’s 77-year journey, Mr Iqbal said the country’s history comprised both achievements and hardships; however, every challenge should be turned into an opportunity for growth and stability.
Outlining Quaid-i-Azam’s vision, he said Pakistan was meant to be a democratic, inclusive and merit-based state with a strong economy, where minorities enjoy equal citizenship, rule of law prevails and institutions function impartially.
He warned that corruption, nepotism, intolerance and disorder were identified by the Quaid as the gravest threats to the country’s survival.

“Whenever we moved with discipline, we progressed. When­ever we were divided, we declined,” he added.
Speaking on the occasion, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said that the struggle and principled life of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah serve as a guiding light for the younger generation, noting that Jinnah never compromised on his principles.
The minister emphasised that such programmes help people better understand the life, thoughts, vision, and principles of the Founder of the Nation.

LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has set aside the federal government’s power to inactivate a citizen’s passport and imp­ose a travel ban of five years or more by placing a person on the Passport Control List (PCL) — adjudicating that this authority was beyond the scope of the parent law.
However, Justice Asim Hafeez upheld the government’s powers to cancel, impound, or confiscate passports, subject to the fulfilment of statutory requirements.
The judgement was delivered at the Multan bench while allowing a petition filed by citizen Farhan Ali, who took up two grievances before the court.
First, he sought the setting aside of an order that dismissed his representation against the placement of his name on the PCL as premature.
Second, he questioned the legality and constitutionality of the power to inactivate a passport under Rule 23 of the Passports Rules, 2021, contending that such power was not provided under Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974, which authorised only cancellation, impounding, or confiscation of a passport.

 

The judge noted that the petitioner’s request for removal of name from the PCL had been dec­lined under clause (c) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 22 of the Passports Rules, 2021, which prescribed a normal retention period of five years or more.
He observed that a person placed in Category ‘B’ might be omitted even before the completion of five years while an appeal was under consideration.
Under category ‘B’, the list includes individuals refused passports for reasons other than anti-state activities. Names may also be placed in this category on the recommendations of government agencies or departments.
‘Lacking statutory backing’
Justice Hafeez held that clause (c) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 22 lacked statutory backing, describing it as arbitrary, disproportionate, and beyond the scope of the parent law.
He noted that the provision offered no categorisation or guidelines for determining proportionate restraint and conferred unstructured discretion upon the executive.
On the issue of passport inactivation, the judge held that Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974, did not provide for inactivation.
Declaring the clause substantially ultra vires the law, the judge directed the federal government to rationalise restraint periods in proportion to the nature of violations, noting that illegal overstay could not be equated with migrant smuggling, human trafficking, or criminal conduct abroad.
Justice Hafeez explained that inactivation was an informal action — wrapped in obscurity — often used to avoid procedural requirements and due-process obligations under the law.
He noted that “surreptitious inactivation” had caused travellers to find themselves in unexpected and humiliating situations at airports despite holding valid passports and visas.
Justice Hafeez ruled that Rule 23 of the Passports Rules, 2021, conflicted with the scheme of the parent law, and that the delegated legislation failed when it exceeded statutory limits or replaced legislative judgement with executive discretion.
“Inactivation of a passport manifests denial of the right to travel in a covert manner not envisaged by the Act,” the judge observed.
“I hold that power to inactivate passport under Rule 23 of the Rules 2021 is beyond the scope of Section 8 of the Act 1974 and same is declared ultra vires — only the power to inactivate is declared invalid and powers to cancel, impound or confiscate are intact and exercisable subject to the existence of conditions and fulfilment of requirements,” the judge wrote in the verdict.
‘30 days’
The judge ordered that the verdict would take effect after 30 days to allow the federal government to revise the rules in conformity with Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974.
He allowed the petition and the impugned order dated Oct 6, 2025, was set aside.
The government was directed to decide the petitioner’s representation afresh in light of the judgement.
The verdict was announced after hearing arguments from the petitioner’s counsel, law officers representing the federal government, and officials from the Federal Investigation Agency and Immigration and Passports Department.

WITH the writ of Imran Khan over­ruling all others in the PTI, a number of party leaders are starting to become disillusioned with their incarcerated leader’s insistence on agitation rather than nego­tiations, to end the political impasse.
In addition to the five party stalwarts incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi, more leaders have come forward in favour of talks with the government, despite opposition by some within the party, who equate dialogue with surrender.
The Imran loyalists, on the other hand, continue to toe their leader’s line, and are currently busy garnering support for the recent call for nationwide protests, issued by the PTI founder following his conviction in the Toshakhana-II case.
Although the PTI founder has charged leaders of the opposition alliance — Mehmood Khan Acha­kzai and Raja Nasir Abbas — with deciding whether to pursue dialogue with the government or opt for a street protest, his orders to his party are clear: there can be no detente as long as he remains behind bars.
The call for dialogue, however, has gained traction after a letter penned by the seasoned party leaders held in Kot Lakhpat jail received a ‘positive response’ from the prime minister, as well as other government figures.
Even the opposition alliance headed by Mr Achakzai has also expressed its willingness to engage with the government.
However, it seems that the party’s hands will stay tied as long as Mr Khan remains set in his ways. According to PTI leaders, the confusion — or uncertainty — within party circles over whether to prepare for protests or talks is largely attributed to the restrictions on access to Imran Khan.
Talking to Dawn, PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Bilal Ejaz regretted that had “mature politicians” been meeting Mr Khan in jail, things could have been very different.
How would someone kept in isolation react if those meeting him were telling him that millions were ready to join his cause, he posited, claiming that politicians were being kept away from Mr Khan and only non-political and ‘planted persons’ were allowed to meet him in jail.
Akhunzada Hussain, a spokesperson for the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan — the opposition alliance of which PTI is an essential component — is also demanding access to Mr Khan; for the sake of political clarity, and as a part of a series of confidence-building measures.
“Now the ball is in the government’s court; it should notify Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Nasir Abbas as opposition leaders in the two houses of parliament,” he said, adding that the alliance was willing to negotiate without calling off their street mobilisation plans and the protest planned for Feb 8.
He said the alliance had demanded fresh elections and measures to restore the supremacy of the Constitution, adding that they were looking towards PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif to lend a sympathetic ear.
“We are not addressing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, rather his elder brother, and explaining to him the common points.” He claimed that the opposition had continued exchanging notes with the elder Sharif on these issues, while asking the government to come to the table for talks.
Other PTI leaders echoed similar views. Aliya Hamza, who is PTI’s chief organiser in Punjab, said the onus was on the government to create an environment conducive for talks.
“We are not making any illegitimate demand, [rather we are demanding] legitimate constitutional and legal rights, as well as implementation of the jail manual in its letter and spirit,” she said, and alleged that that the government was still picking up party workers and registering cases against them.
When the establishment could talk to Nawaz Sharif while he was in jail, then why can’t they do it with Mr Khan in Adiala, she asked, rhetorically.
Ms Hamza also asserted the PTI would not shy away from protests, but called on the political committee to lay out a clear protest strategy, so that the rank and file they could focus their energies.
Former opposition leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar, who was disqualified in May 9 cases, expressed reservations over the government’s ability to stick to the dialogue process, in light of the crackdown that the PTI was facing.
“We were not even nominated in the FIRs… on the basis of which we were disqualified,” he said, lamenting how parliamentary opposition leaders were disqualified by subordinate courts, even though the prerogative to disqualify a parliamentarian rested with the Supreme Court.
With the subject of talks between the government and agitating political forces has started gaining traction once again, so too has former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry re-emerged.
Some months ago, Mr Chaudhry a few other like-minded former PTI figures had come together to form the National Dialogue Committee, an attempt to lower political tempers.
Talking to Dawn, he said the committee had suggested the prime minister should take confidence-building measures and release the five senior PTI leaders languishing in Kot Lakhpat jail on parole, to enable them to lead and participate effectively in the dialogue process.
Mr Chaudhry was of the opinion that both the establishment and the PTI would have to review their positions, since neither of them were going anywhere. “The country’s political landscape is in a stalemate position,” he said, adding that the government should take a step forward, while the PTI needs to step back to create space and environment for a meaningful dialogue.

ISLAMABAD: The transfer of high court judges is expected in the coming weeks under the 27th Amendment, with sources in the judicial bureaucracy indicating that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) may soon take up the matter formally.
The move will come in light of the 27th Amendment that significantly altered the constitutional scheme governing the transfer of judges of the superior judiciary by empowering the JCP to recommend transfers of judges from one court to another without requiring their consent.
According to sources, the issue of judges’ transfers was discussed informally during a recent interaction among the chief justices of the high courts. The chief justices had assembled earlier this month to attend the 56th meeting of the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee (NJPMC).
Following the meeting, the NJPMC issued a statement highlighting key policy directions, including measures to reduce case backlog, improve the disposal of commercial litigation, and streamline mechanisms relating to tax cases. The statement, however, did not mention any deliberation on the transfer of judges, as the subject was not included in the formal agenda of the committee.
A senior official familiar with the development told Dawn that although the NJPMC did not formally deliberate on the matter, the issue of transfers was discussed informally among the chief justices on the sidelines of the meeting. The official added that the discussions were exploratory in nature and did not amount to any decision.
Sources further said that the JCP was expected to convene a series of meetings over the next month. Besides considering the confirmation of additional judges of the IHC, the LHC and the Balochistan High Court, the commission is likely to take up the issue of transfers as well.
Before the 27th Amend­ment, Article 200 required the consent of the judge proposed to be transferred, in addition to mandatory consultations among the president, the chief justice of Pakistan, and the chief justices of the high courts concerned. The revised constitutional provision replaced this mechanism with a process centred on the JCP.
Under the substituted Article 200, the president may transfer a judge of a high court from one court to another on the recommendation of the JCP. The amendment also addresses the question of seniority, providing that the seniority of a transferred judge shall be reckoned from the date of his initial appointment as a high court judge. However, it expressly bars the transfer of a judge to a high court where, upon transfer, they would become senior to the chief justice of that court. However, in such an eventuality, the transferred judge will be entitled to get an additional allowance. The amendment also made it clear that a judge who would not accept their transfer would accordingly be charged under Article 209 and be tried by the Supreme Judicial Council.
Following the passage of the amendment, reports circulated regarding the likely transfer of a number of judges. According to these reports, around 10 judges of the Lahore High Court (LHC) and four judges of the Islamabad High Court may be assigned to different courts or benches for periods ranging from six months to two years.
The reported proposed postings include benches of the Balochistan High Court, particularly the Zhob bench, as well as the Sindh High Court’s benches at Larkana, Sukkur and Mirpurkhas. No official confirmation had been issued regarding these reports.

DERA ISMAIL KHAN / LAKKI MARWAT / QUETTA: Security forces and police neutralised 11 terrorists, including a high-value target, in separate intelligence-based operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan and Lakki Marwat districts and Balochistan’s Kalat district.
On Wednesday, two “khawarij” were killed in an operation in Dera Ismail Khan’s Kulachi area, the Inter-Services Public Rela­tions (ISPR) said in Thursday’s statement, using the state’s term for members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
During the operation, troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, killing two of them, incl­uding their “ringleader Dilawar”, it said.
According to ISPR, Dilawar was wanted by law enforcement agencies due to his involvement in terrorist activity and the government had put an Rs4 million bounty on him.
The statement added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, who remained actively involved in terrorist activities against the security forces and civilians.
Meanwhile, in Lakki Marwat, a terrorist commander was killed in an exchange of fire with police and the Counter-Terrorism Depar­t­­­ment’s (CTD) Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in Wanda Amir area on Thursday.
A police official said law enforcement personnel, with the support of volunteers from local peace committees, carried out an operation in the rural locality after receiving intelligence about the presence of TTP terrorists.
According to the official, a group of terrorists opened fire on the law enforcers using light and heavy weapons. Police and CTD personnel returned fire, and the exchange continued for some time.
After the firing stopped, police launched a search operation and recovered the body of a terrorist along with arms and ammunition.
The slain terrorist was identified as Barkatullah, also known as Barkati and Abuzar. His accomplices managed to escape, taking advantage of the difficult terrain, the official said.
Kalat operation
In a separate statement, ISPR said security forces conducted an operation in Kalat on Wednesday on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan”, the state’s term for Balochistan-based separatist groups.



It said that during the operation, security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and, after an intense exchange of fire, eight terrorists were killed.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” ISPR said.
Nine children injured
Separately, in KP’s Tank district, at least nine children were injured on Wednesday after a drone strike hit a seminary in Shadi Khel village, within the jurisdiction of Tank Saddar police station, local sources said.
Rescue and hospital officials said Rescue 1122 shifted the injured children to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital, Tank, for treatment. Hospital sources confirmed that the injured included six boys and three girls.
Doctors said all the children were out of danger and in stable condition. Local sources said the strike occurred while the children were attending classes at the seminary.
Three security men, 11 civilians hurt
Meanwhile, the security situation turned tense in the Mir Ali subdivision of North Waziristan on Thursday after an hour-long exchange of heavy fire between security forces and militants, leaving three security personnel and at least 20 civilians injured.
Local sources said the clashes erupted around noon in areas adjoining Mir Ali. During the exchange, three security personnel sustained injuries, while mortar shells landed on residential houses in different localities, injuring at least 20 civilians, including women and children.
Security forces cordoned off Mir Ali Bazaar and the surrounding areas, and intermittent aerial firing was reported, triggering panic among residents.
All commercial activities were suspended as people remained confined to their homes amid fear and uncertainty.
A loud explosion was also heard near the Muski area along the Mir Ali-Khaisoor Road, while a security checkpost at Hasokhel Bridge came under heavy weapons fire.
Intense gunfire was reported in the Muski area, where three security personnel were injured and shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment.
Mortar shells also landed on houses in the Hasokhel, Muski and Ippi areas, causing injuries to civilians, including women and children.
Reacting to the incident, Awami National Party North Waziristan president Malik Nisar Ali expressed grave concern, saying a mortar shell had landed on his house and injured three members of his family.
He said targeting civilians, particularly women and children, was “deeply tragic and unacceptable”, and urged the authorities to ensure the protection of the civilian population and take concrete steps to restore lasting peace.

Ms Malik instructed all ticket-holders, office-bearers, workers and lawyers in the Lahore division to ensure their presence at Liberty Roundabout to welcome Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.  
She urged party members to play their role in “restoring constitution, law and democracy in the country”. 
Ms Malik said it would be a “historic moment” to convert Lahore’s main boulevard into a march for the release of Khan. 
Earlier in the day, she said CM Afridi, his cabinet members and members of the Provincial Assembly would make their first stop in Punjab at Bhera. She asked ticket-holders and party office-bearers from the Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin divisions to welcome Afridi at that location.

Driven by an atmospheric river known as “the Pineapple Express,” which moves heavy moisture from the tropical climes of Hawaii to the United States’ west coast, the storm was expected to deliver months’ worth of rain over a few days.
Early on Thursday, the National Weather Service (NWS) warned about the risk of excessive rainfall over parts of southern California, including in Los Angeles, the second-most populous city in the US.
The NWS warned of a “broad plume of moisture” producing heavy rain in California on Christmas Day, adding there was a “moderate risk” of excessive rainfall over the southern parts of the state.

“Numerous flash flooding events are possible. In addition, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers. The flooding may include debris flows in or near recently burned areas,” the bulletin added, referring to areas affected by wildfires.
The rain was forecast to continue on Friday, the service said.
State authorities declared a state of emergency in several counties, including Los Angeles.
Rescue work
Heavy rain lashed southern California on Wednesday, spawning floods and debris flows. Some communities had already received 25.4 centimetres of rain in the first storm, forecasters said.
The Los Angeles Times reported that at least three people had died in storm-related incidents, including a San Diego man who was killed by a falling tree.
On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works warned Angelenos to stay well away from waterways such as flood control channels, rivers, and streams — even after the rain stopped.
“Water from upstream communities can move quickly through channels with little warning. What may look shallow or calm can suddenly become fast-moving and dangerous,” the agency warned in a post on X.







In San Bernardino County, adjacent to Los Angeles, authorities told AFP they were working to divert the flow of floodwater on Thursday.
Muddy water streamed through the town of Wrightwood a day earlier, trapping people in their homes, said Christopher Prater, spokesperson for the county fire department.
“Fire department personnel were out there rescuing people, assisting them from their houses, getting them to safety, also while effecting rescues from people that were stranded in their vehicles,” he said, with work going on into the night.
Fire-affected communities
Fire-burn scar zones, which are less able to absorb water due to vegetation being stripped from them, were under special alert – including the coastal areas of Pacific Palisades and Malibu, both still recovering from devastating wildfires in January.
In northern California, a dangerous storm was tracked developing early Thursday morning in the San Francisco Bay Area, with an emergency alert for flash flooding issued in the area, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
The National Weather Service was also predicting that a winter storm could bring heavy snowfall to the Sierra Madre Mountains.

Ariel Cohen, an NWS meteorologist, had warned that from Wednesday afternoon through Friday, “many areas will likely experience significant flooding, along with rockslides and mudslides, especially in the higher elevations”.
“If you were planning to travel on the roads during Christmas, please reconsider your plans,” he added.</p><small>2025-12-25 18:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2523131275db5da.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963190/cdf-field-marshal-munir-vows-enhanced-military-cooperation-with-jordanian-military-chief' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir vows enhanced military cooperation with Jordanian military chief</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, on Thursday, received a visit from the Chairman of the Jordanian Joint Chiefs of Staff, Major General Yousef Ahmed Al Huneiti, where the pair vowed to enhance military and bilateral cooperation.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the meeting took place at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where the pair discussed matters of mutual interest and regional security dynamics.
“Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with Jordan and emphasised the importance of collaborative efforts to address evolving security challenges,” the statement read.
“The visiting dignitary (Maj Gen Al-Huneiti) appreciated the professionalism of the Pakistan armed forces and lauded their contributions towards regional peace and stability.”
The ISPR said that the meeting concluded with a shared resolve between Field Marshal Munir and Maj Gen Al-Huneiti to further deepen military cooperation between the two brotherly countries.
On November 16, Field Marshal Munir reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to further enhancing military-to-military cooperation with Jordan and jointly realising the mutual vision of a stable and peaceful region, according to the military’s media affairs wing.
The army chief also underscored the “strong defence partnership” between Pakistan and the Hashemite Kingdom — the royal family of Jordan — during an official visit undertaken by Jordan’s King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein.
On October 23, King Abdullah II lauded the Pakistan military’s contributions towards regional peace and security in a meeting with the Field Marshal, who was on a trip to Jordan at the time.
During the visit, Field Marshal Munir also called on Maj Gen Al-Huneiti at the General Headquarters in Amman, where he was welcomed and presented with a guard of honour on his arrival.</p><small>2025-12-25 18:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2522135217b94de.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963188/bilawal-inaugurates-new-rs72bn-indus-hospital-building' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal inaugurates new Rs72bn Indus Hospital building</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto on Thursday inaugurated a new building of the Indus University Hospital (IUH) – a major project being developed with the provincial government’s support, which is designed to become the country’s largest free-of-charge hospital upon completion over the next three years.
The Rs72 billion facility will have an admission capacity for 1,350 patients upon construction.







“This initiative is designed to meet Karachi’s growing healthcare needs. Upon full completion, the facility will offer comprehensive, free-of-charge healthcare services across a wide range of specialities, benefiting millions of patients annually,” said Bilawal at the inauguration, which was attended by senior government officials, including Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah, Health Secretary Rehan Iqbal Baloch, several donors and representatives of the Indus Hospital and Health Network (IHHN).
The inauguration of this landmark project on Christmas Day carried deep symbolic meaning, he added.
“All religions teach us compassion and the duty to care for the poor, the sick and the most vulnerable segments of society.“
The PPP government, he noted, remained committed to providing world-class healthcare facilities to the people without discrimination of any kind, emphasising that care for the underprivileged lies at the very core of the PPP’s political philosophy.
“Roti, Kapra aur Makaan (bread, clothing and shelter) is not merely a slogan; it is a manifesto, an ideology and a way of life. We believe it is the fundamental responsibility of the state to protect and uplift the poor.”
Highlighting the government’s performance in the health sector, the PPP chairman said that the province’s healthcare system had undergone a transformative change since the party had started running the government.
“We are no longer competing with other provinces; we are competing on a global scale,” he said.
He praised IHHN and other partners of the government for their invaluable contributions, stressing that these partnerships must be further expanded to strengthen healthcare facilities and improve their access to people living in underserved and remote areas.
In his remarks, CM Murad Ali Shah recalled the financial challenges faced in materialising the Indus Hospital’s dream.
“Dr Bari requested a grant of Rs250 to 400 million at the time when I was serving as the provincial revenue minister. A few days later, I visited the facility myself and met several old friends who were volunteering their professional services,” the chief minister recounted, adding that the initial government funds were used for land acquisition.
Murad noted that the initial government grant of Rs300m to the hospital had gradually been raised to Rs8bn.
“The government’s partnership with IHHN, which started with a hospital in Badin, continues to grow. Even today, we cannot imagine replacing Indus there,” he said, adding that the Jamshoro Regional Blood Centre was also handed over to the IHHN, which now has the capacity to supply around 20,000 blood bags across the region.
In addition, he pointed out, the IHNN was also working with the government in areas such as tuberculosis control and rabies prevention, while more initiatives were being planned.
The chief minister also announced plans to further strengthen healthcare services in Badin by linking the entire district to a main hospital and improving taluka headquarters hospitals in partnership with the IHNN.
Sharing patient statistics, Murad said around 30 per cent of patients at the Indus Hospital came from Landhi and Korangi, 20pc from other parts of Karachi, while nearly 50pc arrive from outside Karachi, including large numbers from Balochistan and Punjab.
“This demonstrates that the healthcare work done in Sindh is far ahead of other provinces, and we achieved this with the support of our partners,” he added.
President IHNN Dr Abdul Bari Khan termed the project a transformative development for Pakistan’s healthcare system. He acknowledged the provincial government’s continued cooperation and emphasised that, upon completion, the IUH would set a new benchmark in healthcare.
Chief Executive Officer IHHN Prof Syed Zafar Zaidi said IUH represented an evolution of a vision rooted in compassion, dignity and patient-centred care, bringing care, education and research under one roof.
Chairman IHHN Board of Directors Abdul Karim Paracha expressed deep appreciation for the government of Sindh’s support in advancing healthcare services for the people of the province.
The ceremony concluded with a tour of the newly opened sections of the hospital, including emergency and outpatient services, advanced diagnostic facilities and state-of-the-art operation theatres.
Earlier in December, the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), in partnership with the provincial government, launched two key facilities — Syed Haroon Ahmad Dialysis Centre and Zubeida Mustafa Lithotripsy Unit — at its trust hospital located on Sharea Faisal.
Bilawal had claimed the Sindh government’s performance in the health sector under the public-private partnership model had been highlighted as a success, earning international recognition.
He had also claimed the Economist Intelligence Unit — the research and analysis division of The Economist Group — rated Sindh as the sixth best in partnerships in Asia in 2018.</p><small>2025-12-25 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/25223702e59703d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963189/tribunals-under-punjab-property-ownership-law-yet-to-become-operational' target='_blank'><strong>Tribunals under Punjab property ownership law yet to become operational</strong></a><br><p>The tribunals recently notified by the Punjab government under the property ownership law have yet to become fully operational, as they have not been provided with the requisite staff or designated premises to conduct proceedings.
On Monday, Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Aalia Neelum suspended the operation of the newly enacted Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Ordinance, 2025, which empowers deputy commissioner-led committees to decide property disputes.
In response to the suspension, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz argued that the move would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”.
During Wednesday’s hearing against the law, Justice Neelum remarked that the notification for the tribunals was recently issued after almost two and a half months, but the tribunals were still not functional, noting that neither staff nor place had been designated to the tribunals.
It may be mentioned that the Punjab government had appointed the LHC-nominated judicial officers as members of the tribunals to be established under Section 11 of the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immoveable Property Ordinance 2025.
A notification issued by the Board of Revenue, Punjab, explains judicial officers’ appointment in 36 districts out of 41 districts in the province. All the newly appointed nominees as Members of the Tribunals are retired district and session judges.
The notification says property tribunals established at Rawalpindi and Muzaffargarh shall exercise jurisdiction in the districts of Murree and Kot Addu, respectively, till the nomination of judicial officers by the LHC.
Similarly, the property tribunals of districts Gujrat, Chakwal, and Dera Ghazi Khan shall exercise jurisdiction in Wazirabad, Talagang and Taunsa districts, respectively.
The Punjab government said the property tribunals had been established to save citizens from illegal occupation of their immovable properties and protect their proprietary rights.
The government also said prosecutors, who would draw their salaries from their respective district offices, had also been appointed at respective tribunals to assist in the legal proceedings.
Also, the government entrusted the additional charge of Registrar Tribunals to assistant commissioners (coordination) in respective districts.</p><small>2025-12-25 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/252134069706bd1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963187/anf-seizes-over-304kgs-of-drugs-in-nationwide-operations' target='_blank'><strong>ANF seizes over 304kgs of drugs in nationwide operations</strong></a><br><p>The Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) conducted six operations across the country, arresting four suspects, including a woman, and seizing as many as 304.33 kilogrammes of narcotics valued at over Rs786 million, it emerged on Thursday.
According to an ANF spokesperson, the operations were carried out around educational institutions as well as in several cities as part of ongoing efforts to curb drug trafficking and protect students from narcotics abuse.
In Islamabad, ANF personnel recovered 70 30-gram psychotropic tablets from a suspect near a hotel in the G-9 sector. In another operation, 1.2kgs of hashish was seized from a woman near Shamkot Toll Plaza in Khanewal district.
“The arrested suspects confessed to supplying drugs to students at educational institutions,” the spokesperson said.
Under international drug interdiction efforts, ANF officials recovered 300kgs of crystal methamphetamine, concealed in animal feed, from a container at Karachi Port that was bound for Qatar.
In separate domestic operations, two kilograms of crystal meth were recovered from a truck near a park on Peshawar’s Ring Road and one suspect was arrested. In another action at a courier office on the same road, 100 grams of hashish were seized from a parcel destined for Lahore.
Meanwhile, in an inter-provincial operation, ANF recovered one kilogram of hashish from a suspect near the Old Toll Plaza on the Indus Highway in Kohat.
“Cases have been registered against the arrested suspects under the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, and further investigations are underway,” the spokesperson added.</p><small>2025-12-25 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/252031145e28506.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963186/parents-heres-how-you-can-get-your-slang-loving-kids-to-speak-write-better-no-cap' target='_blank'><strong>Parents, here’s how you can get your slang-loving kids to speak, write better — no cap</strong></a><br><p>Oxford University Press has declared “rage bait” as its 2025 Word of the Year, while Dictionary.com cast its vote for “6 7” and Collins’ Dictionary chose “vibe coding”.
These selections offer a compelling snapshot of prevailing cultural and social trends, particularly among the young digital-native generation, over the past year.
You may have overheard your children saying these very words, perhaps leaving you with a momentary sense of frustration as you struggled to follow their conversation.
Navigating the rapidly evolving vocabulary of youth can feel like deciphering an entirely new language.
But do not worry, the following chat has been decoded to help you “gain aura” (slang for boost one’s cool factor) with your children.
Lucas: Bruh, Jennie just posted that “I study only two hours a day” video again.Zoey: That’s 100 per cent rage bait.(Rage bait: Posting online content just to make people mad and argue in the comments, thereby driving up engagement and traffic.)Lucas: Exactly. She’s just trying to aura farm at this point.(Aura farm: Act confident or mysterious online to gain clout or admiration.)Zoey: But it’s working for her. She is just vibe coding chill energy while everyone in the comments is like “teach me your ways”.(Vibe coding: Creating an app or website using artificial intelligence. But among teens, it can mean doing something to evoke a certain mood.)Lucas: Facts. Meanwhile, I post one chill pic and get two likes – one’s you and one’s mum.Zoey: No cap, that’s a flop era moment right there.(No cap: For real, not lying. Flop era: A phase when you are not doing well or not getting attention.)Lucas: 6 7(6 7: Pronounced “six sevennn”, not sixty-seven. Largely a playful sign-off or an acknowledgement without a concrete meaning, while some say it means “so-so”.)
Young members of Gen Z (13 to 28 years old) and Gen Alpha (age 12 and below) around the world have embraced such slang terms to bond with their peers.
“Language and culture are closely interlinked, so it is unsurprising that dictionary publishers have chosen these words to be their Word of the Year,” says Ms Samantha Tay, an English and creative writing specialist from Grade Solution Learning Centre, which provides online tuition.
“I must admit it is quite impressive how kids and youth these days have created an entirely new vocabulary. The sheer virality of it all is also mind-blowing, considering how the evolution of language typically takes a longer time.”
Social media platforms, such as TikTok, have no doubt accelerated the spread of slang.
“This is why expressions such as 6 7, mid (mediocre) and rizz (charisma), among others, crop up around the globe,” says Associate Professor Csilla Weninger, head of the English language and literature department at the National Institute of Education.
But she notes that it is not a new phenomenon, as slang has always been a part of youth language.
“We know from sociolinguistic research that adolescence is a period of linguistic innovation. This is true for all aspects of language, including vocabulary,” she adds.
Why children and youth use slang terms
Embracing slang is a part of growing up as kids move from childhood to adolescence. It helps them differentiate themselves from adults while also fitting in with their peers.
“By being able to use slang fluently, you show insider affiliation with your peers who can do the same, while marking everyone else an outsider,” says Dr Weninger.
Slang embodies a spirit of playfulness and rule-breaking within language, and this also adds to its appeal.
However, while it reflects today’s cultural and social trends, it is important for your children to maintain a good grasp of standard English.
Ms Tay says: “We discourage students from using slang in their school compositions and in our writing assignments. We don’t want students to write about how their characters were ‘aura farming’ or had so much ‘rizz’.
“They are, after all, still preparing for their examinations, and the Ministry of Education is still strict on what is allowed in compositions. Even ‘kiasu’ (Hokkien or Singlish for ‘fear of losing out’) may be frowned upon despite it being in the Oxford dictionary.”
She notes that some students occasionally slip in slang such as “skibidi” (mostly used as a joke with no real meaning) and “6 7” in their work, because they perceive these to be funny or creative.
In such instances, she guides them towards alternative, technique-based writing methods to achieve the same effect.
Being a strong advocate for reading, she encourages her students to pick up books.
“The more children are exposed to good writing, the more their language ability will improve. Books are typically written in standard English. That’s where students can pick up on what proper English looks and sounds like.”
Guiding kids to speak and write better
It is unavoidable that your children will use slang. Ms Tay recommends keeping up with the latest popular slang and adapt to its evolution, which is driven by social media trends. While some slang terms have become mainstream, others can get outdated almost as soon as you learn them.
This helps you to communicate better with your children and support them in maintaining a strong command of English.
She says: “If you want to teach your kids to use proper English, being fluent in Gen Alpha will be helpful. You have to know the terms in order to teach them how to switch to standard English whenever necessary.”
For example, when they write “Jennie is delulu” in their composition, guide them to use “delusional” instead.
Dr Weninger suggests you can show curiosity and interest by asking your children to explain the latest slang.
She adds: “We need to let teens own slang – it is their turf.”
However, it is important to help them see that while slang has a place in their communication with their friends, it is not necessarily appropriate for family interactions.
“When children use slang with their parents, this informal approach can come across as disrespectful. Parents may feel they are being addressed as one of their children’s peers,” says Dr Weninger.
“I’m not sure how many mums like to be called ‘bro’ by their teenage sons.”
Teach your children to adapt their language use – both spoken and written – based on whom they are talking to, where they are and how formal the situation is.
She suggests: “Share examples from your workplace. How do the ways you talk to your work friends, the messages you exchange, or the topics you discuss differ from how you interact with your superiors or clients?”
Such an understanding is also part of language development. Children who develop this skill are able to demonstrate empathy and social intelligence, and hence can speak more effectively and form better relationships.
She adds: “It is also a good idea for your kids to think about how we constantly judge people – rightly or wrongly – based on how they communicate.”

According to security sources, Fitna al Khawarij militants attempted to attack a convoy on the main highway.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to local sources, the clashes erupted around noon in adjoining areas of Mir Ali. During the exchange, three security personnel sustained injuries, while mortar shells landed on residential houses in different localities of Hasokhel, Muski and Ippi areas, injuring 20 civilians, including women and children.
Security forces cordoned off Mir Ali Bazaar and surrounding areas, while intermittent aerial firing was reported, triggering panic among residents. All commercial activities were suspended as people remained confined to their homes amid fear and uncertainty.
Sources said the Bannu–Miranshah main road was completely closed for all kinds of traffic at the Khajori checkpost, resulting in long queues of vehicles and causing severe inconvenience to travelers.
Meanwhile, a loud explosion was heard near the Muski area on Mir Ali–Khaisoor Road, while a security check post at the Hasokhel Bridge came under heavy weapon attack. Intense gunfire was exchanged between security forces and militants in the Muski area, leaving three security personnel injured, who were shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment.
Medical Superintendent of Mir Ali DHQ Hospital, Dr Munir Aslam, said that 20 injured persons were brought to the hospital, seven of whom were referred to Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital in Bannu due to their critical condition, while treatment of the remaining injured is underway.
Sources added that local residents, carrying white flags, continued to shift the injured to hospitals despite the difficult and dangerous situation.
Reacting to the incident, Awami National Party North Waziristan President Malik Nisar Ali expressed grave concern, stating: “Unfortunately, a mortar shell also landed on my house, injuring three members of my family. Targeting innocent civilians, especially women and children, is deeply tragic and unacceptable.”
He urged the authorities to ensure the protection of civilian population and take serious steps for lasting peace in the area.
Following the incident, security forces launched a search operation in the area, while the situation remained tense till the filing of this report.
Multiple incidents of terrorism and violence have been reported from Mir Ali lately.
In October, four terrorists were killed by the security forces, foiling a suicide attack on a military camp in Mir Ali.
Earlier this month, unidentified militants blew up a government primary school in Mir Ali, jeopardising the future of more than 600 school-going children.
Days later, a government school in the same district with over 250 enrolled girls was destroyed with explosives.</p><small>2025-12-25 15:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2519421757679b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963185/pti-requests-ecp-to-extend-deadline-for-nomination-papers-in-islamabad-local-body-polls' target='_blank'><strong>PTI requests ECP to extend deadline for nomination papers in Islamabad local body polls</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Thursday approached the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) with a request for a three-day extension to the submission deadline for nomination papers in local body elections in Islamabad.
According to the application, submitted to the ECP’s Diary Branchand available with Dawn, Baldiat Committee Secretary Anjum Shahzad Tanoli requested that the chief election commissioner extend the deadline to December 27.
“With due respect, this is to draw your kind attention towards the schedule of local body elections in Islamabad, wherein the last date for submission of nomination papers has been fixed as 27th December,“ the application read.
It noted that the government announced a local holiday on December 26, stating that it would significantly affect the process of filing nomination papers.
“Islamabad comprises 125 union councils (UCs), and in each union council, at least nine councillors are required to submit their nomination papers,“ the application stated.
“The announced holiday will create serious administrative and logistical difficulties for candidates, proposers, and concerned offices, leading to unnecessary congestion and hardship on the final day.”
Based on the delay caused by a public holiday, Tanoli requested that the ECP extend the deadline to file nomination papers by at least three days “in the larger interest of transparency, fairness, and effective participation in the democratic process”.
PTI Regional President Amir Mughal, while talking to Dawn, said that there is insufficient time for the nomination process in the local government elections’ first phase. The poll covers 125 UCs and 1,125 councillors.
He also criticised amendments made to the Local Government Act of 2015, claiming that the law was altered with malicious intent to promote rigging and horse-trading.
Mughal further highlighted that direct elections for the chairman and vice-chairman posts had been abolished, and a new law was introduced to “manipulate councillors’ loyalty after they win, pressuring them to change their loyalties”.
“Despite these challenges, PTI is committed to actively participating in local elections as the people of Islamabad have always supported PTI and rejected the PML-N,” he claimed.
Mughal also emphasised that due to the ECP’s decisionto revoke the PTI’s election symbol, all party workers have been instructed to declare themselves as candidates under the “Sunni Ittehad Council” banner in their nomination papers.
The ECP has already announced the schedule for local government elections in the Islamabad Capital Territory. The term of the local government expired in February 2021, but elections could not be held and were further delayed due to “new legislation”.
In a notification also posted on social media, the ECP invited nomination papers to be issued by returning officers (RO) on December 19, while December 22-27 (excluding Quaid-i-Azam Day on December 25) were set as the dates for filing of nomination papers with the ROs by the candidates.







The names of nominated candidates will be published on December 29, while the nomination papers will be scrutinised by ROs from December 30 to January 3, 2026.
From January 5-8, appeals may be filed against the decisions of the ROs to accept or reject the nominations. These appeals will be decided by the Appellate Authority from January 9-13, and the revised candidate list will be published on January 14.
January 15 is the final day a candidate can withdraw from the elections, the day after which election symbols will be allotted and the list of contesting candidates published.
Polling will take place on February 15, with the results being consolidated between February 16 and 19.
The ECP, in its notification, added that polling hours will be observed from 8am to 4pm and that all polling activities would take place during office hours.</p><small>2025-12-25 14:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/25182759cb9bdfd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963183/pakistan-adb-sign-two-key-initiatives-worth-730m-in-power-state-owned-enterprises-sector' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, ADB sign two key initiatives worth $730m in power, state-owned enterprises sector</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed two major initiatives — a power transmission strengthening project and an accelerating state-owned enterprise (SOE) transformation programme — totalling $730 million that would relieve overloading of existing transmission lines and improve operational efficiency.
At the beginning of this year, Pakistan and ADB signed an agreement to provide $200 million in support to the country’s ailing power distribution system through network improvement.
In the recent agreement, the second power transmission strengthening project amounts to $330m, while the accelerating SOE transformation programme is worth $400m, according to a statement issued on Thursday.
Ministry of Economic Affairs Secretary Muhammad Humair Karim appreciated the Manila-based lending agency’s role and its continued support in advancing critical infrastructure and governance reforms, the statement said.
He highlighted that the transmission project would “enable reliable evacuation of 2,300 megawatt from upcoming hydropower projects, relieve overloading of existing transmission lines and enhance resilience under contingency conditions“.
Karim added that the SOE transformation programme would improve “operational efficiency, particularly focusing on the National Highway Authority (NHA)”.
The secretary emphasised that “both initiatives are transformative in nature as the transmission project will secure Pakistan’s energy future by strengthening the backbone of the national grid, whereas the SOE programme will enhance transparency, efficiency and sustainability of state-owned enterprises nationwide”.
ADB Country Director Emma Fan appreciated Pakistan’s strong commitment to the initiatives, emphasising the significance of the transmission project in strengthening energy infrastructure.
Fan highlighted that “the significance of the SOEs transformation programme comes at a critical time in Pakistan, and it will further strengthen the reform efforts” of Pakistan.
Last month, ADB approved two loans totalling $330 million for Pakistan to build a transmission line from Islamabad to Faisalabad, the industrial hub of Punjab.</p><small>2025-12-25 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/250933067e36711.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963159/ex-sapm-mirza-shahzad-akbar-attacked-in-uk' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-SAPM Mirza Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK</strong></a><br><p>LONDON: Former special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) Mirza Shahzad Akbar was attacked in the United Kingdom, where he has been living in self-imposed exile since April 2022, leaving him sustaining facial injuries, including “bruising and a fractured nose”, it emerged on Thursday.
“I have been attacked and been in the hospital and with the police. Bruised and fractured [sic],” the ex-SAPM said in text messages after Dawn reached out to him, seeking confirmation of a post about the incident on PTI’s X account.
The PTI’s post at 9:50pm PKT on Wednesday said Akbar was attacked at his house in Cambridge in the morning.
“The attacker punched him repeatedly in the face, as a result of which his nose and jaw were fractured,” it said.
“Local police have collected all details, and an investigation is underway,” the party said.
Later, taking to the X platform, Akbar denounced the attack as “cowardly” and expressed “full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement” in ensuring justice.
“Yesterday at approximately 8:08am, I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” he wrote.
“The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”







Akbar said he called the emergency services and was taken to the hospital, where he received medical treatment and was later discharged.
“I sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose.”
“The police have taken cognisance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he stated.
He was also prevented from sharing further details on the advice of the authorities at this stage, including CCTV footage or photographs, saying he was not “at liberty”. “As doing so may compromise the ongoing investigation.”
“I also urge the British government to ensure that England remains a safe place for everyone, including dissidents such as myself. I want to make one thing absolutely clear: if my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ are not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me.”
He continued: “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out. I will continue to expose corruption, human rights violations, and the erosion of democratic norms in Pakistan.”
He also clarified that any images circulating on social media purporting to show his injuries would be fake and AI-generated.
Akbar, who was the accountability adviser in the PTI government, was previously also attacked in November 2023 at his home in Hertfordshire.
The attacker, a masked individual, had thrown acidic liquid at Akbar, the former SAPM had shared in a post on X, adding that, “I will not be intimidated nor bow down to those who are doing this”.
Akbar had linked the attack to the Al Qadir Trust case against PTI founder Imran Khan, alleging that security agencies were harassing him to give evidence against the ex-premier.
Separately, he had told Dawn, “I have been sent messages in recent months by people who are clearly not happy with me. I’ve been told to mend my ways or else…”
Akbar had initiated legal action against the government of Pakistan in a UK court in April 2024 over the acid attack. He told Dawn that he had also sent notices to the Pakistan High Commission in UK and other Pakistani officials.
However, in May 2024, the Foreign Office had “categorically rejected” what it said were “preposterous” claims by Akbar about the alleged involvement of state officials in the 2023 acid attack on him.
Meanwhile, Akbar has been declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court in a case pertaining to alleged controversial statements made on X. Subsequently, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott, handing over extradition papers for Akbar.
While Pakistan does not have a formal extradition treaty with the UK, both countries do have an agreement in place whereby London can repatriate Pakistani nationals involved in crimes and violating immigration laws.</p><small>2025-12-25 14:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/25172748bb565d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963181/senior-is-leader-killed-in-coordination-with-us-led-coalition-syrian-officials-say' target='_blank'><strong>Senior IS leader killed in coordination with US-led coalition, Syrian officials say</strong></a><br><p>Syrian authorities on Thursday said they killed a senior leader in the Islamic State group in coordination with the US-led coalition, hours after the arrest near Damascus of another leader.
Syrian security and intelligence forces, working in coordination with the international coalition, conducted what the interior ministry described as a “precise security operation”.
“The operation resulted in neutralising the terrorist Mohammad Shahada, known as Abu Omar Shaddad, who is considered one of the prominent IS leaders in Syria,” it added.
“This operation comes as confirmation of the effectiveness of joint coordination between the national security agencies and international partners.”
Hours earlier, authorities said they captured Taha al-Zoubi, also known as Abu Omar Tabiya, an IS leader in Damascus, along with several of his men on Wednesday.
A December 13 attack killed two US soldiers and an American civilian.
Washington blamed the attack on a lone IS gunman in Syria’s Palmyra.
In retaliation, US forces conducted strikes on scores of IS targets in Syria.
The strikes killed five members of the terrorist group, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
In November, during a visit by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa to Washington, Syria officially joined the US-led coalition against IS.
Sharaa was formerly affiliated with Al Qaeda and fought IS at the height of his country’s civil war.</p><small>2025-12-25 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/251816097f37578.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963182/pakistans-historic-murree-brewery-cheers-export-licence' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s historic Murree brewery cheers export licence</strong></a><br><p>A heady aroma of malt and brewing yeast drifts through Pakistan’s oldest and, by far, largest brewery, which is gearing up for expansion after receiving approval to sell abroad after a nearly 50-year ban.
Bottles and cans clatter along the production lines at Murree Brewery, founded in 1860 to quench the thirst of British soldiers and the colonial community during the Raj. It has survived opposition and strict regulations to become one of Pakistan’s most well-known companies.
“It’s a journey of a roller-coaster and resilience,” Isphanyar Bhandara, the third generation of his family to run the business, told AFP in an interview.
“Getting permission to export is another happy milestone,” he added. “My grandfather and late father tried to get the export licence, but couldn’t get it. Just because, you know, we are an Islamic country.”

However, Bhandara said he got “a rude surprise” in 2017 when the Chinese-run Hui Coastal Brewery and Distillery got permission to brew beer in Pakistan, mainly for the thousands of Chinese working on major infrastructure projects in the country.
“What happened to all the lectures?” said Bhandara, who hails from the small but influential Parsi community and is also a lawmaker in the National Assembly.
Soon, he embarked on the years-long lobbying effort to lift the export ban.
Peculiar profits
Originally housed in the mountains outside Islamabad, Murree’s red-brick facility now sits in Rawalpindi.
Revenue surpassed $100 million in the fiscal year to June, with alcohol sales generating just over half of the total and non-alcoholic drinks and bottle making accounting for the rest.

Expanding horizons
Before the export ban, Murree had sold its products in neighbouring India and Afghanistan, but also in Gulf countries and as far as the United States.
“It sounds very strange or very bizarre today, but we were exporting to Kabul,” Bhandara said.
Murree has already made limited shipments to Japan, Britain and Portugal as it explores distribution channels and strategies.
“Right now, the target is not revenue or to make money… the target is to explore new markets”, Bhandara said.
The company, which has around 2,200 employees, is looking in particular at Europe, but is also weighing a move into Asian and African markets. Selling abroad could also give Murree a chance to promote its history and brand in ways unimaginable at home.
“We are not allowed to advertise, so we keep our heads down — we try to make a good beer with our heads down,” Bhandara said.</p><small>2025-12-25 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/251635140feff7c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963176/mobs-vandalise-christmas-decorations-in-parts-of-india-ahead-of-the-festival-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Mobs vandalise Christmas decorations in parts of India ahead of the festival: reports</strong></a><br><p>There have been multiple incidents of mobs vandalising Christmas decorations in India ahead of the festival, according to local media.
The Indian Express has reported that a mob, armed with wooden sticks, vandalised Christmas decorations and installations at a mall in the Raipur city of India’s Chhattisgarh state.

The report also mentioned that the incident took place on the same day when a Hindu organisation, Sarva Hindu Samaj, had called a Chhattisgarh bandh — a form of protest — against alleged religious conversions. According to The Hindu, the protest was also called following clashes over the “burial of a person from a converted family” in the Kanker district.
The Indian Express carried an account of the incident as narrated by an employee of the mall, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“Around 80-90 people barged in […] we were supporting the protest. For the last 16 years, since we began operations here, we have always supported bandh calls. But I have never seen such behaviour. The mob threatened us […] shouted at us. They indulged in violence,” the report quoted the employee as saying.
Another employee, who also spoke anonymously to The Indian Express, said: “Some women were crying … they (the mob) were charging at all those who were trying to stop them. They kept saying we do not want to see Santa. People who had come to watch movies got scared.”
Videos, that were said to be of the incident that took place at Magneto Mall, were also circulating on social media.







Separately, The Hindu reported that members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad Bajrang Dal — which has been classified as a Hindu militant organisation by the US Central Intelligence Agency — vandalised a school, disrupting Christmas preparations, in the Nalbari district of Assam on Wednesday.
The Hindu’s report, citing police, said Bajrang Dal members also damaged festival items at shops in Assam.
It further quoted an unidentified police official as saying that Bajrang Dal members also staged a protest against Christmas celebrations in Nalbari.
“The activists entered the St Mary’s School of Panigaon village and vandalised the preparation of the Christmas Day programme. They burnt down the banner and posters of the celebration,” the official said, according to The Hindu.
He was further quoted as saying that Bajrang Dal activists had raised the slogan of “Jai Shree Ram” and warned the administration against celebrating Christmas at the school.
“They then went to various shops selling Christmas goods in Nalbari town and set fire to some items in front of the shops near the Jain Mandir in the town,” he said.
The Hindu reported that Bajrang Dal members also burned goods at shops selling Christmas items.
The report also carried a statement by Bajrang Dal Nalbari District Secretary Bhaskar Deka, who said while speaking to the media that “we don’t want Christian festivals here. Trade in any festival-related items of Indian origin. But we do not accept doing business with a festival of non-Indian origin.”
An earlier report by the news website stated that Kerala’s Education Minister V. Sivankutty had “flagged incidents of school managements calling off Christmas celebrations under pressure, allegedly from Hindu far-right groups owing allegiance to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh”.
The Hindu also reported that there was uproar on social media after videos of some individuals, reportedly belonging to Hindu right-wing groups, standing outside a church in Bareilly and reciting religious verses amid police presence before Christmas.







“The group consisting of roughly 20-25 people also raised slogans of Jai Shree Ram,” the report said.</p><small>2025-12-25 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/25160613892f0a3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963175/north-koreas-kim-visits-nuclear-subs-as-putin-hails-invincible-bond' target='_blank'><strong>North Korea’s Kim visits nuclear subs as Putin hails ‘invincible’ bond</strong></a><br><p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a nuclear submarine factory and received a message from Russia’s Vladimir Putin hailing the countries’ “invincible friendship”, Pyongyang’s state media said Thursday.
North Korea and Russia have drawn closer since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, and Pyongyang has sent troops to fight for Russia.
In return, Russia is sending North Korea financial aid, military technology and food and energy supplies, analysts say.
The “heroic” efforts of North Korean soldiers in Russia’s Kursk region “clearly proved the invincible friendship” between Moscow and Pyongyang, Putin said in a message to Kim, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Their work demonstrated the nations’ “militant fraternity”, Putin said in the message received by Pyongyang last week.
The provisions of the “historic treaty” the two leaders signed last year, which includes a mutual defence clause, had been fulfilled “thanks to our joint efforts”, Putin wrote.
South Korean and Western intelligence agencies have estimated that the North has sent thousands of soldiers to Russia, primarily to Kursk, along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems.
Around 2,000 troops have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to South Korean estimates.
North Korea acknowledged this month that its troops in Kursk had been assigned to clear mines and that some had died on deployment.
KCNA reported Putin’s letter on the same day that it published details of Kim’s undated recent visit to a manufacturing base for nuclear-powered submarines.
There, the North Korean leader vowed to counter the “threat” of South Korea producing its own such vessels.
US President Donald Trump has given the green light for South Korea to build “nuclear-powered attack submarines”, though key details of the project remain uncertain.
Photos published by KCNA showed Kim walking alongside a purportedly 8,700-tonne submarine at an indoor assembly site, surrounded by officials and his daughter Kim Ju Ae.
In another image, Kim Jong Un smiles during an official briefing as Kim Ju Ae stands beside him.
Pyongyang would view Seoul developing nuclear subs as “an offensive act severely violating its security and maritime sovereignty”, Kim Jong Un said, according to KCNA.
It was therefore “indispensable” to “accelerate the radical development of the modernisation and nuclear weaponisation of the naval force”, he said.
Kim clarified a naval reorganisation plan and learned about research into “new underwater secret weapons”, KCNA said, without giving details.
Pyongyang’s defence ministry said it would consider “countermeasures” against US “nuclear muscle flexing”, a separate report said Thursday.
Help from Russia?
Only a handful of countries have nuclear-powered submarines, and the United States considers its technology among the most sensitive and tightly guarded military secrets.
In the North’s first comments on the US-South Korea deal, a commentary piece by KCNA last month said the programme was a “dangerous attempt at confrontation” that could lead to a “nuclear domino phenomenon”.
Hong Min, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP the submarine photos raise “considerable speculation” over whether Russia helped North Korea assemble a nuclear-powered submarine “within such a short time frame”.
Kim also reportedly oversaw the test launch on Wednesday of “new-type high-altitude long-range anti-air missiles” over the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan.
The projectiles hit mock targets at an altitude of 200 kilometres (124 miles), KCNA said. That height, if correct, would be in space.
One photo showed a missile ascending into the sky in a trail of intense orange flame, while another showed Kim walking in front of what appeared to be a military vehicle equipped with a vertical missile launcher.
Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said they had been aware of the launch preparations and had braced for the firing in advance.
“South Korean and US intelligence authorities are currently closely analysing the specifications,” it said.</p><small>2025-12-25 12:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2519282959dd654.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963180/nccia-busts-international-cartel-involved-in-60m-cyber-fraud-arrests-15-foreigners-from-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>NCCIA busts ‘international cartel’ involved in $60m cyber fraud, arrests 15 foreigners from Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has busted an “international cartel” involved in cyber fraud amounting to $60 million, arresting 15 foreign nationals and recovering 10,000 international SIMs during a raid in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA), Sindh home minister revealed on Thursday.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi along with NCCIA Additional Director Tariq Nawaz, Sindh Home Minister Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjar shared the details of the investigations, saying the held scammers were “operating online investment scam, where criminals build trust over weeks/months via social media platforms by tricking the victims into investment in cryptocurrency, forex with promise of large profit returns”.
“The victims were lured into investment by creating a login on fake investment platforms (which the victims considered as legitimate due to the fake conversation and activity in telegraph groups) which were controlled and managed by these scammers where the victims were made to believe that this is their investment portal login and time to time they were shown high profits in that fake online portal,” Lanjar said.
The home minister said that a total of 15 foreigners, including three women and 19 Pakistani nationals, were arrested last week during a joint raid by NCCIA and other intelligence and law enforcement agencies in DHA Phase 1 and Phase 6.
Lanjar informed the attendees that an “international cartel” was involved in the scam.
“We recovered 37 computers and 40 mobile phones, along with over 10,000 international SIMs and six unlawful gateway exchanges, ” he stated, adding that the confiscated items were mainly used in “creating fake accounts on social media and Telegram to generate a fake audience and participants in groups mainly on Telegram.“
He said these foreign SIMs were used to receive PIN codes and one-time passwords (OTPs) during the creation of Telegram IDs, and also to communicate on WhatsApp, if required.
Lanjar said the scammers’ main parts of business pertained to “managing and creating Telegram accounts, groups and social media accounts using foreign SIMs to target convincing victims and luring them to invest”.
“Other parts of the business were related to the collection and routing of funds in bank accounts of a target country, which involves local arrangements and conversion of funds into Crypto and movement across borders to the main beneficiaries.”
The home minister revealed that “the technical and financial investigation has led to a series of further developments which are being investigated.”
Modus operandi
The home minister said the scammers’ modus operandi was to “give hope” to locals and foreigners that their money was being invested in business and profit was also being shown, but it was not being sent into the victims’ accounts”.
He revealed that when the amount reached $5,000, the scammers started asking the victims/customers to submit a fee under different pretexts, and when the money was deposited, the suspects used to block the accounts.
The minister estimated that this fraud “amounted to $60m.
Responding to a question, the minister said he was holding a press conference after a “comprehensive” investigation by the NCCIA, as it was a “serious issue” in which foreigners from two or three countries were involved, with whom Pakistan had important relations, thus he was waiting for a proper investigation report to share it with the media.
He said the foreign and interior ministries had taken up this issue of the involvement of foreigners in the scam with their countries.
“The government and law enforcers tended to provide security and protocol to foreigners, but legal action would be taken against them if found involved in criminal activity.”
However, the home minister avoided repeated questions about revealing the nationality of held foreigners.
Lanjar said he also received calls from the citizens, complaining that “illegal” call centres were being used for fraud, narcotics and other crimes.
He said the NCCIA centres in Hyderabad and Sukkur were also receiving complaints about such fraud and crimes.
To a question regarding the law which governs these call centres, Lanjar replied that the “federal government gives no objection certificates (NOCs) and regulates them”.
He affirmed, “Things will not get resolved after these arrests; we need to work more.”
NCCIA Additional Director Tariq Nawaz said that both “foreign nationals and locals were involved in this, and the victims had not only been locals but foreign nationals, too.“
“Crime has no boundaries, and the cyber world has no specific geographical locations.”
He termed this as just the “tip of the iceberg”.
“We hope that after this action, there will be a significant decline in online fraud.”
On Sunday, a judicial magistrate sent 22 suspects, including eight foreign nationals, to prison on judicial remand in the following case.
NCCIA had registered a case against the held suspects under various provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) and the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2025-12-25 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2515180579c86df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963174/in-first-christmas-sermon-pope-leo-decries-conditions-for-palestinians-in-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>In first Christmas sermon, Pope Leo decries conditions for Palestinians in Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Pope Leo decried conditions for Palestinians in Gaza in his Christmas sermon on Thursday, in an unusually direct appeal during what is normally a solemn, spiritual service on the day Christians across the globe celebrate the birth of Jesus.
Leo, the first US pope, said the story of Jesus being born in a stable showed that God had “pitched his fragile tent” among the people of the world.
“How, then, can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold?” he asked.
Leo, celebrating his first Christmas after being elected in May by the world’s cardinals to succeed the late Pope Francis, has a more quiet, diplomatic style than his predecessor and usually refrains from making political references in his sermons.
But the new pope has also lamented the conditions for Palestinians in Gaza several times recently and told journalists last month that the only solution in the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people must include a Palestinian state.
Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October after two years of intense Israeli bombardment and military operations in the besieged enclave, but humanitarian agencies say there is still too little aid getting into Gaza, where nearly the entire population is homeless.
In Thursday’s service with thousands in St. Peter’s Basilica, Leo also lamented conditions for the homeless across the globe and the destruction caused by the wars roiling the world.
“Fragile is the flesh of defenseless populations, tried by so many wars, ongoing or concluded, leaving behind rubble and open wounds,” said the pope.
“Fragile are the minds and lives of young people forced to take up arms, who on the front lines feel the senselessness of what is asked of them and the falsehoods that fill the pompous speeches of those who send them to their deaths,” he said.
Later on Thursday, the pope will deliver a twice-yearly “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message and blessing, which usually addresses global conflicts.</p><small>2025-12-25 11:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/251121538b7b329.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963161/christian-community-an-integral-part-of-pakistans-national-fabric-says-pm-shehbaz-in-christmas-message' target='_blank'><strong>Christian community an integral part of Pakistan’s national fabric, says PM Shehbaz in Christmas message</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that Pakistan’s Christian community, which is celebrating Christmas today, is an integral part of the country’s national fabric.
“Pakistan’s Christian community forms an integral part of our national fabric. Their enduring contributions to education, healthcare, and social welfare, and their sacrifices alongside the nation in the fight against terrorism, are deeply valued and a source of collective pride,” the premier said in his Christmas message on the social media platform X.







He extended his “warmest greetings” to the Christian community across the world, and “especially to our Christian brothers and sisters in Pakistan”.
“May this festive season fill hearts with joy, strengthen bonds of harmony, and bring peace, hope, and prosperity to all,” the premier said.
Separately, a statement carried by state-run APP quoted him as saying that Christmas “conveys a universal message of love, peace, tolerance, and goodwill for all humanity”.
He highlighted the role of the Christian community in Pakistan, saying that they were “an active, positive and peaceful segment of society and had rendered commendable services in education, healthcare and other sectors, contributing to social harmony and national development”.
The premier said ensuring equal rights, freedoms, economic well-being, and equal opportunities for all citizens without discrimination remained among the top priorities of the government and urged people of all faiths to work together for a strong, secure, and prosperous Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz also spoke at a ceremony held in relevance to Christmas in Islamabad.
He hailed the “valuable and historic” role of Pakistan‘s minorities, especially that of the Christian community, saying that they had been contributing to the country’s progress and prosperity since its independence.

The Christian community had played an impressive role in education, healthcare, defence and other areas, the premier said, remembering Justice Alvin Robert Cornelius, Dr Ruth Pfau and Cecil Chaudhry.

 

The recent conflict with India in May particularly enlivened the memory of Chaudhry, who was a hero of the 1965 war.
PM Shehbaz also recalled that Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah had clearly stated in his addresses that in Pakistan, everyone would be able to visit their places of worship and perform their rituals without any fear.
These ideals were now part of the Constitution, he added.
PM Shehbaz also lauded those “Christian brothers” who had sacrificed their lives for the country, especially mentioning Sepoy Haroon William, a member of the armed forces who lost his life in Kurram district last year.
He assured that any injustice to minorities, be it Christians, Hindus, Parsis or Sikhs, would not be allowed and stopped by means of law.
“I assure you that this country belongs to all of us. We all have equal rights here. So, as the prime minister of Pakistan, I assure you of our full support in your journey of progress and prosperity. We will stand by you for the protection of your rights and no one will be allowed to do any kind of injustice to you,” he said.
‘Christmas a time of hope, peace, compassion’
According to state broadcaster PTV News, President Asif Ali Zardari also extended greetings and wishes to Christians in Pakistan and across the world on Christmas.
In his message, he said, “Christmas is a time of hope, peace and compassion. The message of love and service to humanity that this season brings reminds us of the deep bonds that unite all people.”







He also recalled Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah‘s address to the first Constituent Assembly on August 11, 1947, saying that he had articulated a vision of Pakistan rooted in freedom and equality for all.
The president’s message cited an excerpt from the Quaid’s speech, stating: “You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan.
“You may belong to any religion, caste or creed — that has nothing to do with the business of the State.”
President Zardari said that “these words remain a powerful commitment to religious freedom and mutual respect among citizens”.
He highlighted that Christian citizens of Pakistan had made important contributions to society in politics, national defence, education, literature, arts, music, healthcare, social welfare and public service.
“Their efforts strengthen our shared progress and enrich our national life.”
The president further stated that Pakistan’s Constitution guaranteed equal rights and freedom of religion for every citizen.
“We remain committed to fostering harmony, mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among all communities. Our diversity is a source of strength and should inspire greater unity, understanding and cooperation,” he said.
The president concluded his message, saying, “May the spirit of Christmas inspire us all to uphold compassion and justice and to work together for the welfare of our nation.”
Field Marshal Munir joins community in Christmas celebrations
Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir joined the Christmas festivities at Christ Church in Rawalpindi, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Thursday.
According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Field Marshal extended his “heartfelt Christmas greetings and best wishes for peace, harmony and prosperity to the [Christian] community”.
He also paid tribute to the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, on his birth anniversary.
“The Field Marshal highlighted the founder’s vision of equality, freedom and religious tolerance, emphasising the protection of minority rights as a cornerstone of Pakistan’s ideology,” the statement read.
Field Marshal Munir also interacted with members of the congregation, highlighting the contributions of Pakistani Christians to national development and security, including their “proud and distinguished service in Pakistan’s armed forces across generations”.

As per the statement, the CDF stressed the importance of interfaith harmony, mutual respect and unity.
“Pakistan’s strength lies in its diversity, equal opportunities and shared constitutional values beyond religion, ethnicity, caste and creed,” he was quoted as saying.
He “reaffirmed armed forces’ commitment to upholding the dignity, security and equal rights of all citizens, as enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan,” the statement added.
ISPR said that Christian community’s leaders expressed their gratitude for the Field Marshal’s visit, acknowledging the role of the armed forces in protecting Pakistan, inclusivity, religious harmony and national unity.
Earlier, a separate statement by ISPR said that the armed forces also extended “heartfelt” Christmas greetings to the Christian community, acknowledging their valuable contributions to the nation’s progress.
It said that the armed forces reaffirm the commitment to the Quaid’s vision of equal rights, religious freedom and harmony for all citizens.</p><small>2025-12-25 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2510415602b4ade.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963160/quaid-i-azams-vision-ideals-in-focus-as-nation-celebrates-his-149th-birth-anniversary' target='_blank'><strong>Quaid-i-Azam’s vision, ideals in focus as nation celebrates his 149th birth anniversary</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s civil and military leadership highlighted Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s vision of a sovereign, democratic and inclusive nation as the country celebrated his 149th birth anniversary on Thursday.
According to state-broadcaster Radio Pakistan, the day began with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and 21-gun salutes in provincial capitals.
Special prayers were offered at mosques after Fajr for the Quaid, as well as for the peace, prosperity and development of the country, the Radio Pakistan report said.
A change of guard ceremony was also held at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi.







‘A visionary leader and a statesman of global stature’
In his message on the Quaid’s birth anniversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said: “This day offers an opportunity for collective reflection and renewal of our commitment to the Quaid’s guiding principles — democracy, constitutionalism, social justice, religious harmony, and the vision of a welfare state grounded in equality and the rule of law.”
He said the Quaid’s enduring ideals of faith, unity, and discipline remained the foundation of our national strength and a guiding light for future generations.







“A visionary leader and a statesman of global stature, Quaid-i-Azam’s political wisdom, unwavering resolve, and selfless struggle altered the course of history and made possible the creation of an independent homeland for the Muslims of the subcontinent,” the premier further stated.
He ended his message with reaffirming “our collective resolve to follow in the footsteps of the Quaid-i-Azam and to carry forward his enduring legacy, in the service of Pakistan’s honour, security, progress, and prosperity”.
‘Quaid’s principles central to our national journey’
Similarly, President Asif Ali Zardari emphasised the “enduring relevance of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s leadership” and urged the nation to renew its commitment to the democratic and inclusive ideals laid down by him.
Paying tribute to him on his birth anniversary, the president said in a statement that the Quaid’s leadership, vision, and guiding principles continued to inspire the nation in facing contemporary challenges.
The Quaid, he said, “exemplified conviction, perseverance, and hard work that laid the foundation of Pakistan. The Quaid’s principles of democracy, justice, and equality remained central to the country’s national journey and must continue to shape its institutions and decision-making”.
The president said the Quaid’s call for unity, faith, and discipline provided a clear direction to the nation, adding that these ideals were essential for progress, social cohesion, and national confidence.
He urged the nation, particularly the youth, to uphold the Quaid’s ideals and contribute to building a “peaceful, inclusive, and forward-looking Pakistan”.
Zardari also referred to Quaid’s 150th birth anniversary next year.
The government has announced that it will declare 2026 as the “Year of Quaid-i-Azam” to celebrate his 150th birth anniversary.
The president said the milestone would “provide an important opportunity to reflect meaningfully on Quaid’s life and struggle and to renew commitment to his vision while passing his ideals to future generations with honesty and purpose”.
He added that despite the challenges being faced by the country, unity, strength, and resilience would enable the nation to move forward.
‘Statesman of unwavering principles’
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar noted that the birth anniversary and Christmas fall on the same day, saying this shared occasion reflected the “inclusive vision and moral foundations upon which Pakistan was established”.
In his video message, he said, “The Quaid was not only the architect of our independence but [was also] a statesman of unwavering principles and exceptional clarity.”
He said that the Quaid had envisioned Pakistan as a democratic state functioning on the principles of equality and respect for the fundamental rights of all citizens.
“Our commitment to protect minority rights, equality and religious freedom remains a cornerstone of our Constitution and national ethos,” he said.







Military leadership pays tribute to Quaid
The country’s military leadership also paid tribute to the Quaid on his birth anniversary.
A statement by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Chief of Defence Forces and Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu paid rich tributes to him.
It added that the armed forces “reaffirm their unwavering commitment to Quaid-i-Azam’s vision of a strong, sovereign, democratic and prosperous Pakistan, founded on the principles of faith, unity and discipline”.
They emphasised that Quaid-i-Azam’s “exemplary leadership, constitutionalism and steadfast resolve continue to guide the nation and its armed forces in confronting contemporary challenges,” the statement added.
It further stated that the armed forces were reiterating their resolve to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and to contribute wholeheartedly towards national stability, peace, and development, in line with the ideals and aspirations of the Quaid.
“Pakistan’s armed forces remain steadfast in their commitment to uphold the legacy of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and to serve the nation with honour, courage and devotion,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-25 09:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/25133038b607c4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963170/14-countries-including-britain-canada-and-france-condemn-new-settlements-in-occupied-west-bank' target='_blank'><strong>14 countries, including Britain, Canada and France, condemn new settlements in occupied West Bank</strong></a><br><p>Fourteen countries including Britain, Canada, France and others have condemned the Israeli security cabinet’s approval of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank, prompting strong criticism from Tel Aviv.
On Sunday, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that authorities had greenlit the settlements, saying the move was aimed at preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state.
“On the ground, we are blocking the establishment of a Palestinian terror state,” said Smotrich, a vocal proponent of settlement expansion and a settler himself.
Subsequently, fourteen countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Canada, issued a statement late on Wednesday urging Israel to reverse its decision.
“We call on Israel to reverse this decision, as well as the expansion of settlements,” said a joint statement released by Britain, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Denmark, France, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain.







Such unilateral actions, they said, “violate international law”, and risk undermining a fragile ceasefire in Gaza in force since October 10.
They also reaffirmed their “unwavering commitment to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the two-state solution … where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side-by-side in peace and security”.
“We recall that such unilateral actions, as part of a wider intensification of the settlement policies in the West Bank, not only violate international law but also risk fuelling instability,” the statement said.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rejected the statement by foreign countries in an X post late on Wednesday, saying the decision aimed to help address security threats faced by Israel.







“Foreign governments will not restrict the right of Jews to live in the Land of Israel, and any such call is morally wrong and discriminatory against Jews,” Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said.
“The cabinet decision to establish 11 new settlements and to formalise eight additional settlements is intended, among other things, to help address the security threats Israel is facing.”
Since the start of Israel’s assault in Gaza in October 2023 following Hamas’s attack on Israel, calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state have multiplied, with several countries moving to formally recognise such a state.
Among those countries were some of those that condemned the settlement expansion drive.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Excluding east Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank, along with about three million Palestinian residents.
Earlier this month, the United Nations said the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, all of which are illegal under international law, had reached its highest level since at least 2017.
The latest approvals bring to 69 the total number of settlements approved over the past three years by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, one of the most right-wing in Israel’s history.
The Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority has also condemned the latest approvals, accusing Israel of tightening its control over Palestinian land.
It said the approvals were a continuation of “apartheid, settlement, and annexation policies that undermine the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people”.</p><small>2025-12-25 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/25121613fc5887a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162/bangladesh-leader-considered-top-pm-candidate-returns-after-nearly-17-years-in-exile-ahead-of-polls' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh leader considered top PM candidate returns after nearly 17 years in exile ahead of polls</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman returned to Dhaka on Thursday after nearly 17 years in exile, a homecoming the party hopes will energise supporters with Rahman poised to be the top contender for prime minister in the February 12 elections.
Hundreds of thousands of supporters lined the route from the capital’s airport to the reception venue, waving party flags and carrying placards, banners, and flowers, while chanting slogans welcoming Rahman, as senior BNP leaders received him at the Dhaka airport under tight security.
Rahman, 60, the son of ailing former prime minister Khaleda Zia, has lived in London since 2008 and led the BNP as acting chairman since 2018.
Dressed in a light grey, finely checkered blazer over a crisp white shirt, Rahman exited the airport, removed his shoes to step barefoot onto Bangladeshi soil, and picked up a handful of earth in a symbolic gesture marking his return to the South Asian nation.
He was seen standing beside the driver’s seat in a bus taking him to the reception venue, smiling and waving as crowds surged to catch a glimpse of their returning leader.
He had been unable to return while facing multiple criminal cases at home.
Rahman was convicted in absentia on charges that included money laundering and in a case linked to an alleged plot to assassinate former prime minister Sheikh Hasina but the rulings were overturned after Hasina was ousted last year in a student-led uprising, clearing the legal barriers to his return.
His homecoming also carries personal urgency, with Khaleda Zia seriously ill for months. Party officials said Rahman would travel from the airport to a reception venue before visiting his mother.
The political landscape has shifted sharply since Hasinas removal from power, ending decades in which she and Khaleda Zia largely alternated in office.
A December survey by the US based International Republican Institute suggested the BNP is on course to win the largest number of parliamentary seats, with the Jamaat-e-Islami party also in the race.
Hasina’s Awami League party, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could disrupt the vote.
Bangladesh is heading into the polls under an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.
While authorities have pledged a free and peaceful election, recent attacks on media outlets and sporadic violence have raised concerns, making Rahman‘s return a defining moment for the BNP and the country’s fragile political transition.</p><small>2025-12-25 07:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/25101150532a4a5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963145/jinnahs-democratic-legacy-challenges-prospects' target='_blank'><strong>Jinnah’s democratic legacy: challenges & prospects</strong></a><br><p>

THE Quaid categorically declared that no power on earth can undo Pakistan.

QUAID-I-AZAM Mohammad Ali Jinnah, a charismatic statesman, laid the foundation for a modern democratic state, Pakistan, to safeguard the fundamental rights of Muslims who were a minority in pre-Partition India. Pakistan was born as a secular democratic state, but its welfare and prosperity will always depend upon the restoration of Jinnah’s democratic legacy. Despite cultural, religious, or ethnic distinctions, Jinnah steadfastly believed that each Pakistani is an equal citizen; justice, honesty, and impartiality are the guiding principles that protect the right to life, property, and religious beliefs. Hence, for Jinnah, democracy ensures justice for all.
Pakistan’s great founder wanted neither a theocratic state nor a feudal one.
For Jinnah, democracy was a matter of conviction. ‘Democracy’ means people-centred decision-making, which enables individuals not only to elect their representatives but also to devise public policies, enact laws and amend constitutions through public reasoning for the common good. Democracy treats all citizens as equal members of the state.
“Let us lay the foundations of our democracy”
Democracy is one of the cardinal attributes of a modern state. The new independent states in the subcontinent, Pakistan and India, adopted the British democratic political structure in their respective countries. The constitutional approach was the only political solution for this region, and it was more than necessary for the two neighbours to develop democratic systems to preserve the principles of equal citizenship, justice and freedom of expression. The rule of law is essential for democracy. In The Legacy of Quaid-i-Azam, Dr Javid Iqbal states that Mohammad Ali Jinnah, being a celebrated lawyer, had a firm belief in the rule of law rather than the rule of individuals. The rule of law strengthens institutions, not individuals. He writes: “Quaid-i-Azam obviously stood for a strong, independent and irreproachable judiciary because human rights could not be protected and enforced without such a judiciary”. Jinnah has repeatedly asserted that only an independent judiciary can protect the democratic rights of all people in a state.

 

Democracy is the foundation of Pakistan. In a speech at Sibi Durbar on February 14, 1948, the Quaid declared: “Let us lay the foundations of our democracy based on truly Islamic ideals and principles. Our Almighty has taught us that our decisions in the affairs of the State shall be guided by discussions and consultations”.

In The Legacy of Quaid-i-Azam, Dr Javid Iqbal states that Mohammad Ali Jinnah, being a celebrated lawyer, had a firm belief in the rule of law rather than the rule of individuals. The rule of law strengthens institutions, not individuals.

Jinnah also announced, forcefully so, that the affairs of the state should be decided through debate and dialogue to serve the people of his great nation.
Jinnah, time and again, professed that the constitution of Pakistan must be democratic. In a broadcast to the people of the USA in February 1948, he said: “The constitution of Pakistan has yet to be framed by the Pakistan Constituent Assembly. I do not know what the ultimate shape of this constitution is going to be, but I am sure that it will be a democratic type, embodying the essential principles of Islam…. It has taught equality of man, justice, and fair play to everyone.
We are the inheritors of these glorious traditions and are fully alive to our responsibilities and obligations as framers of the future constitution of Pakistan”.
Surely, this statement affirms Jinnah’s pristine vision for a democratic constitution of Pakistan.

 

Did Jinnah want a theocratic state? This question seeks a distinction between an Islamic state and a Muslim state. An Islamic state means adopting a particular sect or religion as its constitution, which imposes a single ideology on all in the country. In contrast, a Muslim state provides religious freedom to all citizens. Hence, the father of the nation’s is a Muslim state grounded in the key principles of Islam. In a broadcast to the people of Australia on February 19, 1948, he insisted that “Pakistan is not a theocracy or anything like it.” So, our visionary founder’s Muslim state is a democratic state in which people can practice their beliefs, are free, equal and united; they cannot be subjected to any coercion, fear, exploitation or exclusion.
When Mohammad Ali Jinnah was elected as the first president of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, he presented a broad vision for a Muslim democratic state in his historic speech on August 11, 1947. He elaborated on the government’s primary duty, identified social evils, determined the role of the state, and the obligations of citizens for a progressive Pakistan. “The first duty of a government is to maintain law and order so that the life, property, and religious beliefs of its subjects are fully protected by the state”. Jinnah insisted on the provision of the right to life, property, and liberty, including the right to religious practice, in Pakistan.
A man of tremendous foresight, Jinnah also identified bribery, corruption, nepotism, and black-marketing as the major social evils that damage institutions, and urged the Assembly to eradicate these ills from society. He added: “Now, if we want to make this great State of Pakistan happy and prosperous, we should wholly and solely concentrate on the well-being of the people, and especially of the masses and the poor”. The Quaid’s was an unwavering conviction— without the well-being of the people, no state can prosper.
The sense of a nation
The founder stated that the progress of a state relied on the recognition of citizenship as a primary shared identity among its members. “If you … work together in a spirit that every one of you, no matter to what community he belongs, no matter what relations he had with you in the past, no matter what his colour, caste or creed, is first, second and last a citizen of this state with equal rights, privileges and obligations, there will be no end to the progress you will make”. It is the shared identity of being citizens of Pakistan, and not anything else, that can foster a sense of a nation among people despite their many differences.
“You are free; you are free to go to your temples; you are free to go to your mosques or to any other places of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed – that has nothing to do with the business of the State…We are starting in the days when there is no discrimination between one community and another, no discrimination between one caste or creed and another. We are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one State…. Now, I think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal, and you will find that in the course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State”.
These words serve as evidence of Jinnah’s immaculate vision for Pakistan.


QUAID-I-AZAM speaking at the Independence Day dinner at the Governor-General’s House in Karachi on August 14,
1947.

Jinnah’s democratic legacy is one of equal rights. For instance, he entrusted Jogendra Nath Mandal to be the first law minister of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, paving the way for the participation of minorities in governance. “I shall always be guided by the principles of justice and fair play without any.… prejudice or ill-will, in other words, partiality or favouritism. My guiding principle will be justice and complete impartiality, and I am sure that with your support and cooperation, I can look forward to Pakistan becoming one of the greatest nations of the world.” Our democratic inheritance from the founding father cannot be squandered.
In his essay, What if Mr Jinnah returned? Khaled Ahmed wondered whether the founder would prefer a constitution that keeps the judiciary independent of the executive? Alternatively, what if the father of the nation appeared in the parliament, public offices, courts, and police stations as an impartial spectator to see whether his citizens are being treated fairly and have access to justice? Would the Quaid not be happier to witness his own vision of fair play, merit, impartiality, freedom, and the rule of law being practiced in the public offices of Pakistan? Pakistan has moved away from Jinnah’s progressive idea of it. Soon after independence, the country stood trapped between neocolonial authoritarianism and theocracy. In The Sole Statesman, Ardeshir Cowasjee says “Jinnah intended Pakistan to be a democratic, forward-looking, modern, secular state. The bigots and the uneducated will always preach otherwise–and it will remain their privilege to do so”. He added that “Jinnah’s Pakistan died with him”. Later, Cowasjee also stated, “In a way, it was fortunate that Jinnah did not live long enough to see the negation of his principles, the perversion of his vision”.
Pakistan’s imperfect present
Now, Pakistan stands at the brink of an existential crisis due to numerous crucial challenges: theocracy, neocolonialism, overpopulation, violation of human rights, poor human development, extremism, political uncertainty, economic instability, corruption, poverty, brain drain, and a compromised educational system. All these challenges are manmade and therefore resolvable. Democracy is key as only opening dialogue and arriving at a political reconciliation will assuage discontent, mistrust and socioeconomic distress for a peaceful Pakistan.
Democracy in Pakistan is hostage to the theocracy, a neocolonial mindset, egoistical authoritarianism and fascist tendencies. The theocratic mind always tends to control freedom and egalitarianism in the country. In Pakistan: Behind the Ideological Mask, Khaled Ahmed argues that dogmatic ideology is taking the state away from democracy toward fascism worldwide. In Pakistan, he believes, “The state has indoctrinated the masses in favour of a revival of the medieval state rather than a ‘modern’ state”. By doing so, the state refuses to meet modern challenges because indoctrination closes all doors to realistic solutions. There is a dire need to liberate the Pakistani mind from the theocratic mind to develop a rational and critical mind through quality education, which is integral for a Pakistan that is modern and truly democratic.
The colonial legacy of governance has diminished the democratic culture of the country. In Confronting Empire, Eqbal Ahmad argued that Pakistan has never been able to decolonise since its independence. He stated that the situation remained the same after independence because “A British-trained army, a British-trained bureaucracy, and the same feudal landlords who had collaborated with the British, constitute the triangle of power…Nothing else has changed. So, the economic reality has not changed, and the political reality has not changed”. Eqbal Ahmad’s claim of neocolonialism is not easy to refute. So, it is undeniable that both theocracy and neocolonialism continue to derail Pakistan’s democratic process.
Despite all these challenges, democracy still holds significant meaning, and promise, in Pakistan. For instance, its vibrant youth and cultural diversity are two major catalysts for reform and change. The youth forms a large part of Pakistan’s population. And it has, to some extent, attained political consciousness, which is mandatory for the advancement of democracy in the country.
Cultural diversity is a blessing for any democracy; each culture has its own language, art, way of life and cuisine, which should be seen as a valuable opportunity to learn and integrate. Cultural diversity nurtures innovation, creativity and knowledge, while democracy cultivates reasoning in the public sphere.
The Quaid categorically declared that no power on earth can undo Pakistan.
However, a bright future for Pakistan depends on the extent to which it embraces Jinnah’s democratic ideals and principles in letter and spirit. The restoration of his values can make Pakistan invincible. Democracy is the sole cure for extremism, neocolonialism, the disease of corruption, poverty, and political instability. Jinnah believed in fostering the rule of law, independence of the judiciary, autonomy of institutions, decision-making through public reasoning, and the moral values of equality, freedom, fraternity, justice, fairness, and impartiality in the country. Pakistan, indeed, is Jinnah’s precious gift of freedom. But a future that is grounded in solidarity depends upon intellectual decolonisation through quality education to resolve contemporary sociopolitical, and economic problems. To conclude, Pakistan needs a paradigm shift from present policies for a progressive future.

Quaid-i-Azam at his favourite residence on Mount Pleasant Road in Bombay.

IN the current phase of our beautiful, beleaguered country’s history, institutional deviation and constitutional deformities have reached abysmal lows. This special report is being published on the birthday of an individual who had unshakable respect for institutional integrity and individual accountability in life, not immunity for life. The invitation to write encouraged one to consider anecdotal aspects to portray the Quaid’s life from inception to conclusion through fleeting glimpses, snatches of scenes, bits and pieces, which juxtaposed together, evoke his unlikely beginnings, unique persona, values and respect for institutions.
So much is already widely known about the pivotal role of M.A. Jinnah, especially between 1935 and 1948. One therefore decided to select relatively less known aspects. Herein are segments from the Quaid’s early years and then, with a deliberate leap over the next 40 years or so, random clips from the last 13 months.
A disconcerting birth
For data about his arrival on earth, and early years, one relied on the account recorded by his sister Fatima Jinnah.
She spent the most time with him. In addition to being one of his six siblings, she also spent a total of 28 years with him as his sole housekeeping custodian and sister, in two phases. Initially from about 1910 to 1918. Then, following Ruttie Jinnah’s death in February, 1929 (after about 10 years of a tumultuous marriage from 1919 to 1929), for a total of 26 years, living in close proximity, and frequent interaction. Her book My Brother presumed to have been written about 15 years after his demise during 1963-64, was published in 1967. Though the late eminent scholar Sharif ul Mujahid states in his preface that “… an extremely controversial passage…” had to be excluded, the published version comprises only three chapters which “…truthfully reproduce…” the contents of the original manuscript, now stored in the National Archives, Islamabad.

 

With the most reputed midwife of Karachi attending to a home-based delivery in 1876 by mother Mithibai, Fatima Jinnah writes; “… the baby boy was weak and tiny, having slim, long hands, and a long, elongated head. The parents were seriously worried about his health, this little baby that was underweight by quite a few pounds…” Despite the doctor’s assurance that the low weight factor should not cause worry, Mithibai insisted that her spouse Jinnah Poonja, herself and the baby travel soonest to Ganod in the small princely state of Gondal, Kathiawar where the venerated holy man Hasan Pir was buried, to seek his blessings for her frail first-born.
Braving a storm en route by sailing boat through the Arabian Sea, to the port of Verawal, thence by bullock cart through village Paneli to the destination of the great Sufi’s tomb, Mithibai and Jinnah Poonja fondly saw the tiny tot’s head shaved for the aqeeqa. With silent, saintly blessings absorbed, the return to Karachi commenced with a rich feast in Paneli where all villagers joined to celebrate the birth of the boy named Mohammad Ali.

There was a poignant contrast in the last stretch. Just as Pakistan’s genesis moved towards the triumph of reality, the great leader’s already frail body was being eroded from within. His fragility became increasingly apparent around, and onwards of 1940.

An unstudious boy
Yet even though he was already the apple – and the orange – of his mother’s eye, his early childhood years worried his father. The boy was far more interested in “…abandoning books for marbles, tops, gilli danda and cricket…”.

 

He had already joined, and soon left, a primary school close to his home in Kharadar because he spurned studies and classrooms. Prematurely, to please his father, he insisted on attending to office work. But soon, his virtual illiteracy prevented participation in conduct of transactions and business. In just two months, the light dawned.
He told his father: “… I would like to go back to school”. He then “…wanted to make up for lost time, as boys of his age and even younger than him had gone ahead of him. He took to his lessons with a vengeance, studying into the late hours of the night at home, determined to forge ahead….” But another disappointment came up. The teacher told his father that “…the boy is horrible in arithmetic….” was ominous news for a businessman who wanted his son to secure future financial bonanzas. He decided to take the boy to a school a long mile away from home, far enough from distracting local friends.
And so the ten-year-old gained admission in 1886 to the fourth standard Gujarati in the well-reputed Sind Madrassah. But, it soon seemed the boy was incorrigible. He “…continued to woo success and victory on the playfield, rather than at school….”
When the boy’s aunt, Manbai Poofivisited Karachi from her Bombay home to spend a few days with her brother Jinnah Poonja and his family, it was agreed that the unstudious boy would proceed with her to Bombay to be admitted to the Anjuman-i-Islam School where, fortuitously, he passed the fourth standard exam, “…enabling him to be admitted in first standard English….” Despite this success, a mother’s love prevailed over a father’s ambitions. The boy soon returned to Karachi, to be readmitted to Sind Madrassah on December 23, 1887. Some unease abided, to resurface four years later. For, on his son’s insistence, his father moved him out of the prestigious school on January 5, 1891 to be admitted to the Catholic Missionary High School on Lawrence Road where the boy became restless yet again. Just a month later, he was returned to Sind Madrassah on February 9, 1891 in fourth standard English.
Equestrian adventures
Meanwhile, back at the Kharadar ranch, the boy who would not settle into school found stallions far more exciting. Using his father’s fine stable of horses, accompanied by a friend named Karim Kassim, the two would make the other two whose reins they held, trot and gallop for long hours every day. Moving swiftly between horse-carriages on the streets of Karachi, the most visible means of transport for the well-off, or ‘aristocratic’ families, the errant son continued to cause concern to his doting parents. Mithibai would steadfastly declare that her Mohammad Ali would one day become a great man.
England beckons
As General Manager of Graham Trading and Shipping Company — an enterprise in close commercial contact with Jinnah Poonja’s firm – Frederick Croft should be credited for initiating a transformative phase in the life of a restless 16-year-old teenager. He suggested that the boy be sent to London to work at the head office of Croft’s firm for about three years where, among other skills, he could also gain high proficiency in English while learning to adjust to new challenges. Intense debate ensued between the parents. Mithibai most reluctantly agreed to allow her beloved firstborn to leave – provided he was first wed to prevent him from being entrapped by an English woman. The search led to 15-year-old Emibai in distant Paneli village, Kathiawar.
The family then proceeded again by boat from Karachi to Verawal, then by bullock cart to the bride’s home. After lavish festivities, the new couple returned to Karachi. Soon thereafter, with his mother’s tears and prayers blending for a heart-wrenching farewell, the son began the three-week journey to what became a four-year life-changing experience. The father had already remitted a large sum to London to pay for his expenses.
Sent to learn commerce, the youth soon learnt much more elsewhere. Mohammad Ali listened to debates in the House of Commons, to rhetoric at Hyde Park Speakers’ Corner, viewed Shakespeare’s plays, noted the names of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) inscribed in Lincoln’s Inn as one of the world’s greatest law-givers, canvassed votes for Bombay Zoroastrian, and earlier, one of the four founders of the Congress Party, Dadabhai Naoroji’s narrow victory as the first non-Englishman elected from a London constituency to parliament.
In short, Jinnah rejected the very reason for being sent to England by his father. Instead, as recounted by him about half a century later in 1946 to Nasim Ahmed, Dawn’s correspondent in London, he even considered a career on the stage. His appetite for acting … possibly as Romeo … was whetted by brief experience with a touring company. Until his shocked father, who belatedly learnt of new plans, instantly and categorically ruled that out.
All the while, he preserved chastity.

 

When his Russell Street landlady’s pretty daughter reminded him that they happened to be “standing together chatting under a mistletoe on Christmas Eve and that custom required the man to kiss the woman”, Jinnah politely declined to do so because, as he told her, his faith and culture did not permit such indulgence. did fall head over heels in love with reading, and voraciously so.
From newspapers to law books to poetry to plays by Shakespeare. From the extreme of abandoning books in childhood to cherishing their infinite value as he grew into adulthood.
He was also recovering from the news of dual tragedies at home. First his childbride Emibai’s death who he barely knew, followed by the profound loss of one he knew from his very first breath, his adoring mother Mithibai who passed away giving birth to her seventh child.
Perhaps these two traumas instilled a new resolve — to fulfill his mother’s dreams and be the youngest ever law student to become a barrister from Lincoln’s Inn. Then return to Karachi, and Bombay, to help his father recover from the huge losses suffered in business.
From trials to new heights


THE Quaid with his beloved sister, and formidable supporter, who devoted 28 years of her life to his mission.

Preferring law practice in larger Bombay to small-town Karachi from 1897 to about 1900 was like an anti-climax to the hopes nurtured by success in the London exams. His secretary in later years, M.H. Saiyid in his book Mohammad Ali Jinnah (A Political Study), in 1945 wrote: “The first three years were of great hardship and although he attended his office regularly every day, he wandered without a single brief. The long and crowded footpaths of Bombay may, if they could only speak, bear testimony to a young pedestrian pacing them every morning from his new abode in a humble locality in the city, to his office in the Fort, and every evening back again to his apartments after a weary, toilsome day spent in anxious expectation.”
Ironically, momentous change yet again began through the intervention of an Englishman, John Macpherson, the acting advocate-general of Bombay. Jinnah became the first-ever local practitioner to be invited to work in the advocate general’s chamber. Obviously, some hint of the intelligence and potential possessed by the young barrister must have come through to the senior luminary who was later knighted. Hearing about a vacancy for a temporary presidency magistrate, the freshly-recruited lawyer boldly initiated contact with his employer ‘s support, and Sir Charles Olivant, member in-charge of the judicial department, who then became the third Englishman to play a catalytic role in opening dramatic new vistas for Jinnah’s ascent to outstanding professional success.
Forty years later
Many articles by other writers published in Dawn have already done justice to crucial phases of the founder’s life between 1900 and 1940. In this rumination, while even excluding glimpses of his singular love for Ruttie Jinnah, arbitrary focus is on random segments between 1940 and 1948.
Age, frailty and fanaticism
Except for Mahatma Gandhi, born in 1869, who was seven years older than Jinnah, the Muslim League’s leader was the oldest among the three most important political figures who played decisive roles in the creation of Pakistan and India. Gandhi had an overarching influence but did not wield the operational Congress policy direction that Nehru did. The latter was born in 1889. He was thirteen years younger and was 58 years old at Independence while Mountbatten was 24 years younger and was only 47 years of age in 1947.
Jinnah, at 71, was the oldest of the three protagonists. But was also the one most notably becoming physically vulnerable to ill-health.
In 1953, A.R. Casey, the governor of Bengal in 1946, noted that “I have looked up my personal diary, and I find that I emphasised, in several references, the fact that he (M.A. Jinnah) looked very frail.” However, he could sustain long periods of active discussion without any sign of tiring …a couple of hours at a time…. My wife and I dined with him and his sister at Government House in Karachi … in March 1948. At this same dinner my wife made some comment about someone or other being “a fanatic.” Jinnah said, “Don’t decry fanatics. If I hadn’t been a fanatic, there would never have been Pakistan.”
August 7, 1947
As the Dakota aircraft afforded an aerial overview of New Delhi soon after taking off with the Quaid, Fatima Jinnah and his small staff on its way to Karachi, the first ADC to the founder, Mian Ata Rabbani was seated immediately behind his leader. He noticed how the Quaid looked intently down at the city and softly said to himself: “That is the end of it”.
Yet, in two respects at least, it was not the end of his ties with India. He did not change his will whereby Aligarh Muslim University remained one of the principal beneficiaries. Nor did he sell his favourite residence on Mount Pleasant Road in Bombay.
Later, the same day, after the boisterous welcome in Karachi, as the Quaid ascended the steps of the Governor-General’s House, he said to his military adviser and ADC Lt. S.M Ahsan: “Do you know, I never expected to see Pakistan in my lifetime. We have to be very grateful to God for what we have achieved. “ Later still, during the orientation walk through the premises of his new residence, and a meticulous inspection of the inventory, he noted that the library shelves were empty.
He was informed that the previous occupant, the Governor of Sind, had taken all the books with him. Visibly upset, Jinnah said to his military secretary, “Nonsense. The books belong here. Go and get them back”. Similarly, when he was shown game items, he was told that a croquet set had been taken away by Sir Francis Mudie, Governor of Punjab. On his visit to Lahore after some time, he had the set retrieved and returned to where it belonged as state property.
August 9, 1947
At a dinner hosted by Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah in Jinnah’s honour, Mrs Hidayatullah tied an imaam zaamin on the founder’s arm. Surprisingly, he did not know the meaning of the ritual. When told that it would protect him against evil, he turned to Altaf Hussain, the editor of Dawn, and said, “Now I can face you”, to loud laughter.
‘Unforgetting’ & unforgiving?
In his book I was ADC to the Quaid, which was written after his retirement, Group Captain Ata Rabbani recalls an unusual revelation of Jinnah’s traits.
He records that, while proceeding to the Sind Assembly on August 11, 1947 to deliver the address that became a historic landmark of secular vision, the Quaid-i-Azam deliberately ignored the presence of A.K.M Fazlul Haque, the East Bengal leader who had the honour of moving the Lahore Resolution on March 23, 1940 at the Muslim League meeting. Well in advance of coming abreast of the Quaid walking in his direction, Fazlul Haque greeted him several times and also bowed respectfully. Jinnah neither looked at him nor responded to the salutation.
Rabbani wrote: “…The only reason that comes to mind is that (Fazlul Haque, otherwise known for his integrity) had repeatedly acted against the categorical instructions of the League’s high command, at times even at the peril of causing damage to the overall Muslim cause. Disloyalty to the cause was one thing that the Quaid-iAzam would not forgive.”
The final stretch
There was a poignant contrast in the last stretch. Just as Pakistan’s genesis moved towards the triumph of reality, the leader’s already frail body was being eroded from within.
His fragility became increasingly apparent around, and onwards of 1940.
Now in Pakistan, the news poured in every day of ghastly massacres as refugees crossed new state frontiers in Punjab, of anti-Muslim slaughters in New Delhi and Bihar, Indian occupation of Srinagar on a forged Instrument of Accession, severe shortage of funds and resources to cope with enormous new numbers and pressures — all compounded the depressive impact on both mind and physique.
Yet he insisted on reviewing piles of files in detail, made notes, frequently met the prime minister and other senior individuals. And also travelled to Peshawar, Risalpur, Lahore.
Then, defying all advice, he flew from Quetta to Karachi to inaugurate the State Bank on July 1, 1948, his last public appearance.
Both Fatima Jinnah in her slim book and Lt. Colonel Dr Ilahi Bakhsh, who wrote With the Quaid-i-Azam during his last days as he attended to him in the last weeks, narrate moving accounts of how this giant of a man, despite valiant efforts, quickly weakened each day in August and early September 1948. Yet his sense of values survived. When a nurse repeatedly declined to tell him his temperature unless the doctor permitted her, and then left the room, he told his sister: “I like people like that… people who can be firm, who refuse to be cowed down….”
Towards the end of August, Fatima Jinnah recalled him saying: “I am no more interested in living…the sooner I go the better.” When she reassured him that the doctors were hopeful, he said, “No… I don ‘ t want to live.”
The bizarre episode of the ambulance breakdown on September 11, 1948 between Mauripur airfield and the Governor-General’s House is well known.
Frail at birth and in death
Weight count came a full circle.
From cradle to grave. Infected lungs and sheer fatigue had reduced him to only 70 pounds. Yet, when it mattered most, Jinnah punched way above his physical weight.
In every sense, the Quaid-i-Azam remained the unbeaten heavy-weight champion of history. He defeated three adversaries virtually single-handedly — the British, the Congress Party and allies, plus at least four Muslim entities that opposed the creation of Pakistan.
Though well-known, Stanley Wolpert’s distinctive tribute in his book, Jinnah of Pakistan bears repetition: “Few individuals significantly alter the course of history. Fewer still modify the map of the world. Hardly anyone can be credited with creating a nation-state.
Mohammad Ali Jinnah did all three.”
