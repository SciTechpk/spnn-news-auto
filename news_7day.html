In a statement, the CTD said eight armed men were killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area.
“Eight armed persons were killed in a fire exchange during the operation,” read the statement, adding that three CTD personnel were injured during the action.
According to the CTD, weapons and ammunition were recovered from the killed miscreants. It noted that the dead individuals were said to be from a banned outfit.
In a separate statement, the CTD said “six terrorists were killed in a fire exchange” during an intelligence-based operation in Barkhan.

 

“All security personnel remained safe,” it stated, adding that arms and ammunition were recovered from the killed militants.
“The terrorists were involved in the planning of disruptive actions,” the CTD said, reaffirming to continue its efforts to eliminate terrorism.
The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
On February 5, security forces concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The operation was initiated as security forces responded to a spate of attacks across the province on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days.
During simultaneous operations, around 180 suspects were arrested and a huge cache of arms and ammunition was seized by Frontier Corps and police, officials said.</p><small>2026-02-18 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1812024483f98a3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974086/ttap-leadership-reaches-sc-for-hearings-of-imrans-cases-alliance-insists-on-personal-physicians-access' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP leadership reaches SC for hearings of Imran’s cases; alliance insists on personal physicians’ access</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: While the sit-in by the main opposition alliance continued for the sixth consecutive day, the leadership of the TTAP has reached the Supreme Court (SC) to show solidarity with Imran Khan during the hearing of his cases.
TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, while talking to Dawn, said that although the protest is ongoing, the leadership decided to reach the court on Wednesday morning as the hearing of Imran’s cases was scheduled.
“Currently, Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, and others have reached the Supreme Court,” he said.
He added that the leadership has arrived at the court and will hold a media briefing once they return.
“They may announce further strategy regarding the protest and will also address the crackdown on PTI supporters,” he said.
TTAP ‘demands’ full medical access for Imran
The TTAP also shared a video of Achakzai inside the SC premises and speaking to Imran’s sister Aleema Khan.







In the early hours of Wednesday, the TTAP also shared a list of five “immediate and unconditional demands”.
The first was immediately granting Imran “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, so “they could conduct a medical examination independently”.
The alliance further asked for certified copies of Imran’s medical tests, diagnostic reports, X-rays, scans and laboratory results to be shared with his personal physicians.







The TTAP also demanded that the PTI founder’s personal doctors be “given full authority to formulate their independent medical opinion without the presence or pressure of the government’s medical board”.
It further sought “regular and continuous follow-up examinations” of the PTI founder by his personal physicians.
Lastly, the TTAP demanded that, for transparency and accountability, the government clarify in writing why “any obstruction or delay occurred in the provision of treatment, diagnosis, and medical facilities”, and also provide assurance that such negligence will not be repeated in the future.
The TTAP stressed that any kind of “delay, excuses or staged actions” would be unacceptable. “The matter of Imran’s health is not political, but a requirement of human and constitutional responsibility,” it added.
The TTAP-led sit-in began after concerns over the health of Imran intensified following a medical report indicating he has only 15 per cent vision in his right eye.
Family members and senior party leaders have repeatedly attempted to meet him at Adiala jail, but most visits have been blocked by authorities.
The Supreme Court’s intervention last week allowed PTI lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Imran, confirming his limited vision. In response, the opposition alliance demanded that Imran’s personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf and family members be allowed regular and confidential access to monitor his condition.
The TTAP framed their sit-in as a push against government negligence and lack of transparency regarding Imran’s treatment.</p><small>2026-02-18 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/181221079f56351.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974089/bangladesh-pm-tarique-rahman-names-cabinet-after-election-win' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh PM Tarique Rahman names cabinet after election win</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Tarique Rahman has named a former commerce minister to steer the country’s troubled economy and kept the defence portfolio for himself as he formed his first cabinet.
Rahman was sworn into office on Tuesday after a landslide election victory, taking over from the interim administration that had led the country of 170 million people since a deadly 2024 uprising that toppled the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina.
The 50-member cabinet announced in a gazette notification issued late Tuesday includes Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, 76, a businessman and veteran lawmaker who has now returned to the finance ministry.
Chowdhury is tasked with reviving growth after months of turmoil that rattled investor confidence in the world’s second-largest garment exporter.

 

He had previously served in the cabinet of Rahman’s late mother, three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia, but was forced to resign in 2004.
According to media reports, his resignation came after he had granted permission for Taiwan to open a commercial office in Dhaka.
Chowdhury has not spoken publicly about the issue.
He was also arrested several times during Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule, as her government regularly targeted opposition leaders in cases often decried as politically motivated.
Rahman, 60, has appointed himself defence minister, as his government faces a daunting list of challenges, including improving security and healing rifts in a country polarised by years of bitter rivalry.
Bangladesh is squeezed between India — where border tensions are high — and Myanmar, where clashes have spilled over into frontier areas.

 

Bangladesh is home to more than a million Rohingya refugees who have fled Myanmar.
Khalilur Rahman is the foreign minister, an experienced diplomat and former UN official who holds degrees from universities in Dhaka and the United States.
Khalilur Rahman held the security portfolio in the caretaker government and helped mediate trade talks with the United States.
He faces the tricky task of balancing regional relations after ties with neighbour India soured during the interim government, and Dhaka deepened engagement with New Delhi’s arch-enemy Pakistan.
India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar congratulated his counterpart on Wednesday, saying in a statement that they would work together to “advance our cooperation”.







PM Rahman is expected to chair his first cabinet meeting later on Wednesday.
Other members of the cabinet include veteran politicians, former ministers and lawmakers, as well as academics and several party workers.</p><small>2026-02-18 07:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1811014696bcf9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974083/two-officials-martyred-in-militant-attack-on-police-station-customs-office-in-dera-ismail-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Two officials martyred in militant attack on police station, customs office in Dera Ismail Khan</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Two officials were martyred and two others injured when militants attacked Yarik police station and a customs office in Dera Ismail Khan on Wednesday, police said.
According to officials, attackers opened fire with automatic weapons on the Yarik police station and a nearby customs office, located along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) route.
A police spokesperson said the officials martyred in the attack were customs official Israr Khan and police constable Mohammad Bilal.
The injured, identified as Hazrat Umar and Khayal Mohammad, were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital’s trauma centre, where they were undergoing treatment.
Police said the attackers also fired at passenger buses travelling on the CPEC route, causing panic in the area. A customs vehicle was set ablaze during the assault.
Security personnel returned fire, prompting the assailants to flee. A heavy police contingent reached the site soon after the incident, and a search operation was launched in the surrounding area.
Investigations are underway, and officials said efforts were ongoing to apprehend those involved in the attack.
Earlier this month, at least four policemen, including a station house officer (SHO), were martyred when armed militants attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area of Dera Ismail Khan.
On January 24, five people, including a peace committee leader, were killed, while 10 others were injured in an explosion — said to be a suicide attack — during a wedding ceremony in the district.</p><small>2026-02-18 06:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18113108478042e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974081/global-leaders-parliamentarians-send-well-wishes-for-a-blessed-and-peaceful-ramazan' target='_blank'><strong>Global leaders, parliamentarians send well-wishes for a ‘blessed and peaceful’ Ramazan</strong></a><br><p>As the Ramazan moon was sighted in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the USA, and other countries on Tuesday night, wishes poured in from politicians and parliamentarians worldwide for the start of the holy month.

Anthony Albanese, prime minister of Australia, also issued a statement on X wishing Muslims in Australia for Ramazan.
“The sacred weeks of Ramadan are a chance for Muslims to reaffirm their faith, to reflect, to forgive and to practice acts of love and kindness,” he said. “It is also an expression of the compassion, gratitude and togetherness that have been the hallmarks of the story of Muslims in Australia.”
He reaffirmed that the country’s “strength, success and unity” was built on the fundamental right of every Australian “to practice their faith in peace and safety, proud of who they are”.
He further acknowledged the grief caused to Australian Muslims by the conflict in the Middle East, saying that there was “much to be done”.
“Over the month ahead, may your faith sustain and comfort you,” he added.







United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer wished “Muslim communities in the UK and across the world a peaceful and blessed holy month”.







London Mayor Sadiq Khan said, “As Londoners come together to celebrate the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, our capital shines bright as a beacon of hope and diversity. From my family to yours: Ramadan Mubarak.”







Although United States President Donald Trump has not issued any statement regarding Ramazan as yet, other political figures in the country were quick to do so.

The incident sparked concern among the fellows of the student when they found her in a pool of blood and immediately alerted the college management.
The student (F) was a resident of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and living in the government hostel of the FJMU.
According to reports, the student suffered multiple head and neck injuries besides the bone fractures. She was rushed to the emergency ward of the attached Sir Ganga Ram Hospital from where she was shifted to the operating theatre after initial assessment.
According to FJMU Vice Chancellor Prof Khalid Masood Gondal, her condition was very critical. She underwent a major neuro surgery by a team of senior doctors, but she succumbed to her injuries.
Prof Gondal said the incident occurred at the FJMU girls hostel wherein she accidentally fell from the building. “We have constituted a medical board comprising senior doctors,” the FJMU VC said adding that he has also formed another five-member fact-finding panel of senior doctors and other experts to probe into the matter and submit a report within 24 hours.
Prof Bilquis Shabbir, the Dean Undergraduates, was made the head of the committee.
The VC said she may have fallen accidentally from the building. However, the eyewitnesses and some sources in the institute claimed that she jumped from the building in an attempt to end her life. Immediately, no reason for her extreme step was available.
Earlier, two students, including a female student of a private university in Raiwind, had also jumped from the building.

The Palestinian news agency Wafa, citing local sources, reported that “Israeli forces detained Sheikh al-Abbasi inside the courtyards of Al-Aqsa Mosque“ on Monday evening without giving any reason.
It added that the arrest “comes amid escalating Israeli measures against the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, including restrictions on imams, preachers and worshippers stationed there, limitations on the entry of worshippers, and intensifying incursions carried out by settlers under heavy protection from Israeli police”.
Hamas condemned the arrest of al-Abbasi in a statement on Tuesday, saying he had been “served with an order banning him from the mosque”.
The movement said the measure “constitutes blatant interference in the affairs of Al-Aqsa and an unacceptable assault on its imams”.
Hamas added: “The escalating violations by the fascist occupation government against the sanctity of Al-Aqsa Mosque, the imposition of restrictions on worshippers’ access, the prevention of logistical preparations for the month of Ramazan, and the intensification of raids by settler groups are dangerous interventions that fall within its persistent attempts to control and Judaize the mosque, restrict freedom of worship there, and impose temporal and spatial division.”

 

The movement called on the “Palestinian people in Jerusalem, across the West Bank and inside the 1948 territories to remain stationed at Al-Aqsa, travel to it and maintain its presence, and stand as a bulwark against plans to tamper with its identity”.
Hamas also urged the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Arab and Islamic nations “to take urgent action through all possible channels to protect Al-Aqsa Mosque from the danger of Judaization, and to take practical steps to pressure the occupation and force it to halt its violations”.
Occupied Jerusalem, particularly the Old City and the vicinity of Al-Aqsa Mosque, has been witnessing rising tensions amid tightened Israeli security measures, including arrests and ban orders against religious figures and Palestinian activists in Jerusalem.
Israeli police have also said they would deploy in force around the Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramazan, as Palestinian officials accused Israel of imposing restrictions at the compound.
Over the course of the month of fasting and prayer, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Al-Aqsa — Islam’s third-holiest site, located in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed.
The Al-Aqsa compound is a central symbol of Palestinian identity and also a frequent flashpoint.
Under long-standing arrangements, Jews may visit the compound, but they are not permitted to pray there.</p><small>2026-02-18 05:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/181017418aabee6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974077/ukraine-war-talks-to-resume-in-geneva-as-us-signals-progress' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine war talks to resume in Geneva as US signals progress</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were to resume a second round of peace talks in Geneva on Wednesday, as Washington’s top envoy signaled optimism in its bid to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II.
The talks are the latest diplomatic bid to halt the fighting, which has killed hundreds of thousands, forced millions to flee, and decimated much of eastern and southern Ukraine.
The United States has been pushing for an end to the nearly four-year war, but has failed to broker a compromise between Moscow and Kyiv on the key issue of territory.
Two previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides in Abu Dhabi failed to yield a breakthrough.
But US envoy Steve Witkoff, representing the Trump administration at the talks, said President Donald Trump’s diplomatic efforts had made strides in Washington’s bid to end the conflict.
“President Trump’s success in bringing both sides of this war together has brought about meaningful progress,” he wrote on X, without elaborating.
“Both parties agreed to update their respective leaders and continue working towards a deal.” The latest talks “lasted six hours” and “were very tense”, a source close to the Russian delegation told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address he was ready “to move quickly towards a worthy agreement to end the war”, but questioned whether Russia was serious about peace.
“What do they want?” he added, accusing them of prioritising missile strikes over “real diplomacy”.
Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with the ensuing conflict resulting in a tidal wave of destruction that has left entire cities in ruins.
Breakthrough hopes low
For the Geneva talks, the Kremlin reinstated nationalist hawk and former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky as its lead negotiator.
Ukrainian national security secretary Rustem Umerov was leading Kyiv’s side and said negotiations would continue Wednesday.
He thanked Washington for its mediation and said he informed European allies of the outcomes from the first round of talks, which he said had focused on “practical issues and the mechanics of possible solutions” to the conflict.
“I have concluded a separate meeting with representatives of the United States and European partners — France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy and Switzerland,” he wrote on Telegram.
“We discussed the results of today’s round of negotiations and aligned our approaches on further steps.” Zelensky has repeatedly said his country is being asked to make disproportionate compromises compared to Russia.
Trump put pressure on Ukraine on Monday to make a deal, saying they “better come to the table, fast”.
Zelensky told Axios on Tuesday it was “not fair” that Trump kept calling on Ukraine to broker a deal, adding that lasting peace would not be achieved if “victory” was just handed to Russia.
“I hope it is just his tactics and not the decision,” Zelensky said.Hopes for a breakthrough remain low.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had told journalists to expect no major news from the first day of talks.
‘Disregards peace efforts’
Even before talks were underway, Ukraine had accused Russia of undermining peace efforts by launching 29 missiles and 396 drones in attacks overnight into Tuesday that authorities said killed four people and cut power to tens of thousands in southern Ukraine.
Late Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff said Russia had fired 28 missiles and 109 guided aerial bombs at its territory since the beginning of the day.
“The extent to which Russia disregards peace efforts: a massive missile and drone strike against Ukraine right before the next round of talks in Geneva,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga wrote on social media.
Russia, meanwhile accused Ukraine of launching more than 150 drones overnight into Tuesday, mainly over southern regions and the Crimean peninsula — occupied by the Kremlin in 2014.
Russia occupies around one-fifth of Ukraine — including the Crimean peninsula it seized in 2014 — and areas that Moscow-backed separatists had taken prior to the 2022 invasion.
It is pushing for full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region as part of any deal, and has threatened to take it by force if talks fail.
But Kyiv has rejected this deeply unpopular demand, which would be politically and militarily fraught, and signalled it will not sign a deal without security guarantees that deter Russia from invading again.
Russia has been slowly seizing territory across the sprawling front line for months.
But its wartime economic worries are mounting, with growth stagnating and a ballooning budget deficit as sanction-hit oil revenues drop to a five-year low.</p><small>2026-02-18 05:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18073111e740b01.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974063/imf-team-due-on-feb-26th-for-review-budget-talks' target='_blank'><strong>IMF team due on Feb 26th for review, budget talks</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: An Inte­r­national Monetary Fund (IMF) mission led by Iva Petrova is due to visit Pakistan on Feb 26 to review implementation of the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the $1.1bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), officials said.
During the almost two-week visit ending March 11, the engagements would be of greater significance as both sides would also discuss budget proposals based on performance this year and set broad contours of the upcoming budget (for the fiscal year 2026-27), particularly those relating to provincial finances.
The programme’s performance as of end-Dece­mber 2025 — the period for review — has mostly been up to the mark, alb­eit with a revenue shortfall, which authorities bel­i­eve could be reduced following a recent super tax ruling by the Federal Cons­t­ituti­onal Court that went in the government’s favour.
The power sector would also remain under added scrutiny given volatile policymaking in the recent months, including those relating to the industrial sector, residential fixed cha­rges and so on, altho­ugh circular debt numbers are within the target range.
On the positive side, Pak­istan has met almost all quantitative performa­nce criteria for end-Dece­mber 2025. However, it is lagging behind in indicative targets and structural benchmarks, which could affect future programme implementation.
Given the biannual reviews of the $7bn EFF and the $1.1bn RSF, the two sides will have to agree on past performance as well as forward-looking implementation plans.
Upon the successful completion of the review, Pakistan will be eligible for the disbursement of about $1bn (760 million Special Drawing Rights) under the EFF and another $200m under the RSF by the end of April.
Meanwhile, Topline Research said it expected Pakistan to meet nearly all quantitative performance criteria (QPCs).
“As per our calculation, Pakistan is likely to meet nearly all seven QPCs; however, data for one indicator is not known yet,” it said, referring to the floor on targeted cash transfers, which it said was missed in the previous review by Rs1bn.
However, it perhaps missed the point that the slippage was only technical in nature, as lower spending was not related to beneficiaries but to lower administrative expenses.
Topline also observed that net international reserves were likely to remain below at around $6.7bn against the $7bn benchmark for September 2025 and below $6bn for December 2025 against the $6.5bn benchmark.
“The net domestic assets (NDA) of the SBP are likely to remain in the range of Rs12.5-13.5tr vs the ceiling target of Rs14.9-15.1tr for September and December 2025,” it said.
It said that as per the State Bank, foreign currency swaps stood at $2.2bn for September 2025 and $1.86bn for December 2025, compared to ceiling targets of $2.25bn and $2bn, respectively. It also estimated primary surplus figures of Rs3.5tr and Rs4.1tr for September and December compared to targets of Rs460bn and Rs3.2tr.
“The government guarantees and floor on cash transfer spending are also likely to be met as per our channel checks. Similarly, the new tax return target is also expected to be achieved,” Topline said.
It added that the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) indicative criteria were missed by Rs336bn but hoped that a portion of this missed target could be collected through the super tax verdict, though the collection would still remain below the annual target.

The Green Shirts returned to Lahore late Tuesday night after suffering defeats in all their matches against Germany and hosts Australia, concluding a winless campaign across both legs of the competition.
Media reports highlighted serious lapses in arrangements, particularly inadequate and delayed accommodation in Hobart, which left players discontented and affected their preparation.
PHF president Tariq Hussain Bugti, speaking to Dawn, said the responsibility for all logistical and financial arrangements — including hotel bookings, air travel, TA/DA and visas — rested with the PSB.
He cited directives from the senate standing committee on sports, which had designated the PSB as the body to handle financial matters for the team’s FIH Pro League participation.
“The PHF has accepted the senate committee’s ruling and is not interfering in these affairs,” Bugti said. “Our priority remains ensuring the national team’s participation in this important competition, which provides valuable exposure against top-ranked teams.”
A PSB official, Rana Nasrullah, countered that the team management had sufficient funds at its disposal, with players also carrying USD 1,650 each.
“If funds were available, why was the hotel arrangement mismanaged? There was also no proper cooking system, forcing players to prepare their own meals,” he said.
When queried about food-related issues, Bugti noted that the squad was en route home and a detailed report would be available upon their arrival in Lahore.
Both the PHF president and the PSB welcomed the prime minister’s directive for a probe. Federal sports minister Rana Sanaullah has constituted an inquiry committee to investigate the matter.
“It is a positive step, and the PHF will present its position before the committee,” Bugti added.
Separately, sources indicated that accommodation payments of USD 3,750 from the first leg in Argentina remain pending.
It is relevant to note that, amid past allegations of financial irregularities against the PHF, the prime minister had released Rs250 million to secure Pakistan’s participation in the Pro League, with the PSB appointed as custodian of financial affairs.
Reports also suggest the PSB had booked the hotel but payment issues arose.
A PHF official, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed the PSB provided a cheque of Rs10 million to the team management for accommodation upon arrival.
However, hotel rates had increased by then, leading to limited bookings — including a guest house — and shared or substandard rooms, leaving players dissatisfied with both lodging and food.
Sources added that players may address a press conference in Lahore to clarify the situation.
Pakistan captain Emmad Butt, in a video statement, had earlier refuted claims that the team was left without any hotel accommodation or forced onto the streets.
Players have also expressed discomfort over their daily TA/DA allowance of USD 40 from the PSB, which falls short of the USD 100 stipulated in PHF regulations.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office issued a statement: “Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken notice of the mismanagement in hockey affairs reported in the media, and enquiries are being conducted. Immediate action will be taken against those found responsible.”
Following the notice, Sanaullah expressed grave concern, stating that the PHF’s actions had tarnished the country’s and the sport’s reputation. “Such behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Strict action will be taken against those responsible for mismanagement and bringing disrepute to the sport,” he warned.
While the minister has initiated the inquiry, no specific names of committee members have been announced. Observers have noted that an inquiry conducted solely by PSB or ministry officials may lack full independence, and a neutral body would better serve impartiality.

JERUSALEM: As Israeli authorities barred the imam of Al Aqsa Mosque from entering the compound, 93 states — including the eight-nation Muslim bloc — slammed Tel Aviv’s move to designate lands in the occupied West Bank as so-called “state land”.
Last week, the Israeli cabinet approved measures that would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory.
Israeli NGOs have also raised alarm over the government’s settlement plan, which they say would mark the first expansion of Jerusalem’s borders into the occupied West Bank since 1967.
According to a statement, issued by the Palestinian mission to the United Nations, 85 nations as well as the European Union (EU), Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and Arab League called for the immediate reversal of the Israeli annexation of the West Bank.
States who signed up to the latest statement include Algeria, Andorra, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chad, China, Colombia, Cuba, Cyprus, North Korea, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Liberia, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, South Korea, Russia, San Marino, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tajikistan, The Gambia, Turkiye, Uganda, UAE, Tanzania, UK, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Yemen and Zimbabwe.







An earlier statement from the foreign ministers of the eight-nation Muslim bloc also condemned Israel for approving procedures for the registration and settlement of land ownership across extensive areas of the occupied West Bank.
“This illegal step constitutes a grave escalation aimed at accelerating illegal settlement activity, land confiscation, entrenching Israeli control, and applying unlawful Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and undermining the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” said the statement.
“This step reflects an attempt to impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land, thereby undermining the two-state solution, eroding the prospects for the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian State, and jeopardising the attainment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region.”
Warning by NGOs
The planned development, announced by Israel’s Ministry of Construction and Housing, is formally a westward expansion of the Geva Binyamin, or Adam, settlement situated north-east of Jerusalem in the West Bank.
But the area to be developed lies on the Israeli side of the separation barrier built in the early 2000s, while Geva Binyamin sits on the West Bank side of the barrier, and the two are separated by a road. In a statement, Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now said there would be no “territorial or functional connection” between the area to be developed and the settlement.
“The new neighbourhood will be integral to the city of Jerusalem,” said Lior Amihai, Peace Now’s executive director.
“What is unique about that one is that it will be connected directly to Jerusalem, but it will be beyond the annexed municipal border. So it will be in complete West Bank territory, but just adjacent to Jerusalem,” he said.
Imam barred from Al Aqsa
Sheikh Muhammad Al-Abbasi, a senior imam of the Al Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem, said on Tuesday that Israeli authorities had barred him from entering the compound, just days before the start of the holy month of Ramazan.
“I have been barred from the mosque for a week, and the order can be renewed,” he said, adding that he was not informed of the reason for the ban.
On Monday, Israeli police said they had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.

Speaking at the session, industry specialists noted that while AI offers significant opportunities to improve governance and service delivery, its integration into the civil bureaucracy will not be immediate.
It was highlighted that digital contributions account for more than 50 percent of GDP in China, whereas the share remains very low in Pakistan, underscoring the need for adoption across all sectors.
The session was held for media professionals and digital activists at the head office of Huawei Pakistan, which also serves as a global back office for Huawei.

Strong local cloud presence essential as data sovereignty, AI sovereignty fast becoming matters of national security, says Huawei official

Experts argued that AI tools could help streamline public services, support evidence-based decision-making, and reduce delays in administrative processes.
Kashif Iqbal, a technical expert at Huawei, said Pakistan has a strong IT workforce, noting that Pakistanis form the second-largest group of employees at Huawei after Chinese nationals.
More than 20,000 students participate annually in global competitions organised by Huawei, and Pakistani participants have consistently secured positions among the top three, outperforming competitors from around the world.
Although basic infrastructure already exists in Pakistan, including in the public sector, the digitisation of data is essential for AI systems to function effectively.

 

“AI is the right direction for transforming the public sector, but it will take time for senior executives and government officials to fully understand and effectively use these technologies,” said Ahmed Bilal Masood, CEO of AI and Cloud Business at Huawei Pakistan.
He highlighted that Huawei is a key supplier of AI equipment used in establishing cloud services and ICT solutions in Pakistan.
“Data sovereignty and AI sovereignty are becoming matters of national security globally, which is why a strong local cloud presence is essential,” Mr Masood said, adding that despite the challenges, AI is a critical driver for reforming Pakistan’s public administration. Embracing artificial intelligence, he said, could help modernise outdated systems and improve public service delivery.
“AI is being adopted in all fields, from traffic management to enhancing the performance of hospitals and educational institutions.” However, he cautioned that successful implementation would depend on the enactment and enforcement of cyber laws, including data protection legislation, as technology alone cannot drive change.
Faisal Ameer Malik, Huawei’s Chief Technology Officer for the Middle East and Central Asia region, said the concept of AI was introduced in 1956, with a major breakthrough occurring in 2011 by Google. However, the concept gained widespread prominence during and after the Covid era.
He noted that between 2012 and 2022, AI was largely applied to small data models, but due to widespread digitalisation, current AI systems are based on large data models.
He added that around 170 countries have released national digital strategies, while 60 countries have elevated AI to the level of a national strategy. Pakistan has already approved its National AI Policy in 2025.

DEMONSTRATORS protest in front of New York’s Trump Tower.—Reuters

• Hillary accuses Trump of orchestrating ‘cover-up’• Los Angeles mayor calls for 2028 Olympics chief to resign• Hyatt boss steps down
SANTA FE: Lawmakers in the US state of New Mexico passed legislation on Monday to launch the “first full investigation” into what happened at Zorro Ranch, where the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is accused of trafficking and sexually assaulting girls and women.
A bipartisan committee will seek testimony from survivors of alleged sexual abuse at the ranch, located about 50 kilometres south of Santa Fe, the state capital. Legislators have urged local residents to testify.
Meanwhile, former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton accused President Trump of orchestrating a ‘cover-up’ over the Epstein files.
“Get the files out. They’re slow-walking it,” the former first lady said in an interview with the BBC.
In other developments, the mayor of Los Angeles called upon Casey Wasserman, the chief organiser of the 2028 Olympics committee, to resign after his name figured in the Epstein files.
Thomas Pritzker, the chairman of the Hyatt chain of hotels, said he had decided to leave his position after emails revealing his ties to Epstein came to light.
Truth commission
The “truth commission” named by New Mexico, comprising four lawmakers, seeks to identify ranch guests and state officials who may have known what was going on at the 7,600-acre property, or taken part in alleged sexual abuse in its hacienda-style mansion and guest houses.
The Democratic-led investigation adds to political pressure to uncover Epstein’s crimes that has become a major challenge for President Donald Trump, weeks after the Justice Department released millions of Epstein-related files that shed new light on activities at the ranch.
The files reveal ties between Epstein and two former Democratic governors and an attorney general of New Mexico.
The committee started its work on Tuesday, and will deliver interim findings in July.
“He was basically doing anything he wanted in this state without any accountability whatsoever,” said lawmaker Andrea Romero, a Democrat.Testimony to the committee could be used for future prosecutions, she said.
Victim advocates applauded the move, saying Zorro Ranch had been overlooked by federal investigations that focused on Epstein’s Caribbean island and New York townhouse.
“Many of the survivors had experiences in New Mexico, and as we’ve learned, you know, there were local politicians and other people that were aware of what was happening in New Mexico,” said attorney Sigrid McCawley, whose law firm has represented hundreds of Epstein survivors.
Hillary Clinton slams ‘cover-up’
“Get the files out. They are slow-walking it,” Clinton, who is due to testify before a Congressional committee on the issue next week, told the BBC in Berlin.
Former president Bill Clinton features regularly in the files, but no evidence has come to light implicating either of the two in criminal activity.
The couple has been ordered to give closed-door depositions before the House Oversight Committee, which is probing the deceased financier’s connections to powerful figures and how information about his crimes was handled.
“We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public,” Hillary Clinton told the BBC. “I just want it to be fair,” she said. “I want everybody treated the same way.”
Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has called on Casey Wasserman, whose name was also mentioned in the Epstein files, to step down as chief organiser of the 2028 Summer Olympics.
Bass told CNN it was “unfortunate” the Olympic organisers were supporting Wasserman after revelations he exchanged flirtatious emails with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. He said: “My opinion is that he should step down. That’s not the opinion of the board.” She said that “we need to look at the leadership” of LA28.
Hyatt CEO resigns
The executive chairman of the Hyatt hotel chain also stepped down after emails revealing his ties to Jeffrey Epstein came to light.
Businessman Thomas Pritzker maintained contact with Epstein well after the latter was convicted in 2008.

WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrives here on Wedne­sday (today) to attend the global summit of the Boa­rd of Peace (BoP) hosted by US President Donald Trump, stepping into a forum that seeks to go beyond Gaza in restoring global peace and stability.
The summit’s immediate focus is expected to be threefold: consolidating a ceasefire in Gaza, mobilising financial pledges for the BoP — with Washin­gton announcing an initial commitment of $5 billion — and finalising the contours of a proposed global forum that Trump hopes can achieve what the United Nations could not.
Participants are also likely to discuss the proposed International Stab­ilisation Force (ISF), tas­k­ed with securing reconstruction zones and supporting a post-conflict governance arrangement in Gaza.
For Pakistan, the question of contributing troops to the ISF has assumed particular importance after it reportedly figured in discussions between Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Diplomatic sources say several Muslim countries are open to participating in a stabilisation mechanism but are reluctant to accept any combat role that could place their forces in direct confrontation with Hamas. They are also seeking a clear political horizon for Palestinian statehood and opposing Israeli moves towards ann­e­x­ation in the West Bank.
The institutional design of the BoP — a compact, leader-driven body with an operational arm in the form of the ISF and a dedicated financing pool — reflects Washington’s preference for coalition-based mechanisms operating outside the slower multilateral framework of the United Nations. This has raised questions among diplomats and scholars about both effectiveness and legality.
Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the United States, Britain and the United Nations, was unequivocal in her assessment. “The jury is out on whether the Board of Peace can deliver peace. The absence of any Palestinian representation on the Board raises questions about its legitimacy,” she said. “If the principal party to the issue is excluded, how is this going to advance the peace process or carve out a post-conflict future for the people of Gaza.”
Dr Lodhi warned that externally imposed governance arrangements risk reproducing older power hierarchies. “Externally controlled governance arrangements make this a colonial-style project,” she observed, adding that “at least half of the countries invited to be members didn’t join the body as they had reservations about its role, legality and effectiveness as well as Trump’s pretension of turning this into a parallel body to the UN Security Council”.
She also questioned Islamabad’s early decision to sign on. “Pakistan should not have joined the Board in such haste and should have waited to see what exactly it will do, especially given the widespread view that it can end up becoming an instrument for continuing Israeli occupation.”
For PM Shehbaz, the visit is not only about Pakistan’s potential role in a new stabilisation architecture but also about navigating a complex web of domestic and external pressures, according to Akbar Ahmed, Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at American University.
“PM Shehbaz Sharif faces as sticky a wicket as can be imagined when he arrives in Washington for his meetings with President Trump,” Prof Ahmed said. “He is bringing with him two sets of dilemmas: an internal one and an external one.”
On the domestic front, he noted, the prime minister must manage a difficult civil-military balance amid rising security challenges. He added that Shehbaz Sharif also faces a politically sensitive decision regarding the continued incarceration and health of former PM Imran Khan.
Externally, the challenge is even more complex. “On the one hand, he must continue his newly formed amiable relationship with President Trump, which gives him access to American military and economic structures, and on the other, the consistent and immeasurable support that China has provided,” Prof Ahmed said, pointing to tensions on both the eastern and western borders as factors that make this balance unavoidable.
“With both the western border with Afghanistan and the eastern border with India heating up, Shehbaz Sharif cannot ignore this balance between America and China. His performance will be watched carefully and his words weighed. He will need all his legendary skills of survival.”
In that sense, the Washington visit is as much about testing the contours of Pakistan’s evolving relationship with the United States as it is about Gaza. For the Trump administration, the summit is expected to secure troop commitments for the ISF, financial participation in reconstruction and political endorsement for a US-led stabilisation model.
For Muslim and Arab countries, participation is tied to a permanent ceasefire, a credible pathway to Palestinian statehood and a non-combat mandate for any multinational force.
How PM Shehbaz positions Pakistan between these competing expectations — while coordinating with like-minded states and maintaining strategic equilibrium between Washington and Beijing — will determine both the immediate diplomatic outcome of the summit and the longer trajectory of Pakistan’s role in the emerging post-conflict framework for Gaza.

The State Bank of Pakistan data revealed that consumers opted for more loans in January due to the change of model year and registration, as the growth in December 2025 was slightly slower than in November 2025.
Auto financing has been struggling to beat the peak of Rs368bn recorded in June 2022 when annual car sales volumes were around 240,000 units.

 

Auto sector expert Mashood Ali Khan said that the current trend shows consumers are increasingly leveraging bank financing to purchase vehicles, contributing to a gradual recovery in automobile sales despite prevailing economic challenges. This is a strong indicator that consumer demand still exists, and it only needs supportive policy to accelerate further.
The growth momentum comes primarily under the State Bank’s existing Rs3 million auto financing cap, enabling a large segment of middle-income consumers to access vehicle ownership. “I believe that the auto sector holds significantly greater potential if financing limits are revised upward to Rs6 to Rs7m.”
By doing this, the auto market will witness a substantial expansion, particularly in the sedan and mid-range vehicle segment, which remains largely inaccessible to financing-dependent consumers under current limits, he added.
“If financing ceilings are increased and interest rates continue to ease, Pakistan’s annual auto sales could potentially cross 200,000 units a year again,” he emphasised.
He said the small-car segment remains the primary beneficiary of financing due to its alignment with the SBP financing cap. A segment of consumers is also seeking to access sedans through partial financing combined with personal savings, highlighting the demand gap created by the current financing ceiling.
Banks are offering more flexible financing options, including comparatively lower markup rates, reduced down-payment requirements, and easier repayment structures. “This has supported recovery, but policy alignment is essential to unlock the sector’s full potential,” he said.
Raising financing limits, while supporting consumers, would also generate broader economic benefits, including industrial production growth, employment generation, vendor development, and increased government revenues through taxes and duties, he said.
He said continued interest rate moderation could further strengthen financing activity in the coming months. “I stress that revising financing limits remains the single most impactful policy intervention to accelerate growth,” Khan said.
Sales are likely to remain upbeat in view of a 137pc increase in imports of semi- and completely knocked-down kits by the local assemblers to $1.144bn in 7MFY26 from $706m in the same period last fiscal year.

Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka restrained police from arresting the PTI founder in the said cases and also extended the pre-arrest bail of Bushra Bibi in one related matter. The hearing was adjourned till Feb 18.
During the proceedings, the PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were represented by their legal team. However, despite earlier directions, the former prime minister could not be produced before the court through a video link. Owing to his absence and the unavailability of his counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, arguments on the acquittal application could not be advanced.
The court subsequently directed that the PTI fou­nder must appear at the next hearing either personally or via video link.
The cases against the PTI founder stem from the May 9 incidents and incl­ude charges of attempted murder, submission of fake receipts and other offences. A separate case has also been registered against Bushra Bibi for allegedly submitting fake receipts.
Also, Additional Distr­ict and Sessions Judge Amir Zia extended the interim bail of Bushra Bibi in a case related to the November 26 protest.
Meanwhile, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra deferred indictment proceedings in the Sangjani Jalsa case due to the non-appearance of the accused PTI lawmakers.

Meanwhile, the alleged move continues to draw criticism.
On Monday, it was claimed by an X account, The Stratcom Bureau — which mainly shares defence- and security-relates news — that the “government of Punjab, Pakistan has acquired a new, 2019-manufactured Gulfstream GVII-G500 aircraft for their VIP transport role”.
In a separate post by the same account, it was claimed that “the registration number of the luxury plane is N144S” and its “old Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) registration would be changed to Pakistani registration soon”.
The post also said that the approximate asking price for the aircraft was $38 million to $42m.
Meanwhile, the US FAA registry shows that the aircraft is currently owned by TVPX Aircraft Solutions Inc. Trustee, which, as per its website, commonly acts as the registered owner for aircraft trusts, facilitating the buying, selling, and leasing of planes, particularly for non-US citizens or for privacy reasons.



According to flight tracking service Flight Radar, the aircraft has been flying between various airports in Punjab since at least February 12.
Dawn reached out to several officials for a confirmation of the purchase’s claims, but they remained tight-lipped on the matter.
Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman and Additional Chief Secretary Ahmad Raza Sarwar did not respond to calls and text messages to clarify the Punjab government’s position.
Punjab Additional Secretary (Welfare) Waseem Hamid, however, denied the claims of the aircraft’s purchase before abruptly disconnecting the call.
Dawn also tried to contact Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, but she, too, did not respond to any calls or the query sent to her as a text message.
Amid this silence by the officials, the reported purchase of the aircraft continues to draw criticism, including by former finance minister Miftah Ismail and ex-Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair.
Sharing the Stratcom Bureau’s post on X, Miftah juxtaposed the reported purchase of the aircraft with the recent hike in petroleum prices by the government.
“So while Pakistanis are supposed to tighten our belts and sacrifice, Punjab’s entitled VIPs are fastening their seatbelts for taking off in luxury private jets,” he said.







Similarly, Zubair posted on X: “Such a beautiful plane worth more than 1,000 crore, which has been bought by the Punjab govt for the use of its CM and party’s elite.”
He questioned whether a nation facing economic difficulties, with 45 per cent of the people living below the poverty line and amid record unemployment — afford this luxury.
“The Punjab government may issue a denial if not true,” he said about the claims of the aircraft’s purchase.

In separate reports, the publication said that Wednesday (Feb 18) would be the first day of the holy month in both countries.
The official Saudi Press Agency also said on X that Wednesday would be the first day of the holy month in the kingdom.







Tolo News, meanwhile, also announced that Ramazan would begin on February 18 in Afghanistan.
“In a statement issued by the Supreme Court, it said that in the provinces of Parwan, Kandahar, Helmand, and Zabul, a large number of people sighted the crescent moon of Ramadan and reported it to the Sharia courts,” it said in a post on X.







Saudi Arabia’s Gulf neighbours Oman, Qatar and the UAE also made similar announcements.
Last week, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said that the first day of Ramazan in Pakistan “likely to fall” on February 19 (Thursday).
However, the agency said the final announcement regarding the beginning of the Islamic holy month will be made by the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, “which is the sole competent authority, based on credible witness testimonies from across the country”.
It is worth mentioning that a meeting of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee will be held tomorrow at the Auqaf Department building in Peshawar.
According to a notification issued by the religious affairs ministry, zonal and district committee meetings will also be held at their respective headquarters.

Cricketer-turned-politician Imran, 73, has been in jail since August 2023, convicted in a string of cases that he says were politically driven following his ouster in a 2022 parliamentary vote.
Imran’s lawyer, Salman Safdar, told the Supreme Court last week that the former premier had lost a significant amount of vision in his right eye while in custody. On Monday, a medical board said the swelling had reduced after treatment, and his vision had improved.
On Tuesday, former India captains Gavaskar and Kapil signed a petition expressing “deep concern” about Imran’s treatment and prison conditions.
Former Australia captain Greg Chappell, his brother Ian Chappell and compatriots Allan Border, Steve Waugh, Belinda Clark and Kim Hughes have signed the petition.
England’s Mike Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Mike Brearley and David Gower have also signed, alongside Clive Lloyd from the West Indies and John Wright from New Zealand.
The campaign is led by Chappell, a former Australian captain and contemporary of Imran. Meanwhile, the office of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told AFP it had not yet received the captains’ statement.
“Many of us competed against him, shared the field with him, or grew up idolising his all-round brilliance, charisma, and competitive spirit,” they said in the petition.







“Recent reports concerning his health — particularly the alarming deterioration of his vision while in custody — and the conditions of his imprisonment over the past two and a half years have caused us profound concern.
“As fellow cricketers who understand the values of fair play, honour, and respect that transcend the boundary rope, we believe that a person of Imran Khan’s stature deserves to be treated with the dignity and basic human consideration befitting a former national leader and a global sporting icon.”
The cricket greats “respectfully” urged the Pakistan government to ensure immediate and adequate medical attention, dignified treatment, and unhindered access to legal processes for Imran.
“Our shared history on the field reminds us that rivalry ends when the stumps are drawn — and respect endures. Imran Khan embodied that spirit throughout his career.”
Separately, former Indian cricketer Mohammed Azharuddin posted on X that he was “deeply saddened to hear about Imran bhai”.
“Cricket has given us many shared moments, and as a fellow sportsman who has shared the platform and learned from him, I sincerely appeal that he be treated with dignity. Praying for his good health and strength for his family,” he said.







Meanwhile, the PTI issued a statement on its X account, thanking the international cricketers for raising “their voices against the injustices being committed against” the former premier.
The party expressed the hope that cricketers “will continue to extend their full support to Imran Khan until justice and fairness are achieved”.
PTI also called on the current and veteran cricketers around the globe to speak in favour of the incarcerated leader and against “this injustice”.
“One of cricket’s greatest legends is currently languishing in prison as the victim of a political vendetta and injustice, where he is being deprived of basic human rights and essential medical facilities,” PTI added.







Last week, Pakistan’s cricketing community had also voiced concern about the health of the former captain and called on authorities to ensure he received the best possible care.
Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram — who was part of the 1992 squad which won the World Cup — said it was “heartbreaking” to learn that Imran was facing health issues.
Former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar said he was “deeply saddened” to hear the news about Imran losing vision in his eye.</p><small>2026-02-17 19:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1720145317b5916.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973874/tarique-rahman-sworn-in-as-bangladeshs-pm-after-landslide-election-victory' target='_blank'><strong>Tarique Rahman sworn in as Bangladesh’s PM after landslide election victory</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Tarique Rahman was sworn in as Bangladesh’s prime minister on Tuesday, marking a decisive political shift in the South Asian nation after his party’s sweeping parliamentary election victory.
Rahman, 60, son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and assassinated President Ziaur Rahman, takes office facing urgent challenges, including restoring political stability, rebuilding investor confidence, and reviving key industries such as the garment sector after the prolonged turmoil that followed the Gen Z-led uprising that toppled Sheikh Hasina’s government in 2024.
An interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus ran the country through the transitional period leading up to the election.

 


Breaking with tradition, the swearing-in ceremony was held under the open sky at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, the national parliament building, instead of the Bangabhaban, the president’s official residence, where such events are usually organised.
President Mohammed Shahabuddin officiated as Rahman and his cabinet took their oaths in the presence of senior political figures, diplomats, civil and military officials, and representatives from invited countries, including China, India and Pakistan.
Rahman’s BNP secured a commanding two-thirds majority, returning to power after nearly two decades. The Jamaat-i-Islami, contesting its first election since a 2013 ban was lifted following Hasina’s ouster, won a record 68 seats.
Hasina’s Awami League party was banned from contesting after its registration was revoked by the Election Commission.
Jamaat and its allies, including the National Citizen Party, led by youth activists who played a prominent role in the movement that toppled Hasina, will form the opposition.

 

Rahman’s elevation caps a long and turbulent political journey. He returned to Bangladesh last year after 17 years of self-imposed exile in London, arriving shortly before his mother’s death.
Rivals have long criticised his political record, pointing to corruption allegations he denies, but his return energised party supporters and reshaped the BNPs campaign.
In his first remarks after the election, Rahman urged calm and restraint, saying: Peace, law and order must be maintained at any cost.
He called on supporters to avoid retaliation, warning: We will not tolerate any kind of chaos.
Earlier today, Rahman and lawmakers were sworn into parliament on Tuesday, becoming the first elected representatives since a deadly 2024 uprising.
The lawmakers, who promised loyalty to Bangladesh, were sworn in by the Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin.



‘Peaceful opposition’
Rahman’s win marks a remarkable turnaround, with the BNP coalition winning 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance.

 

Jamaat, which secured more than a quarter of seats in parliament — a four-fold increase on its previous best — has challenged results in 32 constituencies.
But Jamaat leader Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has also said the party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.
Only seven women were directly elected, although a further 50 seats reserved for women will be allocated to parties according to their share of the vote.
Four members of minority communities won seats, including two Hindus — a population that makes up roughly seven per cent in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.

 

Despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has so far responded to the results with relative calm.
“If the BNP can do a good job with the economy, it will make everything else easier for the government,” Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean said.
“It will help to create a level of stability, to tackle the many other challenges beyond the economy.”
Pakistan congratulates Rahman
After Rahman’s oath-taking, President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated him on becoming the prime minister and his party on its “decisive victory” in the elections.
A post by the President’s Secretariat on social media platform X said Zardari also appreciated the interim government’s role “in a peaceful [and] fair election” and conveyed “best wishes for stability and prosperity”.
The president “hopes for stronger Pakistan-Bangladesh ties and regional peace”, the post said.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended warm felicitations to Rahman.
“I look forward to close and meaningful engagements with my brother, to further strengthen our bilateral cooperation across mutually beneficial areas and to deepen the historic ties between our two countries,” he said.







Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who was visiting Dhaka for the swearing-in ceremony, conveyed best wishes and prayers for Rahman in “steering the country towards new heights of progress and development”.
“It was an honour to witness and be part of this historic moment in the history of Bangladesh on behalf of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the people of Pakistan,” he said.







Iqbal also met Rahman after the latter’s oath-taking, with a PID press release stating that the Pakistani minister conveyed “warm congratulations on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan” to the new prime minister.
He extended best wishes for the peace, progress and prosperity of Bangladesh under Rahman’s leadership, the press release said, adding that during the meeting, Iqbal also conveyed a formal invitation from the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Rahman to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date.
“The two leaders discussed avenues to reinvigorate bilateral relations and enhance regional cooperation,” the press release further stated.
It said Iqbal emphasised the need to revive SAARC to promote regional connectivity and advance a shared geo-economic vision for South Asia.
He noted that South Asia has remained one of the least integrated regions due to historical conflicts, and underscored that Pakistan and Bangladesh, through mutual collaboration, could help pave the way for a more integrated and economically vibrant South Asia.
Highlighting the importance of knowledge partnerships, Iqbal proposed the establishment of a “Pakistan–Bangladesh Knowledge Corridor” to strengthen academic, research and technological collaboration, the press release said.
He informed Rahman that the Chairman of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan would be directed to visit Bangladesh to explore twin-university agreements and promote student and faculty exchange programmes.
Iqbal stressed that youth exchange “is crucial for building long-term partnerships” and announced enhanced academic cooperation, including scholarship opportunities. He said that 500 scholarships had been allocated for Bangladeshi students, with 75 students already proceeding to Pakistan for higher education.
Both sides also discussed collaboration between institutions including the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), and their Bangladeshi counterparts to exchange expertise in data systems, digital governance, and institutional capacity building.
Iqbal further highlighted opportunities for cooperation in SMEs and cottage industries, noting that by leveraging their combined populations, Pakistan and Bangladesh could secure a greater share in global markets for technology-enabled services, manufacturing, and production of goods.
Expanding direct flight operations and improving connectivity were also discussed as important steps to facilitate trade, tourism, business-to-business engagement, and people-to-people contacts, the press release said.
It said Iqbal also proposed the revival of the Iqbal Academy and suggested joint celebrations of the 150th birth anniversary of Allama Muhammad Iqbal next year, as a symbol of shared intellectual and cultural heritage.
Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties and working together for regional peace, stability, and shared prosperity, according to the press release.
Earlier, the minister had met with Mohammad Yunus, who was serving as the country’s interim leader.
“I warmly congratulated Professor Yunus and the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of elections and the historic democratic transition. I conveyed Pakistan’s sincere good wishes for continued stability, progress, and prosperity for Bangladesh under its new leadership,” he said.







He further said that the discussions focused on “opening a new, forward-looking chapter in Pakistan–Bangladesh relations”.
“I expressed appreciation for the positive momentum in bilateral ties, including growing trade engagement, revival of direct air connectivity, and renewed people-to-people contacts. We agreed that the current regional and geopolitical environment demands greater economic cooperation, connectivity, and collaboration between our two countries,” Iqbal said.
He also acknowledged Yunus’s global contributions to social entrepreneurship and inclusive development.
“I extended an invitation for him to visit Pakistan so that we may further institutionalise cooperation in areas of shared interest, particularly youth empowerment, innovation, and sustainable development,” he said.
“Pakistan and Bangladesh share deep cultural, historical, and social affinities. It is time to transform these affinities into structured economic partnerships, academic exchanges, and regional cooperation. Our future lies in building connectivity, expanding trade, empowering youth, and shaping a stable and prosperous South Asia together,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-17 19:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/172044557289230.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973875/ttap-sit-in-continues-for-5th-day-at-parliament-house-meetings-with-imran-at-adiala-jail-still-not-allowed' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP sit-in continues for 5th day at Parliament House; meetings with Imran at Adiala jail still not allowed</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: As the TTAP’s sit-in continued for the fifth day after the blocked routes to Parliament House were cleared, the alliance expressed hope on Tuesday that at least one family member of the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan or a party leader would be allowed to meet him today amid concerns about his health.
The hope, however, did not materialise.
In the afternoon, an X account of the PTI said that a vehicle carrying Imran’s sisters was stopped at the Chakri Interchange while on its way to the Adiala jail.







Later, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also claimed in a post that “we were stopped at the Chakri police post by the police. When we informed them that we intended to leave and proceed to Islamabad, they unlawfully blocked us and detained us there for the next four hours”.
“We have now been released and are on our way to Islamabad,” she added.







PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Secretary General Salman Akram Raja also sought to meet Imran today but were told by the Adiala jail administration that the meeting could not be allowed.
Speaking to the media on the occasion, Raja said Imran’s medical report released on Monday indicated that he had an eye ailment. He added that the court had also issued directives for meetings with Imran and yet, his associates and family members were not being allowed to meet him.
Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the Supreme Court’s (SC) intervention last week led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which quoted Imran as saying only 15 per cent vision was left in his right eye.
This prompted a strong response from the opposition alliance, which began a sit-in at the Parliament House for the fulfilment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination.
Raja said Safdar, in his report submitted to the Supreme Court after meeting Imran, “clearly stated that Imran Khan told him he could not see him with his right eye”.
The PTI leader demanded that Imran’s long-time personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf and the former premier’s sisters should be allowed to meet him at the Adiala jail.
“We want to hear from Imran Khan that he is fine, and this should be conveyed by a person we can trust,” Raja said.
Meanwhile, family members of Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, were allowed to meet her at the Adiala jail, sources told Dawn.
According to the sources, three of her family members, including her daughter, met her for around 40 minutes.
Earlier in the day, TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai had told Dawn that as Tuesday was supposed to be a meeting day with Imran, two of the sit-in participants — Raja and Gohar — would be going to Adiala jail, as their names had been included in the list of those to meet the PTI founder.







“Moreover, we are hoping that the meeting of all sisters or at least one of the family members will be allowed today,” he had said. “It will end the rumours about the health of Imran Khan, as they will directly hear from him and will share Khan sahib’s views regarding his health.”
Responding to a question, Yousufzai said that the government should allow the meeting as it may help defuse the current tensions if the medical report regarding Imran was correct.
“It is a fact that during the last two years we have been deceived a number of times, due to which the level of trust has been reduced,” he said.
The spokesperson further said he met Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi last night, where it was decided to hold an evening meeting to determine the next course of action.

 

The opposition on Monday decided to extend their sit-in at the Parliament House, which began on Friday, for another day to “see the government’s response” to their demand for access to the former premier, whose health has recently been called into question by a medical report following his examination at the Adiala jail on Sunday.
After Imran was not allowed visits today, the TTAP held an “emergency meeting” at the Parliament House to discuss the course of action pertaining to Imran’s “deteriorating health and the government’s negligence, non-serious attitude and lack of transparency in the information being provided on the matter”.
A statement by the TTAP said that the “future course of action, joint strategy and probable constitutional and parliamentary measures” were discussed in the meeting.







After the meeting, the alliance released a list of demands, calling for Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan to be provided immediate and “confidential” access to Imran so that they could “independently” examine Imran.
The TTAP also demanded the provision of copies of all medical test, diagnostic and x-ray reports, scans and laboratory tests of Imran to his personal physicians.
Moreover, the “personal physician should be allowed to develop an independent medical opinion in the absence of the medical board or any pressure”.
The TTAP also demanded permission for Imran’s personal physicians to conduct his follow-up examinations regularly.
The government should also clarify the delay in Imran’s treatment, diagnosis and the provision of medical treatment to him, the TTAp demanded, also seeking assurance that such negligence would not be committed in the future.
CM Afridi and MPAs also continued their demonstration outside the KP House in Islamabad on Tuesday.







Imran’s party, family ‘reject’ medical report
Imran’s party and family have rejected the report issued by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday, sticking to their demand that he be taken to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital in the presence of his personal doctors.
In a post on X, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram referred to the statement by Imran’s longtime personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf, who had spoken to the doctors currently treating the ex-prime minister.
Akram noted that Dr Yusuf said “that he neither met Khan nor could he talk to him nor could he examine him or take care of him, therefore he can neither confirm nor deny” the report prepared.
He stated that the PTI “rejects this report and strongly demands that Imran Khan sahib be immediately met by his family and personal physician and that he be immediately treated and examined at Al-Shifa International”.
“To issue such a report by having doctors of one’s choice examine him shows that something is definitely being hidden and the only solution to avoid all this is to immediately have Imran Khan examined at Shifa International on the recommendation of his family and personal physician,” Akram contended.







In her statement posted hours earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said: “We categorically REJECT all the medical reports circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan.”
“[…] as Dr Asim Yousuf stated in his video, there is NO way for us to verify any of this,” she highlighted.
“Now we are even more concerned and worried and our demand remains unchanged: Imran Khan must be urgently transferred to a proper medical facility (Shifa International Hospital Islamabad) where he shall be examined by qualified specialists under Dr Asim Yousuf’s supervision and in the presence of his family,” Aleema demanded.
She added that she and others will be at the Adiala jail at 1:30pm today to attempt to meet Imran.
“We expect the authorities to allow us to meet Imran Khan as this is his legal right,” the sister said.

Chasing 171 for victory, Nepal looked in trouble at 98-3 in the 14th over before Airee took the initiative in his 23-ball knock as his team achieved the target with four balls to spare in Mumbai.
Airee put on 73 runs with Gulsan Jha, who made 24 not out, as Nepal earned their first win after three losses in Group C.
Nepal’s fans erupted with joy at the Wankhede Stadium after seeing their team win for the first time in the tournament since 2014.
“I want to thank the fans who came from Nepal and supported us, that gives a lot of motivation to all of us,” said player of the match Airee.
“And in the last World Cup, we didn’t win a single match. So that’s why this win is very important for us.” It was Nepal’s first victory in the T20 World Cup since they beat Hong Kong and Afghanistan in the opening stage 12 years ago.
Nepal had given England a mighty scare in their opener before losing by four runs and then went down in the next two games.

Nepal pace bowler Sompal Kami stood out with figures of 3-25.
Nepal started strongly with Kushal Bhurtel scoring 45 as he put on 74 runs with fellow opener Aasif Sheikh, who made 33.

The TTAP particularly accused Naqvi of attempting to “distort” facts to “cover up the deteriorating health and treatment meted out to” the former prime minister.
The allegations came in response to a press conference by Naqvi earlier in the day, who asserted that the government did not want to “politicise” the matter of PTI founder Imran Khan’s health and blamed the opposition for doing the same.
The opposition, PTI and Imran’s family have voiced concerns over the former prime minister’s health after his eye ailment came to light late in January.
Addressing the media in Lahore, Naqvi referred to the recent medical report prepared by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday.
“The medical report also came forward yesterday and everything is clear as per it. Neither we nor the government want to politicise this,” he said, adding that there were certain “requests” which the authorities allowed but were not suitable to publicise at the moment.
“Putting up such a show is extremely inappropriate, especially misleading people,” the minister said.

 

“Still, we picked our best government and private doctors because it had been three days and the checkup had not taken place,” he insisted.
Naqvi said he then invited PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan to reach Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday to witness Imran’s checkup but the former refused, citing party consultations.
Detailing the communication between the authorities and the opposition, Naqvi said Gohar was given the time of 2:30pm. “We kept on waiting for an hour but Gohar sahib replied in the negative, that he has consulted with his party and would not be able to come.”
“Our intention was that the checkup be performed in front of everyone,” he asserted, adding that the doctors were at the Adiala jail for about 1.25-1.5 hours for the examination.



Naqvi stated that Gohar, along with the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders — Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai — and their preferred doctors, was then invited to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad.
There, the doctors who examined Imran briefed the opposition leaders as well as spoke on the phone to the “two doctors” named by the PTI, with each conversation lasting for about 45 minutes. “They asked each and everything,” Naqvi said about the PTI-recommended doctors.
“Excellent. This is the best treatment. Even if we had to provide treatment, we would have done the same,” he quoted the doctors as saying.
According to Naqvi, the opposition representatives also expressed satisfaction over the treatment and said they would inform their supporters about it.

 

Asked about former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s claims that Naqvi made unmatched efforts for Imran’s release, the minister said, “One thing, which is not new, is that I have believed from the first day that dialogue is the solution to everything.
“This is not my personal opinion; the prime minister has also said what I say, and we are following those instructions. […] If you ask about my personal view, I always say talks are the [answer],” he said.
Responding to another question, he said there were “sensible people” in every party and if they had been listened to, the “PTI would not have been in the current situation, nor would have done the May 9 things”.
On whether any action was being taken against the former Adiala jail superintendent whom the PTI holds responsible for aggravating Imran’s health issue, Naqvi stated: “We will check with the Punjab government what they are doing on it. But they are on it.”
‘Politicians onboard but Aleema vetoed everything’
However, the minister claimed, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum told the PTI that the “issue would die down” if the opposition accepted the government’s arrangements.
“The medical checkup could not take place for three days just because of her. On one hand, they claim to have great empathy, relation and everything. On the other hand, politics has been done to the utmost over this.”
The interior minister then questioned why roads were being blocked despite all the steps taken for Imran’s treatment.
“If your intention was good, then you would have agreed on the first day. Almost all political leaders used to be on board but Aleema Khan sahiba vetoed them. She used to reject everything,” Naqvi said.
“The problem is they want to cash this matter,” he contended.



During his media talk, Naqvi recalled how the issue of Imran’s eye ailment came to light after the government confirmed that the PTI founder was taken to Pims for a minor procedure.
He noted that the treatment was merely an injection that needed to be administered.
The minister pointed out that “as a precaution, so there are no germs”, Imran was taken to the hospital, even though doctors suggested it could be done in jail.
“I will tell you very clearly that when any prisoner needs treatment, it is our duty,” he affirmed, questioning whether all thousands of prisoners were accorded the same facilities as Imran was being provided.
The interior minister said he believed that journalists should be provided with a tour of prisons so they could witness the facilities available there.
Naqvi quipped that if the aim was political vendetta, then the first step would be to adopt a strict demeanour and restrict their facilities to what is provided to an ordinary prisoner as per the jail manual.
“If we wanted to exact political revenge, the first step would be to [tighten] him,” he said.
On the topic of the ongoing road blockades due to PTI protests, the minister said: “Our duty is to tell people to be aware of whatever cells in your party that are doing this; they are enemies of your people that have different objectives and want to do their own politics.
“[…] It is now clear to me about at least some individuals that they are more worried about their politics than his (Imran’s) health.”
The interior minister affirmed that the government would ensure the implementation of the recent Peshawar High Court (PHC) order that has directed the KP government and its police to reopen the roads.
Demand for 1-week hospital admission
Recalling previous contacts between the government and the opposition with the mediation of NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Naqvi asserted: “We made one thing very clear that in the matter of treatment, we will provide whatever facility is available to any incarcerated person as per the Constitution and the law.”
He stated that the government had sought the name of a “non-political” eye specialist for examining Imran, but the other side refused and insisted on a family member accompanying the doctor, which was also agreed to.
“I am saying all this as it is on record and you can ask the PTI leaders about this,” the minister affirmed. He further said that the name of Kasim, who he said was a cousin, was also given by the party to come along, which was allowed.
“When both things had taken place, they said ‘no, not like this, you must admit him to a hospital for a week and we will not accept anything else’,” Naqvi claimed.
The minister said the authorities would “100 per cent” have Imran hospitalised for “even two weeks” given that the doctors recommended it.
“But if the doctors do not recommend, then how can we have him admitted?” he asked. “It is not possible that just on your recommendation we admit him to hospital for one week.”
Separately, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry posted on social media platform X that Imran would be administered an injection in the next few days, and a second injection would be administered after a month.
The minister said this was expected to lead to further improvement in Imran’s condition, adding: “His (Imran’s) treatment will continue at the best hospital of Islamabad/ Rawalpindi and under the supervision of expert doctors.”







Chaudhry asserted that Imran’s family was taken into confidence at every stage.
He further said: “The government clarifies that no negligence will be committed. All prisoners are equal for us and their health is the state’s responsibility.
“Politicisation should be avoided on this matter, and baseless doubts should not be spread.”
The minister alleged that the PTI was “giving a political colour to this sensitive matter to hide its internal divide”.
TTAP terms Naqvi’s presser contrary to facts
Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) termed Naqvi’s press conference “blatantly misleading and contrary to the facts”.
In a statement, the opposition alliance said that the government was attempting to “distort” facts and create a “fabricated narrative to cover up the deteriorating health and treatment meted out to” the incarcerated former premier.







“Concealing the facts from the nation is unacceptable,” the TTAP said. It added that the “distrust of government doctors and demand for the presence of Imran’s personal physician during the medical examination was not an act of stubbornness but rather a unanimous decision taken by his family, the leadership of PTI and the TTAP”.
It said that only the incarcerated leader’s family “has the right to make a decision regarding his health”.
The opposition alliance reiterated its demand for Imran’s personal physicians to be present, stressing that inviting the political leadership “was just a facade”.
It also claimed that the “prolonged solitary confinement in which Imran has been kept comes under the category of torture, as per international human rights standards”.
It recalled that Imran last met his personal physician in November 2024, while meetings with family “have remained suspended for two-and-a-half months”.
It added that under such circumstances, “claiming that he was being given the best of facilities was a mockery of truth”.
The TTAP warned the government “against attempts to suppress the truth, distort facts, and cover up rights violations”.
Imran’s sisters dispute Naqvi’s account
Separately, Imran’s sisters — Aleema, Uzma Khanum and Noreen Niazi — also disputed Naqvi’s account while addressing a press conference in Islamabad.
First to speak among them, Aleema, said the daughter and sister-in-law of Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, had conveyed a message by the former premier after they met the latter at the Adiala jail today.
Aleema said Imran had complained about the condition of his eye and asked for his reports to be shared with his personal physicians, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf.
“Imran Khan has also said that his blood tests should be conducted and that the results be shared with his personal physicians,” Aleema added. “I ask why he is saying so,” she added, without further elaborating on the remark.
She further said that Imran had stated that his vision had been perfect but he began facing problems around three months back. “He said he conveyed to the jail superintendent that he was unable to see, but no one bothered to provide him medical treatment for three weeks.”
Aleema said Imran had also suggested initiating a case of criminal negligence against the jail superintendent.
She maintained that “we had demanded that Imran be moved to Shifa International Hospital, and the government initially agreed to it. But, they suddenly said later that he would be moved to Al Shifa Eye Hospital”.
Moreover, she continued, they had also shared the names with the government of the doctors they wanted to examine Imran. “But we were told that we should change the names, so we changed the names. Later, we suggested that Dr Nosherwan Barki be allowed to meet Imran Khan, but we got the message that it was not possible,” she claimed.
Aleema also claimed that before leaving for a visit to Sri Lanka, Naqvi had given them the guarantee that Imran would be treated at Shifa International Hospital, but the commitment was not fulfilled.
“They (government) said that [Imran’s] sisters will not be allowed to meet him. We accepted it and suggested that doctors should be allowed to meet Imran Khan, but that suggestion was also rejected,” she said.
Aleema went on to say that if Naqvi was not afraid of Imran, he should allow moving the PTI founder to Shifa International.
“They are scared of Imran Khan,” she asserted, urging “all Pakistanis” to raise their voice for the former premier.
Speaking after Aleema, Uzma claimed she had received a “call from the government” and was informed that Imran’s cousin, Qasim Zaman, could be allowed to visit him.
“I replied that Dr Barki and Dr Yusuf should be sent instead,” she said, further claiming that she was told that it was “not acceptable”.
Uzma went on to claim that she was later informed that while Imran’s family would not be allowed access to him, Dr Yusuf could visit him. But, even he was not allowed, she added.
She accused the doctors who had signed Imran’s medical report of “derailing their credibility”, saying that the report neither detailed any diagnosis nor any treatment plan.
Uzma further maintained that “we have received messages from doctors from around the world that the report was not prepared by doctors. That is why we were demanding that at least one doctor of our choice be included in the medical board [for Imran]”.
She also said that “an injection cannot be administered in jail”.
“We do not know what kind of injection was administered to Imran. Was it an injection of poison?” she asked, adding that during her last meeting with Imran, he had expressed the fear that he would be killed in jail.
PTI takes exception to minister’s remarks
Meanwhile, the PTI took exception to Naqvi’s remarks regarding Imran, wherein he said that if the government wanted to harm the former premier it would have done so at the jail.
“Given credible reports of vision loss, this statement is deeply alarming. A senior official openly implying deliberate worsening of custody conditions raises serious concerns about hidden mistreatment,” the party said on X.
“Public threats on national TV make it legitimate to question humane treatment in prolonged solitary confinement without independent medical oversight, family contact or transparency,” the party said.







“Prolonged solitary confinement is internationally recognised as harmful, especially with pre-existing conditions. Combined with deteriorating eyesight and treatment secrecy, the threat to ‘tighten’ conditions becomes far more sinister,” it said.
“This is not mere rhetoric; it concerns actual custodial reality. A state claiming rule of law must prove it through actions, not threats. When power lacks transparency and such insinuations are normalised, the risk of custodial abuse becomes urgent and credible,” it added.</p><small>2026-02-17 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/171943598ce78c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973912/iran-fm-says-agreed-with-us-on-guiding-principles-for-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Iran FM says agreed with US ‘on guiding principles’ for deal</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday the latest talks with the United States saw them agree on “a set of guiding principles” that would pave the way for a deal.
“Ultimately, we were able to reach broad agreement on a set of guiding principles, based on which we will move forward and begin working on the text of a potential agreement,” Araghchi told state TV.
“I can say that, compared with the previous round, fully serious discussions were raised and the atmosphere was more constructive,” he added.
Tehran and Washington held on Tuesday a second round of negotiations — which began earlier this month — after talks last year collapsed following Israel’s attack on Iran in June, which triggered a 12-day war.
That war saw the United States briefly join Israel with strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites.
The latest talks were held after Washington deployed an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East following Iran’s deadly crackdown last month on anti-government protests, first sparked by economic hardships.
During the interview with state TV, Araghchi said the two sides have begun a path towards an agreement, but noted that “this does not mean we can reach a deal quickly”.
“We hope this process can be completed as soon as possible and we are ready to devote sufficient time to it,” he added.
He acknowledged that it “will take time to narrow” the gap between the positions of both sides, “but at least we now have a set of guiding principles and a clearer path to move forward on”.
Khamenei says US ‘will not succeed’ in destroying Iran
Separately, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump would not succeed in destroying the Islamic republic.
“In one of his recent speeches, the US president said that for 47 years America has not succeeded in destroying the Islamic republic … I tell you: you will not succeed either,” Khamenei said in a speech.
During his speech, Khamenei warned that the US warship deployed in the Gulf could be sunk.
“We constantly hear that they have sent a warship towards Iran. A warship is certainly a dangerous weapon, but even more dangerous is the weapon capable of sinking it,” he said.
Khamenei expressed skepticism over the outcome of the negotiations with the US.
“If there are to be negotiations — because there is no real room for negotiation — determining the outcome of the negotiations in advance is a mistake and madness,” he said, referring to US calls for Iran to abandon its nuclear programme.
“The statements of the American president, at times threatening and at times dictating what should and should not be done, reveal a desire to dominate the Iranian nation,” Khamenei said.</p><small>2026-02-17 14:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1718504603ee008.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973913/hrcp-calls-for-judicial-inquiry-into-deaths-resulting-from-operations-by-punjabs-crime-control-department' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP calls for judicial inquiry into deaths resulting from operations by Punjab’s Crime Control Department</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A fact-finding report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has called for an urgent high-level judicial inquiry into deaths resulting from operations conducted by Punjab’s Crime Control Department (CCD), alleging that the department has adopted a “deliberate policy of staged police encounters leading to extrajudicial killings”.
Last year, the Punjab government formally approved the establishment of the CCD to curb organised crime and protect life and property in the province. However, human rights advocates and civil society members have been voicing their concerns about the alleged encounters and the number of casualties.
According to the HRCP, based on press accounts, at least 670 CCD-led encounters were carried out across Punjab over eight months in 2025.
These operations reportedly resulted in the deaths of 924 suspects, while only two police officials were killed during the same timeframe, it said.







The HRCP noted that the sharp disparity in casualties — averaging more than two fatal encounters per day — alongside similar operational patterns reported across districts, pointed to what it described as an “institutionalised practice” rather than isolated incidents of misconduct.
The commission’s findings highlighted the “systematic violations” of domestic law and Pakistan’s international human rights obligations.
It stated that the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act 2022 required the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to investigate every custodial death under the supervision of the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR).
However, the HRCP said there was no evidence that such mandatory procedures were consistently followed in the cases examined. In one instance, the commission said, a court had to direct the FIA to initiate an investigation.
Additionally, the commission said that magisterial inquiries required under Sections 174–176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were not conducted in several cases reviewed.
The commission’s findings also expressed concern that neither the Punjab government nor CCD and police officials responded to its request for meetings during the course of the inquiry, describing the lack of engagement as indicative of institutional reluctance to address serious human rights allegations.
It also documented what it described as a “climate of fear among affected families”.
In one case, the commission said, relatives of the suspect alleged they were pressured by police to bury the deceased immediately and warned of further harm if they pursued legal action. The HRCP termed such actions as criminal intimidation and a direct obstruction of justice.
Citing international standards, the commission stated that CCD operations appeared inconsistent with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, which require that lethal force be used only when necessary and proportionate, and that accountability mechanisms be enforced in cases of misuse.
It observed that CCD press releases and first information reports followed a nearly identical narrative pattern — alleging suspects fired first, police acted in self-defence, and those killed were “hardened criminals” — raising concerns about coordinated messaging rather than independent operational outcomes.
The HRCP emphasised that sustainable public safety cannot be secured through “lethal shortcuts” that bypass investigation, prosecution and judicial oversight.
Among its recommendations, the commission called for an immediate province-wide moratorium on all encounter operations until comprehensive legal safeguards and independent oversight mechanisms are established.
It further urged that all encounter-related deaths be investigated by the FIA under NCHR supervision, the formation of an independent civilian police oversight commission, and mandatory compensation for the families of those killed in such operations.
Last year in October, the HRCP had reported a “sharp and deadly” surge in police encounters across Punjab. It had warned that such practices eroded public trust in legal institutions and set a dangerous precedent for state-sanctioned violence.
However, the Punjab police had filed a report in the Lahore High Court in January, claiming that the establishment of the CCD led to a significant decline in serious crime across the province.
Furthermore, the police had also rebuffed all the claims of fake encounters and extrajudicial killings.</p><small>2026-02-17 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1717333958c7123.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973906/dar-to-visit-new-york-for-unsc-briefing-on-palestine-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Dar to visit New York for UNSC briefing on Palestine: FO</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will visit New York on February 18 to participate in a high-level United Nations Security Council (UNSC) briefing on the situation in Palestine, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Tuesday.
In a statement, the FO said that the meeting will be chaired by the United Kingdom’s foreign secretary as president of the UNSC.







The statement said that during the briefing, Dar will reaffirm Pakistan’s “principled and consistent position on Palestine”.
“He will reiterate Pakistan’s strong opposition of Israel’s recent illegal decisions to expand its control over the West Bank, emphasise the need for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, full implementation of Security Council resolution 2803, scaled-up humanitarian assistance, and the early commencement of Gaza’s recovery and reconstruction,” the statement said.
“The deputy prime minister will also underscore Pakistan’s continued engagement with international and regional partners, including the group of eight Arab and Islamic countries and the United States, in support of a just and lasting peace, anchored in international law, leading to the realisation of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent, sovereign and contiguous Palestinian State based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” the statement added.
Separately, on the margins of the visit, Dar will hold bilateral meetings with counterparts to discuss matters of mutual interest, it concluded.
The development comes as the foreign ministers of eight Muslim nations, including Pakistan, condemned the Israeli move to claim land in the occupied West Bank as “state property”.
It should be mentioned that the same eight countries had worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan last year to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza.
On Monday, Pakistan had released a separate statement condemning the Israeli move, calling on the international community to reject its actions.</p><small>2026-02-17 13:05</small></div><hr>
