The father, a 50-year-old, was killed at the scene, taking the number of dead to 16, while his 24-year-old son was in a critical condition in hospital, police said at a press conference on Monday.
The father and son were identified as Sajid Akram and Naveed Akram, respectively, by state broadcaster ABC and other local media outlets.
Officials have described Sunday’s shooting as a targeted anti-Semitic attack.
Forty people remain in hospital following the attack, including two police officers who are in a serious but stable condition, police said. The victims were aged between 10 and 87.
Witnesses said the attack at the famed beach, which was packed on a hot evening, lasted about 10 minutes, sending hundreds of people scattering along the sand and into nearby streets.
Police said around 1,000 people had attended the targeted Hanukkah event, which was held in a small park off the beach.
A bystander captured on video tackling and disarming an armed man during the attack has been hailed as a hero whose actions saved lives.
7News Australia named him as Ahmed al Ahmed, citing a relative, who said the 43-year-old fruit shop owner had been shot twice and had undergone surgery.



A fundraising page for the man had raised more than A$350,000 (£233,000) by Monday afternoon.
Police did not release the shooters’ names, but said the father had held a firearms licence since 2015 and had six licensed weapons.
Home Minister Tony Burke said the father arrived in Australia in 1998 on a student visa, while his son is an Australian-born citizen.
Police did not provide details about the firearms, but videos from the scene showed the men firing what appeared to be a bolt-action rifle and a shotgun.
“We are very much working through the background of both persons. At this stage, we know very little about them,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters.
Bondi local Morgan Gabriel, 27, said she had been heading to a nearby cinema when she heard what she thought were fireworks, before people started running up her street.
“I sheltered about six or seven. Two of them were actually my close friends, and the rest were just people that were on the street. But people, their phones had been left down the beach, and everyone was just trying to get away,” she said.
“It’s a very sad time this morning … Normally, like on a Monday or any morning, it’s packed. People are swimming, surfing, running. So this is very, very quiet. And there’s definitely a solemn sort of vibe.”
A makeshift memorial with flowers and Israeli and Australian flags was set up at the Bondi pavilion and an online condolence book was established.
Police and private Jewish security guards wearing earpieces were positioned around as mourners paid respects and laid flowers.
World leaders condemn the attack
Authorities said they were confident only two attackers were involved in the incident, after previously saying they were checking whether a third offender was involved.
At the suspects’ home in Bonnyrigg, a suburb around 36 km west of the CBD, there was a heavy police presence on Monday, with a cordon wrapping around several neighbouring houses.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Bondi Beach on Monday morning to lay flowers near the scene of the attack.
“What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of anti-Semitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location,” Albanese told reporters.
“The Jewish community are hurting today. Today, all Australians wrap our arms around them and say, we stand with you. We will do whatever is necessary to stamp out antisemitism. It is a scourge, and we will eradicate it together.”
Albanese later urged Australians to light a candle in solidarity with the Jewish community “to show that light will indeed defeat darkness — part of what Hanukkah celebrates”, he said.
Albanese said several world leaders including US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron had reached out and offered condolences and support.
Sunday’s shootings were the most serious in a string of anti-Semitic attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars in Australia since the beginning of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in October 2023.
‘Saw bodies on the ground ’
Mass shootings are rare in Australia, one of the world’s safest countries. Sunday’s attack was the worst since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people at the Port Arthur tourist site in the southern island state of Tasmania.
Rabbi Mendel Kastel, whose brother-in-law Eli Schlanger was killed in Sunday’s attack, said it had been a harrowing evening.
“You can very easily become very angry and try to blame people, turn on people but that’s not what this is about. It’s about a community,” he said.
“We need to step up at a time like this, be there for each other, and come together. And we will, and we will get through this, and we know that. The Australian community will help us do it,” he added.
Local woman Danielle, who declined to give her surname, was at the beach when the shooting occurred and raced to collect her daughter, who was attending a bar mitzvah at a function centre near where the alleged shooters were positioned.
“I heard there was a shooting so I bolted there to get my daughter, I could hear gunshots, I saw bodies on the ground. We are used to being scared, we have felt this way since October 7.”
Australia’s Jewish diaspora is small but deeply embedded in the wider community, with about 150,000 people who identify as Jewish in the country of 27 million.
About one-third of them are estimated to live in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, including Bondi. Major cities including Berlin, London and New York stepped up security around Hanukkah events on Sunday following the attack at Bondi.</p><small>2025-12-15 05:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/150951158e0f2e5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961146/goods-transport-owners-strike-forces-development-projects-in-punjab-to-stop' target='_blank'><strong>Goods transport owners strike forces development projects in Punjab to stop</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The ongoing development projects — both public and private sectors — have come to a grinding halt in Lahore and other parts of Punjab after the suspension of delivery of supplies of construction material due to the ongoing wheel-jam strike by goods transporters.
The situation of dust pollution, smog and other environmental issues has also worsened due to the incomplete projects, Dawn has learnt.
“At present, the work on all the ongoing development projects in which construction material (mainly cement, crushed stones etc) is required is stopped for the last seven days or so due to the suspension of material delivery from Sargodha and other parts of Punjab,” commented an official of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA). “The situation persists not only in Lahore but also in other cities and towns of the province where a huge number of development works are underway at the moment,” he added.
According to another official source in the Metropolitan Corporation Lahore, the work on the ongoing development schemes under the Lahore Development Plan (LDP) has also slowed down due to the non-supply of construction material. “The concrete work is a vital part of construction that cannot be completed without crushed stones, cement and other items,” he explained.

Public and private sector development projects in Punjab have come to a grinding halt owing to the lack of construction material delivery

Talking to Dawn, a private builder said that all construction-related activities requiring core building material had stopped or slowed down not only in Lahore but also in other cities including Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Sahiwal, Bahawalpur and Multan. “At present, no work is in progress at the under-construction building requiring brickwork, lenter, plaster, tilework etc, as there is no supply of cement, crushed stone and other material. Even those constructing their houses privately have no option but to stop work in such a terrible situation,” he explained. He requested the government to make efforts to resume business activities as the same was also causing unemployment.
On the other hand, the transporters have refused to surrender before the government till the acceptance of their demands, including suspension of the controversial clauses of the Motor Vehicle Ordinance 2025, stopping registration of FIRs against drivers, imposition of heavy fines and impounding vehicles on various traffic laws violations.
“We will not call off the strike until the acceptance of our genuine demands,” said Khalid Arain of the Punjab Stone Transporters Association based in Sargodha. “We can call off the strike if, at least, someone responsible can give us an assurance to resolve our issues within the shortest possible time,” he said, requesting the government to cooperate for the sake of a huge number of people having no work due to the strike.
EXHIBITION: The annual Chrysanthemum Flower Show 2025, organised by the Parks & Horticulture Authority (PHA), is in full swing at the Jilani Park, captivating citizens with its vibrant colours, pleasant fragrance, and creative floral displays.
The event has emerged as a major attraction for families, with more than 100,000 people visiting the park over the weekend alone to enjoy the breathtaking exhibition.
According to PHA Managing Director Raja Mansoor Ahmad, the visitors had appreciated the excellent arrangements, artistic presentation, and innovative landscaping showcased at the exhibition. Featuring more than 200 varieties of flowers and thousands of beautifully arranged flowerpots, the show has transformed Jilani Park into a mesmerizing blend of colors and scents. The park has become a serene, family-friendly, and visually appealing recreational destination for children, women, and men alike.
“Chrysanthemum Flower Show will continue at Jilani Park until December 15,” said the MD. He said that the annual flower show had proven to be a special gift for the public. “So far, more than 1.5 million visitors have attended the exhibition, reflecting its immense popularity and public appreciation,” he added.

KARACHI: Residents of Defence View and adjacent localities, students of nearby educational institutions and thousands of commuters using Shaheed-i-Millat Expressway are forced to endure the stench of garbage collected by authorities from across district East and dumped along the Malir riverbank.
The area is also polluted with dust, harmful fumes and toxic gases emanating from the piles of garbage.
Known as GTS Imtiaz (Garbage Transfer Station-Imtiaz), because of its proximity with the Qayyumabad outlet of the chain of department stores, the garbage dump is managed by the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB).
Dawn visited the locality where the area residents said the pungent smell, dust, toxic gases and air pollution from the site have not only disrupted daily life, but have also given rise to various health problems.
The GTS Imtiaz is one of the centres where waste collected from district East is temporarily transferred before being moved to landfill sites. However, residents claim that a facility which should have been located on the outskirts of the city has instead been established near a residential area, severely affecting the entrance to the Defence Housing Authority.
Locals said that upon entering the district, the overwhelming stench of garbage greets the people, while hundreds of kites and other birds circle the area, creating an unsightly and unhygienic environment.
According to the World Health Organisation and UN-Habitat guidelines, waste should not be left in the open at transfer stations, as these facilities are meant only for temporary storage before transfer. Open-air storage produces foul odours, harmful gases, dust, attracts flies and birds, and increases disease risks, especially near residential areas.
The UN guidelines add that proper transfer stations should use sealed containers and covered halls to control odours; without this, the facility becomes a dumping site, threatening public health and urban living.
It also mentions that children, the elderly and patients with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable. Continuous odours also contribute to mental stress, sleep disruption and reduced quality of life, while improper management encourages pests and risks contaminating nearby rivers or streams.
A study by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), a public health agency within the US Department of Health and Human Services, states that organic waste emits gases like hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and methane during decomposition, producing a rotten-egg smell. Prolonged exposure can cause breathing difficulties, worsen asthma and allergies, trigger headaches and nausea, irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and affect the nervous system.
Frustrations grow over health risks, daily discomfort In a visit to the area, Dawn talked to residents as well as students of a nearby private university.
Defence View Phase II resident and MBBS student Maria said she and her family were facing a variety of health problems.
She added that the continuous smell and air pollution, particularly affecting respiratory health, have had a severe impact on her mother.
A passer-by said that people chose to live in upscale areas expecting better facilities and a cleaner environment.
“But when one enters the district and is immediately hit by a stench and pollution, the whole idea of living here seems pointless. The difference between affluent and ordinary areas disappears,” he added.
A student from Iqra University, located opposite the GTS Imtiaz, said the city already struggles with pollution, and daily garbage transfers at this site make the situation worse. “This is totally unfair,” he added.
A group of three other students from the same university shared that in the morning, when garbage is moved, the dust is so thick that it becomes “difficult to see, significantly reducing visibility”.
They also highlighted that a month ago, smoke from burning garbage would fill the entire university campus and classrooms, causing health issues, though burning has ceased over the past month.
Student Amna said that while a large transfer station is located on the opposite side of the university, a smaller station has been set up in the university parking area, leaving students “surrounded by garbage on both sides”.
Defence View Phase III resident Shamim Iqbal said that when garbage is moved at nights, the stench makes it almost impossible to sleep. “Even with windows and doors closed, the smell is so strong it causes nausea,” he said.
Salim, a resident of Gulshan-i-Ibrahim, Junejo Town, said that he had previously lived near Defence View Phase III but was forced to relocate due to his father’s respiratory condition. “The odour is so overpowering that even breathing becomes difficult,” he added.
A local shopkeeper said that the smell and pollution attracted flies over food items, creating serious hygiene and health issues.
Residents expressed concerns that the GTS’s location near the Malir River could exacerbate environmental risks, particularly during rains, when garbage and contaminated water might flow into the river.
They demanded that transfer stations be relocated away from residential areas or properly covered in accordance with recognised environmental and health standards.
SSWMB response
The SSWMB Managing Director, Tariq Ali Nizamani, told Dawn that the GTS Imtiaz functions as an intermediary point, where waste is first brought before being transferred to landfill sites.
He added that four of the six GTS facilities in Karachi — GTS Imtiaz, Dinga Morr, Sharafi and Gutter Baghicha — are in the process of being modernised, including GTS Imtiaz.
Mr Nizamani added that the work on the GTS Imtiaz was expected to be completed by early next year.
“Once modernisation is complete, the facility will be upgraded into a covered centre to improve the collection and transfer of waste,” he added.
Regarding complaints about garbage burning, the MD said that previously some scavengers would remove usable items from the site and burn the remaining waste. However, eight guards have now been deployed by the board to prevent such incidents from recurring.
He explained that decomposing waste produces methane gas, which poses a fire risk, considering that water bowsers have also been stationed on site to respond immediately to any potential hazards.

Home to nearly two billion people, this region is sandwiched between geopolitical rivalry and ecological fragility. The 1.5 degrees Celsius in not a distant world here — it is the lived experience of millions. The glaciers in the Third Pole are melting rapidly, threatening the water security of both Pakistan and India. Recurrent droughts are driving migration and deepening poverty in Afghanistan. Glacial lake outburst floods threaten mountain communities in Nepal, while Bangladesh faces rising seas that could submerge one-fifth of its land.
For decades, the region’s political energy has been consumed by border disputes, identity politics, and historical grievances. Yet none of these rivalries will matter, if climate change renders our lands uninhabitable and our economies unviable.
According to scientific reports, South Asia is warming up more rapidly than the rest of the world, and therefore, logic suggests that the region cannot afford another century of hate and hostility. Its people share rivers, monsoons, mountains and deltas. All these systems are under assault by nature posing a threat far greater than cross-border conflicts.
As the glaciers in the region retreat, transboundary rivers such as the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra are becoming increasingly unpredictable. In this context, water is emerging not just as a resource, but as a potential fault line. As water flows become more erratic, the temptation to use dams and diversions as tools is growing. The Kabul River tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, or India’s upstream dam building on the Indus tributaries show how easily climate-linked resources can morph into geopolitical friction. But herein lies the paradox and irony: no country can protect its water and food security in isolation. The hydrological of the region makes every country an upper or lower riparian necessitating a shared approach to solutions for peace and stability.

The combination of climate change and conflict politics is fast turning this region into one of the world’s most dangerous flashpoints.

The World Bank estimates that South Asia could lose up to 10 per cent of its GDP by mid-century due to climate impacts. Agriculture, which employs nearly half the region’s population, is under siege from heat stress and unpredictable rainfall. Cities like Lahore, Delhi and Dhaka are choking under smog and water shortages. Health systems are collapsing under vector-borne diseases and heat-related illnesses. The consequences are clear. The climate crisis has become a social equaliser of suffering, disproportionately affecting women, informal workers and the urban poor. For them, adaptation is not a policy debate but a matter of daily survival.

 

The truth is that the real threat to regional stability does not lie across a frontier. It rests in its atmosphere, rivers and the Third Pole that bind the landmass. The multilateral process of climate negotiations is slow and does not meet the urgent needs of vulnerable countries. It is time for South Asia to look inward and strengthen its adaptive resilience to climate change. In a region where hunger and hope coexist uneasily, peace is not just a political stance but a survival strategy.
The combination of climate change and conflict politics is fast turning this densely populated region into one of the world’s most dangerous flashpoints. The status quo is no longer viable simply because the dynamics of climate change have altered the power equation. This existential threat is more lethal than nuclear weapons. It can kill millions and foreclose the future for the next generation.
Time has come to reframe political discourse and look at the future through the lens of nature. Thus far, Pakistan and India have built their narratives on a zero-sum game with disputed agendas as the fulcrum of their objective. This needs to change, making survival and well-being of the people as the core objective, and looking at disputes as an obstacle. This shift in perception along with a negotiating strategy that is integrative and not distributive in intent, can change the future of South Asia giving each country a higher potential for growth and development.
A pivot to Asia in the real sense can only be possible if all countries in South Asia agree to address the climate crisis collectively as a political imperative. Taking a regional approach has many advantages that can be discussed among countries if pragmatism and not passion guide thinking. The linked geographies serve as green corridors and the climate crisis makes it necessary for South Asia to develop its own ‘Regional Climate Framework Agreement’. Notwithstanding current tensions, there is still room for reason and need to reframe climate cooperation not as a peripheral environmental concern but a core security issue.
South Asia has two parallel futures; one with business as usual that will keep us mired in poverty, escalate conflicts and intensify risks. A different choice can usher in an era of peace, prosperity and stability. Our choices will shape the future. The youth should not inherit a grim future. They need to create a new future and make it a place they want to visit.
The shift in stance will require courage to challenge entrenched nationalist narratives, and clarity to see that survival depends on shared action, not competition. A shared horizon is not utopian thinking but a strategic imperative. The future of South Asia will not be decided on the battlefield but the cost of conflict will be measured in hunger, displacement and lost futures.

A surge in public optimism in the earlier part of the year seemed to fade towards year-end. An Ipsos poll released in December found nearly 70 per cent of people felt the country was headed in the wrong direction. It also showed 82pc of respondents had no confidence in the economy despite progress made by the government in achieving short-term macroeconomic stabilisation.
Government-opposition confrontations kept a deeply polarised country in an unsettled state, making political stability elusive. There was a marked slide into authoritarianism, which reinforced the trend of democratic recession. The civil-military balance shifted even more decisively to the latter’s advantage in a governing arrangement that went beyond being ‘hybrid-plus’. The internal security situation continued to be challenging with an upsurge in militant activity and terrorist attacks.

 

One of the most consequential events of the year was the four-day conflict in May between India and Pakistan. Pakistan’s effective management of the military confrontation in which it got the better of its adversary generated a rise in national pride and self-confidence. It produced a significant surge in the military’s popularity and image. India failed to achieve its objectives in spite of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unsubstantiated claims of destroying the “terrorist infrastructure”. Its resort to a military ‘solution’ for a terror attack backfired as it miscalculated the consequences of its actions. As a result of its clumsy diplomacy and missteps, New Delhi lost considerable ground in the international arena from which Islamabad gained.
The crisis left a long-troubled relationship in an even more fraught state with neither side showing any interest in resuming diplomatic engagement. With sharply conflicting lessons drawn by them from the conflict this heightened the risk for miscalculation and created uncertainty ahead.

2025 saw democratic erosion, greater military dominance and elusive political stability.

Its domestic political consequence was to further shift the power balance from the civilians to the military, make the military more dominant in governance and establish what many agreed was a ‘new model’ of military ascendancy. It led to constitutional changes that bestowed wider powers, privileges and lifelong immunity to the top military leadership. It also involved the most far-reaching transformation of the higher defence organisation since the 1970s.
These developments left the coalition government, with its legitimacy in doubt since the disputed election of 2024, look even weaker. In ceding so much power to the establishment, it turned itself into a junior ‘partner’ in the country’s governance. Its credibility was further eroded by its increasingly authoritarian conduct. The most egregious action in 2025 was the government’s assault on the independence of the judiciary by adoption of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. This struck at the heart of the Constitution and delivered another blow to democracy by subordinating the judiciary to the executive and undermining the rule of law.
There were a series of other democratic reversals in 2025. Every indicator of democracy showed regression. Parliament was reduced to a rubber stamp, freedom of assembly curbed, opposition suppressed, the media controlled and digital space restricted. Pressure was mounted on human rights organisations that impeded their work. Political protests were frequently banned and dubious cases filed against opposition leaders. But power grabs such as through the 27th Amendment and repressive actions did not inject confidence in the government, which frequently appeared jittery and insecure in the face of criticism. It seemed to mistake repressive ‘control’ for strength whereas that only signalled its weakness and lack of self-confidence.
Speculation intensified about a government ban on PTI after adoption of a resolution by the Punjab Assembly in early December. This followed the military spokesman’s presser in which he described Imran Khan, jailed for over two years now, as “a national security threat”. A ban would be disastrous if it were to happen. But for its part, a divided and factionalised PTI was unable to pose a serious challenge to the government or pressure it to meet its demands.
Where the government made progress was in stabilising the economy, controlling inflation and staying on track on the IMF programme. But economic stabilisation remained fragile and rested on unsustainable factors (borrowed resources and loan rollovers by friendly countries) especially as Pakistan is faced with large external financing needs in coming years and has low foreign exchange reserves and heavy debt burden. The government’s economic measures fell way short of real reform involving, for example, structural changes in the taxation system and reining in expenditure, privatisation of financially hemorrhaging state-owned enterprises and addressing the energy sector’s circular debt.
2025 did not indicate the transition from stabilisation to growth and investment had begun. Despite official efforts and signing of multiple MoUs, investment including FDI remained stagnant. The investment-to-GDP ratio at just over 13pc is actually lower than in previous years. Economic growth also remained stalled. The governor of the State Bank recently admitted that Pakistan’s current growth model is not working. The country remained mired in a low-growth, low-investment, high-debt equilibrium trap. Without action on dealing with structural issues this situation will not change. With exports contracting and imports surging, economic experts warned of a crisis ahead from the widening external account deficit.

 

The outgoing year saw a significant spike in terrorist and militant violence across KP and Balochistan and terror strikes beyond. The two insurgency-afflicted provinces struggled through the year with attacks by TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army respectively. While the army and law-enforcement agencies made notable gains, the internal security situation remained worrisome. The rise in casualties of security personnel made 2025 the deadliest year in almost a decade. The need to revisit and redesign Pakistan’s counter-militancy strategy was acutely felt but the task is yet to be undertaken.
These trends and developments indicate the challenges that lie ahead in the coming year. What is evident is that political and economic stability will remain elusive unless fundamental problems are resolved, domestic peace established and governance is focused on meeting public needs and aspirations rather than advancing the interests of a ruling elite preoccupied with perpetuating its power.

According to officials, the decision was taken at the 20th meeting of Conference of the Parties (CoP), CITES, recently held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.
The development, sources said, followed effective lobbying efforts of the Pakistani delegation that put up a revised plea before the global forum to consider the plant for inclusion in the CITES.
The initial proposal put up by Germany and supported by EU countries couldn’t get the two-third majority.
Describing the development as a major success for Pakistan on the international forum, officials said that the status would help tackle the growing threat of the plant’s illegal trade.

Gughar, native to Karoonjar Hills, now listed on CITES; the status will help tackle growing threat to plant’s illegal trade

“This decision will help promote global traceability of the plant’s trade,” said Sindh Wildlife Conser­vator Javed Ahmed Mahar, adding that while the CITES Appendix 11 didn’t place a ban on the plant’s trade, it called upon on the member states to set up a mechanism to make the trade transparent and traceable.
“The CITES Appendix II creates a strict science-based control system that only allows international trade when specimens are legally acquired and sustainably sourced. Every shipment is required to carry standardised CITES permit, creating a fully traceable chain of custody that can be verified at any border,” Mr Mahar explained.
Sources said plant’s illegal trade from Pakistan had increased dramatically in recent years following complete ban by India on its extraction from the species’ native population growing in Rajasthan. The plant’s resin, they said, was in high demand across the world.
In 2024, the wildlife department in collaboration with anti-narcotics force had confiscated two major illegal shipments containing high-value plant materials, including that of gughar, which was declared protected the same year.
The decision came in light of Sindh High Court’s last year’s order placing a complete ban on mining and excavation activities at Nagarparkar’s Karoonjar hills, a key habitat of the plant.
Precious plant
A perennial shrub, gughar (Commiphora Wightii) is found in parts of Tharparkar, Sindh, and Balochistan in Pakistan, India and Oman. The plant is targeted for its dense oily resin known as guggulu or guggul.
This substance, expert say, is widely used in traditional medicines for the treatment of various disorders. Scientific evidences show the shrub to be profoundly effective against diverse chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, arthritis, pancreatitis, dermatitis, diabetes, infectious diseases, intestinal metaplasia, otitis media, respiratory diseases, asthma, psoriasis, and gingivitis.
Besides, according to experts, it also exerts hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, cardio-protective, hypolipidemia, and thyroid stimulatory effects by targeting multiple signalling pathways.
“C.wightii is vulnerable to overexploitation, both because of its life history characteristics as well as the higher yields produced when destructive methods are used to harvest its gum. The species is slow growing with a poor germination rate and harvest is focused on mature individuals that are at least five years old (and 8-10 years old in India). Unregulated commercial exploitation is therefore expected to impact the recruitment and regeneration capacity of C.wightii, which is already heavily depleted,” says the proposal read out by Dr David Harter of Germany at the conference.
It calls for urgent regulation to control its international trade and promote the recovery of the remaining population of the species.

A small tremor turns into a fault line, and what feels stable can give way without warning. Three such changes are now forming beneath the surface, in Japan, in Washington and across Europe, each with the potential to reshape policy, flows and currencies in the months ahead.
Japan: a storm building in silence
The entire world is borrowing yen at 0.5 per cent and earning $4. It looks calm. It feels stable. But this is the most vulnerable structure in global liquidity today. The moment Japan hints at tightening, that calm will break. As the US Federal Reserve System (Fed) eases interest rate and the Bank of Japan tightens, guess what happens to the yen against the dollar? The pace at which carry trades unwind will throw all cross assets into stress. Japanese institutions have been selling US T-bills, a trend that can accelerate as hedging costs rise and the economics of the carry trade break down.
Add to this a Japan that is finally opening its doors to global capital, including the Gulf Cooperation Council, rebuilding its buyout market, and inviting investment into artificial intelligence, defence and advanced manufacturing.
Japan is pivoting. And markets are not prepared for how quickly the yen can move once the Bank of Japan shifts its stance.

Traders believe the State Bank will buy surplus dollars to rebuild reserves, limiting further appreciation and keeping the currency close to current levels.

The Fed: a shift beneath the surface
As expected, the US Federal Reserve has cut rates by 25bps, but not without three dissents. The question is what happens after this?
Political pressure on the Fed is rising. The question is not whether Jerome Powell, Chair of the US Federal Reserve, cuts once or thrice next year; the question is who will shape the Fed’s direction over the next two years. Monetary policy only works when the institution is seen as independent. Right now, that anchor is under strain.
Disinflation is progressing. Labour softening is clearer once you strip out noise. But markets are no longer just reacting to data. They are reacting to the possibility that the Fed may become an extension of the White House rather than an independent institution of monetary regulation. It is subtle, but it is seismic.
Europe: a fault line
The new US National Security Strategy unsettled the foundation of the trans-Atlantic relationship. The strongest criticism was aimed not at Russia or China but at Europe itself. It described European governments as weakened and struggling to hold identity. This is a written policy, not an offhand comment.
It also recasts the US as an intermediary between Europe and Russia rather than Europe’s anchor. For markets, this adds a long-lasting political risk premium at a moment when the European Central Bank cannot afford it.
Currency outlooks
Pakistan finally secured the $1.2 billion facility under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Extended Fund Facility and Resilience and Sustainability Facility. Country reserves should move past the $20.5bn mark, a level last seen during Covid-19, and that alone is keeping sentiment steady. Interbank liquidity is calm, nostros are comfortable, and the market is now asking if the rupee can stretch toward Rs278 per dollar.
Trade flows do favour levels below Rs280 per dollar, but traders’ view is that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) will step in to buy excess dollars and rebuild reserves rather than allow further appreciation, keeping the currency close to current levels.
Data from October also shows SBP’s net short swap position holding near $2bn, so the pressure on forward premiums is coming from exporters selling forward and a rise in foreign exchange loans, not from any change in the SBP’s stance. However, we expect premiums to improve marginally now that IMF dollars are received.
As for the Indian rupee (INR) slipping past 90 per dollar, it was less about the number and more about the silence that followed. For the first time in years, the market sensed that the Reserve Bank of India was willing to let the rupee breathe on the downside. No dramatic defence or heavy selling, but rather an uneasy acceptance of the new level. The INR will not likely find any respite from the 25bps Fed rate cut.
For the INR to stabilise, it needs two structural shifts: an oil bear market that resets India’s terms of trade and a US–India trade deal that finally unlocks the next leg of growth. Until then, it will drift further into the early 90s. It is a currency in waiting, not a currency in crisis.
Finally, the Great British Pound rallies feel like echoes of an older world; they do not last. Each bounce runs into the same issues: political noise, fragile gilts, and conflicting policy signals. Sterling is not broken, but it no longer has the cushion it once enjoyed. For now, strength invites selling more than commitment on the buy side.

But 40 years after the fact, Saarc remains an unfulfilled dream, marked more by lost potential than any significant achievement in improving regional integration. What could have been an EU- or Asean-like grouping has largely failed to deliver on its promise of promoting the “welfare of the peoples of South Asia”.
Both President Asif Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to mark Saarc Charter Day on Dec 8, reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to Saarc and to work with “all willing states” to improve regional trade. But the fact remains that the Pakistan-India rivalry has been and remains the biggest obstacle in transforming Saarc into a dynamic regional body. This has been the case despite the Saarc Charter clearly stating that “bilateral and contentious issues shall be excluded”.
At one time, hawks in Pakistan vetoed moves to improve ties with India. For the past many years, it has been India which has blocked all attempts to break the ice with Pakistan. Indian influence to isolate Pakistan has resulted in the paralysis of Saarc. For example, the last Saarc summit was held in Kathmandu in 2014. The 2016 summit in Islamabad was ‘indefinitely postponed’ after India engineered a boycott of the event, along with a few other members.
In this context, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is not wrong when he says that multilateralism is “under assault” in South Asia. It is a fact that no multilateral body can function when one or more members seek to assert their hegemony over smaller states, or attempt to isolate other members. And with the Pakistan-India relationship at a historic low, any revival of Saarc at this point seems remote.

 

So, should Saarc’s requiem be written? Should South Asian states look at other formations — SCO, BRICS etc — to enhance trade and connectivity, as well as improve bilateral ties? Arguably, while bilateral relations should be pursued, and other multilateral partnerships explored further, the South Asian dream of harmony and peace should not be buried in such haste. Without intra-regional trade, countries in close proximity cannot prosper.
South Asian trade is currently in the dismal territory of around 5pc. Perhaps another attempt can be made to revive Saarc, so that — while respecting each state’s sovereignty — a regional community can be built around the principles of trade, peace and people-to-people contacts. But for this, India must stop behaving like a hegemon, and especially shed its animosity towards Pakistan. Ultimately, the Saarc Charter’s aim of improving “the quality of life of the peoples of the region” is a goal still worth pursuing.

Most cars cannot reach this area, because the dusty mountain path that winds its way through the pass was never paved. I make my way there riding pillion on a motorbike, because anything else would get a puncture.
The path that we take only exists because smugglers use the route to haul their ‘wares’ from Afghanistan into Balochistan, locals tell me after I reach the village.
At first glace, it seems like we’ve returned to medieval times: there is no electricity, healthcare, road infrastructure, or any other basic facility, for that matter. The cold weather also brings to mind the absence of natural gas, which remains a pipe-dream for many parts of Balochistan.
Once, Pishin used to be governed from Quetta, and was only granted the status of a district in January 1975. But the change of administration has not cha­nged the lives of those who inhabit this difficult terrain.
During our visit, we spot only two cars in the entire settlement. These, we learn, are mostly used to ferry pregnant women to hospitals for childbirth. Most other residents use motorbikes, like we did, to travel to other villages en route to the border, or southward to Quetta.

The sight of an abandoned school building catches our eye — it has no doors or windows, and is filled with dry hay for cattle to feast on. As we approach the abandoned school, a man from the nearby village, who we later discover is one of the local notables, approaches us.
First he warns us not to approach the school building, as there is a ferocious dog about. When that fails to dissuade us, he becomes more straight-forward: “You cannot take photographs of the school,” he says in Pashto.

Named after another local notable, Daru Khan, the school in Inzargai village is one of the three in Sanzala Pass that never opened since construction finished around a decade ago. This is why most of the children we meet in the area work instead of studying.
Due to a lack of economic opportunities, dozens of youths from Sanzala can be found working in ubiquitous ‘Quetta tea hotels’ across the entire country.
Our Pashtun Achakzai hosts welcome us at lunchtime. After our meal, I ask them, “Do your children go to school?”
An elderly farmer laughs along with his nephews: “Where are the schools in our village?” he asks in response.
Sattar, the farmer, has five children of his own. Ameen has six, while his younger brother Saeedo has three, and Faizullah, the elder brother, has nine children.
They themselves are nine siblings. I do the math: this means around 30 family members, mostly children, in one joint family that are out of school. Besides, there are several other villages in the pass, stretching right up to the border. This means that potentially hundreds of children of school-going age are falling by the wayside.

Talking to Dawn, Faizullah Kakar, the local district education officer (DEO), claimed only two schools in the area were closed due to the non-ava­ilability of teachers and community disputes, while three were functional.
However, he called the area — located just over 40km from Quetta — a ‘far-flung area’ of the district, vowing that all schools would be reopened by March 2026, when bus services would be provided to teachers who cannot go there on their own.
“The MPAs only think of us during election time, and we have to travel all the way to Pishin town on bikes to cast our votes,” Sattar regrets, adding that soon after the elections, “they forget all about us and our issues”.

Nearly 60 years later, the US government still refuses to publicly acknowledge what happened — even as fears persist that the device could pose environmental and security risks to millions of people whose water supply depends on the Ganges river basin, according to a New York Times report.
The operation, kept secret for more than a decade, involved American and Indian climbers scaling Nanda Devi — India’s second-highest peak — to install a nuclear-powered surveillance station designed to spy on China’s missile programme.
The generator, known as a SNAP-19C, was fuelled by highly radioactive plutonium and intended to power an antenna capable of intercepting telemetry from Chinese nuclear tests. Containing Pu-239 — an isotope used in the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki — similar generators were used by Nasa to power satellites such as Voyager I.

Designed to power spy equipment to track Chinese N-tests, the generator was abandoned atop Nanda Devi during a blizzard. According to NYT, it has never been recovered

In 1965, as the climbers neared the summit, a violent storm forced a retreat. Acting to save lives, the expedition leader ordered the team to secure the equipment near the top and descend immediately.
The generator, weighing about 50 pounds, was left behind. When climbers returned the following spring, it was gone.
An avalanche had torn away the ledge where it was stored. Despite multiple search missions using radiation detectors and metal sensors, the generator was never found.
The loss triggered alarm inside the CIA and anxiety in both Washington and New Delhi, sparking a decades long cover-up that was continued by the likes of president Jimmy Carter.
The plutonium-powered device is still believed to be buried somewhere beneath glaciers that feed the Ganges River, a lifeline for hundreds of millions of people. While scientific studies conducted in the 1970s found no evidence of contamination and concluded the risk was low, concerns have never fully subsided — especially as Himalayan glaciers melt faster due to climate change.
The episode became public in 1978 after an investigative reporter blew the lid off the mission, sparking outrage in India. Lawmakers accused the government of allowing the CIA to operate secretly on Indian soil, while protesters warned that the agency had endangered the headwaters of India’s most sacred river.
Declassified diplomatic cables show that President Carter and then-Indian prime minister Morarji Desai worked quietly to contain the fallout.
Today, the mystery continues to linger. Indian politicians, environmental activists and villagers living near Nanda Devi have renewed calls for the device to be located and removed.
Some fear that a warming climate could eventually expose the generator, or that its radioactive mat­erial could be misused if it is discovered.

“This is unfair,” he said after being told to pay Rs1,000, with the threat of having his truck impounded if he did not “fix” the problem. “I was coming from Lahore after getting my vehicle repaired. They pressed the accelerator to make it release smoke. It’s an injustice,” he said.
Checkpoints set up this month are part of a crackdown by authorities to combat the city’s soaring smog levels, with winter months the worst due to atmospheric inversions that trap pollutants at ground level.
“We have already warned the owners of stern action, and we will stop their entry into the city if they don’t comply with the orders,” said Dr Zaigham Abbas of Pakistan’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as he surveyed the checkpoint at the southeast edge of the capital.

Checkpoints are part of plan to combat capital’s soaring pollution

For Waleed Ahmed, a technician inspecting the vehicles at the site, “just like a human being, a vehicle has a life cycle. Those that cross it release smoke that is dangerous to human health”.

Self-inflicted crisis
While not yet at the extreme winter levels of Lahore or the megacity Karachi, where heavy industry and brick kilns spew tons of pollutants each year, Islamabad is steadily closing the gap.
So far in December it has already registered seven “very unhealthy” days for PM2.5 particulates of more than 150 microgrammes per cubic meter, according to the Swiss-based monitoring firm IQAir.
Intraday PM2.5 levels in Islamabad often exceed those in Karachi and Lahore, and in 2024 the city’s average PM2.5 reading for the year was 52.3 microgrammes — surpassing the 46.2 for Lahore.
Those annual readings are far beyond the safe level of five microgrammes recommended by the World Health Organisation.
“The capital region is choked overwhelmingly by its transport sector,” which produces 53 per cent of its toxic PM2.5 particles, the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative, a research group, said in a recent report.
“The haze over Islamabad… is not the smoke of industry, but the exhaust of a million private journeys — a self-inflicted crisis,” it said.

Crackdown
Announcing the crackdown on Dec 7, EPA chief Nazia Zaib Ali said over 300 fines were issued at checkpoints in the first week, with 80 vehicles impounded.
“We cannot allow non-compliant vehicles at any cost to poison the city’s air and endanger public health,” she said in a statement.
The city has also begun setting up stations where drivers can have their emissions inspected, with those passing receiving a green sticker on their windshield.
“We were worried for Lahore, but now it is Islamabad. And that is all because of vehicles emitting pollution,” said Iftikhar Sarwar, 51, as he had his car checked on a busy road near an Islamabad park.
“This is not the Islamabad I came to 20 years ago,” said Sulaman Ijaz, an anthropologist.

Providence Mayor Brett Smiley announced the detention during an early morning news conference, confirming the campus shelter-in-place order had been lifted.
Speaking alongside Sm­iley, Police Colonel Oscar Perez said authorities were “not at this point” looking for anyone else in relation to the attack.
Of the nine wounded, Smiley said one is in critical condition, seven are in stable condition and one has been discharged.

‘Shelter-in-place’ lifted as authorities cease search for suspects

Brown University Pres­ident Christina Paxson confirmed in a letter to community members that all 11 victims were students. At the time, the university had sent an emergency alert regarding an active shooter near the Barus and Holley Engineering building.
“Nine members of our community who were transported to local hospitals are all students,” Paxson wrote on the school’s website. “And we lost two students to today’s devastating gun violence.”
The attack triggered a terrifying lockdown on Saturday afternoon. Witness Katie Sun told the Brown Daily Herald student newspaper she was studying nearby when she heard gunfire and fled to her dormitory.
“It was honestly quite terrifying. The shots seemed like they were coming from where the classrooms are,” Sun said.
Student Lydell Dyer, who was working in the gym, told CNN he hid in the dark with 154 others.
“We had to go gather everybody, bring them up to the top floor, turn off the lights, and put down the blinds,” Dyer said.
Officials have postponed final exams scheduled for Sunday. Smiley noted the incident has left the Ivy League community “incredibly shaken up”.
“This should not be normal,” Smiley said. “This should not be the case that every community needs to prepare for something like this to happen.”
President Donald Trump called the shooting a “terrible thing” after being briefed. “All we can do right now is pray for the victims,” he said.
The incident is the latest in a series of attacks across the country. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been more than 300 mass shootings in the United States this year.

“Resistance and its weapons are a legitimate right guaranteed by international law and are linked to the establishment of a Palestinian state,” Hayya said in a televised address on Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV.
“We are open to studying any proposals that preserve this right while guaranteeing the establishment of a Palestinian state.”
The US-sponsored ceasefire, in effect since October 10, halted the conflict. But it remains fragile as Israel and Hamas accuse each other almost daily of violations.
The agreement is composed of three phases. In the first phase of the deal, Palestinian committed to relea­sing the remaining 48 living and dead captives held in the territory.
So far they have released all of the prisoners except for one body.
Under the second phase Israeli troops would further withdraw from their positions in Gaza and be replaced by an international stabilisation force, while Hamas would lay down its weapons. Israel has repeatedly insisted Hamas “will be disarmed”. The third phase includes the reconstruction of the vast areas of Gaza levelled by Israel’s retaliatory military campaign.
Hayya also confirmed the head of the group’s weapons production was killed in an Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip the day before.
“The Palestinian people are currently going through difficult times and suffering greatly… with the martyrdom of more than 70,000 people, the latest of whom was the mujahid commander Raed Saad and his companions.”
Raed Saed’s funeral
Israel announced on Saturday that it had killed Saad, describing him as “one of the architects” of the Oct 2023 raid.
Thousands of Hamas supporters rallied in central Gaza City at a funeral for senior commander Raed Saed and three associates killed alongside him on Saturday.
The mourners chanted “Martyrs are dear to God” and carried the bodies in coffins draped in green Hamas flags, in one of the group’s biggest displays of its presence since a US-backed ceasefire deal came into effect in Gaza in October.

Both LeT and JeM were declared proscribed organisations by Pakistan in 2002.
The proposed sanctions — a global asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo — signal closer US-India counterterrorism cooperation. Yet, strikingly, the joint statement does not mention Pakistan.
That omission has not gone unnoticed, especially given India’s frequent charge that such groups operate from Pakistani soil — a claim Islamabad denies.

Joint call makes no mention of Islamabad, despite India’s wishes

Observers interpret the omission as deliberate and revealing of Washington’s strategic balancing act in South Asia.
As Washington-based analyst Shuja Nawaz noted: “The US may have avoided naming Pakistan. It has named India as a partner in the Indo-Pacific theatre. I wonder how long this straddling policy will last.”
The US and Indian delegations, led respectively by Monica Jacobsen of the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism and India’s Counterterrorism Joint Secretary Vinod Bahade, emphasised cooperation in training, cybersecurity, judicial coordination, mutual legal assistance and intelligence-sharing.
They condemned recent attacks notably the April 22 Pahalgam attack and the Nov 10 Red Fort incident in New Delhi — stressing that “those responsible for terrorism should be held accountable”.
They also welcomed the US designation of The Resistance Front (TRF), which India blames for being behind the Pahalgam attack, as both a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and Specially-Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).
But as observers noted, the silence on Pakistan reflects a US desire to continue counterterrorism cooperation with India, while keeping open diplomatic space with Pakistan, whose utility Washington appears to value anew.
The broader context helps explain this approach. According to a Dec 8 Foreign Policy article titled ‘Trump’s Pivot to Pakistan’, the warming of US-Pakistan relations since mid-2025 has been dramatic.
The piece noted that President Trump has “developed a close relationship with senior Pakistani leadership, including the country’s powerful military chief, Asim Munir, whom he hosted at the White House in June and again in September, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, whom he met three times this year.”
As the article reports, “The Pakistanis have done a very good job of developing a positive relationship with President Trump,” according to a former US diplomat who requested anonymity.
The logic seems tactical: Islamabad has offered “things of value” from cooperation on counterterrorism (including high-profile arrests of militants), to access to critical minerals, to interest in emerging sectors such as energy, mining, and even cryptocurrency — aligning with some of Trump’s strategic and personal predilections.
According to one former Pakistani ambassador to the US, the outreach has been carefully crafted: “They gave him the praise that he wanted,” the diplomat said.
In this context, the joint US-India terror-designation statement can be read as tactical: the US still wants to maintain the appearance of cooperation with India on counterterrorism, but avoids confrontation with Pakistan, preserving for Islamabad a renewed space in US foreign policy.
That’s why observers argue the omission of Pakistan in the joint statement is not a mere oversight, but a reflection of evolving US strategy in South Asia, where alliances are becoming more transactional, fluid and hedged.
The next session of the India-US JWGCT and Designations Dialogue scheduled in the United States will offer an early test of whether this balancing act can hold. In the meantime, the strategic triangle between Washington, New Delhi and Islamabad appears more complex and fragile than ever before.

LAHORE: The Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC), a broad coalition of clerics from various Sunni schools of thought, has urged the Taliban interim government to implement the resolution recently passed by more than 1,000 Afghan clerics against indulging in militancy abroad.
“It is now the responsibility of the Afghan interim government to ensure the implementation of the recent declaration issued by its scholars,” PUC Chairman Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi said here on Sunday, terming the resolution a “positive step in the right direction”.
He said there was no difference between the stance of Afghan clerics and that of those belonging to Pakistan.
“There are two basic points in the declaration. First, they [Afghan clerics] say that aggression against Afghan soil is unacceptable, and we say that terrorism in Pakistan is unacceptable. Second, they say that Afghan soil should not be used against any other country, and we hold the same opinion. There should be no attacks on Pakistan from Afghanistan and vice versa,” he added.
Stressing that peace and stability in the region are in the collective interest, he thanked Turkiye, Qatar and Saudi Arabia for their attempts to negotiate between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Mr Ashrafi warned that any attempt to raise voices against the armed forces would be strongly resisted.
He said that if the need arose, religious seminaries and mosques would stand ready to defend the country, its security and stability. He emphasised that safeguarding the homeland was a collective responsibility.
Calling for political maturity, Mr Ashrafi urged all political parties to sit together and engage in dialogue to strengthen the country’s defence, economy and internal stability.
He criticised the use of abusive language in politics, saying that those who resorted to hate speech did not want peace in the country. He said scholars from all schools of thought had unanimously declared that violent behaviour was unacceptable. “Our objective is to take the country towards the caliphate system through peaceful means,” he added.
He also strongly condemned attacks and criticism directed at the ISPR director general following his recent press conference.

ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Sunday urged the Afghan Taliban to rid their country of all militant groups, while Iran stressed the need for regional cooperation, rather than foreign intervention, at a multinational Afghanistan-foc­used mee­t­ing in Tehran.
The calls for action came during a meeting of Special Representatives for Afghanistan from neighbouring countries, plus Russia.
The Taliban were invi­ted to participate, but declined to attend, according to statements from both Iranian and Taliban officials.
The high-level gathering in the Iranian capital brought together special representatives from Paki­stan, China, Russia, Tajiki­stan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan to discuss shared security concerns and strategies for engaging with Afgha­nistan’s de facto authorities.
Pakistan’s Special Rep­re­sentative for Afgha­nistan Mohammad Sadiq made the country’s position clear, emphasising the persistent threat of terrorism originating from Afghan territory.
“The continued threat of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil is a big challenge for the region,” Mr Sadiq said, according to a statement.
He highlighted that a stable Afghanistan, free from terrorist elements, was essential for gaining the trust of its neighbours and unlocking its vast economic potential.
“It is, therefore, imperative that the current de-facto rulers take steps to ameliorate their suffering. And the foremost step in this regard would be to rid their soil indiscriminately of all types of terrorists,” he stated.
He later posted on X that “the people of Afghanistan have already suffered enough and they deserve better”.







Only an Afghanistan that does not harbour terrorists, he explained, will inspire confidence in neighbouring countries to meaningfully engage, which would in turn help realise the country’s immense potential for economic connectivity.
The regional forum was first initiated and hosted by Pakistan in September 2021, just weeks after the Taliban seized control of Kabul as US and Nato forces completed their withdrawal after a 20-year conflict. Iran hosted the second foreign ministers’ meeting of the group in late October 2021.
However, the forum has struggled to achieve its goals. According to Pakistan’s former ambassador to Afghanistan, Mansoor Khan, the original intent was for the group to make collective decisions, including the possibility of a coordinated recognition of the Taliban government.
“The grouping could not become an effective forum as the Taliban did not positively respond,” Mr Khan told Dawn on Sunday.
He added that Pakistan had hoped the neighbouring countries would adopt a unified approach on critical issues such as counter-terrorism, political inclusivity, girls’ education, and human and women’s rights in Afghanistan.
Separately, Ambassador Sadiq held a bilateral meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi. According to Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran, Muhammad Muddasir Tipu, Sadiq expressed hope that the meeting would play a useful role in promoting regional peace.
“Recalling closer interactions taking place between leaderships of both countries at the highest levels in the past two years, Mr Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to further deepen and widen its ties with Pakistan,” Mr Tipu wrote on X.







Regional solutions
Mr Araqchi, addressing the meeting, argued that Afghanistan’s stability hinges on its integration into regional political and economic structures, not on external involvement.
“Experience has shown that ‘imported prescriptions and trans-regional decisions’ have failed to bring stability to crisis-hit countries,” he said, according to Iran’s Press TV.
He highlighted the primary role of neighbouring states, describing them as the “most natural and reliable” actors capable of addressing Afghanistan’s complex challenges.
Mr Araghchi pointed to Afghanistan’s strategic geoeconomic position at the intersection of Central, West, and South Asia, highlighting its potential to serve as a vital corridor for trade, energy transit, and regional connectivity.
The Iranian foreign minister argued that the security and prosperity of Afghanistan are inseparable from the interests of the entire region. “Afghanistan’s stability and development are not only a humanitarian necessity but also a strategic imperative for the entire region,” he noted.
He called for collective responsibility and confidence-building measures among regional nations, warning against an over-reliance on security-centric approaches and the neglect of Afghanistan’s social and cultural realities.
Mr Araghchi attributed past failures to these factors, as well as the marginalisation of regional actors and the chaotic foreign military withdrawal in 2021 and said the integration of Afghanistan into regional political and economic processes would help establish long-term stability and reduce tensions.
Reaffirming Iran’s commitment, he said his country was ready to expand cooperation with Afghanistan’s neighbours in transportation, trade, energy, and consular services, arguing that regional convergence could create a sustainable framework for cooperation centred on Afghanistan.
“At the heart of all these efforts are the people of Afghanistan, who deserve a secure and dignified future,” he said.
Taliban decline invitation
Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baqaei, confirmed at a briefing that the Taliban had been formally invited, stating that Iran believed their participation would enhance mutual understanding and help resolve issues between Afghanistan and its neighbouring countries.
“Afghanistan, however, chose not to attend the meeting, a decision that Iran respects,” Baqaei said, according to the IRNA news agency. He noted that the meeting allowed participating countries to discuss regional developments, including recent border tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Baqaei stressed Iran’s concerns over regional stability, saying, “Iran shares a total border of nearly 2,000 kilometres with Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any tension that arises between the two countries will inevitably affect us as well.”
Kabul’s decision to stay away was criticised by Asif Durrani, Pakistan’s former ambassador to Iran.
“The Taliban regime’s decision not to participate in tomorrow’s Tehran meeting of senior officials from Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours and Russia is further proof of the Taliban’s lack of political maturity,” Durrani wrote on X.
“This decision reinforces the argument that the Taliban cannot negotiate an issue; a mere ‘Na-manu (don’t accept)’ is a head-in-the-sand attitude and will not resolve the serious problems.”

“A tweet, circulated by certain anti-Pakistan quarters, claiming that [the] whole crew of a particular PIA flight is missing, is entirely baseless,” the flag carrier said in a post on X, adding that the purpose was to “malign PIA and Pakistan”.
“There has been no such incident, and the news is fake,” it added.







Meanwhile, a PIA spokesperson issued a separate statement also denying the news, claiming that the information had been circulated by an “Afghan and anti-Pakistan account”.
“The misleading tweet is part of a well-conceived plan based on hostility towards Pakistan and is aimed at damaging the reputation of the national airline and the country,” the spokesperson said, clarifying that the news held no truth.
Missing PIA crew members, particularly in Canada, have been reported in the past, too.
On November 21, a PIA flight attendant reportedly went missing in Canada, prompting the airline to launch an inquiry into his disappearance.
​According to PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafeez Khan, the attendant did not report for flight PK-798 from Toronto to Lahore.
“When contacted, he cited ill health as an excuse,” the spokesperson said, adding that the matter is being investigated. “In case of illegal disappearance, departmental action will be initiated against the flight attendant.”
Last year in October, a cabin crew member was reportedly gone missing while on duty. The missing crew member, based in Islamabad, had disappeared during a layover in Toronto.
Similarly, a 47-year-old PIA steward was reportedly gone missing in Canada in March 2024.
In February 2024, another member of the airline’s cabin crew was reported missing while on duty. The member had arrived in Toronto on PIA flight PK-782 from Islamabad but failed to report for duty on the return flight, PK-784 to Karachi.</p><small>2025-12-15 02:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15072015a524d3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961211/ctd-official-found-shot-dead-in-panjgur' target='_blank'><strong>CTD official found shot dead in Panjgur</strong></a><br><p>GWADAR: An official of the Counter-Terrorism Dep­­artment (CTD) was found shot dead in an aba­ndoned area of the Panjgur district, while two individuals were gunned down in separate attacks in Turbat, police said on Sunday. 
Authorities identified the CTD official as Khalil Ahmed, who was kidnapped at gunpoint from the Tusp area of Panjgur. His body, which showed signs of torture and gunshot wounds, was later found dumped in an abandoned site in Tusp. 
Locals informed the authorities about the presence of a body, prompting police to rush to the Chakul locality on the outskirts of Panjgur town. Police took custody of the body and shifted it to the district hospital. 
Later, family members protested in front of the district police officer in Panjgur to press the police for immediate arrest of the kidnappers and killers. The protesters alleged police had been informed about the abduction of the official, but they did not rescue him. However, after negotiations with police officials and the district administration, the demonstrators ended their protest and dispersed peacefully. Police said an investigation into the incident is underway. 
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the killing of the official.
Meanwhile, two other people were killed in Turbat, police said. 
They said armed men riding motorcycles targeted Muhammad Naeem in the Kahirabad area, killing him on the spot before speeding away. 
In a similar shooting, armed men killed a man in the Absar area of Turbat before fleeing. The body was shifted to the Turbat hospital. “In both incidents attackers fired at their targets from close range, which caused their instant death,” police said.

The announcements were made during a PCB investor roadshow in New York, part of an overseas promotional campaign aimed at attracting commercial interest ahead of a potential expansion of the league from six to eight teams.
The PCB has previously indicated that expansion is under consideration, though the addition of new franchises has not yet been formally ratified.
Addressing attendees at the event, Mohsin said the PCB had taken administrative control of the Muzaffarabad Cricket Stadium and intended to begin renovation work.
He added that efforts were under way to have the venue ready in time for the PSL, though he acknowledged that completion before the tournament was not guaranteed.
“We are starting Muzaffarabad’s stadium, which we have taken over, and our target is to get it ready before the PSL. If not, then work will be initiated within this year,” he said.
Mohsin also stated that the deadline for submission of bids for the new franchises had been extended to December 22, citing interest from prospective investors.

On Sunday, the PSL trophy was displayed at Times Square, where members of Pakistan’s cricketing diaspora gathered for photographs and brief interactions with players and officials.
The PCB said the event was intended to raise the league’s profile among overseas audiences. Several Pakistan cricketers attended the engagement, including Shan Masood, as well as former players Wasim Akram and Ramiz Raja.
The PCB also said members of the current national setup were present, though no official matches or cricketing activities were scheduled as part of the programme. Singer Ali Zafar, who has previously been associated with PSL anthems, was also in attendance.



The New York event followed a similar promotional stop at Lord’s Cricket Ground in London earlier this year. The PCB has described these activities as part of a broader effort to enhance the league’s commercial value and visibility beyond traditional markets.
Launched in 2016, the PSL has grown into Pakistan’s flagship T20 competition, initially staged entirely overseas before returning to home venues in phases.
While the league has attracted international players and broadcasters, it has also faced scheduling challenges due to Pakistan’s crowded international calendar and competition from other T20 leagues.
The PCB has yet to release detailed information regarding venues, player drafts or confirmation of new teams for the 2026 season.</p><small>2025-12-14 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14224958a1af717.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961096/ukraines-zelensky-drops-nato-ambition-as-berlin-peace-talks-begin' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine’s Zelensky drops Nato ambition as Berlin peace talks begin</strong></a><br><p>Ukraine has relinquished its aim to join the Nato military alliance in exchange for Western security guarantees as a compromise to end the war with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday as peace talks got underway in Berlin.
Zelensky aired the concession as he flew to the German capital, where he began meetings with US President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in efforts to end Europe’s bloodiest conflict since World War Two.
The move marks a major shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia’s war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.
Zelensky met the US envoys at talks hosted by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who, a source said, had made brief remarks before leaving the two sides to negotiate. Other European leaders are also due in Germany for talks on Monday.
Security guarantees from the United States, Europe and other partners instead of Nato membership represented a compromise on Ukraine’s side, Zelensky said ahead of Sunday’s discussions.

“From the very beginning, Ukraine’s desire was to join Nato; these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” he said in answer to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat.
“Thus, today, bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the US, Article 5-like guarantees for us from the US and security guarantees from European colleagues, as well as other countries, Canada [and] Japan are an opportunity to prevent another Russian invasion,” Zelensky said.
“And it is already a compromise from our part,” he said, adding that the security guarantees should be legally binding.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its Nato ambitions and withdraw troops from about 10 per cent of Donbas, which Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country and that no Nato troops can be stationed there.
Russian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by major Western powers not to enlarge the US-led Nato alliance eastwards — shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.
Zelensky had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again.
Under pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow’s demands, Zelensky accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities and Ukraine’s power and water supplies.
Sending Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia’s 2022 invasion.
Zelensky said Ukraine, the Europeans and the US are looking at a 20-point plan and that at the end of it there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has no direct talks with Russia.
A ceasefire along the current front lines would be a fair option, he added.
‘Critical moment’
Britain, France and Germany have been working to refine the US proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its Nato ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces.
European allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine’s future, and sought to shore up Kyiv’s finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.
Putin hosted Witkoff and Kushner at a meeting earlier in December that the Kremlin praised as “constructive”, although no major breakthroughs were reached.
Zelensky said hundreds of thousands were still without power after Russian strikes on energy, heating and water supplies across Ukraine.
“Russia is dragging out the war and seeks to inflict as much harm as possible on our people,” he said.

Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine caused relations with the West to plummet and has cranked up warnings from Nato and European leaders that Putin would not stop there.
Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech in Berlin on Thursday that Nato should be “prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured” and asserted that “we are Russia’s next target”.
The Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed such claims.
“This seems like a statement by a representative of a generation that has managed to forget what World War Two was actually like,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television reporter Pavel Zarubin on Sunday.
“They have no understanding, and unfortunately, Mr Rutte, making such irresponsible statements, simply does not understand what he is talking about,” Peskov added.</p><small>2025-12-14 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14153319ce629ab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961076/suspect-involved-in-australia-bondi-beach-shooting-identified-police' target='_blank'><strong>Suspect involved in Australia Bondi Beach shooting identified: police</strong></a><br><p>One of the suspected shooters in a gun attack at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on Sunday has been identified by police, a senior law enforcement official told the public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
Ten people were killed and around a dozen were wounded when gunmen opened fire during a Jewish holiday event at the beach, Australian officials said. New South Wales police said two people had been taken into custody, and the ABC said one of at least two gunmen was among those killed.
According to the law enforcement official, the suspect was identified as Naveed Akram, who lives in the Sydney suburb of Bonnyrigg.
ABC gave no information on his nationality.
“The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr Akram’s home … was being raided by police on Sunday evening,” ABC reported.
Australian police said an “improvised explosive device” had been found in a car linked to a suspect in the deadly shooting.
“We have found an improvised explosive device in a car which is linked to the deceased offender,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a news conference.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the incident “shocking and distressing”, adding that “emergency responders are on the ground and working to save lives”.
“I saw at least 10 people on the ground and blood everywhere,” 30-year-old local Harry Wilson, who witnessed the shooting, told the Sydney Morning Herald.
According to The Sydney Morning Herald, 43-year-old fruit vendor Ahmed el Ahmed disarmed one of the attackers and wrestled his weapon away from him.
“Ahmed placed himself in the line of fire to take a rifle from the shooter, and was later hit by at least two bullets himself,” the newspaper reported, adding that Ahmed’s cousin told the media that he was shot in his hand and upper arm.
“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” the cousin, Mustafa was quoted as saying. “We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 per cent.”

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Jewish people who had gone to light the first candle of the Hanukkah holiday on the beach had been attacked by “vile terrorists”.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was appalled by the shooting.
“These are the results of the anti-Semitic rampage in the streets of Australia over the past two years, with the anti-Semitic and inciting calls of ‘Globalise the Intifada’ that were realised today,” he alleged.
One of the world’s most famous beaches, Bondi is typically crowded with locals and tourists, especially on warm weekend evenings.
“If we were targeted deliberately in this way, it’s something of a scale that none of us could have ever fathomed. It’s a horrific thing,” Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Sky News, adding his media adviser had been wounded in the attack.
Videos circulating on X appeared to show people on the beach and nearby park scattering as multiple gunshots and police sirens could be heard.
One video showed a man dressed in a black shirt firing a large weapon before being tackled by a man in a white T-shirt who wrestled his weapon off him. A different man was seen firing a weapon from a pedestrian bridge.
Another video showed two men pressed onto the ground by uniformed police on a small pedestrian bridge. Officers could be seen trying to resuscitate one of the men. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.
The attack came almost exactly 11 years after a lone gunman took 18 people hostage at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney. Two hostages and the gunman were killed after a 16-hour standoff.
Sussan Ley, the leader of Australia’s opposition Liberal party, said the loss of life in the incident was “significant”.
“Australians are in deep mourning tonight, with hateful violence striking at the heart of an iconic Australian community, a place we all know so well and love, Bondi,” she said.
President, PM express solidarity with Australia
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and extended their condolences to the victims in separate statements.
In a statement from the Presidency, President Zardari expressed sorrow over the incident, praying for the victims’ families and wishing the injured a speedy recovery.
“Pakistan, itself a victim of terrorism, stands in solidarity with Australia and condemns violence against innocent civilians,” the statement read.







Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz extended his condolences and said Pakistan condemns terrorism in all of its forms.
“We stand in solidarity with the people and government of Australia in this difficult time,” he wrote.

According to a statement issued by the FIA on Saturday, the suspect was taken into custody during a major operation at the airport.
Initial investigations revealed that the suspect was involved in organised migrant smuggling and online fraud activities operating out of Cambodia.
The FIA said the suspect had travelled from Pakistan to Cambodia in September 2024, where he worked for an online fraud company. “He later began recruiting individuals from Pakistan as agents, allegedly facilitating their movement to Cambodia under false pretences,” the statement said.
During forensic analysis of the suspect’s mobile phone, investigators recovered passport photographs of several individuals, payment receipts and records of financial transactions.
The agency said the suspect received money through personal bank accounts as well as cryptocurrency accounts, indicating the use of multiple channels to move illicit funds.
The FIA said the suspect has been handed over to its anti-smuggling circle in Karachi for further legal proceedings.
“Further investigation is underway to identify other members of the network and potential victims,” the statement said.
In January, more than 30 officers of the FIA were booked and dismissed from service over their alleged collusion with human smugglers in sending Pakistanis abroad illegally.
The FIA began the purge following the capsizing of a boat carrying illegal immigrants near Greece in December last year. According to estimates, more than 80 Pakistanis drowned in the accident, and 36 were rescued. The remaining were presumed dead.
In response to the tragedy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered the authorities to take action against the human smugglers and officials aiding them. Since then, a countrywide crackdown has been launched against human smugglers, leading to the arrests of dozens of suspects.
Consequently, FIA Lahore arrested 177 human smugglers in the following months.

“On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell.”
It added that the second IBO was conducted in the province’s Bannu district, where security forces neutralised six more terrorists.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as a relentless counterterrorism campaign under [the] vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement said.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.
Last month, security forces eliminated 22 terrorists during an operation in the Bannu district.</p><small>2025-12-14 16:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14201053279083b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961094/pti-demands-cessation-of-imrans-solitary-confinement-following-un-experts-report' target='_blank'><strong>PTI demands cessation of Imran’s ‘solitary confinement’ following UN expert’s report</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Saturday expressed grave concern over a report issued by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Jill Edwards, saying it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”
The report, released on Friday, claimed the PTI founder is being held in conditions that could “amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on authorities to comply with international norms and standards.”
In a statement issued by PTI’s Central Media Department, the party said the UN report unequivocally confirmed what it has consistently maintained for a long time: that Imran Khan was being subjected to “inhuman, unlawful, and degrading treatment motivated entirely by political vendetta.”







The PTI asserted that the report reaffirmed Imran’s 23 hours of solitary confinement, constant CCTV surveillance, isolation from the outside world, obstruction of meetings with legal counsel and family, denial of religious practice, and deprivation of basic human necessities, which constituted a blatant violation of prison rules and a flagrant breach of international human rights law.
“According to the United Nations, solitary confinement exceeding 15 days falls under the category of psychological torture, while Imran Khan has been subjected to this agonising process for months,” the PTI added in its statement.
The party said that subjecting a 72-year-old suffering from serious medical conditions, a spinal injury and wounds from a prior assassination attempt to such conditions, while denying adequate medical care, amounted to deliberate and calculated cruelty.
PTI demanded the immediate cessation of solitary confinement, the provision of detention conditions consistent with human dignity and international standards, unrestricted access to personal physicians and the removal of all barriers to meetings in strict compliance with judicial orders.
“This matter is no longer just about a political prisoner but has become a test of the credibility of law, justice, and human rights in Pakistan. If the treatment being meted out to Imran Khan is not stopped, it will be considered the worst example of state-sponsored violence,” the statement concluded.
However, Prime Minister’s aide Rana Ihsan Afzal dismissed the rapporteur’s findings and insisted that Imran is being treated “according to prison rules and the jail manual”.
“His children have access, and he should schedule [a call] and put in the appropriate request. There is no issue or obstacle from the government of Pakistan,” said the premier’s aide.
He added that the PTI founder is being provided facilities “greater than his rights” as a B-class prisoner.
“He has the facilities of exercise available, good food is available, and ample space is also available.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.</p><small>2025-12-14 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14194513ad5d96d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961092/aseefa-bhutto-appeals-for-public-support-ahead-of-polio-vaccination-campaigns-commencement-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Aseefa Bhutto appeals for public support ahead of polio vaccination campaign’s commencement tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>As the nationwide polio campaign begins from Monday (tomorrow) to vaccinate over 45 million children, first lady Aseefa Bhutto Zardari has urged parents, caregivers, public representatives and community leaders to actively support the drive.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases, with the highest number of cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 19.This will be the last polio campaign of the year, which will conclude on December 21.
“The success of the campaign depends on our collective responsibility, so we must ensure that every child under five years of age receives polio drops,” she said in a statement.
The campaign aims to vaccinate 45.4 million children nationwide, including 23.3 million in Punjab, 10.6 million in Sindh, 7.3 million in KP and 2.66 million in Balochistan, with the remaining children covered in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad Capital Territory.
The drive is being conducted in coordination with Afghanistan’s December polio campaign to curb cross-border virus transmission.
Recalling the legacy of late Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Aseefa said “Pakistan’s first nationwide polio eradication campaign was launched under her leadership in 1994, and her vision continued to guide national efforts to eliminate the disease.”
She shared that she feels a deep personal connection to the cause, remembering that her mother, as the former prime minister, personally administered the first polio drops to her.
“That moment marked the beginning of Pakistan’s national fight against polio and shaped my lifelong commitment to the effort,” she said.
Aseefa Bhutto shared that the campaign will follow a three-day house-to-house vaccination drive with one catch-up day. In high-risk areas, community-based vaccination and special mobile team strategies will be implemented, and the  five-day campaign will be conducted with two additional catch-up days.
A total of 408,484 frontline polio workers, including area in-charges, union council medical officers and mobile, fixed and transit teams, have been deployed across the country.
Aseefa also called upon elected representatives, local government officials, religious leaders and community elders “to stand with polio teams, facilitate access to communities and help counter misinformation and hesitancy.”She urged citizens to welcome vaccinators, report missed children and support frontline workers, saying that only united action can stop the virus and protect the future of Pakistan’s children.

Over the past several days, multiple media bodies came together and condemned the 13-month ban, which initially affected the newspaper but extended to DawnNewsTV and the radio channel City FM 89.
In its press release today, the PFUJ condemned the ad ban and called it “an attempt to control media and stifle free expression”.
“In a joint statement, PFUJ President Afzal Butt and Secretary General Arshad Ansari expressed deep concern over the government’s decision, stating that it is an attack on freedom of expression and an attempt to financially cripple a respected media outlet,” the union said.
“Dawn was founded by the father of the nation, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and the paper is respected globally for its unbiased reporting,” it added, quoting its president and secretary general.
The PFUJ urged the government to withdraw the ad ban for the promotion of “free and responsible journalism” and emphasised the importance of traditional media’s role amid the ubiquity of fake news.
“[The] PFUJ views this as an attempt to force the media group to change its editorial policy, which is unacceptable,” the press release read, adding that the union would stand in solidarity with the Dawn Media Group and called on the government to “respect the principles of press freedom and freedom of expression”.
Earlier this year, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) noted in its ‘Islamabad Declaration’ that Dawn has been denied advertisements by the federal and Punjab governments since October 2024 “because of its professional and critical approach in reporting and editorials”.
The Sindh government, too, has periodically withheld its ads for arbitrary reasons.
This was not the only way in which authorities have tried to obstruct Dawn’s reporting – after the so-called ‘Dawn Leaks’ saga, the paper’s circulation was blocked in large parts of the country, especially the cantonment areas, on the orders of certain individuals.</p><small>2025-12-14 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/141736536a25742.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961079/we-will-together-seize-haqiqi-azadi-cm-afridi-asks-pti-supporters-to-be-ready-in-case-call-for-protest-is-made' target='_blank'><strong>‘We will together seize Haqiqi Azadi’: CM Afridi asks PTI supporters to be ready in case call for protest is made</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Muhammad Sohail Afridi asked PTI supporters on Sunday to “be ready” in case a call was made for a protest, adding that “we will together seize [our] Haqiqi Azadi (true freedom)” from the country’s current rulers.
Afridi’s intimation came during a PTI rally in Kohat, where he reminded the crowd that incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, had delivered the message from jail of “freedom or death”.







“So if we go this time around, we will either return in shrouds or after getting freedom,” he said, adding that Imran had given the responsibility of making decisions — be it about talks with the government or protests — to Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas.*
The two leaders are part of the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) along with the PTI, which has also nominated them as the opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate.
“For my part,” Afridi said, “I met them and assured them of any kind of support.”
He added, “So whenever a call comes from them, you have to be ready. And we will together seize Haqiqi Azadi from them (country’s current rulers).”
The CM claimed that “all institutions and the government want to eliminate the PTI”.
Even the judiciary did not heed PTI’s grievances, he said.
Without naming anyone, the CM further stated: “Those supposed to protect us turn into out killers, and those raised to protect our mandate, stole it. Tell me then, what solution do we have?”
He said Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz had been issuing advice to him lately but she should focus on her province instead.
“I will listen to them now?” he remarked, adding that “our leader is Imran, and we will listen to only him. There will be only Imran’s policy and rule here”.
He said Maryam should focus on her province, where, according to a recent survey, police had turned out to be the most corrupt department in the country.
CM Afridi also urged the people to report corruption cases to authorities and his government in KP would take action on the complaints. He also asked the divisional and district administrations to keep their doors open and listen to public issues.
Provincial Minister for Law, Parliamentary Affairs, and Human Rights Aftab Alam Afridi lamented that Imran’s family and CM Afridi were not allowed to meet the incarcerated party chief.
He also condemned Imran being called a “security threat” to the country, saying, “Yes, Khan was a threat, but only to those who had owned business empires in this country.”
Referring to today’s rally, he said these were just “warm-up matches”.
“And this time, when we leave, we will not come back empty handed,” he said, seemingly implying the possibility of a protest.
Speaking to the participants of the rally, PTI’s provincial president and MNA Junaid Akbar said the workers of the party “could never be threatened with police cases or press conferences.”
He also said that the party and its workers were ready to protect CM Afridi’s government.
“If someone tries to impose governor’s rule in KP, you must reach and lay siege to the governor’s house. We protected our vote, and we will protect our government, too,” he said.
He also said that the PTI was did not expect that “bullets, purchased from funds meant for development”, would be fired on its protesters on November 26, 2024.
“But I assure you, this time, we will come to face bullets.”
Akbar also mentioned that Achakzai would make decision regarding any dialogue or call for a protest.
Special Assistant to the Chief Minister Shafi Jan warned that if CM Afridi was removed, powers that be would not be able to control the masses.
Meanwhile, MNA Shehryar Afridi said that the PTI will take Imran’s case to every corner of the country.
“No power on earth could challenge Pakistan if the country were united,” he said, adding, “Imran Khan is a matter of pride for us.”</p><small>2025-12-14 14:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/141627020171ded.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961077/8-suspects-part-of-extortion-network-arrested-during-raid-at-sunni-tehreek-chiefs-residence-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>8 suspects part of extortion network arrested during raid at Sunni Tehreek chief’s residence in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>Karachi police said on Sunday that eight suspects, “involved in running an extortion network” were arrested during a raid at the residence of Pakistan Sunni Tehreek (PST) chairman Muhammad Sarwat Ejaz Qadri in Karachi.
Special Investigation Unit (SIU) Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Imran Khan confirmed Saturday night’s development during a press briefing in Karachi today.
At the same time, he also clarified that Qadri was neither wanted by police nor had he been arrested. Moreover, the official said police had no evidence of the suspects’ association with any party.
The SSP also clarified that police had found no evidence of the involvement of the PST chief or any other member in the extortion network.
SSP Khan said multiple cases had been registered against the arrested suspects, who were associated with an extortion network run by two men, who he identified as Wasiullah Lakho and Abdul Samad Kathiawari.
These two “most-wanted” suspects were reportedly “in hiding abroad”, the official said, adding that three other suspects had been playing a key role in running the extortion network in Karachi. The official identified those three suspects as Mullah Shahzaib, Jawwad alias Waja Qadri and Rehanuddin.
The SSP said the Karachi additional inspector general had constituted a special task force for action against extortion last week. The team comprised west zone deputy inspector general (DIG), Crime Investigation Agency DIG, central SSP and SIU SSP, he added.
Two days ago, he continued, the SIU arrested suspect Rehanuddin in an injured condition. “He is named in a case of extortion and firing at a car showroom, which was registered at the Jamshed Quarters police station a month ago.”
“During initial interrogation, the suspect revealed the names of other members and heads of the [extortion] group,” the official said, adding that based on the information shared by him, the SIU and central police conducted a joint raid in the jurisdiction of Rizvia police station on Saturday night.
Seventeen people were detained during the raid, he said, adding that nine weapons, including G-3 rifles, submachine guns and pistols, were also confiscated.
Initial investigation showed that eight of the detained suspects had criminal records, including Mullah Shahzaib and Jawwad. Apart from them, three suspects accused of firing while carrying out extortion activities and three “facilitators” were arrested, he added.
Ten cases had been registered with the SIU against nine suspects involved in extortion, including Rehanuddin, the SSP said.
He said further investigation of the matter was under way.
Replying to a question, he said if it was established that anyone had provided shelter to the suspects or kept them in hiding, action would be taken against that individual as well.
He also confirmed that among the suspects, Rehanuddin had contested elections in 2024 as an independent candidate for an MNA seat.</p><small>2025-12-14 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14124138a43723d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961075/imf-targets-dubbed-new-benchmarks-do-not-represent-imposition-of-abrupt-conditions-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>IMF targets dubbed ‘new’ benchmarks do not represent ‘imposition of abrupt conditions’: finance ministry</strong></a><br><p>The finance ministry said on Sunday that the 11 targets, being categorised as “new conditions” under the ongoing programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), represented “continuity, sequencing, and deepening of Pakistan’s agreed reform agenda” rather than the “imposition of abrupt or unprecedented conditions”.
The ministry’s clarification follows reports of the government agreeing to 11 new targets, including additional tax measures and expenditure cuts from early next month, to make up for rising revenue shortfalls and to keep the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on track.
This was revealed in documents released by the IMF earlier this week, according to which commitment to the new or revised structural benchmarks, together with completion of two “prior actions”, enabled the conclusion of a staff-level agreement on the second review of the EFF and its approval by the IMF Executive Board for the disbursement of about $1.2bn for Pakistan on December 9.
A press release issued by the finance ministry today said that it had “clarified the intent, context, and continuity of reform measures under Pakistan’s IMF Extended Fund Facility programme, particularly in response to recent commentary regarding so-called “new conditions”.

 

“The purpose is to reaffirm that the measures referenced are part of a phased, medium-term reform agenda agreed with the IMF, many of which are extensions or logical progressions of reforms already initiated by the Government of Pakistan,” the press release read.
It said that the EFF was designed to support countries in implementing medium-term structural reforms aimed at achieving agreed policy objectives.
“These reforms are implemented in a sequenced and step-by-step manner over the duration of the programme,” it said. “Each review builds upon prior actions to ensure that the ultimate policy goals agreed at the outset of the program are achieved.
“Accordingly, actions under the EFF are structured as logical steps, with additional measures incorporated at each successive review.”
The press release said the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) with the IMF finalised after the second EFF review supplemented the MEFP agreed during the first review and reflected this phased approach.
During IMF discussions and negotiations, the government presented its planned policy reform initiatives, it said. “Where the IMF assesses that these initiatives contribute to the agreed programme objectives, they are incorporated into the MEFP.
“As a result, many of the structural benchmarks and actions included in the latest MEFP are derived from reforms already undertaken or initiated by the government of Pakistan, rather than being externally imposed or newly introduced conditions.”







The ministry issued clarifications for each of the 11 measures characterised as “new conditions”.
Regarding the public disclosure of asset declarations of civil servants, it said that this reform had been part of the EFF programme since the initial MEFP in May 2024.
“The current structural benchmark represents the second step, following the successful legislative amendment to the Civil Servants Act, 1973,” it said.
Commitments to strengthening the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) operational effectiveness and independence were also agreed during earlier reviews, it said, including coordination with provincial anti-corruption establishments.
“The development of action plans for high-risk agencies is a continuation of this commitment and runs parallel to, rather than stemming from, the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment Report,” the ministry added.
On empowering provincial anti-corruption establishments, it said that allowing these bodies access to financial intelligence aligned with the ongoing Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) reform agenda, which had been “integral to the EFF since its inception”.
The ministry further said that strengthening remittance inflows was “critical to Pakistan’s external stability”.
“Following measures to curb informal channels, remittances increased by 26 per cent year-on-year from FY24 to FY25, with a further increase of 9.3 percent projected for FY26.
“The government, in coordination with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), has been working to remove structural bottlenecks in cross-border payments. The IMF has built upon these efforts by incorporating them into the MEFP,” it added.
The ministry also said that the IMF staff report that had been published in May 2025 had recommended a comprehensive study to identify bottlenecks in the local currency bond market to broaden the investor base. This recommendation has now been formalised as a structural benchmark, according to the press release.
On the deregulation of the sugar industry, it said that the initiative originated from the government.
“A task force, notified by the prime minister’s office and chaired by the minister for power, has been mandated to recommend full liberalisation of the sugar market and propose a national policy in consultation with provinces. Given its alignment with the EFF objective of reducing government intervention in commodity markets, the IMF has included this initiative as a structural benchmark,” it said.
The ministry added that the development of a comprehensive roadmap for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was part of a broader domestic resource mobilisation reform agenda led directly by the prime minister.
“Key actions already taken include approval of the transformation plan, establishment of the Tax Policy Office, and strengthening of compliance risk management. This structural benchmark builds upon commitments made with the IMF in May 2024 and March 2025,” it said.
Further, the ministry called the requirement to develop and publish a medium-term tax reform strategy “a logical extension of earlier reforms, particularly the establishment and operationalisation of the Tax Policy Office to separate tax policy formulation from FBR’s operational functions”.
It said that the privatisation of distribution companies (Discos) had also been a core component of the EFF programme since its inception, adding that it was “envisaged to occur in phases”.
“Finalising preconditions for private-sector participation in Hesco (Hyderabad Electric Supply Company) and Sepco (Sukkur Electric Power Company) represents the next step following initiation of the process for the first batch of Discos. Additionally, the signing of Public Service Obligation (PSO) agreements with the seven largest entities reiterates an earlier programme commitment,” it added.
Regarding regulatory reforms and corporate compliance, it said, “Amendments to the Companies Act, 2017 to strengthen compliance for unlisted firms are part of the broader regulatory reform agenda aimed at improving the business climate, an objective embedded in the EFF from the outset.”
It added that, similarly, the structural benchmark related to a concept note for amendments to the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Act follows the successful completion of a prior benchmark involving an SEZ assessment study.
Finally, it said that contingency measures to address potential revenue shortfalls had also been part of the MEFP framework since May 2024, adding that the initial MEFP itself included a structural benchmark for introducing a 5 per cent Federal Excise Duty on fertiliser and pesticides.
“In conclusion, the measures outlined in the latest MEFP represent continuity, sequencing, and deepening of Pakistan’s agreed reform agenda under the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility, rather than the imposition of abrupt or unprecedented conditions,” the ministry said.</p><small>2025-12-14 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14120517aff365f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961074/nocs-to-binance-htx-not-blanket-approvals-but-first-step-under-supervised-entry-framework-bilal-bin-saqib' target='_blank'><strong>NOCs to Binance, HTX not ‘blanket approvals’ but first step under supervised entry framework: Bilal bin Saqib</strong></a><br><p>Chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) Bilal Bin Saqib has said that the no-objection certificates (NOCs) issued to global cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and HTX were not a “blanket approval” but the “first step under a risk-mitigated, phased, supervised entry framework”.

         View this post on Instagram            

Saqib’s video statement, televised on Sunday, comes after Pakistan gave initial clearance for Binance and HTX on Friday to register with regulators to set up local subsidiaries and begin preparations for full exchange licence applications.
The clearances allow the exchanges to register on the Anti-Money Laundering system, set up local units and prepare full applications.
Speaking about the development, Saqib said the issuance of the NOCs to Binance and HTX was the “first practical step” that reflected a “new mindset”.
He further said that the step was based on the “Pakistan-first” approach.
Saqib detailed that by working under a supervised entry framework, authorities had been able to establish “control” in three areas, namely money laundering and terrorism financing; transparency of ownership and fitness and propreitary checks; and paving the way for licensing through the enforcement of timelines.
“It is mandatory for every platform to register on the AML [system] and have direct linkages with the financial monitoring unit,” he said, further asserting that no platform would be allowed entry in the country without “disclosures and verification”.
Moreover, he said, the process of licensing would be initiated for entities after they would “move forward in line with Pakistan’s law and with its oversight”.
Saqib said this model was not unique to Pakistan and the world’s leading financial centres had been approaching new industries in a phased manner.
Reiterating that a “Pakistan-first approach” was being employed in the crypto sector, he said, “We will first control this industry and then scale it.”
He said Pakistan ranked among the world’s top three “crypto-adoption countries”, adding that it was estimated that there were 30 to 40 million crypto users in the country.
“They have adopted this industry without any regulatory framework, classroom and education,” he said. “The good thing here is that this shows that our youth is world class. But are our systems world class? Are our regulations world class?”
Saqib further questioned whether it would be wise for the state to stay out of a sector in which people were involved on an extensive scale.
“You cannot ignore innovation,” he said, stressing that not introducing the “right policies will weaken the country and make people unsafe”.
Keeping this in view, he continued, “our country’s leadership has tried to narrow this gap”.
Stressing the need for regulation, he said countries that would take an early initiative in this regard would be able to attract capital.
“Few countries have the opportunity that Pakistan has,” he said, adding, “We are not trying to promote crypto but to regulate it as people here have already adopted it.
“Our country is the fifth-most populous country with tech-savvy youth and where digital adoption is growing fast. But, the [country will be able to] benefit from this talent when they have a legal, structured path [to follow]. When they will have a framework. Otherwise, they will leave.”
He said it was the responsibility of the state to create an enabling environment for emerging technologies. “There needs to be smart regulation here so that capital from [around the world] flows into the country.”
He said that through the framework devised for the crypto sector, the government aimed to prepare for the “industries of 2035 and 2025”.
“We do not want the Pakistani youth to be just consumers but evolve into builders and global experts.”
Saqib emphasised that the country needed to prepare for the future and be globally trusted. “So that we are able to strengthen our sovereignty and economy through technology.”
He said his message to the international community was that Pakistan was open to business and welcoming innovation in the area of digital assets, but only from those entities who would follow the country’s rules, create opportunities for the youth here and operate in line with a “Pakistan-first approach”.
Coming back to the NOCs for Binance and HTX, he said while addressing the youth, “This is not our destination. This is the foundation of a building that you have to construct.”
“Pakistan’s future should not be imports. It should be built here, by your hands. Pakistan should emerge as a global case study in the area of global assets.”</p><small>2025-12-14 08:47</small></div><hr>
