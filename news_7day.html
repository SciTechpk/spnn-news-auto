“The FIA has received reports that some unknown individuals are harassing the public by sending fake emails and WhatsApp messages in the name of the DG FIA,” a statement issued by the agency’s spokesperson, Abdul Ghaffar, read.
 






“In these fake messages, the public is being terrorised by using the name and position of DG FIA,” the statement said, adding that fraudsters put a fake stamp of “Top Secret” on these messages to make them appear authentic.
In addition, these elements are trying to present themselves as government officials by using fake and misleading names. In these messages, attempts are being made to blackmail citizens by accusing them of “cyber crimes”.
“The FIA does not send such messages to any individual through WhatsApp or email,” the agency clarified.
“The public is requested to file a complaint about any suspicious message or contact with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency, which is the authorised agency for investigating cyber crimes.”
The statement called on citizens to be wary of fake messages and never share their personal and financial information, adding that for more information, the FIA Helpline can be contacted at 1991.
Earlier this week, the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF) issued an alert this week, warning against an ongoing scam aiming to compromise WhatsApp accounts via fake calls requesting a code.
Last month, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency conducted a successful raid on an illegal call centre in Islamabad and arrested five foreign nationals, according to a press release.
Meanwhile, in May, the national Cyber Emergency Response Team issued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan had been stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures.</p><small>2025-08-08 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08222539597a258.jpg?r=222602' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929559/mqm-founder-altaf-hussain-hospitalised-again-in-london' target='_blank'><strong>MQM founder Altaf Hussain hospitalised again in London</strong></a><br><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain was hospitalised again in London on Friday after falling ill.
In a post on the party’s X account, it said: “The health of MQM founder and leader Altaf Hussain has deteriorated again, after which he has been taken to a local hospital. According to details released by the MQM Central Information Department, on Friday, Altaf Hussain’s health worsened again.
“Immediate medical attention was sought, and an ambulance was called. The doctor promptly dispatched a medical emergency team. The emergency team initially examined Altaf Hussain at his residence, after which he was shifted to a local hospital for further examination and treatment.”
The MQM Coordination Committee appealed to all workers and the public to pray for his recovery.
 






MQM London-based senior party leader Mustafa Azizabadi also confirmed the development on a post on X.
 






Hussain was hospitalised in London last month due to “severe illness”, where he underwent multiple tests.
Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.
Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third-largest party in the country.
The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.
Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.
He was in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Britain, apparently after contracting Covid-19 in February 2021.
Hussain was born on September 17, 1953, in Karachi. He obtained his early education at a public school in Karachi’s Azizabad neighbourhood, a middle-class locality in Karachi where he spent his early years and his youth. He later enrolled at the University of Karachi to study Pharmacy and graduated from the programme in 1979.
His political career began during his student years in KU when he and Azeem Ahmed Tariq founded the All-Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO).
Formed in 1978, APMSO gained a massive following within a short period of time.
In the early 1990s, the MQM chief went into exile as the government at the time conducted an operation in Karachi.
Viewed as the man who controlled Karachi from London, Hussain came under fire in May 2013 for his televised speech across Pakistan, where he allegedly demanded the separation of Karachi from the rest of Pakistan if the public mandate of his party was not acceptable to the ‘establishment’. The party later clarified, saying it was taken out of context.
However, the final undoing of the MQM, as it was known, came after Hussain delivered an incendiary speech in August 2016 in which he not only raised slogans against Pakis­tan but also called the country “a cancer for the entire world”. Hours after the speech, MQM workers had attacked the ARY News office in Kara­chi.
Authorities launched a crackdown following the speech and the MQM’s Karachi headquarters and Hussain’s residence in Azizabad were sealed. Later, Hussain’s own party leaders in Pakistan distanced themselves from him and omitted his name from the party constitution.
In October 2019, Hussain was charged with “encouraging terrorism” by British police over his speech. He was also arrested in the case earlier in 2019 but was released on bail.
After deliberations that spanned three days, a 12-member jury had returned a majority verdict in Rex (crown) versus Altaf Hussain in February 2022, acquitting the MQM founder on two counts of ‘encouraging terrorism’.
The jury found Hussain not guilty on both counts of encouraging terrorism, contrary to section 1(2) of the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006.</p><small>2025-08-08 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0821204072f272d.jpg?r=212101' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929556/pm-shehbaz-blasts-israeli-cabinets-gaza-takeover-plan-as-dangerous-escalation' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz blasts Israeli cabinet’s Gaza takeover plan as ‘dangerous escalation’</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday blasted the Israeli cabinet’s approval of a plan to occupy Gaza City as a “dangerous escalation”.
Earlier in the day, Israel’s political-security cabinet approved a plan to take control of Gaza City, nearly two years into its invasion of the Palestinian territory. The approval came hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel intended to take military control of the entire strip, American news agency Reuters reported.
“We strongly condemn the Israeli cabinet’s approval of a plan to take illegal and illegitimate control of Gaza City. This tantamounts to a dangerous escalation in an already catastrophic war against the people of Palestine,” the prime minister said in a post on X.
 






He added that the expansion of military operations will only worsen the already existing humanitarian crisis and derail any prospect for peace in the region.
“We must not lose sight of the root cause of this ongoing tragedy: that is, Israel’s prolonged, illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. As long as this occupation endures, peace will remain elusive,” the premier added.
“Pakistan reiterates its unwavering support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in line with relevant UN and OIC resolutions.”
PM Shehbaz called upon the international community to intervene urgently to bring an immediate halt to Israel’s unwarranted aggression, ensure the protection of innocent civilians, and ensure the direly needed delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.
Earlier, Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan in his weekly briefing announced that Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar officiated the send-off of the 18th humanitarian aid consignment to Gaza at a ceremony held at Islamabad International Airport today.
“Under the directives of the Prime Minister, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in close coordination with relevant partners, facilitated the dispatch of this consignment, which is the 18th shipment from Pakistan,” the FO spokesperson said.
 






The aid consignment comprised of essential supplies including dry ration packs, Meals Ready-to-Eat and medicines. The ceremony was attended by senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the NDMA, and the Ambassador of Palestine to Pakistan, he added.
This consignment brings Pakistan’s total humanitarian assistance to Gaza to 18 shipments, comprising 1,815 tons of vital relief supplies, he added, saying “This sustained support reflects Pakistan’s resolute solidarity with the people of Gaza.”
Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed 61,258 and injured 152,045 Palestinians, per the Palestinian health ministry. Bombardments have also destroyed 88 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Media Office, with Tel-Aviv facing accusations of genocide.
On Thursday, the World Health Organisation said that 99 people were now known to have died from malnutrition in the Gaza Strip so far this year, with the figure likely an underestimate.
International outrage over the humanitarian situation in Gaza has ratcheted up pressure on Israel, with UN agencies warning of famine in the devastated Palestinian territory.
Earlier in the week, Israel’s military chief had pushed back against Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans to seize areas of Gaza it doesn’t already control, three Israeli officials said, as the prime minister faced increasing pressure over the invasion both at home and abroad.
FO condemns Israeli plan for complete military takeover of Gaza
The Foreign Office, in a separate statement, condemned the Israeli plan for complete military takeover of Gaza.
“Pakistan condemns in the strongest possible terms the reported Israeli plan for a complete military takeover of Gaza,” the statement said.
This not only represents yet another flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, but also the occupying power’s intention to further expand its ongoing genocidal military campaign, the statement added.
This highly escalatory action will further aggravate the prevailing grave humanitarian situation and suffering of the civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in addition to undermining international efforts aimed at achieving peace and stability in the region, the FO said.
“Pakistan reiterates its call on the international community to ensure an immediate end to Israeli impunity and its genocidal military campaign”, the FO said, calling for concrete measures for the provision of unimpeded humanitarian supplies to millions of Palestinians in dire need, and to hold Israel accountable for its heinous crimes.</p><small>2025-08-08 16:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0821261344a302f.jpg?r=212627' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929554/tense-phonecall-on-pak-india-ceasefire-reason-for-deterioration-in-trump-modi-relations-report' target='_blank'><strong>Tense phonecall on Pak-India ceasefire reason for deterioration in Trump-Modi relations: report</strong></a><br><p>A tense phone call on the ceasefire between Pakistan and India became the basis for the current breakdown in relations between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United States President Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Friday.
Trump on Wednesday imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi’s continued imports of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations after trade talks reached a deadlock. The new import tax, set to come into place in three weeks, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc — among the highest levied on any US trading partner.
While the rupture in US-India ties was abrupt, there have been strains in the relationship. Delhi has repeatedly rebutted Trump’s repeated statements that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after four days of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Trump also hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.
The two leaders spoke over the phone at the insistence of Trump on the sidelines of June’s G7 summit in Canada, which Modi attended as a guest. The call lasted 35 minutes.
“PM Modi told President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had said of the talk. “Talks for ceasing military action happened directly between India and Pakistan through existing military channels, and on the insistence of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi emphasised that India has not accepted mediation in the past and will never do,” he said.
Bloomberg reported today that “tensions came to a head” between the two leaders in the call with Trump’s repeated claiming of credit and India’s downplaying of the matter.
“Modi felt like he needed to set the record straight in the call after his aides discovered that Trump planned to host a lunch the following day at the White House for Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir,” the report cited officials in New Delhi familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak about confidential discussions.
“While India had no problem if Trump met Pakistan’s civilian leaders, hosting Munir was seen as giving legitimacy to a military that Modi’s government accuses of supporting militant groups, they said. Wary that Trump would look to orchestrate a meeting between Munir and Modi, the Indian leader turned down an invitation to stop by the White House on the way back from Canada, they said, adding that he was also committed to visiting Croatia,” the report said.
It added that since the phone call, “India saw a shift in tone from the White House after that phone call, according to the officials in New Delhi” despite the US not making a direct request for Modi to acknowledge Trump’s role.
“Once Trump began publicly attacking India, they added, it was clear the episode marked a turning point in the broader relationship,” the report said.
Modi said a day ago he would not compromise on the agriculture sector.
For New Delhi, one of the main sticking points in trade negotiations has been Washington’s demand to access India’s vast agricultural and dairy market. India has remained steadfast about its labour-intensive agricultural sector, unwilling to risk angering farmers, a powerful voting bloc.
“We will not compromise with the interests of our farmers, our dairy sector, our fishermen,” Modi said during a speech at a conference in New Delhi, his remarks widely seen as his first public response to the tariffs.
“I know I will have to pay a personal price for this, but I am ready for it,” he added, without giving further details.
In February, Trump said that he found a “special bond” with Modi when he visited Washington — complimenting Modi as being a “much tougher negotiator” than he was.
Successive US administrations have seen India — the world’s most populous nation and fifth-largest economy — as a key partner, with like-minded interests in the face of powerful China.
India and neighbouring China have long been intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.
Now, India is bracing for a bumpy ride, as the US is its largest trading partner, with New Delhi shipping goods worth $87.4 billion in 2024.</p><small>2025-08-08 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0819571561d2c5e.jpg?r=195758' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929551/ptis-leaders-of-opposition-in-na-senate-removed-from-posts' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s leaders of opposition in NA, Senate removed from posts</strong></a><br><p>PTI’s Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan and Opposition Leader in the Senate Shibli Faraz, were removed from their seats, according to notifications by the respective houses’ secretariats that came to light on Friday.
On Tuesday, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had disqualified the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions in cases related to the May 9 riots.
According to the notification by the National Assembly Secretariat dated August 7, “ Consequent upon disqualification and de-notification of Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan from being a member of the National Assembly (NA-18 Haripur) under Article 63 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan … the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly has become vacant with effect from August 5th, 2025.“
A similar notification for Faraz was issued by the Senate Secretariat: “Consequent upon disqualification and de-notification of Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Senator Syed Shibli Faraz, from being a member of the Senate under Article 63 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan … the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has become vacant with effect from 5th August”.
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday halted ECP from taking any action against PTI leaders Faraz and Ayub.
A notification from the ECP had said Faraz, Ayub, Kharal, Raza, MNA Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan, Gul, MPA Muhammad Ansar Iqbal, MPA Junaid Afzal Sahi and MPA Rai Muhammad Murtaza Iqbal were now disqualified under Article 63(1h) (a person shall be disqualified from being elected [if] … he has been, on conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years) of the Constitution and their seats were vacant.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
Last month, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Faisalabad senten­ced over 100 leaders and workers of the PTI, including several key opposition figures, to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the May 9 riots.
NA Opposition Leader Khan, Senate Opposition Leader Faraz, MNA Zartaj Gul, Raza, Sheikh Rashid Shafique (nephew of former interior minister Sheikh Rashid), Kanwal Shauzab, Farah Agha, Rai Haider Kharal and Muhammad Ahmad Chattha were among those sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.
Ayub had lambasted the ATC’s “bogus verdict” in a post on X, saying that he would contest it and the ECP’s disqualification in court.
He also posted a video of himself at the Peshawar High Court with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.
The ECP disqualification followed other recent disqualifications of PTI leaders and lawmakers.
On July 29, the ECP had disqualified MNA Abdul Latif from the NA-1 constituency (Upper and Lower Chitral), raising questions over the haste with which a flurry of similar decisions were taken in recent days.
On July 28, the commission had disqualified Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chatta and MPA Ahmad Khan.
On December 21 and 26 last year, a military court had sentenced over 50 PTI leaders and activists, including Imran Khan’s nephew Hassaan Niazi, to up to 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 riots.
The ATCs have been hearing May 9-related cases daily to meet a deadline set by the Supreme Court for the conclusion of trials by August.</p><small>2025-08-08 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0817575255a67f5.jpg?r=175937' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929546/security-forces-kill-33-terrorists-in-balochistans-zhob-district-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 33 terrorists in Balochistan’s Zhob district: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 33 terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on Friday, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a large group of terrorists belonging to the “Indian proxy Fitna al Khwaraj”, were trying to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border when they were detected by the security forces in the Sambaza area of Balochistan’s Zhob district on the night of August 7 and 8.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement added that the troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate, adding, “As a result of precise, bold and skilful engagement, thirty three Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell.”
A large cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was also recovered, it added.
“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and to eradicate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.
Last month, 30 terrorists of an “Indian proxy” outfit were killed as they attempted to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border in Hassan Khel tehsil of KP’s North Waziristan district.</p><small>2025-08-08 15:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08151443df1d913.png?r=151522' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929527/14-terrorist-facilitators-held-in-kps-bannu-locality-operation-police' target='_blank'><strong>14 terrorist facilitators held in KP’s Bannu locality operation: police</strong></a><br><p>Amid a spate of terrorist and quadcopter attacks, police on Friday carried out a search and targeted operation alongside security forces in Hoveed and Wazirabad areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu, arresting “14 terrorist facilitators and destroying three hideouts”.
Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu in July.
Bannu police spokesperson Khanzala Quraishi said in a statement: “Pakistan Army and police conducted a joint operation in Hoveed and Wazirabad areas based on intelligence inputs and arrested 14 facilitators of the banned organisation, while 3 hideouts of terrorists were demolished.”
Quraishi added that the operation was carried out on information about the presence of terrorists in Wazirabad and Tudonar along the Tuchi River, where five suspected targets were cleared. Security forces also seized three vehicles, which included two motorcycles and a rickshaw.
“Joint patrols were also conducted in Hoveed Bazaar and its surroundings to ensure the presence of security forces in the area,” the police spokesperson added.
In a statement issued earlier today, Quraishi had said: “This operation has been launched on the basis of intelligence reports, the main objective of which is to cleanse the area from the scourge of terrorism and establish lasting peace.”
The operation began at 5am on Friday, according to Quraishi, and was launched on the instructions of Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan under the supervision of District Police Officer Saleem Abbasi Kalachi.
“During the operation, security forces and police personnel have completely surrounded the area and house-to-house searches are ongoing,” the statement said.
“In case of any suspicious activity or resistance, immediate and effective action is being taken so that the terrorists do not get any chance to escape or hide.”
A curfew was imposed in the area during the duration of the operation for the sake of public safety, and citizens were advised to cooperate with security agencies and stay indoors.
“Immediately report any suspicious person or activity to the relevant authorities,” the statement read.
“Authorities have warned that providing any kind of facility or assistance to terrorists is a serious crime, and strict legal action will be taken against such elements.”
Last week, a police constable was martyred in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Bannu, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.
In July, ter­rorists used a quadcopter to attack a police station in Miryan, Bannu, making it the fifth such attack at the installation in a month.</p><small>2025-08-08 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/081806008bd5906.jpg?r=180606' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929545/workers-remittances-for-july-2025-up-by-74pc-on-yearly-basis' target='_blank'><strong>Workers remittances for July 2025 up by 7.4pc on yearly basis</strong></a><br><p>Remittances from overseas Pakistani workers went up by 7.4 per cent on year-on-year basis for the month of July, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Friday.
Every month, millions of overseas Pakistanis send money home. These remittances are now a cornerstone of Pakistan’s balance-of-payments, hitting a record $4.1 billion during March alone.
“Workers’ remittances recorded an inflow of $3.2bn during July 2025,” a press release by the SBP read.
According to the data released by the bank, the inflows were mainly sourced from Saudi Arabia ($823.7 million), United Arab Emirates ($665.2m), United Kingdom ($450.4m) and the US ($269.6m).
Last month, SBP’s data showed that workers’ remittances increased by 26.6pc to hit a record $38.3bn during the fiscal year 2025 as compared to the corresponding period of last year.
It added that the workers’ remittances went up by 7.9pc to $3.406bn in June 2025, compared to $3.158bn during the same month last year.
FY25 proved to be a relatively successful year for the government on the external front, with expectations of a current account surplus and the SBP exceeding its foreign exchange reserves target of $14bn by closing at $14.5bn.
 
 

Remittances played a crucial role in maintaining exchange rate stability, enabling the central bank to accumulate reserves and make partial repayments of its external debt. While official figures have not been disclosed, interbank currency dealers estimate the SBP purchased over $8bn from the banking market during the year.
A study by the Asian Development Bank last year found that Pakistani migrants tend to remit more when economic conditions are improving back home and when there is a positive association between remittances and domestic economic activity.
The study’s findings indicate that domestic and abroad economic activity is positively associated with remittances to Pakistan.</p><small>2025-08-08 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08175408d263aa1.jpg?r=175440' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929530/peshawar-man-booked-for-online-harassment-cyberstalking-crime-agency' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar man booked for online harassment, cyberstalking: crime agency</strong></a><br><p>A man in Peshawar was booked under the charges of cyberstalking and harassment on Friday by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) after he allegedly threatened to leak personal pictures of the complainant online.
In a statement, NCCIA said that the suspect — who was arrested from the Faqirabad area of Peshawar — was posting photos of the complainant on TikTok and had threatened to post photos of an obscene nature on the platform.
“The incident caused severe mental and social damage to the victim,” the NCCIA said.
A first information report (FIR) has been registered against the suspect under Section 16 (Unauthorised use of identity information), Section 20 (Offences against dignity of a natural person), and Section 24 (Cyberstalking) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, as well as Section 419 (cheating by personatation) and Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The investigation officer, Sub-Inspector Mukhtiar Ahmed, said in a statement that strict action would be taken against those who are involved in such activities, calling it a “serious crime”.
According to a Digital Rights Foundation report, a total of 3,171 complaints of tech-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV) were received from across the country in 2024.
A large number of women in the country across all age groups and classes continue to face violence and endure sexual, mental, and physical abuse despite improvements in education, according to a 2023 report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
On Wednesday, the National Assembly urged the government to ensure strict punishment to those involved in unauthorised video recording, cyber-harassment, and digital defamation.
In June, the national cybersecurity authority urged citizens to use social media responsibly and remain vigilant against cyber threats.
The body pointed out that women are “frequently targeted” with cyber harassment, identity theft and image-based abuse, risks that are “compounded by broader societal inequities”.</p><small>2025-08-08 12:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/081635330aeb04b.png?r=163720' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929536/india-pauses-plans-to-buy-us-arms-after-trumps-tariffs' target='_blank'><strong>India pauses plans to buy US arms after Trump’s tariffs</strong></a><br><p>New Delhi has put on hold its plans to procure new US weapons and aircraft, according to three Indian officials familiar with the matter, in India’s first concrete sign of discontent after tariffs imposed on its exports by President Donald Trump dragged ties to their lowest level in decades.
India had been planning to send Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to Washington in the coming weeks for an announcement on some of the purchases, but that trip has been cancelled, two of the people said.
Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods as punishment for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil, which he said meant the country was funding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That raised the total duty on Indian exports to 50pc — among the highest of any US trading partner.
The US president has a history of rapidly reversing himself on tariffs, and India has said it remains actively engaged in discussions with Washington. One of the people said the defence purchases could go ahead once India had clarity on tariffs and the direction of bilateral ties, but “just not as soon as they were expected to”.
Written instructions had not been given to pause the purchases, another official said, indicating that Delhi had the option to quickly reverse course, though there was “no forward movement at least for now.”
India’s defence ministry and the Pentagon did not respond to Reuters’ questions. Delhi, which has forged a close partnership with America in recent years, has said it is being unfairly targeted and that Washington and its European allies continue to trade with Moscow when it is in their interest.
Reuters is reporting for the first time that discussions on India’s purchases of Stryker combat vehicles made by General Dynamics Land Systems and Javelin anti-tank missiles developed by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have been paused due to the tariffs.
Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in February announced plans to pursue procurement and joint production of those items.
Singh had also been planning to announce the purchase of six Boeing P8I reconnaissance aircraft and support systems for the Indian Navy during his now-cancelled trip, two of the people said. Talks over procuring the aircraft in a proposed $3.6 billion deal were at an advanced stage, according to the officials.
Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics referred queries to the Indian and US governments. Raytheon did not return a request for comment.
Russian Relations
India’s deepening security relationship with the US, which is fuelled by their shared strategic rivalry with China, was heralded by many US analysts as one of the key areas of foreign-policy progress in the first Trump administration.
Delhi is the world’s second-largest arms importer, and Russia has traditionally been its top supplier. India has, in recent years, however, shifted to importing from Western powers like France, Israel and the US, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute think-tank.
The shift in suppliers was driven partly by constraints on Russia’s ability to export arms, which it is utilising heavily in its invasion of Ukraine. Some Russian weapons have also performed poorly in the battlefield, according to Western analysts.
 
 

The broader US-India defence partnership, which includes intelligence sharing and joint military exercises, continues without hiccups, one of the Indian officials said.
India also remains open to scaling back on oil imports from Russia and is open to making deals elsewhere, including the US, if it can get similar prices, according to two other Indian sources.
Trump’s threats and rising anti-US nationalism in India have “made it politically difficult for Modi to make the shift from Russia to the US,” one of the people said. Nonetheless, discounts on the landing cost of Russian oil have shrunk to the lowest since 2022.
India’s petroleum ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
While the rupture in US-India ties was abrupt, there have been strains in the relationship. Delhi has repeatedly rebutted Trump’s statements that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after four days of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Trump also hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.
In recent months, Moscow has been actively pitching Delhi on buying new defence technologies like its S-500 surface-to-air missile system, according to one of the Indian officials, as well as a Russian source familiar with the talks.
India currently does not see a need for new arms purchases from Moscow, two Indian officials said.
But Delhi is unlikely to wean itself off Russian weapons entirely as the decades-long partnership between the two powers means Indian military systems will continue to require Moscow’s support, one of the officials said.
The Russian embassy in Delhi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><small>2025-08-08 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08122930b70786d.png?r=155032' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929512/kkh-partially-blocked-by-river-flow-in-gbs-hunza-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>KKH partially blocked by river flow in GB’s Hunza: spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>River erosion and increased water flow caused a blockage on part of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Hunza Valley on Friday, according to a government spokesperson.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that the flow of water in GB rivers had increased, because of which a part of the KKH had been blocked due to erosion.
“The chief minister of GB has ordered the restoration of the highway,” he said.
He added that relevant institutions were on their way to restoring the KKH in Morkhun.
Faraq also said that a search was underway for tourists who went missing after a boat capsized in Skardu on Tuesday.
“Due to the increase in the flow of water in the lakes, there is a ban on operating boats and Section 144 is in force,” he said.
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
“Action is being taken against those who take tourists out on lakes by boat despite the ban,” Faraq added.
Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since June. GB has been among the hardest hit regions by the extreme weather.
On Monday, a search operation for tourists who went missing after rain-induced floods in GB’s Babusar area concluded after 14 days, and the tourists’ funeral prayers were held in absentia.
Last month, thousands of people, including foreign tourists, were stranded at multiple locations in GB due to blocked roads, including KKH, due to landslides.</p><small>2025-08-08 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/081509140e09db2.jpg?r=150922' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929528/govt-suspends-mobile-data-services-in-balochistan-until-aug-31-for-security-reasons' target='_blank'><strong>Govt suspends mobile data services in Balochistan until Aug 31 for ‘security reasons’</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan government spokesman Shahid Rind on Friday said that mobile data services in the province have been suspended until August 31 over “security reasons”.
In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. In February, nearly 62 per cent of the total terrorism-related deaths in the country occurred in Balochistan.
The move came after a notification issued by the Balochistan Home Department on Aug 6, seen by Dawn.com, ordered the immediate suspension of data services until Aug 31, citing the “peculiar law and order situation” in the province.
“It is, therefore, requested to please direct the concerned authorities for suspension/closure of 3G and 4G services in the entire province … to avoid any untoward incident,” the notification read.
“The service has been suspended because they (militants) use it for coordination and sharing information,” Rind said, according to Reuters.
The suspension follows the government announcement from last month banning Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) from travelling by road from Quetta to Iran and Iraq due to national security concerns.
 
 

On March 11, the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express train became the target of an unprecedented hijacking, when terrorists fired on the locomotive and took over 400 passengers hostage.
Media reports said that security forces had surrounded the area and launched a clearance operation to rescue all passengers. Radio Pakistan reported that security forces had rescued 80 hostages held by the terrorists.
Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the clearance operation, launched after the train’s unprecedented hijacking in Balochistan, ended with all 33 terrorists being killed.</p><small>2025-08-08 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08155110e5de01c.jpg?r=155432' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929509/pakistan-set-to-become-first-south-asian-country-to-ratify-unesco-underwater-heritage-convention' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan set to become first South Asian country to ratify Unesco underwater heritage convention</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is set to become the first South Asian nation to ratify the 2001 Unesco Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage (UCH), marking a significant step toward safeguarding its submerged maritime legacy, a statement from the Press Information Department (PID) said on Friday.
In recent years, underwater cultural heritage has attracted increasing attention from both the scientific community and the general public.
For scientists, it represents an invaluable source of information on ancient civilisations, maritime practices, human use of land and marine environments, and climate change, according to Unesco.
The announcement was made by Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry during a meeting with Unesco representative Dr Cristina Menegazzi in Islamabad today. The two sides discussed collaborative efforts to document, preserve, and promote Pakistan’s rich underwater archaeological resources.
“Pakistan is set to become the first South Asian nation to ratify the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage (UCH), marking a significant step toward safeguarding its submerged maritime legacy,” the statement said.
Maritime archaeology, a specialised discipline that explores the relationship between humans and bodies of water through historical artefacts, is gaining prominence in coastal nations with rich nautical histories, as per the statement.
In Pakistan’s case, this includes shipwrecks, submerged landscapes, ancient maritime infrastructure such as piers and lighthouses, and historic trade routes along the Arabian Sea.
“We are committed to preserving our maritime cultural heritage and will soon ratify the 2001 Convention,” Minister Chaudhry was quoted as saying in the statement.
“This will position Pakistan as a regional leader in protecting underwater cultural heritage and strengthen our voice on international platforms concerning climate change and cultural preservation.”
The minister underscored the government’s focus on environmentally responsible exploration. “Any scientific activity in maritime archaeology must be conducted in a way that respects and protects marine ecosystems,” the minister was further quoted as saying.
“The use of non-invasive technologies like remote sensing, diver-based observation, and photogrammetry will be prioritised, while excavations will only be carried out under strict scientific guidelines.”
The statement added: “In line with efforts to preserve both submerged and coastal heritage, Chaudhry also requested Unesco’s assistance in registering historic maritime buildings in Karachi.
“These include over 70-year-old structures under the Maritime Affairs Ministry, such as the Marine Fisheries Department and the iconic Marine Lighthouse. The minister proposed establishing a maritime historical museum to house and exhibit this coastal legacy.
“Unesco possesses valuable digital archives and marine archaeological data from across the globe,” according to Chaudhry. “We wish to collaborate in scientific research and mapping of Pakistan’s underwater cultural heritage, which has been largely unexplored.”
The minister emphasised that Pakistan’s engagement in this field will not only highlight its cultural wealth but also align with global efforts to combat climate change. Submerged archaeological sites, he noted, serve as key indicators of past sea levels and climate patterns, offering insights into the environmental shifts that affect coastal communities today.
“Dr Menegazzi welcomed Pakistan’s intention to join the global community in protecting underwater heritage and expressed Unesco’s willingness to support technical and scientific cooperation in the area,” the statement read.
Last year, experts at Unesco-sponsored workshop at Mohenjo Daro said that while disasters cannot be stopped, preventive measures could be adopted to reduce the risk of destruction to heritage sites, monuments and museums, and minimise harm.
A Unesco delegation has also previously called on the Sindh government to discuss the restoration project of the world heritage Makli’s tombs of Shaikh Jiyo and others, which have been severely affected by rains, floods and other natural disasters.</p><small>2025-08-08 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/081117289d36976.png?r=111829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929503/arshad-nadeem-marks-one-year-since-historic-paris-gold-with-london-rehab' target='_blank'><strong>Arshad Nadeem marks one year since historic Paris gold with London rehab</strong></a><br><p>A year ago to the day, Arshad Nadeem stunned the world with a monstrous javelin throw that propelled him to global stardom and salvaged Pakistan’s plummeting sports glory with its first individual gold medal at the Paris 2024 Olympics.
The javelin star sweetened the deal when his 92.97m throw shattered the Olympic record — not once, but twice, to the delight of a roaring crowd at Paris’ Stade de France.
But a year on from the historic triumph, Arshad is undergoing physiotherapy in London following surgery on his calf muscle.
The two upcoming Diamond League championships he was set to compete at this month have been scrapped from his sports calendar as he recovers in time for the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo in September.
But there is no disappointment from Arshad or his coach Salman Butt, who doubles as his mentor, manager, and much more.
“Things are looking good for Tokyo,” he told Dawn.com in a call from London. “We’re hoping to accomplish a lot there.”
A gold medal at the World Championships will complete his trifecta after his gold in the Paris Olympics and the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Arshad made this year’s international debut in style when he won gold with an 86.40m throw at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea, in May.
Butt acknowledged that the scratched competitions are not ideal, and the aim was to compete at least four or five times ahead of the world championships.

“The thing is, sports and injury go together. That’s just how it is.”

He emphasised the importance of rectifying the recurring injury as they flew to Cambridge and underwent surgery within six days.
Contrary to any doom and gloom, Arshad is now pain-free and going full steam ahead with his training in London as he wraps up his last few physiotherapy sessions.
He’ll return to Pakistan soon, where he’ll continue training for the next six weeks before heading to Tokyo in an attempt to make history once again.
Arshad honoured by Pakistan High Commission in London
The Pakistan High Commission in London honoured Arshad with a shield to commemorate one year since his Olympic triumph.
“All officers and staff of [the high commission] were present to honour our national hero,” it said in a post on X.
High Commissioner Dr Muhammad Faisal said: “Arshad Nadeem’s achievement has highlighted the importance of track & field athletics to the youth of Pakistan.”

Extreme temperatures caused approximately 489,000 heat-related deaths annually between 2000 and 2019, with 36 per cent occurring in Europe and 45pc in Asia, the report said.
The health impacts of heat are especially severe in cities due to the so-called ‘urban heat island effect’ — the over-heating of dense city areas compared with their rural surroundings — which is magnifying problems as urbanisation continues, it was pointed out.
Amid rising 21st-century temperatures, the WMO underscored that July 2025 was the third-warmest July ever recorded, behind those in 2023 and 2024.
In this record-breaking July, heatwaves especially impacted Sweden and Finland, which experienced unusually long spells of temperatures above 30°C.
Southeast Europe also faced heatwaves and wildfire activity, with Türkiye recording an extreme new national high of 50.5°C.
In Asia, temperatures soared above average the most across the Himalayas, China and Japan in July, with extreme heat continuing into August.
In the week leading up to August 5, temperatures surpassed 42°C across West Asia, southern Central Asia, the southwestern United States, much of North Africa and southern Pakistan — with some areas exceeding 45°C.
Parts of southwestern Iran and eastern Iraq saw particularly severe temperatures above 50°C, disrupting electricity and water supplies, education and labour.
For the week of August 4, Morocco issued heat warnings for temperatures up to 47°C.
Korea also issued widespread heat warnings, as station temperature records were broken across parts of China.
In Japan, a new national temperature record of 41.8°C was set on August 5, breaking the previous record of 41.2°C set a week prior.
Looking to next week, the World Meteorological Centre in Beijing forecasts that heatwaves will persist across the same regions as well as the Iberian Peninsula and northern Mexico.
These regions are expected to see maximum temperatures between 38 and 40°C, with parts of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, North Africa and the southwestern US likely to exceed 45°C.
 
 

As Canada experiences one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, with 6.6 million hectares burned, smoke has polluted the skies and caused poor air quality across several provinces and northern states of the US in late July and early August.
Twice this summer, smoke from Canadian fires crossed the Atlantic, affecting skies over Western Europe from August 5-7 and over Central and Southern Europe in late June.
Elsewhere, Cyprus, Greece and Türkiye have battled wildfires that forced evacuations and caused fatalities. In the US, a wildfire in Arizona’s Grand Canyon National Park disrupted tourism at the iconic site.
“Extreme heat is sometimes called the silent killer, but with today’s science, data and technologies, silence is no longer an excuse. Every single death from extreme heat is preventable,” said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.
The WMO is working to strengthen heat early warning systems under the Early Warnings for All initiative. In collaboration with global and local partners, it is also helping countries develop heat-health action plans and ensure at-risk populations receive timely alerts.
WMO is also one of ten UN agencies supporting the Secretary-General’s Call to Action on Extreme Heat, which aims to boost global cooperation to reduce heat impacts through economic and social policy. A key focus is limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement.
According to estimates from WMO and the World Health Organisation (WHO), scaling up heat-health warning systems in 57 countries alone could save nearly 100,000 lives annually.
“Our network is connecting science, policy, and action so that no community is left behind in the race to adapt to climate change that will continue to worsen extreme heat for years to come,” said Joy Shumake-Guillemot, lead of the WHO-WMO Climate and Health Joint Programme and co-lead of the Global Heat-Health Information Network (GHHIN).
“This is not just a climate issue, it’s a public health emergency,” she added.</p><small>2025-08-08 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08123113a3b6af6.jpg?r=125800' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929508/2-terrorists-planning-to-attack-police-killed-in-mianwali-operation-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>2 terrorists planning to attack police killed in Mianwali operation: CTD</strong></a><br><p>Two terrorists planning to attack the police in Punjab’s Mianwali district were killed during an operation, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Friday.
The CTD regularly carries out operations across the province to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. Operating under the provincial police department, the Punjab CTD plays a key role in maintaining internal security and countering terrorism within the country.
In a statement today, the law enforcement agency said, “Punjab CTD killed two terrorists during an operation near Kundian in Mianwali.”
It said that the CTD acted on a tip-off after receiving intelligence that the terrorists were planning to attack police and other institutions.
“During the operation, the CTD and terrorists engaged in an exchange of fire, as a result of which two terrorists were killed by their own accomplices, while six of them managed to escape.”
According to the statement, the CTD recovered “explosive materials, two rifles, hand grenades and bullets” from the terrorists.
“The terrorists had completed their plans to target the police and other institutions,” it said.
The CTD spokesperson said that the process of identifying the two terrorists was underway, while a search operation was launched to arrest the terrorists who escaped.
Punjab CTD was “diligently pursuing its goal of a safe Punjab and is committed to uprooting the menace of terrorism”, the statement added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
Last month, Punjab CTD killed five terrorists and successfully thwarted a terror plot in Taunsa Sharif in a “major counter-terrorism breakthrough”.
In April,  the law enforcement agency foiled major attacks by arresting 10 terrorists belonging to banned organisations during 189 operations in different areas of Punjab.</p><small>2025-08-08 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/081138293c14515.jpg?r=113918' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929480/indias-assam-to-offer-gun-licences-in-bangladesh-border-areas' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Assam to offer gun licences in Bangladesh border areas</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI: India’s Assam state, bordering Muslim-majority Bangladesh, is to issue gun licences to “indigenous” residents, its Hindu nationalist leader has announced, a move raising concerns among the state’s Muslims.
Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has previously warned that the Assamese-speaking population “face the threat of attacks from the Bangladesh side, and even in their own villages”.
The northeastern state of around 31 million people is riven by multiple ethnic, linguistic and religious fault-lines, and was troubled by several bloody clashes in past decades.
Muslims make up roughly 35 per cent of the population, most of them Bengali speaking, according to the most recent national census in 2011, with the rest largely Hindus.
Sarma announced on Wednesday the introduction of a website “where indigenous people, who perceive a threat to their lives and reside in sensitive areas, can apply for arms licenses”. India has otherwise strict gun control laws, and critics and opposition leaders condemned the move.
“This will lead to gang violence and crimes based on personal vendettas,” said opposition Congress lawmaker Gaurav Gogoi on social media platform X.
“This is not governance, this is a dangerous step backwards towards lawlessness.”
Sarma is from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The move is part of a wider populist campaign by Sarma’s BJP government backing the majority Assamese-speaking people, including large-scale eviction drives against what he has called “illegal foreigners or doubtful citizens”.
It is widely seen as targeting Muslims speaking Bengali — the main language in neighbouring Bangladesh.

Six other suspects, including a surgeon, managed to escape during a pre-dawn raid, according to the police.
Earlier this month, Airport police had also unearthed a similar illegal operation in which a man was found undergoing a kidney removal procedure.
Police said on Thursday that Sub-Inspector Wasim Sarwar registered an FIR with the Rawat police, stating he and his subordinates heard screaming of an individual from inside a house during an anti-crime patrol at 12 o’clock midnight in Rafi Block, Phase VIII of Bahria Town.
He said an ambulance and other suspicious vehicles were also seen moving outside the house. “When the police reached the house located on the main road at 12:10am, they heard screams from inside,” the SI said.
He stated in the FIR that the police knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, but no one responded from inside. Considering human lives were at stake, they entered the house along with a lady constable and heard noises coming from one of the rooms.
 
 

As the police entered the room, they found a man fastened to a stretcher with pieces of rope. He was on a drip and shouting loudly: “Save me, save me.” Another person standing guard in the room attempted to escape.
The SI added that the police apprehended the man, who after interrogation revealed his name as Zafarullah Khan Cheema, a resident of district Hafizabad. Upon seeing the police, six individuals inside the house jumped over the walls and escaped.
According to the arrested suspect, the names of those who escaped were Imran, resident of Dhamial, Rawalpindi; Dr Manzoor (surgeon), resident of Hazro, Attock; Dr Aamir, of Mansehra; Gul Nawaz (assistant), Attock; Zeb (assistant), Attock, and Rafiq alias Fika.
It transpired later that the person on the stretcher was Hanan Zaid, resident of Sector I, Phase VIII, Bahria Town.
He informed the police that the suspects had called him for a job at the house. When he arrived, they gave him a glass of juice. After drinking the juice, he began feeling unwell and became semi-conscious. He said the suspects then took him to a hospital in the PWD area and conducted medical tests on him before he lost consciousness.
When he regained consciousness, he found himself tied to a stretcher in the same house, and said he was experiencing seizures.
When he asked why he had been tied up, they told him, “You’ve your medical done, and you have a damaged kidney that needs an operation. After that, you will get a job.”
He added that the suspects had forcibly kidnapped and detained him and intended to remove his kidney to sell it.
Zafarullah Cheema, now in police custody, told investigators that various people had been brought to the house, where their kidneys were removed and sold for transplants to both domestic and foreign clients.
Upon searching the rooms inside the house, police seized medical equipment and medicines used in the operation theatre. A case has been registered under relevant sections of the law, and an investigation is underway.

The demand was made by both treasury and opposition members during an assembly session chaired by Deputy Speaker Suriya Bibi here.
Special assistant to the chief minister for housing Dr Amjad Ali said the Action in Aid of Civil Power Ordinance was the root cause of unrest in the province, so the house should think about it.
“The house must think that the root cause of all this mayhem is the Action in Aid of Civil Power Ordinance, 2019, so it should be abolished to prev ent further loss of public life and bring peace,” he said.

CM’s aide opposes military operations insisting they fuel terrorism

Mr Ali warned that there would be more chaos in KP and Balochistan if the ordinance remained in force.
He said he would never support more military operations as they fueled terrorism.
“At least I will not support military action even if the provincial government favours it because such actions fuel terrorism,” he said.
The aide to the chief minister said the people, who the military fought against, were trained, facilitated and launched by it against the USSR.
He said that the former rulers declared on record that 90,000 people were trained to fight against the USSR.
“Former military dictator General Pervez Musharraf and former prime minister
Benazir Bhutto termed mujahideen national heroes,“ he insisted.
Mr Ali said people questioned why terrorist infiltration into the country couldn’t be stopped.
He also said that Afghanistan shared a border with six countries but it was never heard that terrorists crossed from there into those countries.
Member of the opposition Awami National Party Mohammad Nisar Baaz said all the laws, which were being misused, should be abolished.
He said that when his party’s workers, office-bearers and lawmakers were attacked, many believed the target was just ANP, but the party
always termed the state’s “unwise” decisions the reason behind the poor law and order situation.
Mr Baaz said it was the PTI government that called the armed forces under Article 245 of the Constitution in aid of the civil power in the province.
He said that the PTI’s government extended the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations 2011 to the entire province in 2019 but the same party obtained stay orders from the Supreme Court when the Peshawar High Court nullified that move.
“If the provincial government wants to abolish that ordinance, it should withdraw the stay orders it obtained,” he said.
The lawmaker said that even after two decades, peace could not be restored in the province and those responsible for maintaining law and order failed to fulfil their responsibilities.
He said that the armed forces were called in 2006 due to the law and order situation in Malakand region and even 21 years later, the armed forces were present in the province, with their expenses being paid from the provincial budget.
“It is a burden on our resources. If the house is serious about shrinking the armed forces’ role, the police and the CTD must be strengthened,” he said.
Mr Baaz requested the chair to call the provincial
police chief and additional inspector general of the counter-terrorism department to the house for briefing on investigation into the killing of ANP leader from Bajaur Maulana Khanzeb.
Adviser to the CM for communication and works Sohail Afridi said his leader and PTI founder Imran Khan dissolved assemblies and thought that elections would be held in 90 days but it took over a year for the electoral exercise to take place.
 
 

He said Imran was against drone strikes and military operations, so the PTI’s government would never allow any military offensive in the province.
“Terrorists come over and ask for a meal. If we refuse, we are killed by them and if we do not, we are killed by the security forces,” he said, wondering how terrorists reach residential areas.
Mr Afridi said terrorist movement in residential areas was an “intelligence failure” and that authorities “allowed” terrorist infiltration.
MPA Aurangzeb Khan said the situation would come under control only when people, security forces and police jointly fight against terrorists.
He said only people from the Orakzai tribal region decided not to allow any terrorists to operate in their area.
He said terrorists would be identified and their locations would be shared with law-enforcement agencies to see if any action was taken.
Member of the opposition PPP Ashbar Jan Jadoon said his party respected the military and judiciary as national institutions.
He said those calling the assembly seats reserved for women and non-Muslims unconstitutional must know those seats were allotted to parties and not individuals.
“You have been ruling this province for the last 12 years, what you have done so far against terrorism,” she asked the PTI members.
Mr Jadoon said attacks were a routine in the 2008-13 period, with the government funding terrorists.
MPA Obaidur Rehman said that from the previous Zarb-i-Azb military operation in the tribal region to the ongoing Sarbakaf action in Bajaur tribal district, the province had witnessed 22 such offensives against terrorisms, claiming 8,0000 lives, costing $140 billion and displacing 3.5 million people, but the government didn’t launch even a single project to rehabilitate those people.
“I ask state institutions how terrorists enter Pakistan, why they enter Pakistan only and why these Indian proxies don’t go to Punjab and Sindh,” he said.
The house unanimously passed MPA Asif Khan Mahsud’s resolution, seeking the renaming of South Upper Waziristan district as Mehsud Waziristan.
The chair later adjourned the sitting until Monday due to a lack of quorum.

The extension comes amid ongoing extreme weather conditions in the province, though the notification did not explicitly cite a reason for the decision.
This marks the second adjustment to the academic calendar this summer. Parents and students are advised to note the revised date, while school administrations are expected to adjust their academic plans accordingly.
The Punjab government has not yet indicated whether the extended break will affect the overall academic year schedule or examinations.
Punjab School Education minister Rana Sikandar Hayat also tweeted about extension of summer vacations.
“Schools in Punjab will be opened from Sept 1,” he tweeted.

Pakistan Railways authorities confirmed the explosion, which occurred near the outer signal of the track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country.
“The explosive device was planted near the outer railway signal and detonated shortly after the train passed, causing significant damage to the track but leaving the train unharmed,” a senior official told Dawn.
However, the railway track was badly damaged in the blast.
“A portion of the railway track was blown up in the blast,” railway police officials said, adding that train service has been suspended after the explosion and Quetta-bound trains stopped at Jacobabad station. The repair of the damaged railway line has started.
Following the explosion, security forces rushed to the scene to investigate. Preliminary findings revealed that the explosive device had been remotely detonated.

This figure is more than double the 301,000 bales reported by the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA).
Citing data from its Crop Reporting Service (CRS), a spokesperson for the department clarified on Thursday that the 609,000 bales of seed cotton were recorded up to July 31. In contrast, the PCGA’s estimate reflects only the cotton arriving at operational ginning factories in Punjab, irrespective of its origin.
The spokesperson emphasised that the CRS figures are based on internationally recognised, scientifically proven methods. These include randomised sampling, ground truthing techniques, and GPS-enabled tools, all of which are in line with FAO-endorsed methodologies. The CRS also utilises a real-time digital dashboard that ensures transparency and supports evidence-based policy decisions.
 
 

The department further argued that the PCGA figures fail to account for cotton held at the farm level, transferred to other provinces, or stored by stockists. “Persistent under-invoicing in recent years has distorted the accuracy of cotton reporting at ginning factories,” the spokesperson added.

Agriculture Department claims record yield, discrepancies with PCGA data

To clarify the situation, the department reiterated that the official record of national cotton production is based on estimates compiled by all provinces. As such, it suggested that comparisons with the fortnightly data on cotton arriving at ginning factories were not justified.
The department has also requested the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to implement a robust mechanism at all operational ginning factories to ensure real-time, accurate reporting of cotton received and processed.
“This step is essential for enhancing transparency, strengthening data integrity, and supporting coordinated efforts across institutions involved in cotton monitoring and policy formulation,” the spokesperson said.
This year, Punjab has seen significant success in cotton cultivation, with early planting carried out on 781,000 acres, contributing to a total sown area of 3.16 million acres.
Extensive support for the crop has included enhanced field services, active participation from universities, agricultural interns, and the private sector through the cotton campaign.

The auction of three remaining properties, owned by controversial real estate tycoon Malik Riaz, was shelved due to a “lack of qualifying bids”.
Although mediapersons were invited to cover the auction, they were not allowed to witness proceedings, which were held behind closed doors at NAB’s regional headquarters for Rawalpindi/Islamabad.
Following the auction, journalists seated in a separate committee room were handed a paper carrying brief details of its outcome.
Dozens of private vehicles were seen parked outside the NAB headquarters, ostensibly belonging to the bidders.
According to NAB’s advertisement, six properties were scheduled to be auctioned. However, only three were sold: Rubaish Marquee fetched Rs508 million, while the bureau received conditional offers of Rs876m and Rs881.5m for two of the property developer’s corporate offices.
NAB claimed that Rubaish Marquee was auctioned at Rs20m above its reserved price of Rs488m, while the other two properties were sold at the reserved prices set by the bureau.
 
 

A source in NAB told Dawn that the conditional offers for the two corporate offices were submitted as the bidders wanted to change the purpose of these premises in order to carry out other businesses at these venues.
The remaining three properties — Arena Cinema (reserve price Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn), and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), all located in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi — will be auctioned later.
No date has been announced yet for the next auction.
NAB documents stated that the properties were auctioned due to a default of a plea bargain amount in a reference filed against Zain Malik, Malik Riaz’s son-in-law and one of the owners of Bahria Town housing schemes.
Malik Riaz is currently abroad and is reportedly avoiding arrest in other references filed against him, including the high-profile £190m Al-Qadir Trust case and the Bahria Town Karachi case.
The auction followed the Islamabad High Court’s dismissal on Tuesday of petitions filed against the sale of six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad, thus allowing NAB to proceed with the auction scheduled for August 7.
Following the IHC go-ahead, Bahria Town approached the Supreme Court in a bid to restrain NAB from holding the auction.

• Asad Qaiser demands transparent trial of Imran; Marwat seeks inquiry into ‘attack on parliament’
• Commerce ministry says $1 billion saved after US tariff reduced from 29 to 19pc
ISLAMABAD: As the PTI vigorously opposed any potential military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa following a spike in terror incidents, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Thursday said action against militants under the National Action Plan would continue, despite their objections.
The minister was responding to PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser in the lower house of parliament as the latter vowed to oppose any offensive in the PTI-ruled province to eradicate militancy.
Mr Qaiser warned against such attempts, saying they would put up resistance against such plans. His statement is consistent with PTI founder Imran Khan’s stance, who had asked the KP government to oppose such measures, as well as that of the tribal people who have expressed apprehensions against new military offensives.
In response, the minister ruled out a new operation but said measures under NAP would continue, adding that nobody can stop such measures.
Mr Chaudhry also urged the provincial authorities to fulfil their responsibilities to tackle the menace, saying Khyber Pakhtunkhwa received Rs700 billion under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award for counter-terrorism measures.
He, however, rued that the province had done nothing to improve the capacity of law enforcement agencies.
“I know why you are disturbed,” he said while addressing Mr Qaiser. Chiding the PTI leadership for alleged resettlement of the TTP terrorists in Pakistan, he asked if they were with the militants or the state.
It may be noted that after initial action, a potential military operation had been postponed in Bajaur following successful talks between the Bajaur Aman Jirga and the banned TTP.
 
 

About the claims of Imran Khan being the most popular leader, he said popularity did not prove innocence, adding that monuments honouring martyrs had been desecrated during the May 9 violence in 2023.
Crackdown on PTI
Earlier, PTI leader Asad Qaiser also demanded a transparent and independent trial of Imran Khan. “We are referring to an ‘independent trial’ of cases against Imran Khan when we talk about his release”, he clarified.
He said that the PTI leadership had been struggling for the country’s sovereignty and fighting for the supremacy of the Constitution and law. He recalled that the PTI parliamentarians were whisked away from the Parliament House by unidentified men and now they were being disqualified on the pretext of the May 9 violence.
 






The opposition leader said the National Assembly had been turned into a rubber stamp, adding that he would ask his party members to boycott the proceedings of the house for being “unlawful”. He regretted that the gates of the house were closed for the PTI parliamentarians and a BPS-18 or BPS-19 officer humiliated them.
Disgruntled PTI member Sher Afzal Marwat questioned whether the PML-N and the PPP had signed the Charter of Democracy to misbehave with the leaders and parliamentarians of other political parties.
 






“Such an attitude is creating hatred in the political culture,” he said, adding that he would always remember the personnel of agencies and police standing outside the assembly. “I shall never tolerate these people outside the Assembly if I am given the authority of the speaker even for a day,” he remarked.
He demanded the constitution of a committee of the house for an inquiry into what he termed an “attack on Parliament House”. Mr Marwat was among several PTI lawmakers who had been picked up from the premises of parliament in a late-night raid in September last year.
US tariff
Earlier, during Question Hour, the house was told that the recent trade deal signed with the United States would boost Pakistan’s exports and positively impact the economy.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the 19pc tariff rate offered to Pakistan was the lowest in the South Asian region.
Separately, the commerce ministry, in a written response, informed the house that the change in the US tariff from 29pc to 19pc saved Pakistan at least $1 billion.
“…instead of one billion dollars loss, Pakistan’s exports have the potential to increase share in the US market especially in textiles. The new tariff rates on Pakistan and other comparative economies will be instrumental in enhancing Pakistani goods penetration in the highly competitive US market,” the response attributed to Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan said.
 






Lifesaving drugs
Responding to a calling attention notice, Parliamentary Secretary for National Health Services Nelson Azeem said that there was no shortage of lifesaving medicines, including insulin and cancer drugs. He admitted there was a shortage in May during tensions with India.
PPP’s Sharmila Farooqui, who raised the matter, however, noted that the parliamentary secretary was unaware of ground realities and insisted that there was an intermittent shortage in both urban and rural areas.
 






She regretted that about 100 key positions in the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan were vacant, affecting the performance of the authority responsible for controlling the prices and ensuring the availability of drugs.
She said, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the prices of these lifesaving drugs had been increasing by 17.5 per cent every year. According to the June price index, the prices went up by 13 and 15 per cent in urban and rural areas, respectively, she added.
