The prime minister made these remarks during a meeting with Min­ister for Climate Change Dr Musadik Malik, who was part of the delegation. Mr Malik briefed the prime minister on the delegation’s diplomatic engagements and outcomes of the tour.
The two leaders also discussed government climate policies, as well as recent diplomatic efforts undertaken in the wake of heightened tensions between Pakistan and India.
During the meeting, the prime minister was also briefed on the initiatives taken by the Ministry of Climate Change to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change under the government’s ongoing programmes.

Minister briefs premier on diplomatic engagements, outcomes of the tour

During its overseas visits, the delegation had urged the international community to support dialogue betwe­­en Pakistan and India, stressing that sustained communication was essential to curbing regional instability.
 
 

The delegation emphasised the urgent need for a structured dialogue process, warning that the absence of communication between the two nuclear-armed neighbours only emboldens terrorist elements and exacerbates regional insecurity.
During their engagements with officials from the United States, the United Kingdom and European Union, the delegation conveyed Pakistan’s position that India was attempting to politicise terrorism to damage Pakistan’s global reputation.
The prime minister was informed that, despite India’s aggressive lobbying efforts to undermine Pakistan’s progress on the Financial Action Task Force front, Islamabad had successfully transitioned from the FATF grey list to the white list.
Pakistan’s delegation also strongly criticised what it described as “Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dangerous doctrine of escalation”, calling it a threat to peace and stability in the region.
 
 

Delegates further highlighted that Pakistan has borne the brunt of terrorism far more than India — suffering attacks ten times greater in number — many of which, they claimed, could be traced back to Indian funding or involvement.
The delegation also conveyed a firm message that Pakistan will not compromise on its share of water and will take all necessary steps to ensure its people receive their rightful allocation from all six rivers, including the River Indus.

Was it then a mistake for Iran to persist with its opposition to nuclear defence? Part of the answer lies in pictures from Singapore in 2018, showing a boyish, chubby strongman from Pyongyang wrapping Donald Trump around his little finger in a memorable encounter with the US president.
Sunday’s bombing of Iran makes it hard to think of North Korea ever giving up the nuclear weapons that have protected his country so well. In Iran, too, there is a growing chorus within the regime to annul the anti-bomb edict and withdraw from the NPT.
Besides, if Iran does get the bomb, (unlikely under Ayatollah Khamenei’s watch) would Saudi Arabia or Turkey be far behind? Trump may be flashing victory signs to TV channels.
 
 

The fact is, he has run a free jingle to encourage the desire for nuclear weapons among too many worried countries. While details are awaited about the extent of damage from the so-called bunker-buster ammunition dropped on the Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear facilities, Iranian officials seem sanguine the damage is minimal.
Besides, and crucially, the enriched uranium and possibly also critical components from Fordow had already been spirited out to secret locations; not necessarily to make a nuclear weapon, but to assert Iran’s sovereign right to persist with a decades-old quest for peaceful nuclear power.
In a characteristically well-informed column on June 19, three days before the B2 bombers carried out the deadly mission on Saturday night, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh revealed that the deed was going to be done as early as “this weekend”, thereby avoiding panic at the bourses.
Seymour explained why the attack was not carried out earlier in the week. “The delay has come at Trump’s insistence because the president wants the shock of the bombing to be diminished as much as possible by the opening of Wall Street trading on Monday.” Hersh was writing on Thursday.

The US leader has run a free jingle to encourage the desire for nuclear weapons among too many worried countries.

Given his insights into the US attack, the likely next steps in the assault on Iran can be readily discerned. A key aspect pertains to the perennially discussed American quest for regime change. All will be “under control” if Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei “departs”, according to an unnamed, longtime US official in Washington Hersh says he relies on.
He expressed his doubts about the quest. “Just how that might happen, short of [Khamenei’s] assassination, is not known. There has been a great deal of talk about American firepower and targets inside Iran, but little practical thinking, as far I can tell, about how to remove a revered religious leader with an enormous following.”
A brief dive into the history of the 1979 revolution and the regime that has sustained it for 45 years reveals a mixed outcome for the idea of assassinating Khamenei. Neocon lobbyists led by John Bolton have praised the B2 raids and are now hoping for the CIA and Mossad to step up with the help of what are seen as disgruntled ethnic minorities, the Azeris, Kurds, Baloch among others, to wage a civil war.
Police stations would be bombed according to the script to create a law-and-order crisis. However, it’s equally true that Iran’s ruling clerics have been through far worse, not at the hands of any ethnic minority, but through Persian opponents such as the late Maoist leader Masoud Rajavi and his Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) group. They had staged stunning attacks, including the blowing up of parliament in 1981.
 
 

The attack resulted in the deaths of several high-ranking officials, including president Mohammad Ali Rajai and prime minister Mohammad Javad Bahonar. An earlier bombing killed the charismatic chief justice Ayatollah Beheshti, considered second to Ayatollah Khomeini.
I was in Tehran in 1981 the day the MEK blew up the country’s telecommunications building at the Nasir Khusro Square. All contact with the outside world came to a standstill for days. Remember, Iran was fighting an American-backed Iraqi attack at the time, its troops enduring Saddam Hussein’s chemical weapons.
That experience makes Israel’s decapitating blitzkrieg of June 13, again with the help of MEK, not quite a jolt Iran was unprepared for. The assassinated military chiefs were quickly replaced, and there is a plan according to reliable Iran watchers for a new Supreme Leader when needed.
A far more worrying prospect for the world, not just for Iran, features in a book Seymour Hersh wrote in 1991. The Samson Option derives its name from the powerful Biblical hero who, though blinded by his enemies, brings down a massive temple filled with his tormentors, smashing its pillars with bare hands. Samson, too, succumbs in the bargain.
The idiom implies that, cornered by devastating missile attacks from Iran on extremely critical targets, Israel would take the nuclear route. The reckless urge would grow should Trump, under pressure from his MAGA supporters (and possibly President Vladimir Putin), tell his Zionist supporters that he had done what they had expected of him: defanging Iran by destroying its nuclear weapons hopes. Iran’s foreign minister is expected to discuss the terrifying possibility with Putin in Moscow and explore the hope of ending the war instead of escalating it by attacking US bases.
As for the prospect of regime change, Rajavi’s widow, Maryam, and the late Shah’s son are jockeying to take charge. The MEK is intensely hated as a traitor. And Raza Pahlavi is opposed by Israel. Why? The Shah of Iran had famously slammed the Israeli lobby’s control of the media, banks and financial institutions in the US. It was he who started Iran’s search for nuclear capabilities. The Khamenei leadership thus would seem the best bet against an Iranian bomb. However, that will require a fair and durable resolution of the Palestinian question.

Their key traits include callous intentions, disregard of ethics and the law, and a record of abuses.
Warlords have a long history. But this hitherto local threat has now morphed into a global one, posed — oddly enough — by modern states. America and Israel are separate states, but with near-identical aims. In fact, some see them as a conjoint, two-headed entity called ‘USrael’, which works in unison and vividly displays warlord-like traits despite their ‘championing’ of the law and ethics.
Unfortunately, the global arena today is as lawless as warlord zones, with aggressive powers such as the US, Russia, Israel, etc, violating weak global laws at will. ‘USrael’ has broken them most in attacking Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Libya, Syria and now Iran, with forays into Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. UN law lets states use force in self-defence, including pre-emptively against imminent attacks. But both the US and Israel have illegally expanded the law to use force for even minor or faraway threats that could have been tackled peacefully.
Israel could have foiled future Hamas attacks just by beefing up its border security and intelligence, which its media says had shortcomings. It could have even taken revenge via its illegal tactics of killing top foes at will. But it chose wild attacks on civilians, killing tens of thousands of people, but neither rescuing the hostages nor felling Hamas.
Many Israelis rejoice at the horrific and wretched misery of the Gazans beamed globally; even key Western leaders show inhuman apathy by backing Israel’s genocide, exposing the hypocrisy of their moral claims. The same is true for Iran now.
The US and IAEA officials do not have proof before them of Iran’s intent to acquire nukes. Even if Iran does, the aim would arguably be deterrence and not to use them against nuclear foes that can flatten the country in return. But both the US and Israel have attacked Iran to make it a failed state like Libya, as pointed out by many. And we naïvely nominated Trump for a Nobel prize as he was about to bomb our neighbour.

Success feeds evil ambition doubly fast.

Warlords thrive via pillage, and not fair competition and creativity. Once an economic titan, the US is now a second-rate industrial power against China. Its financial juggernaut still runs the world, but it has spawned inequality that rewards billionaires and supports instability, which harms the masses. Its science and military lead the world, but the science flexes its military muscles more than the economic ones. Thus, the US now thrives less via fair competition and creativity and more by bullying.
 
 

Israel plays the role of its able evil partner, which can act more quickly due to its small size and weaker democracy to undertake vile actions that the large and clumsy US itself cannot due to its bureaucratic and democratic constraints. In fact, Israel has now morphed into the main mastermind plotting the use of America’s huge powers to overcome foes, much like the less strong but seductive Rasputin, who mesmerised and controlled the mighty Russian empire, only to cause its fall.
 
 

Success feeds evil ambition doubly fast. If they defeat Iran, they may soon plot to bring down bigger foes such as Russia and China (and maybe the latter’s ‘all-weather’ friend and neighbour too); not militarily, obviously, but via new high-tech templates based on economic, intelligence and cyber sabotage.
China dwarfs the US industrially and in terms of America’s ruthless military-intelligence machine. It lacks the strategic intent and mu­­­­­scle to co-shape eve­­­nts globally, but still aims to rise economically within a US-led world. This gap between the two keeps China away from global dominance. Meanwhile, ugly American neo-conservatism is turning nastier fast and is bent on halting China’s rise unfairly. China, along with other anti-US states such as Russia, Iran and perhaps even South Africa, Brazil and its own ‘all-weather friend’, must create a bipolar world where US and its allies don’t run amok as global warlords.
This means mapping major American weaknesses, such as political gridlock, crumbling infrastructure, low education quality, twin deficits and debt, rampant greed and inequality, porous borders, a large army of aliens and the limited long-term intellect of its elites, to develop cutting-edge strategies to checkmate lawlessness. Otherwise, all states daring to irk the US can wait like sitting ducks for their turn to be swallowed like the hapless victims of a Komodo dragon.

Regarding the recent US-Israeli aggression against Iran, a similar pattern has been witnessed. Foreign ministers of the OIC states have issued the Istanbul Declaration after meeting in the Turkish city over the weekend, in which various questions were addressed, including the genocide in Gaza and the attack on Iran.
 






The document condemned the “destabilisation policies of Israel” with regard to Iran, Syria and Lebanon, while condemning “firmly” the Israeli assault on the Islamic Republic.
In a more circumspect tone, the OIC General Secretariat has expressed “concern” over America’s targeting of Iranian nuclear facilities on Sunday, adding that the US intervention is a “dangerous escalation”.
The fact is that such insipid statements will do little to stop the war on Iran, just as the OIC’s past pronouncements have done next to nothing to halt Israel’s slaughter in Gaza.
It must be acknowledged that the OIC brings together Muslim-majority states allied to various geopolitical camps and with diverse foreign policy agendas.
Some are beholden to West-led international financial institutions to stay afloat; others feel the American military umbrella will protect them from foes, real and imagined.
Yet, despite their respective foreign policy compulsions, it is highly unfortunate that the members of the ‘ummah’ cannot formulate a substantive response when it comes to matters of grave import, such as the ongoing Gaza massacre or aggression against a Muslim state.
 
 

The condemnation of Israel and the US should have been stronger for attacking Iran and creating the conditions for a regional conflagration. Today, Iran has been targeted; yesterday it was Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Libya and Yemen.
Tomorrow, it can be any other OIC member, especially if Israel is allowed to continue its mad rampage across the region, supported by the US and others in the Western bloc.
The bare minimum the OIC can do is to take firm action against the butchery of the Palestinian people and resist regime change in the Muslim world.
This can be achieved, for example, through economic boycotts and suspension of diplomatic relations with states that target Muslim populations, such as in occupied Palestine or those that initiate aggression against Muslim countries. Mealy-mouthed criticism will only embolden the aggressor.

India recently re-entered the international rice market after a two-year hiatus imposed to ensure domestic food security. The lifting of export bans by New Delhi generated considerable excitement in Indian media, which predicted a significant economic blow to Pakistan’s rice exports, which had been performing robustly in the interim.
 
 

For the three months preceding India’s return (July to September 2024), Pakistan’s rice exports averaged a strong 550,000 tonnes per month. Indian officials, trade bodies, and think tanks anticipated that a surge in cheaper Indian rice would undercut Pakistan’s global market share.
However, Pakistani exporters countered with a swift, quality-centric strategy, avoiding a direct price war and instead focusing on premium offerings. According to sector expert Hamid Malik, this approach paid off as India’s re-entry failed to significantly disrupt Pakistan’s rice trade in the following six months (October 2024 to March 2025).

New Delhi’s cheap rice strategy faces WTO heat, market blowback

Pakistan retained its foothold in high-end markets such as the United Kingdom and European Union while also serving price-sensitive African destinations through a calibrated quality approach. Data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics shows rice exports for the first 11 months of FY25 stood at 5.544 million tonnes, compared to 5.593m tonnes a year earlier — a marginal decline of just 0.87pc.
Falling production
Yet, a new challenge looms. A 3.7pc drop in rice output during Kharif 2024 has led to rapid depletion of stocks since April 2025. As a result, rice exports for the final quarter (April–June 2025) are projected to fall by around 15pc due to tight inventory.
Meanwhile, India continues to offer both Basmati and non-Basmati rice at what industry insiders describe as “throwaway” prices. At $349 per tonne (FOB), India is currently the cheapest exporter of 25pc broken non-Basmati rice — undercutting Thailand ($376), Vietnam ($362), and Pakistan ($365).
This aggressive pricing has raised eyebrows, given India’s government-set Minimum Support Price (MSP) for non-Basmati paddy stands at $265 per tonne. With a 66pc milling recovery, the ex-mill cost comes to $330 per tonne, and when factoring in transportation, port handling, packaging and wharfage — around $55 — the actual FOB cost is closer to $385. This discrepancy suggests deep, potentially WTO-incompatible subsidies.
In fact, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have lodged complaints with the World Trade Organisation (WTO), alleging that India’s export strategy violates the Doha Agreement by exceeding the allowed 10pc subsidy threshold.
Despite its subsidised push, India’s rice exports declined sharply in April and May 2025 — falling 50pc year-on-year. The downturn has drawn criticism from within India. Prominent voices such as rice historian and author Chandrasakhran, as well as exporters, have questioned the government’s policy, pointing to rice diversion for ethanol, swelling stocks at the Food Corporation of India (39m tonnes of rice and 19.5m tonnes of paddy), inefficiencies in the Public Distribution System, and the removal of the Minimum Export Price (MEP).
As global scrutiny of India’s subsidy-driven strategy intensifies, Pakistan’s exporters are cautiously monitoring developments — focused on safeguarding their gains through quality, adaptability, and disciplined market targeting.

Speaking during a budget session of the KP Assembly, chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, CM Gandapur alleged that the Centre was deliberately trying to delay the KP budget in an attempt to trigger a financial crisis in the province.
Consulting with the PTI founder on the KP budget was their democratic right, but despite repeated requests over 21 days, no meeting was arranged with Imran Khan, he regretted. “If you can’t arrange our meeting, then admit that this isn’t your government. Either acknowledge that someone else is running this  government or stop calling yourself democratic.”
CM Gandapur said a government could only be brought down under two conditions — financial instability and a deteriorating law and order situation. However, he said the PTI-led KP government had overcome financial hurdles despite repeated obstacles created by the Centre.
The chief minister lamented that drone attacks continued despite being repeatedly condemned on the floor of the house. “Since they have no other option left, they now want to stop us from passing the budget and declare a financial emergency in the province. We will never let them succeed in their conspiracies.”
Mr Gandapur alleged that the PTI was systematically attacked and that all state institutions and powers had jointly decided to eliminate Imran Khan and his party.
The chief minister alleged that PTI’s mandate was stolen in three provinces and at the federal level, and that no one was able to produce Form-45. He pointed out that the Rawalpindi commissioner had confessed to altering the results of the Feb 8, 2024, general elections.
He accused the members of political parties who were part of the interim government — and are now part of the federal government — of abusing power and targeting PTI candidates during the Feb 8 polls.
“They instructed ISI, MI, and the police to pick up their opponents. PTI candidates were abducted and tortured,” Mr Gandapur alleged, adding that he himself had been picked up before May 9, 2023 and was tortured to issue a statement against Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi.
Mr Gandapur also referred to the judges’ letters alleging pressure, saying that no action had been taken on those complaints. He reiterated that only Imran Khan had the authority to order the dissolution of the KP Assembly. “As soon as Mr Khan gives the order, I will not waste a moment and dissolve the assembly.”
Since PTI holds a majority in the KP Assembly, Mr Gandapur said, they reserved the right to amend the budget as per the directives of their party founder.
The chief minister added that the province had collected Rs65 billion from its own resources over 76 years. However, due to Mr Khan’s policies, KP’s revenue rose to Rs93bn and is projected to reach Rs129bn during the fiscal year 2025-26.
He criticised the federal government for failing to release Rs43bn under the Accelerated Impleme­ntation Programme for the merged districts, saying that only Rs6bn had been paid.

• Shipping and insurance costs could soar if key oil route shut, warn business leaders
• Global oil prices retreat 4pc
KARACHI: The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz — one of the world’s most critical oil transit chokepoints —could deal a devastating blow to Pakistan’s already fragile economy, with soaring production, shipping, and insurance costs threatening industrial output, exports, and employment.
Zubair Motiwala, Chairman of the Businessmen Group (BMG) and former CEO of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), warned that a shutdown of the Strait—located between Iran and Oman—would significantly disrupt supply chains. “Our imports of raw materials, 30 to 40pc of which pass through this route, would become prohibitively expensive, making continued production unsustainable,” he said.
 
 

Motiwala noted that freight markets were already strained due to the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict. He pointed to Iran’s parliament approving a move to close the Strait in retaliation for US strikes on its nuclear facilities, which he said could trigger a severe economic shock for oil-importing countries like Pakistan.
Crude oil prices slip
According to a Reuters report, global crude oil prices surprisingly dipped on Monday despite growing concerns over the possible closure of the Strait of Hormuz. Brent crude futures were down $2.91, or 3.8pc, at $74.09 a barrel by 1:13 p.m. ET (1713GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) eased $2.8, or 3.8pc, to $71.06.
Analysts attributed the decline to market expectations that a full-blown disruption was unlikely or could be temporary. However, traders and economists in Pakistan argue that even the threat of such a closure is enough to spike freight and insurance costs for the country, which heavily relies on oil imports and maritime trade.
“The impact is already visible. A shipment from China to Karachi that cost $1,250 per container earlier is now being quoted at $5,000,” said Motiwala. “This is simply devastating for business viability.”
He added that the European Union — Pakistan’s largest buyer of textiles and other goods — may no longer find Pakistani exports competitively priced due to the sharp rise in shipping and production costs.
Motiwala further warned that rising insurance premiums and disrupted raw material supply would halt factory operations, leading to widespread layoffs. “Our machines will stop. Hundreds of thousands of workers will be on the streets,” he said.
Business leaders expressed concern over the lack of preparedness among local industries. Many, they said, have not assessed the scale of disruption nor developed contingency plans for alternate supply routes.
Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Javed Bilwani stated that more time is needed to comprehend the consequences fully. “If the Strait is closed, the cost of doing business will skyrocket, especially if the Iran-Israel conflict escalates further,” he added.
The Ministry of Commerce has yet to issue an official statement on how the government intends to address the emerging crisis.
Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Senior Vice-President Saqib Fayyaz Magoon echoed these concerns. “About 30 to 40pc of our imports move through the Strait of Hormuz. If ships are forced to take longer routes to reach Karachi, both freight and insurance will surge dramatically,” he said, warning of a “highly volatile” outlook for business.
Several traders, when approached, admitted they were unaware of the full extent of the impact. Some said while the economy may survive the shock, economic growth would be stifled, leading to widespread job losses.
Others pointed out that the closure of the Strait could also choke off the Red Sea route, making access to West Asia and Europe prohibitively costly. “If that happens, inflation will spiral. Businesses will collapse. Import and export operations could grind to a halt,” said Motiwala.
He concluded with a grim warning: “Oil prices have already started creeping up. If the war escalates further, we are staring at unimaginable inflation and economic paralysis.”

• 20pc tax proposed on profits from investments in government securities
• FED of Rs10 imposed on one day-old chicks
• No changes to voluntary pension regime; tax on pensions won’t apply to commutation & gratuity amounts
ISLAMABAD: As the government announced a modest tax relief for the lower income slabs, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday introduced three new tax measures in the National Assembly to offset its revenue impact — part of the country’s ongoing commitment to remain within the fiscal parameters agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
In his winding-up speech, Mr Aurangzeb informed the National Assembly that the proposed measures aim to offset the revenue shortfall resulting from the tax relief, while ensuring that the industrial and commercial sectors are not subjected to additional burden.
As part of three new revenue measures, the government has proposed raising the tax rate on income derived from the debt portion of dividends issued by mutual funds to companies — from 25 per cent to 29pc. The revision aligns this category with the tax rate already applied to other corporate income streams.
A 20pc tax has been proposed on profits earned by corporations and companies through investments in government securities — underscoring the government’s broader objective of expanding credit access for the private sector.
Additionally, a federal excise duty (FED) of Rs10 has been imposed on one-day-old chicks, aimed at ensuring the poultry industry contributes its due share to national revenue.
Mr Aurangzeb stated that the government initially proposed reducing the tax rate from 5pc to 2.5pc for annual incomes between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million. However, following the prime minister’s directive, the rate was brought down to 1pc for this income bracket.
He also clarified a misperception stemming from his budget speech, where it was mistakenly inferred that the proposed tax on pensions would also apply to commutation and gratuity amounts. He said that that would not be the case. It was also clarified that there would be no changes in the taxation of voluntary pension scheme.
The minister said that the tax will only apply to individuals receiving annual pensions exceeding Rs10 million, while pensioners above the age of 75 are entirely exempt from any form of taxation.
He also informed the lower house that the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) powers related to tax fraud have been reassessed, in line with proposed amendments in the Finance Bill.
Under the revised framework, tax fraud cases are now classified as either ‘cognisable’ or ‘non-cognisable’. For cases involving alleged tax fraud of up to Rs500m, the FBR will no longer be empowered to make arrests without a court-issued warrant.
Furthermore, any arrest under this provision must meet at least one of the following criteria: the accused has deliberately failed to respond to three official notices; the individual has attempted to evade investigation; or there is evidence of record tampering.
The minister clarified that, even in such instances, arrest authorization will not rest with a single officer, rather must be approved by a three-member high-level committee within the FBR. Any individual taken into custody would have to be presented before a special judge within 24 hours.
Mr Aurangzeb also informed the National Assembly that the amount of sales tax proposed on solar power equipment had now been reduced to 10pc. However, he said, this tax will apply to only 46pc of imported components, resulting in a modest 4.6pc increase in the overall price of imported solar panels.
The original Finance Bill also proposed curbs on large asset purchases by undocumented individuals.
However, these restrictions will not apply to residential properties valued up to Rs50 million, commercial plots or properties up to Rs100 million, and vehicles priced up to Rs7 million.
Additionally, under existing law, capital gains tax will not be levied on the sale of property held for more than six years, provided the asset was acquired before July 1, 2024.
 
 

The minister said that such property will be subjected to 4.5-6pc withholding tax on purchase, which he said was generally reimbursed upon filing returns. To give relief, property that was in personal use for 15 years or more would not be subject to this withholding tax.
The government has proposed levying a sales tax on the import of raw cotton and yarn, in a bid to narrow the price disparity between imported and locally produced goods, while bolstering the domestic agriculture sector.

The move came as several Middle Eastern and international carriers suspended their operations across the Gulf region.
 






The announcement follows a closure of airspace by Qatar and Bahrain as Iran attacked the Al-Udeid US military base in Doha.
However, Qatar reopen­­ed its airspace early on Tuesday. Qatar Airways said that it had temporarily cancelled flights to and from Iraq, Iran and Syria.
 






Airspace over the UAE — a hub for airlines such as Emirates, Etihad and flydubai — is also closed based on flight paths and air traffic control audio, according to a post by FlightRadar.
Emirates said that it had temporarily suspen­ded flights to and from Tehran and Iraq (Baghdad and Basra) until June 30. Etihad said that it had cancelled flights between Abu Dhabi and Tel Aviv until July 15.
Flydubai said that it had temporarily suspended flights to and from Iran, Iraq, Israel and Syria until June 30.
Kuwait Airways also suspended flight departures from the country due to regional developments, it said in a post on X.
Russia’s Aeroflot said that it had cancelled flights between Moscow and Tehran, and made changes to other routes in the Middle East.
Lufthansa said that it had suspended all flights to and from Beirut until and including June 30 and to and from Tel Aviv and Tehran until and including July 31.
The Turkish airline Pega­sus said that it had cancelled flights to Iran until July 30 and flights to Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan until June 30.

The assembly session, presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, continued late into Monday night, concluding the debate on the budget.
During the session, opposition’s legislators urged the government to ensure an equitable distribution of PSDP funds for development schemes suggested by them.
They identified corruption as the province’s most significant challenge, warning that without effective controls, the substantial budget would be squandered.
“The biggest issue of the province is corruption and if corruption is not controlled, the biggest budget of the province would go to waste,” opposition members said.
Conversely, members of the treasury benches lauded the budget, asserting that its significant allocations would help alleviate the province’s backwardness. They refuted the opposition’s claims of non-consultation.
“CM Bugti had taken all coalition partners and opposition parties on board on the budget and provided more funds for the opposition members’ constituencies,” treasury members said.
They also noted it was “the first government against whom no protest was witnessed outside the assembly during the budget session”.
Former chief minister Dr Malik Baloch highlighted pressing provincial and international concerns.
“Iran is facing Israeli aggression and in this hard time Pakistan should extend all help to Iran [but] Pakistan should not jump into this war,” he said.
He identified corruption and price hikes critical domestic issues, noting that “in Turbat chicken is being sold at Rs1000 per kg”.
Dr Baloch said: “The government must take steps for controlling corruption. Otherwise the huge budget will be lost.”
He also addressed the issue of missing persons, saying:  “The missing persons issue is important and the state should play a positive role in resolving it and also release all arrested political leaders.”
Dr Baloch claimed schemes he proposed for the PSDP were excluded, calling it “unfair to the people of my constituency”.
 
 

Provincial Minister for Public Health Engineering Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran described the budget as “a balanced document”, affirming the government’s commitment to improving facilities in health, education, and other sectors.
Minister for Communication and Works Mir Saleem Khosa said: “No negative thing was included in the budget,” and added that “the government has provided more funds for the opposition constituencies”.
He further remarked that the current administration “had released 98 percent PSDP allocations before the end of financial year”.
Other members, including Mir Asghar Rind and Raheela Durrani, also characterised the budget as balanced, reiterating that the chief minister had engaged with all coalition partners and opposition parties during its preparation.

The session was marked by the absence of opposition lawmakers. A three-member ministerial committee sent by Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar to bring them in informed the House of their refusal to attend, resulting in the suspension of Question Hour and call-attention notices.
Raising a point of order, PML-N’s regional president Shah  Ghulam Qadir questioned under what legal or constitutional authority the House was debating a budget that had already been passed through suspension of rules. He contended that without a resolution or the finance committee’s report on the agenda, no further discussion was permissible.

Assembly session marked by absence of opposition lawmakers

Speaker Akbar supported Mr Qadir’s argument, saying there was no procedural basis for debate after approval.
Law Minister Mian Abdul Waheed, however, said that the rules had only been suspended for a day. He argued that since the finance bill was still under consideration and the prime minister had yet to deliver his budget speech, members retained the right to offer suggestions and feedback.
Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq also defended the session, saying the budget process was not yet final until the finance bill was passed. He asserted that the Assembly operated under both rules and parliamentary traditions and welcomed constructive input from all lawmakers.
“This House is governed by rules of procedure. Debate and dissent are integral to its function. Since only the two-day interval rule was suspended, there’s no bar on discussion now,” he said.
Mr Haq said that supplementary grants continued throughout the year and that valid proposals from lawmakers could still be incorporated. He stressed that both opposition and treasury members had equal access to development allocations and representation.
Mr Qadir responded that while his party was part of the coalition and its ministers had supported the budget in cabinet, it was his constitutional responsibility to highlight procedural violations.
“We’re not here to be pushed around. Majority doesn’t mean unbridled power. The Assembly must have a formal agenda,” he said.
He challenged the law minister to cite any article allowing debate on a post-approved budget, accusing the government of rushing the process for a third consecutive year. “This is not a democratic practice,” he said.
In response, PM Haq noted that in the absence of explicit provisions, the Speaker’s ruling carried authority and traditions helped fill procedural gaps.
“Both Mr Qadir and I have served as Speaker. We know how long a point of order can stretch,” he added.
Resolution on Islamabad airport
Meanwhile,  the House ‘unanimously’ passed a resolution tabled by Minister for  Social Welfare and Women Development, Syed Bazil Ali Naqvi, calling for the renaming of the New Islamabad International Airport after the late prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
Mr Naqvi argued that the previous Islamabad airport had been named after Ms Bhutto, and the removal of her name following the construction of the new facility was unjust.
“When an institution bears someone’s name, that should continue even after renovation or relocation,” he said.
His cabinet colleague Sardar Javed Ayoub supported the resolution, terming it timely, especially since Ms Bhutto’s 72nd birth anniversary was observed just two days ago.
The Speaker declared the resolution unanimously adopted and directed that its copies be sent to all national and provincial assembly speakers, the Senate chairman, and the prime minister. The session was then adjourned until Tuesday.

• Speaker briefly suspends proceedings; reconciliation on both sides saves members from punitive action
• FBR arrest powers restricted to tax frauds of over Rs50m
 • Non-filers allowed to buy homes worth Rs50m, cars worth Rs7m                              
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly session on Monday broke into a disarray as government and opposition members hurled abuses at each other, with some getting into physical brawls.
The rowdy scenes overshadowed the finance minister’s speech — to formally close the budget session — in which he announced several changes to budget proposals, including more checks on FBR’s powers to arrest tax defaulters and relaxation for non-filers to purchase assets.
The situation in the house became so tense that Speaker Ayaz Sadiq briefly suspended the session as his entreaties for restraint fell on deaf ears.
Sergeant-at-arms, the parliament’s security men, had to be called but they too failed to break the scuffles between angry opposition and government lawmakers.
The tempers in the house flared when opposition lawmakers interrupted the speech of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari over his remarks about jailed PTI founder Imran Khan.
In turn, the PPP lawmakers opposed the speaker’s decision to give the floor to leader of the opposition, Omar Ayub Khan.
The first altercation broke out between PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi and PML-N leader Hanif Abbasi amid loud protests and chants from both sides. The war of words soon turned physical with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle pushing and shoving each other near the speaker’s podium.
Speaker Sadiq warned members that such behaviour “would not be tolerated in the House”.
“This is a place for debate, not brawls,” he said while admonishing the lawmakers.
The second scuffle took place between PTI’s Nisar Jatt and PPP’s Agha Rafiullah after the former called Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s recent foreign visit a “junket for recreation and not for diplomacy”.
The sergeant-at-arms and deputy sergeant-at-arms who tried to separate the two members were allegedly abused and thrashed by some opposition lawmakers.
The irate speaker decided to punish four opposition lawmakers but decided not to after both sides held a two-hour-long meeting in his chamber, sources told Dawn.
Later, members from both sides of the aisle apologised for their remarks and actions.
FBR’s arrest powers
Amid the commotion, the finance minister announced the government has decided to restrict the arrest powers granted to FBR officers over alleged tax frauds. The powers, which allowed FBR officers to investigate tax fraud and make arrests, had made businesspersons and lawmakers apprehensive, who warned the excessive authority would be used to victimise taxpayers. 
As per the government’s proposal, assistant or deputy commissioners could arrest tax defaulters after seeking approval from the commissioner.
However, after opposition from businesspeople and lawmakers, the prime minister, last week, formed a committee to reevaluate the proposal.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told the house that under the new proposal, court warrants have been made a prerequisite for cases involving tax fraud of up to Rs50 million.
Even in such cases, arrests can only be made on three conditions: if the accused doesn’t join the inquiry after three notices; if the accused attempts to abscond; and tampers with evidence.
The arrests must also be approved by a three-member FBR committee with the accused presented before a special judge within 24 hours, ensuring protection against arbitrary detention and abuse of authority.
Relaxation for non-filers
The finance minister also announced that restrictions proposed on the purchase of assets by non-filers have been eased following the prime minister’s direction.
Now, non-filers will be able to purchase residential property worth up to Rs50m, commercial plots or properties worth up to Rs100m and vehicles worth up to Rs7m.
Additionally, under the existing law, capital gains tax will not apply to property sold after six years of purchase, provided it was bought before July 1, 2024.
However, it would be subject to a 4.5 to 6 per cent withholding tax on purchase, which he said was generally returned on filing returns.
He said the property in personal use for 15 or more years would not be subject to this withholding tax.
The minister also announced a collateral-free loan programme, offering credit of up to Rs1m to farmers owning up to 12.5 acres of land, to support the agriculture sector, especially small-scale farmers.
These loans will cover the costs of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, diesel and other essential inputs.
Health and crop insurance facilities will also be provided under the scheme.
The government will also introduce an electronic warehouse receipt system, allowing farmers to store crops securely and obtain better market prices, thereby contributing to national food security.
The minister also announced a 20-year loan scheme for low-income individuals to help them build or purchase houses.
Under the Women Inclusive Finance Programme, loans worth approximately Rs14bn have been provided to over 193,000 women.
In the coming year, another Rs14bn will be extended to women with support from the Asian Development Bank, announced Mr Aurangzeb.
On the tax imposed on e-commerce transactions, the minister said the move was aimed at rationalising the tax scheme and helping the industry to flourish. 
He further highlighted upcoming policy measures, including a new industrial policy, progress on the electric vehicle policy and comprehensive energy sector reforms aimed at achieving sustainable growth.
‘Distortion’ caused by EFS
Mr Aurangzeb said the export facilitation schemes announced in the past “unintentionally distorted market prices” of cotton as they allowed exporters to import raw materials without paying taxes and duties.
It disrupted the prices of domestically produced cotton and yarn, adversely affecting local farmers.
To address this imbalance, the government has proposed sales tax on the import of raw cotton and yarn to reduce the price gap between imported and local products.
He said the government has proposed a tax of Rs10 per broiler chick due to the poultry industry’s minimal tax contribution.
The Minister warned the ongoing tensions in the Middle East may affect regional economic stability but assured the house that the government was “closely monitoring developments”.

The proscription would put the pro-Palestinian group on a par with Hamas, Al Qaeda or IS under British law, making it illegal for anyone to promote it or be a member. Those who breached the ban could face up to 14 years in jail.
In its latest and most high-profile action, two of its members entered a Royal Air Force base in central England on Friday, spraying paint into the engines of the Voyager transport aircraft and further damaging them with crowbars.
“The disgraceful attack on Brize Norton … is the latest in a long history of unacceptable criminal damage committed by Palestine Action,” Home Secretary (interior minister) Yvette Cooper said in a written statement to parliament.
“The UKs defence enterprise is vital to the nations national security and this government will not tolerate those that put that security at risk.”
She said the group’s actions had become more aggressive and caused millions of pounds of damage.
Under British law, the home secretary can proscribe a group if it is believed it commits, encourages or “is otherwise concerned in terrorism”. The banning order will be laid before parliament on June 30 and will come into effect if approved.
Palestine Action, which says Britain is an “active participant” in the conflict in Gaza because of military support it provides to Israel, called the ban “an unhinged reaction”, and accused Cooper of making “categorically false claims”.

• Opposition slams budget as ‘anti-poor’
GILGIT: The Gilgit-Baltistan finance minister on Monday unveiled the region’s Rs148.63 billion budget for fiscal year 2025-26.
The budget was presented by Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate.
Addressing the session, Finance Minister Muhammad Ismail said Rs88.19bn has been allocated for non-development and Rs37bn billion for development expenditures.
As per the minister, the region will get Rs80bn in federal grant for the next financial year.
Moreover, Rs20bn has been allocated for the purchase of subsidised wheat. The size of Annual Development Plan will be Rs22bn, with Rs11bn allocated  for PSDP projects.
Moreover, Rs59.60bn has been allocated for the salaries of government employees; Rs28.29bn for service delivery and administrative matters, including health, education, basic facilities, peace and electricity supply; and Rs80 million for regional elections to be held in November.
Rs50m has been allocated for the health endowment fund.
The minister, Mr Ismail, said no funds have been allocated for new development projects in the next fiscal year to ensure the completion of ongoing schemes.
He claimed that for the first time, a coalition government in GB presented its second annual budget.
The aim of this budget is to esnure the welfare of people, he said, adding the government focused on health, education, power, local government and infrastructure development in the budget.
The region has limited revenue reso­urces and mostly relies on federal grants, the minister said, and stressed the need to increase revenue collection from local resources.
 
 

He said due to the region’s exemption status, the government can’t impose direct taxes.
Still, the revenue collection has increased by 45 per cent from last year, the minister claimed.
Despite financial difficulties and limited resources, GB is “on the path of development”.
According to the minister, Rs13.3m has been allocated for the rehabilitation of those affected by natural disasters. Rs45m will be spent on the benevolent fund and group insurance funds for the welfare of government employees.
Earlier, the opposition boycotted the budget session, calling the budget “anti-poor”.
Opposition Leader Kazim Mesum and other opposition members tore budget speech copies and chanted slogans against the government.

The government had decided to nominate Trump for the prestigious award to hail his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during last month’s Pak-India conflict, when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war with US mediation.
In a statement, it had highlighted that Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”, which ultimately secured a ceasefire.
However, after the US bombed Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, with Trump saying they were “totally obliterated”, leaders across the political spectrum joined citizens in voicing their reservations.
In the resolution dated today, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Senator Murtaza said, “The Senate of Pakistan urges the Federal Government to rescind and withdraw its decision recommending US President … after bombing Iran by the USA on the orders of its President in violation of international law, interfering in the sovereignty of Iran, resulting several casualties also, as one of the concern of human rights, disturbing the peace in the region.”
The JUI-F leader also submitted a motion under Rule 218. It said that the House may discuss the government’s recommendation for his “decisive diplomatic role” during the conflict “against the will of people of Pakistan without taking into confidence any House of Parliament”.
Earlier today, an emergency meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) reaffirmed Iran’s right to self-defence following the US airstrikes.
A press release from the Prime Minister’s Office said: “The committee strongly condemned Israel’s acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the US.
“These reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran’s right to self-defence as enshrined in the UN Charter.”
On Sunday, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman demanded that the government rescind its decision.
“President Trump’s claim of peace has proven to be false, the proposal for the Nobel Prize should be withdrawn,” Fazl told workers at a party meeting in Murree.</p><small>2025-06-23 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2322352984cd045.jpg?r=223606' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919442/what-are-the-main-us-military-bases-in-the-middle-east' target='_blank'><strong>What are the main US military bases in the Middle East?</strong></a><br><p>Iran on Monday struck a retaliatory missile attack targeting the American Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, while launching a missile operation called “Annunciation of victory” against US bases in Iraq and Qatar, according to Iran’s Tasnim news agency.
A day earlier, President Donald Trump said US air strikes “totally obliterated” Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.
The strikes drew threats from Tehran to retaliate, with US military installations in the region a potential target.
The following are significant US facilities in the Middle East:
Bahrain
Home to the headquarters of the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet, whose area of responsibility includes the Gulf, Red Sea, Arabian Sea and parts of the Indian Ocean.
Qatar
The 24-hectare Al Udeid Air Base, in the desert outside the capital Doha, is the forward headquarters for US Central Command, which directs US military operations in a huge swathe of territory stretching from Egypt in the west to Kazakhstan in the east. The Middle East’s largest US base houses around 10,000 troops.
Kuwait
Several sprawling military installations include Camp Arifjan, the forward headquarters of US Army Central and the Ali Al Salem Air Base, roughly 40 kilometres from the Iraqi border and known as “The Rock” for its isolated, rugged environment.
Camp Buehring was established during the 2003 Iraq War and is a staging post for US Army units deploying into Iraq and Syria, according to the US Army website.
United Arab Emirates
The Al Dhafra Air Base, situated south of UAE capital Abu Dhabi and shared with the UAE Air Force, is a critical US Air Force hub that has supported key missions against the Islamic State, as well as reconnaissance deployments across the region, according to the US Air Force Central Command.
Dubai’s Jebel Ali Port, while not a formal military base, is the US Navy’s largest port of call in the Middle East that regularly hosts US aircraft carriers and other vessels.
Iraq
The US maintains a presence at Ain Al Asad Air Base in western Anbar province, supporting Iraqi security forces and contributing to the Nato mission, according to the White House. Iranian missile strikes targeted the base in 2020, in retaliation for the US killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.
Situated in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq, Erbil Air Base serves as a hub for US and coalition forces conducting training exercises and battle drills. The base supports US military efforts by providing a secure location for training, intelligence sharing, and logistical coordination in northern Iraq, according to the congressional report.
Saudi Arabia
US soldiers in Saudi Arabia — which numbered 2,321 in 2024 according to a White House letter — operate in coordination with the Saudi government, providing air and missile defence capabilities and supporting the operation of US military aircraft.
Some are stationed roughly 60 kilometres south of Riyadh, at Prince Sultan Air Base, which supports US Army air defence assets including Patriot missile batteries and Terminal High Altitude Area Defence systems.
Jordan
Located in Azraq, 100 kilometres northeast of the capital Amman, the Muwaffaq al Salti Air Base hosts the US Air Forces Central’s 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing, which engages in missions across the Levant, according to a 2024 report in the Library of Congress.

New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
On April 24, Pakistan’s top brass had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country.
A revised notice to airmen (NOTAM) issued by the PAA today said, “[The] airspace closure for India has been extended for one month.”
The statement said that the airspace will remain closed until July 23.
“PAA maintains [the] ban on Indian airlines’ passenger and military aircraft from using Pakistan’s airspace,” it further said, adding that all Indian registered or leased aircraft will remain under the ban.
The two neighbouring nations closed their airspaces multiple times during the hostilities last month. Pakis­tan reopened its airspace for all types of flig­hts on May 10 after the ceasefire was announced.</p><small>2025-06-23 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2321012271fe1ca.jpg?r=210127' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919419/following-new-visa-rules-us-embassy-in-india-asks-students-to-make-social-media-public' target='_blank'><strong>Following new visa rules, US embassy in India asks students to make social media public</strong></a><br><p>Following new visa rules by the Trump administration, the United States Embassy in India on Monday asked all applicants for F, M, or J nonimmigrant visas to make their social public accounts public for vetting.
US President Donald Trump’s administration on Wednesday ordered the resumption of student visa appointments but significantly tightened its social media vetting in a bid to identify any applicants who may be hostile towards the country, according to an internal State Department cable reviewed by Reuters.
US consular officers are now required to conduct a “comprehensive and thorough vetting” of all student and exchange visitor applicants to identify those who “bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles”, said the cable, which was dated June 18 and sent to US missions on Wednesday.
 
 

In a post on X today, the US Embassy in India said: “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the US under US law.”
It added that since 2019, the US had required visa applicants to provide social media identifiers on immigrant and nonimmigrant visa application forms.
“We use all available information in our visa screening and vetting to identify visa applicants who are inadmissible to the US, including those who pose a threat to US national security.”
 






F and M are different student visa types, while the J visa is a nonimmigrant visa for individuals approved to participate in exchange visitor programmes in the US.
On May 27, the Trump administration ordered its missions abroad to stop scheduling new appointments for student and exchange visitor visa applicants, saying the State Department was set to expand social media vetting of foreign students.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said updated guidance would be released once a review was completed.
The June 18 dated cable, which was sent by Rubio and sent to all US diplomatic missions, directed officers to look for “applicants who demonstrate a history of political activism, especially when it is associated with violence or with the views and activities described above, you must consider the likelihood they would continue such activity in the US”.
The cable, which was first reported by Free Press, also authorised the consular officers to ask the applicants to make all of their social media accounts public.
“Remind the applicant that limited access to … online presence could be construed as an effort to evade or hide certain activity,” the cable said.
The move follows the administration’s enhanced vetting measures last month for visa applicants looking to travel to Harvard University for any purpose, in what a separate State Department cable said would serve as a pilot programme for wider expanded screening.
Online presence
The new vetting process should include a review of the applicant’s entire online presence and not just social media activity, the cable said, urging the officers to use any “appropriate search engines or other online resources”.
During the vetting, the directive asks officers to look for any potentially derogatory information about the applicant.
“For example, during an online presence search, you might discover on social media that an applicant endorsed Hamas or its activities,” the cable says, adding that this may be a reason for ineligibility.
Rubio, Trump’s top diplomat and national security adviser, has said he has revoked the visas of hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, including students, because they got involved in activities that he said went against US foreign policy priorities.
Those activities include support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel’s conduct in the conflict in Gaza.
A Tufts University student from Turkiye was held for over six weeks in an immigration detention centre in Louisiana after co-writing an opinion piece criticising her school’s response to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. She was released from custody after a federal judge granted her bail.
Trump’s critics have said the administration’s actions are an attack on free speech rights under the First Amendment of the US Constitution.
Fewer appointments?
While the new directive allows posts to resume scheduling for student and exchange visa applicants, it warns the officers that there may have to be fewer appointments due to the demands of more extensive vetting.
“Posts should consider overall scheduling volume and the resource demands of appropriate vetting; posts might need to schedule fewer FMJ cases than they did previously,” the cable said, referring to the relevant visa types.
The directive has also asked posts to prioritise among expedited visa appointments of foreign-born physicians participating in a medical programme through exchange visas, as well as student applicants looking to study in a US university where international students constitute less than 15 per cent of the total.
At Harvard, the oldest and wealthiest US university, on which the administration has launched a multifront attack by freezing its billions of dollars of grants and other funding, foreign students last year made up about 27pc of the total student population.
The cable is asking the overseas posts to implement these vetting procedures within five business days.</p><small>2025-06-23 16:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/23205351cac1677.jpg?r=210619' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919418/fo-condemns-damascus-church-bombing-as-death-toll-climbs-to-25' target='_blank'><strong>FO condemns Damascus church bombing as death toll climbs to 25</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday strongly condemned a suicide bombing in Damascus the day prior, as the death toll from the attack rose to 25.
At least 20 people were killed and dozens injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the Mar Elias Church in the Dweila neighbourhood of the Syrian capital Damascus on Sunday, health authorities and security sources said.
In a statement issued today, the FO said: “Pakistan strongly condemns the heinous suicide bombing at the Mar Elias Church in the Dweila neighbourhood of Damascus, Syria, on June 22, 2025, which resulted in the loss of precious lives and left many injured.
“Pakistan stands in full solidarity with the brotherly people of Syria in this hour of grief, and reaffirms its strong support for efforts aimed at achieving lasting peace and stability in the country.”
 






Meanwhile, Syria’s state news agency SANA reported that the death toll rose to 25. The agency cited the country’s health ministry.
Syria’s interior ministry on Sunday said the suicide bomber was a member of the banned militant Islamic State grpup. “He entered the church, opened fire and then detonated his explosive vest,” a ministry statement added.
It was the first suicide bombing in Damascus since Bashar al-Assad was toppled by a rebel insurgency in December.</p><small>2025-06-23 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2320111403b88f9.jpg?r=201311' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919412/bangladesh-probe-into-hasina-era-abuses-warns-impunity-remains' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh probe into Hasina-era abuses, warns ‘impunity’ remains</strong></a><br><p>A Bangladesh government-appointed commission investigating hundreds of disappearances by the security forces under ousted premier Sheikh Hasina on Monday warned that the same “culture of impunity” continues.
The Commission of Inquiry into Enforced Disappearances is probing abuses during the rule of Hasina, whose government was accused of widespread human rights abuses.
That includes the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of political opponents and the unlawful abduction and disappearance of hundreds more.
The commission was established by interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 84, who is facing intense political pressure as parties jostle for power ahead of elections expected early next year.
Bangladesh has a long history of military coups and the army retains a powerful role.
 
 

“Enforced disappearances in Bangladesh were not isolated acts of wrongdoing, but the result of a politicised institutional machinery that condoned, normalised, and often rewarded such crimes,” the commission said, in a section of a report released by the interim government on Monday.
“Alarmingly, this culture of impunity continues even after the regime change on August 5, 2024”.
The commission has verified more than 250 cases of enforced disappearances spanning the 15 years that Hasina’s Awami League was in power.
Commission chief Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury said earlier this month that responsibility lay with individual officers, who were “involved in conducting enforced disappearances”, but not the armed forces as an institution.
Earlier this month, a joint statement by rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, called on the security forces to “fully cooperate with the commission by guaranteeing unfettered and ongoing access to all detention centres … and providing free access to records regarding those seized or detained”.
Hasina era ex-election chief detained
Meanwhile, A Bangladesh court on Monday remanded in custody the former elections chief for his alleged role in rigging the vote in favour of Hasina.
KM Nurul Huda, 77, was ordered to be detained for four days while questioning continues, a day after a mob, who smashed into his home and assaulted him, eventually handed him over to the police.
On Sunday, the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) filed a case against Huda and other former election commissioners it accuses of rigging past polls in favour of Hasina.
Hours after the case was filed, a mob stormed Huda’s home in the capital, Dhaka and dragged him onto the street. They put a garland of shoes around his neck and beat him up before handing him over to the police.
The interim government condemned the incident and urged people not to take the law into their own hands.

“Swooping on an accused and physically assaulting him is illegal, contrary to the rule of law, and a criminal offence,” the statement read.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus has said elections will be held in early April 2026.
Police put a helmet on Huda while taking him to the court for his protection.
Human rights organisations also condemned the attack on Huda.
“It was a complete violation of … the rule of law,” Abu Ahmed Faijul Kabir from the rights group Ain O Salish Kendra said in a statement.
Hasina, 77, remains in self-imposed exile in India, where she fled after she was ousted last year.
She has defied orders to return to Dhaka to face charges amounting to crimes against humanity. Her trial in absentia continues.</p><small>2025-06-23 15:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/231838553869c9b.jpg?r=184026' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919392/fm-dar-arrives-in-uae-to-lead-12th-jmc-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar arrives in UAE to lead 12th JMC meeting</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday arrived in the UAE for the upcoming 12th session of the Pakistan-UAE Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC) to be held in Abu Dhabi.
The 12th session of Pak-UAE JMC is being held following a hiatus of 13 years after it was scheduled in October 2024. The last session was held in Islamabad from 6-7 November 2013.
According to a statement by the Foreign Office (FO), Dar will lead the Pakistan delegation to the meeting scheduled on June 24.
“The JMC serves as the highest institutionalised platform for bilateral cooperation between Pakistan and the UAE. The upcoming session will take forward the agenda of deepening strategic, economic and development cooperation between the two brotherly countries,” the statement said.
It said that the delegation “will comprise secretaries and senior officials from key ministries including Economic Affairs, Commerce, Energy, Maritime Affairs and Interior”.
“The UAE side will be led by Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, along with high-level representation from relevant Emirati institutions,” it added.
FO also said that the session will discuss progress across different areas of bilateral cooperation and explore new avenues for collaboration in trade, investment, energy, infrastructure development and IT.
“A number of legal instruments are expected to be finalised during the session to institutionalise sectoral cooperation.”
The statement added, “The session will provide an important opportunity for both sides to align their economic priorities and unlock the potential of enhancing [the] scope of mutually beneficial partnership.”
Dar also wrote on X that he had reached the UAE to lead Pakistan’s delegation at the JMC meeting.
The UAE is Pakistan’s third-largest trading partner after China and the United States, is home to more than a million Pakistani expatriates, and is the second-largest source of remittances to the South Asian country after Saudi Arabia.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE, Faisal Tirmizi, had said that the bilateral trade between Pakistan and the UAE exceeded US$10.9 billion in the fiscal year 2023–24, including goods and services.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during his official one-day visit to the Gulf state, where he discussed matters of bilateral and regional interest.
The high-level engagement aimed at reaffirming Pakistan’s gratitude to friendly nations that supported Islamabad’s position during its recent standoff with New Delhi.</p><small>2025-06-23 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/23192604eb34cc0.jpg?r=192822' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919403/oman-moves-to-become-first-gulf-state-to-impose-personal-income-tax' target='_blank'><strong>Oman moves to become first Gulf state to impose personal income tax</strong></a><br><p>Oman issued a royal decree to become the first country in the Gulf to impose a personal income tax, its tax authority said on Sunday, as the small oil producer works to diversify its revenue stream.
Oman, among the smaller Gulf economies, launched a medium-term fiscal programme in 2020 to reduce public debt, diversify revenue sources and spur economic growth, which has improved public finances.
The sultanate, which still remains largely reliant on oil revenue, will impose a five per cent tax on taxable income for individuals earning over 42,000 Omani rials ($109,091) per year starting from 2028, according to the decree.
“The law also includes deductions and exemptions that take into account the social situation in the Sultanate of Oman, such as education, healthcare, inheritance, zakat, donations, primary housing,” the country’s tax authority said in a statement.
According to the state-run Oman News Agency (ONA), the plan also contributes to the objectives of Oman Vision 2040 by diversifying income sources and reducing reliance on oil revenues, with targets of 15pc of GDP by 2030 and 18pc by 2040.
The Gulf country added that the tax would apply to about 1pc of the population.
The Omani tax authority stated that the implementation of the tax “follows an in-depth study assessing its economic and social impact, based on income data from various government entities”, according to ONA.
Meanwhile, observers said that the introduction of income tax signalled economic maturity.
“That the rate is competitive internationally will ensure that Oman remains a country of choice for international professionals,” said David Daly, a partner at Gulf Tax Accounting Group, speaking to Gulf publication The National.</p><small>2025-06-23 14:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/231451590493a27.gif?r=145210' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360/met-office-forecasts-nationwide-monsoon-rains-from-june-25' target='_blank'><strong>Met Office forecasts nationwide monsoon rains from June 25</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast monsoon rain across the country from Wednesday, June 25, the weather agency said in a statement.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia’s nearly two billion people.
According to the Met Office, “moist currents are penetrating upper and central parts of the country and likely to become intensified in next couple of days.”
“A westerly wave is expected to approach upper parts on June 25 and likely to become significant on June 26,” it said.

Landslides may cause roads closure in the vulnerable hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Murree, Galliyat, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan during the wet spell, it added.
Heavy downpour and windstorm, and lightning may affect daily routines, and may damage weak structures like roofs and walls of houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels during the forecast period, it said.
It advised farmers are advised to manage their activities keeping in view the weather forecast, and urged travelers and tourists to remain extra cautious and plan their travel according to weather conditions and avoid any untoward situation.
Pre-monsoon rains in Punjab
Earlier in the day, pre-monsoon rains were recorded in various districts of Punjab in the last 24 hours, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
A statement from the PDMA spokesperson said, “37 mm of rain was recorded in the Lahore Airport area, while 4 mm of rain was recorded in the rest of the city.”
The statement added that Noorpur Thal received 29 mm of rain, Shamsabad in Rawalpindi 14 mm, Gujranwala 28 mm, Sialkot 11 mm, Mianwali 10 mm, Hafizabad 9 mm, Sargodha 5 mm, and 1 mm each in Jhang, Joharabad, Gujrat and Kasur.

After months of attacking Gaza — flattening homes, targeting hospitals, and starving a besieged population — Israel expanded its assault by launching wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences on June 13, killing top commanders, scientists and civilians. A day earlier, President Donald Trump said US air strikes  “totally obliterated” Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.
The strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which came four days after Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir’s meeting with Trump and a day after the government said it decided to formally recommend Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his role during the recent conflict with India, were condemned by Pakistan. A meeting of the NSC,  the highest forum for security deliberations comprising the civil and military top brass, was subsequently convened.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired the meeting, with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir also attending the important moot, and reviewed the evolving regional situation following the Israeli aggression against Iran.
 






Sources in the Prime Minister’s Office had told Dawn that Field Marshal Munir would brief the committee on the details of his meeting with Trump.
A press release from the Prime Minister’s Office said: “The committee strongly condemned Israel’s acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the US. These reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran’s right to self-defence as enshrined in the UN Charter.”
The committee members also conveyed their condolences to the Iranian government and people on the loss of innocent lives and offered prayers for the recovery of those injured.
“While reiterating Pakistan’s stated position, the NSC expressed grave concern over the potential for further escalation after the attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan on June 22 which violated the resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency, relevant international law and the UN Charter.”
The committee members also reaffirmed Pakistan’s close engagement with relevant parties in the situation and endorsed the government’s readiness to continue efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting regional peace and stability.
The NSC called on all relevant parties to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in line with the UN Charter, underscoring the need to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian laws.
 






The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel first struck the country, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently denied the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran said it was “resolved to defend Iran’s territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force”. It also responded with a volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people in Tel Aviv.</p><small>2025-06-23 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2316012325fceb6.jpg?r=165505' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919373/karachi-police-to-investigate-threats-to-boxer-aliya-soomro-assure-her-of-protection' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Police to investigate threats to boxer Aliya Soomro, assure her of protection</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi Police ordered an investigation on Monday of alleged threats being made to boxer Aliya Soomro.
Earlier this year, Soomro became the first Pakistani woman to win a world boxing title. She knocked out her opponent from Thailand in just 45 seconds in Bangkok to claim victory in the WBA Asia 105-pound category.
A day ago, Soomro issued a video statement on her Instagram account, saying that she and her family were being harassed by an alleged facilitator of the Lyari gang war who was impersonating a media worker.
“Don’t drag me into political and ethnic disputes and conflict between boxing institutions. Why is the entire machinery being used against me? My family and I are facing life threats,” she said.
Soomro alleged that certain elements were “spreading unfounded information” against her, expressing fear that she could be physically harmed.  She appealed to the Sindh police chief and other officials for protection and legal assistance.

A statement issued today from the office of South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said he took immediate notice and ordered City Senior Superintendent of Police Arif Aziz to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter and take legal action against those involved.
“South Zone Police contacted Alia Soomro and assured her of full cooperation,” the statement said.
“Boxer Aliya Soomro is a representative and a shining example of the courageous women of Pakistan. Women have the right to move forward in every field of life. The police will provide all possible protection to Aliya Soomro,” the statement quoted DIG Raza as saying.

Since Trump joined Israel’s campaign by dropping massive bunker-buster bombs on Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday morning, Tehran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate.
But while it has continued to fire missiles at Israel, it has yet to take action against the United States itself, either by firing at US bases or by targeting the 20 per cent of global oil shipments that pass near its coast at the mouth of the Gulf.
“Mr Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,” Ebrahim Zolfaqari, spokesperson for Iran’s Khatam al-Anbiya central military headquarters, said on Monday in English at the end of a recorded video statement.
 






Iran and Israel traded another wave of air and missile strikes on Monday as the world braced for Tehran’s response.
Trump’s administration has repeatedly said that its aim is solely to destroy Iran’s nuclear programme, not to open a wider war.
But in a social media post on Sunday, Trump openly spoke of toppling the hardline clerical rulers who have been Washington’s principal foes in the Middle East since Iran’s 1979 revolution.
“Its not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,’ but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldnt there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!” he wrote.
 


Experts surveying commercial satellite imagery said it appeared that the US attack had severely damaged the site of Iran’s Fordow nuclear plant, built inside a mountain, and possibly destroyed it and the uranium-enriching centrifuges it housed, although there was no independent confirmation.
Trump called the strike a “Bullseye!!!”.
“Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran,” he wrote. “The biggest damage took place far below ground level.”
 


More Israeli strikes
Israel’s airstrikes on Iran have met little resistance from Iranian defences since Israel launched its surprise attack on June 13, killing many of Iran’s top commanders.
The Israeli military said on Monday that about 20 jets had conducted a wave of strikes against military targets in western Iran and Tehran overnight. In Kermanshah, in western Iran, missile and radar infrastructure was targeted, and in Tehran a surface-to-air missile launcher was struck, it said.
Iranian news agencies reported air defences had been activated in central Tehran districts, and Israeli air strikes had hit Parchin, the location of a military complex southeast of the capital.
Iran says more than 400 people have been killed in the Israeli attacks, mostly civilians, but has released few images of the damage since the initial days of the bombing. Tehran, a city of 10 million people, has largely emptied, with residents fleeing to the countryside to escape attacks.
Iran’s retaliatory missile strikes on Israel have killed 24 people, all civilians, and injured hundreds, the first time a significant number of Iranian missiles have ever penetrated Israeli defences.
The Israeli military said a missile launched from Iran in the early hours of Monday had been intercepted by Israeli defences. Air raid sirens blared overnight in Tel Aviv and other parts of central Israel.
Limited retaliation
Beyond those missiles, Iran’s ability to retaliate is far more limited than a few months ago, since Israel inflicted defeat on Iran’s most feared regional proxy force, Hezbollah in Lebanon, whose downfall was swiftly followed by that of Iran’s most powerful client ruler, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad.
Iran’s most effective threat to hurt the West would probably be to restrict global oil flows from the Gulf. Oil prices spiked on Monday at their highest since January. But they have not yet shot up to crisis levels, indicating that traders see a path out of the conflict that avoids serious disruption.
Brent crude futures were down 0.5pc to $76.64 a barrel as of 8:30am GMT (1:30pm PKT), after briefly jumping above $80 at the opening.
Iran’s parliament has approved a move to close the Strait of Hormuz that leads into the Gulf, which would require approval from the Supreme National Security Council, a body led by an appointee of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Attempting to strangle the strait could send global oil prices skyrocketing, derail the world economy and invite conflict with the US Navy’s massive Fifth Fleet that patrols the Gulf from its base in Bahrain.
“It’s economic suicide for them if they do it. And we retain options to deal with that,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
As Tehran weighed its options, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi was expected to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow today. The Kremlin has a strategic partnership with Iran, but also close links with Israel.
Speaking in Istanbul yesterday, Araqchi said his country would consider all possible responses and there would be no return to diplomacy until it had retaliated. TASS news agency later quoted him as saying Iran and Russia were coordinating their positions.</p><small>2025-06-23 10:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/24092902c0a4596.jpg?r=092912' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919329/either-india-shares-water-fairly-or-we-will-secure-it-from-all-6-rivers-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>Either India shares water fairly or we will secure it from ‘all 6 rivers’: Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>Former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Monday said India has the option to either share water fairly or “we will deliver water to us from all six (Indus river system) rivers”.
Delhi unilaterally suspended its participation in the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their worst fighting in decades.
The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday had slammed Indian Home Minister Amit Shah’s “brazen disregard” for international agreements after the latter said New Delhi would never restore the IWT with Pakistan.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Speaking in the National Assembly during a session on the federal budget, Bilawal said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will deliver water to us from all six rivers.”
“The attack on Sindhu [Indus River] and India’s claim that the IWT has ended and it’s in abeyance, firstly, this is illegal, as the IWT is not in abeyance, it is binding on Pakistan and India, but the threat itself of stopping water is illegal according to the UN charter,” the former foreign minister said.
He continued that if India decides to follow through on the threat, we will have to wage war again.
 
 

He added that hopefully Pakistan won’t have to, but if it does have to, it is in the position to defeat India the same way it just did.
Bilawal further told lawamkers that peace between the two nuclear neighbours is impossible without cooperation, especially in counterterrorism efforts. “If India and Pakistan refuse to talk, and if there is no coordination on terrorism, then violence will only intensify in both countries,” he warned.
He said India was weaponising terrorism for political purposes. “India seeks to exploit terrorism as a political tool to harm Pakistan’s international standing,” he said, adding that during his diplomatic visits to the United Kingdom and European Union as foreign minister, it became evident that India had lobbied hard to reverse Pakistan’s progress on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) front.
“At a time when Pakistan had successfully moved from the FATF grey list to the white list, India made every effort to drag us back to the grey list using false narratives and diplomatic pressure,” he said. “But thanks to our Foreign Office, the prime minister, and his team, those efforts failed. Once again, Pakistan won — and India lost.”
Bilawal also urged renewed dialogue between Pakistan and India to curb regional instability. He added, “We are fighting not only for the public of Pakistan but also of India as well.”
He strongly criticised what he called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dangerous doctrine of escalation. “Under Modi’s new ‘abnormal’, any terrorist incident in India becomes an automatic pretext for launching hostilities against Pakistan,” Bilawal warned.
He questioned what would happen if Pakistan were to adopt the same policy. “We suffer from terrorist attacks ten times more than India, many of which are traced back to Indian funding or involvement. Should we then adopt a policy of automatic retaliation, too? That would mean surrendering our future to the will of terrorists.
“That might be Modi’s vision, but it is not ours. We will not let terrorists dictate regional peace,” he declared.
Last week, addressing a crowd of supporters, Bilawal had said that New Delhi must accept the IWT. Pakistan’s narrative had prevailed, not only in diplomatic circles, but also across international media, he claimed.
Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned India’s unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a “blatant violation and act of water aggression”, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.</p><small>2025-06-23 09:25</small></div><hr>
