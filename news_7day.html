Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi has taken oath on October 15 but since then the provincial government has been functioning without cabinet.
He has said time and again that he would announce names of his team members with the consultation of Imran Khan.
 
 

On the second day of his oath-taking, Mr Afridi rushed to Adiala Jail to meet his incarcerated ‘boss’ and take instructions from him about future line of action but he was not allowed to meet him.

Provincial govt working without cabinet since Oct 15; participants of a recent party meeting say protest march on Islamabad to be ‘last option’ for Imran’s release

Sources in PTI told this scribe that some leaders of the party told Mr Afridi during a recent meeting that ‘corrupt’ ministers and ‘people with bad reputation’ should be kept away from the new cabinet.
The meeting was also attended by PTI provincial president MNA Junaid Akbar Khan, general secretary Ali Asghar, central leader and former speaker of National Assembly Asad Qaiser, MNAs Atif Khan and Shahram Tarakai and former finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra.
Sources said that during the meeting, it was discussed that fair people should be inducted in the new cabinet.
It is pertinent to mention here that making frequent changes in the previous cabinets of the PTI governments in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained its hallmark.
Recently ministers for elementary and secondary education department and public health engineering department resigned from Ali Amin Gandapur’s team while the ministers of several other departments were reshuffled.
Besides formation of new cabinet, sources said, the release of Imran Khan from jail and volatile law and order situation were also discussed in the meeting.
They said that the new chief minister and party leadership discussed in detail how to resolve the issue of law and order situation and bring peace in the province.
They said that they discussed in detail prospects about the release of Imran Khan. When asked whether PTI would march on Islamabad by the end of November, sources said that the date was not decided yet.
They said that protest march on Islamabad would be the last option with PTI and before the march, the party would take other steps for the release of Imran Khan.
Sources said that election of Sohail Afridi as chief minister was an indication to deal things with the federal government and powers that be with aggression. They said that all organisations of PTI were fully supporting their new chief minister.
In another development which took place on Sunday, PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan directed general secretary Ali Asghar to issue show-cause notices to district presidents for not holding protest demonstrations against the alleged killing of workers of Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan. PTI founder Imran Khan had given the call to stage protest demonstrations at district level on Friday last.
Sources said that most of the district organisations of PTI staged protests while reportedly several of them did not obey the directives of Imran Khan.
A senior PTI leader told Dawn that strict action should be taken against such district presidents because holding demonstrations was not a big task rather the protest was peaceful and there were no probabilities of registration of FIRs and any other action against them by police or government.

• Officials say Ajrak-themed plates for those who applied in June are ready
• Claim over 50,000 plates lying uncollected at Civic Centre
KARACHI: As the deadline for vehicle owners to obtain new number plates draws near, those who applied months ago are thronging the Civic Centre to collect their retro-reflective plates, only to be returned disappointed due to a backlog of at least four months.
Many of these people had appl­ied months ago for the replacement of their old number plates with the new Ajrak-themed ones. However, they had to return empty-handed from the offices of the Excise and Taxation Depar­tment after being informed that their plates had not yet been delivered.
During visits to the Civic Centre and Executive Centre in Clifton, Dawn saw a large number of people arriving either to collect their number plates — those who had applied after January — or to complete the process of transfer of ownership.
Officials and visitors said the main reason for the rush was the deadline announced by the Excise Department, which expires on Oct 31.
However, if not extended, acco­rding to the department, both the buyer and seller will be required to appear in person at the centre for biometric verification to complete the transfer process.
An excise official told Dawn that number plates for vehicle owners who had applied for replacements by June have either been delivered to the respective centres or collected by vehicle owners. However, he said that over 50,000 plates were still lying uncollected at the Civic Centre.
“I had applied for the number plate in January but have come to collect it now,” said a vehicle owner waiting for his turn to collect new Ajrak-themed number plates at the centre.
He acknowledged that he had already received a message from the excise department, but only decided to obtain the plate after learning that the traffic police would begin issuing challans from the last week of October against vehicles not affixed with new number plates.
However, another vehicle owner, who had also come to collect his number plate, claimed that he had not received any message from the department. He said he was informed by a traffic police officer during a routine check that his number plate had already been delivered to the centre.
“I had applied two months ago for ownership transfer and for the replacement with the new Ajrak-featured plate, but while the file has been received, the number plate has still not arrived,” a vehicle owner said.
Number of applicants surges to 10,000: official
A senior official in the department told Dawn that number pla­t­es for those who had applied for replacements by June had already been delivered to the centres or collected by the respective vehicle owners. Without giving a specific time frame, he claimed that the remaining backlog would be cleared soon.
He also claimed there was no backlog in the issuance of Ajrak-featured number plates for newly registered vehicles.
The official said that while around 300 to 400 applications or receipts were being received daily initially, the number has now surged to over 10,000 per day. Complaining about the situation, he added that more than 50,000 plates remain uncollected, causing “space constraints at the centre”.
He further said that over 650 new Ajrak-featured number plates were being delivered to the centre daily.
Responding to a question about what applicants should do if their replacement plates have not yet been delivered, the official said they are required to visit the centre.
“If their number plates have not been delivered, a stamp reading ‘number plate not issued’ will be placed on their receipt,” he explained.

In video after video, we have seen not only the depredations and war crimes of Israeli forces, but also the joy and pride on the faces of the genocidaire soldiers and the generals and government officials who direct their actions. For the vast majority of us, these images cannot be viewed with anything other than revulsion and disgust; it’s the most human of instincts to feel sympathy for Israel’s victims and rage against the unrepentant perpetrators.
But when Israel and its supporters look out at this new world, they don’t see that all this fury is caused by their actions; instead, they blame ‘antisemitism’, a tropey accusation that has long since lost its sting, and they point to social media — and in particular TikTok — for spreading anti-Israel sentiments. It’s not the atrocities that make us so hated, they believe, it’s the algorithms. And so, the thinking goes, if we can bully, buy or otherwise control social media platforms the way we control the bulk of mainstream Western media, anti-Israel sentiment could be managed. If we scrub the digital archives of our genocide, then it will be forgotten. And this is exactly what they’re doing.
First, they came for TikTok, and with good reason; Northeastern University conducted a study on pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli messaging on TikTok in the immediate aftermath of Oct 7. They found that there were 170,430 pro-Palestinian posts while pro-Israel posts numbered 8,843. But as we all should know, it’s not just about volume but about engagement too, and here we see that there were 236 million views for pro-Palestinian posts and a comparatively measly 14m for pro-Israel posts.
And in the following two years, the trend has not reversed but has in fact become progressively more and more pro-Palestinian. In fact, while pro-Israel posts and views spiked immediately after Oct 7, as a reaction to the event and then started to decline (as is typical of posts related to a major development), the pro-Palestinian posts are increasing in the pattern one ascribes to a sustained and broad-based movement.

Netanyahu is already celebrating.

Zionists identified this issue early on with Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of America’s Anti-Defamation League saying in a leaked audio “we have a TikTok problem, a Gen Z problem”, which needed to be solved. In typical Zionist fashion, they did so by manipulating the levers of US politics and throwing money at the problem. Suddenly a campaign started in the US accusing the Chinese government of manipulating TikTok’s algorithm and of accessing the private data of American users and demanding that TikTok’s American operations be sold off. It was a transparent ploy, because the real reason TikTok is being targeted has nothing to do with China and everything to do with Israel and its image.
 
 

And so we saw Republicans and Democrats alike line up against TikTok in the attempt to make Israel great again, and TikTok was forced to divest its US operations. But who would buy TikTok? Here we see a consortium of buyers emerge, with the primary one being Oracle. Oracle itself was founded by US billionaire Larry Ellison, who was (for a short while) the richest man in the world. Ellison is also the single largest private donor to the Israeli army and otherwise a staunch ‘Israel first’ Zionist. As for Oracle, its former CEO Safra Catz openly wrote in a private email to former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak that “we have to embed the love and respect for Israel in American culture”, while adding in an­­o­ther statement that Oracle’s commitm­ent to Israel was “second to none”. You can then imagine what TikTok will look like once Oracle is in control.
Netanyahu is already celebrating; in a recent talk with his cronies he said that “the most important [battlefield] is social media and the most important purchase that is going on right now is … TikTok”.
And with that battle won their sights are now not just on other social media outlets with the next major target being X (Twitter). And on cue, we see a slate of articles in Israeli media decrying X as the new home of antisemitism. Netanyahu isn’t worried though.
“Elon is a friend … we should talk to him,” he says. And he will. And Elon will obey. They’re coming for AI as well; the government of Israel has awarded a $6m contract to a former Trump campaign manager to create new pro-Israel websites and videos which LLMs like ChatGPT and others will be trained on.
The goal is to feed them Israeli propaganda so that they will, in turn, churn it out. This, then, is how a genocide is forgotten.

Dramatic developments that culminated in the US president’s visit to the Middle East and the ‘peace summit’ in Sharm el-Sheikh aroused hopes of an ‘era of peace’. But that may be a distant possibility given the fragility of the ceasefire and the stumbling blocks facing the critical next phases of the peace process.
The peace declaration signed by Trump and leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye at Sharm el-Sheikh contains general principles. It states the commitment to implement the Trump peace agreement but without detailing or elaborating its various elements. The signing ceremony neither had a representative from Hamas nor Israel, the two parties to the ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire, in any case, marks the beginning of a process not its culmination.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proclaimed victory after Hamas released all the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. But his commitment to honour the ceasefire and implement other steps of Trump’s 20-point plan, especially withdrawal from Gaza, is yet to be tested. His record is not encouraging. The last ceasefire in January was unilaterally ended by Israel after two months when it restarted its military onslaught. Tel Aviv also refused to negotiate further phases of what was earlier agreed.
This time Hamas sought written guarantees that Israel would not resume fighting once hostages were released. But it was unable to secure this. Instead, it got verbal assurances from the Americans. It will need Trump’s sustained engagement and pressure on Netanyahu to keep the peace process on track. Trump has staked his prestige on the Gaza deal, casting it as a “historic dawn of a new Middle East”. But he is not known to involve himself in detail that the plan’s implementation will require in the weeks ahead. Trump’s attention span is famously short.

With a fragile ceasefire in place, the path to peace in Gaza is strewn with formidable obstacles.

The next phase will involve intense negotiations to reach agreement on key aspects of the Trump plan, including demilitarisation of the territory, dismantling Hamas, pullout of Israeli forces from Gaza and deployment of a multinational stabilisation force. These are all vexing issues on which there is a yawning gap between the positions of Hamas and Israel. On Gaza’s post-conflict governance, convergence has yet to be evolved between the Palestinians/ Arab governments and Washington. The US has baulked at addressing the all-important issue of Palestinian statehood, for which Muslim countries want some assurance beyond the vague reference in Trump’s plan to “a pathway” to statehood.
Hamas is expected to disarm under the plan but has given no unequivocal assurance to give up arms as there is no commitment from Israel to withdraw from Gaza. Hamas leaders have indicated that without a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the territory they will not lay down their arms. A senior Hamas leader, Mousa Abu Marzouk, has said his organisation would only hand over weapons “if the occupation ends and Palestinians can govern themselves”. Others have said they want an iron-clad assurance about the establishment of a Palestinian state.
 
 

Trump’s 20-point plan does not address how to sequence Gaza’s demilitarisation with an Israeli pullout. It does not specify a timetable to achieve these two evidently linked goals. This will have to be negotiated which will not be easy, especially as Netanyahu has not committed to a full withdrawal from Gaza. With Israeli officials already claiming Hamas is tightening control over areas that their forces initially vacated, Netanyahu can indefinitely delay the drawdown. Tel Aviv can even derail the process, citing lack of movement on disbanding Hamas.
There are also many unanswered questions about the ‘temporary stabilisation force’ envisioned for Gaza to secure the Strip. The US has already sent 200 troops to Israel to be deployed as part of the so-called civil-military coordination centre to help the stabilisation force monitor the ceasefire and oversee the peace. The terms and rules of engagement of the international stabilisation force (ISF) are purposely absent in the plan and will need to be thrashed out. Negotiations are said to be underway on this.
Will this force have a UN mandate authorised by a Security Council resolution? Several Arab states have shown preference for that. Western members of the P5 are said to be working on a resolution to establish a stabilisation force but not one that operates under the UN flag. Any expectation for its role to involve counter-insurgency or disarm Hamas would be hard for potential troop-contributing countries to accept. No Muslim/ Arab state would want to be seen as acting against Palestinians on Israel’s behalf or protecting Israel. ISF’s size, composition, who will lead it, precise role and how long it is deployed all have to be figured out in negotiations.
Its deployment has to be closely synchronised with the post-conflict governing arrangement in Gaza. Under the plan, a ‘Board of Peace’ headed by Trump is to supervise the temporary transitional governance by a committee of Palestinian technocrats and international experts who are to be responsible for day-to-day affairs. Again, who will constitute this committee and how legitimate will it be, are questions that still have to be grappled with. This international trusteeship arrangement, until a reformed Palestinian Authority takes over, will basically mean Gaza is run by outsiders for an unspecified period in a colonial-style enterprise. How viable this will be — and acceptable to the Palestinians — is an open question. Authority after all depends on legitimacy.
The challenges ahead are daunting. There are already signs of brewing trouble that can unravel the peace plan. Israel has continued to shell Gaza and kill Palestinians during the tenuous ceasefire and delayed full access for humanitarian aid. Hamas has handed over a list of Israeli violations to mediators. Israel has threatened to resume fighting if Hamas doesn’t comply with the deal. Echoing Israel’s threat, Trump has said he would allow Israel to restart military action if the organisation does not lay down its arms. All this suggests that the path to what Trump envisions as a “new dawn” in the Middle East remains a long and uncertain one.

Published in Dawn, October 20th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-20 04:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950108/need-for-safeguards' target='_blank'><strong>Need for safeguards</strong></a><br><p>ONE of the key manifestations of extremism in Pakistan is the misuse of blasphemy laws. While sacrilege can never be condoned, it is the misuse of these laws to settle personal scores and persecute vulnerable groups that has led to frequent bouts of violence in society.
In this regard, the government has stated its intent to reform the laws in order to prevent abuse. While speaking at an event at the Supreme Court recently, the federal law minister said that “procedural safeguards” were being introduced in blasphemy-related cases to prevent misuse. At the same event, the chief justice of Pakistan highlighted the need for interfaith harmony.
 
 

While specifics are not available, any progress in this regard should be welcomed, though it must be remembered that previous efforts at reform — even those led by the higher judiciary — have stalled due to the pushback from extremist lobbies.
Calls for reform of the blasphemy laws, and legal safeguards, are by no means a defence of sacrilege. For harmony in society, no abuse against the revered figures and scriptures of all faiths can be tolerated, and there can be no room for hate speech. Instead, what activists have been saying for decades is that the misuse of the laws has to be prevented. We have seen far too many incidents where personal disputes have led to accusations of blasphemy, while in other instances, sacrilege allegations have been used to dispossess minorities of their land.
 
 

Moreover, recently a gang of criminals was uncovered that would trap people online and blackmail them, threatening to go public with false blasphemy allegations against the victims unless they paid up.
Clearly, steps need to be taken, as innocent people have lost their lives simply on the basis of unproven claims and spurious ‘evidence’. Even the head of the Council of Islamic Ideology said last year that certain “religious elements” were misusing the laws and resorting to “mob justice”, which is “un-Islamic”.
If the state’s latest attempt to reform the said laws is to succeed, then there needs to be buy-in from mainstream clerics. Unless clergymen of all sects endorse the state’s move, and extremist voices are isolated, the initiative is unlikely to succeed. But beyond legal changes, to end the troubling culture of false blasphemy allegations, there needs to be grassroots change in society, so that sensitive religious issues are not used to target people.
Countering violent extremism has been highlighted both in NAP and NAP 2.0, yet beyond solemn promises, successive administrations have done little on the ground to translate these aims into policy. Holding conferences and issuing statements is not enough. Conversations must be held in neighbourhood mosques, madressahs, schools and bazaars to communicate the message, and adopt a ‘whole-of-society’ approach against extremism.

DEFENCE Minister Khawaja Asif shakes hands with his Afghan counterpart Mullah Yaqoob, following the signing of a ceasefire agreement in Doha.—Reuters

• Pakistan, Afghanistan resolve to establish security mechanisms for lasting stability
• Kh Asif says terrorist attacks from Afghan soil must be stopped immediately
• Mujahid expresses Kabul’s commitment to not support terrorists targeting Pakistan
• Next round of talks scheduled in Istanbul on 25th
ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan and Afghanistan early on Sunday agreed to an immediate and permanent ceasefire and to set up mechanisms to address security concerns following marathon negotiations in Doha mediated by Qatar and Turkiye, officials announced.
A communique issued by Qatar’s foreign ministry said that after a round of nego­tiations between Pakistan and Afgh­a­nistan, the two sides “agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries”.
Defence and intelligence chiefs of Pak­istan and Afghanistan, accompanied by senior officials, engaged in high-level talks in Doha after a week of intense border clashes along the border, triggered on Oct 9 by Pakis­tani cross-border action aga­inst terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan.
The conflict’s roots lie in the sharp surge in militant attacks inside Pakistan, which coincided with the Afghan Tali­ban’s return to power in 2021. Islamabad blames Kabul for not reining in the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant groups based on its soil.
UN monitoring reports have, meanwhile, repeatedly confirmed linkages bet­ween the Afghan Taliban and other militant groups, reinforcing Islamabad’s concerns.
The clashes, which started on Oct 11, were the most severe since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover in Kabul and resulted in dozens of deaths, including civilians and security personnel, and hundreds of injuries, exacerbating mistrust between the two countries. A 48-hour ceasefire was agreed on Oct 15 and later extended to allow talks.
Pakistan’s delegation was led by Defence Mini­ster Khawaja Asif, along with National Security Adviser and ISI Chief Lt Gen Asim Malik, while Afghanistan’s Defe­nce Min­ister Mullah Moha­mmad Yaqoob Mujahid and intelligence chief Maulvi Abdul Haq Wasiq led the delegation from Kabul.
Turkiye’s role
The participation of Turkiye, whose role in the process had not been previously disclosed, as a mediator in the talks added a new dimension to the mediation effort.
Ankara’s involvement was notable given its decades-long experience in combating the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).
Turkish security sou­rces confirmed that the country’s intelligence chief, Ibrahim Kalin, participated in the discussions. He was also pictured at the Doha meeting. A Turkish source said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan closely followed the discussions.
Turkiye’s foreign ministry welcomed the Pakis­tan-Afghanistan agreement, saying, “We welcome that Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire under the mediation of Turkiye and Qatar and decided to establish mechanisms to strengthen peace and stability bet­ween the two countries during the talks held in Doha.”
“Turkiye will continue to support the efforts for achieving lasting peace and stability between the two brotherly countries and in the region,” it added.
The next round of talks is scheduled for Istanbul on Oct 25, where the two sides plan to establish a monitoring mechanism to verify the implementation of the ceasefire and address Pakistan’s long-standing concerns about cross-border sanctuaries of the TTP and other militant groups.
At the upcoming Istanbul meeting, it is expected that technical  committees will work on finalising the terms of a monitoring framework,  which is seen as a crucial step towards transforming the ceasefire  agreement into lasting peace.
Agreement
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, while commenting on the agreement reached in Doha, said in a post on X, “The series of terrorist incidents from Afghanistan on Pakistan’s soil will be stopped immediately. Both neighbouring countries will respect each other’s territory.”
He added that delegations will reconvene in Istanbul later this month to discuss “detailed matters”.
 






Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called the agreement “the first step in the right direction”, but stressed the importance of follow-up.
“We look forward to the establishment of a concrete and verifiable monitoring mechanism, in the next meeting to be hosted by Turkiye, to address the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil towards Pakistan,” he said.
 






Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed that “neither country will undertake any hostile actions against the other, nor will they support groups carrying out attacks against the government of Pakistan. Both sides will refrain from targeting each other’s security forces, civilians or critical infrastructure”.
 






Pakistan, as a principle, does not attack civilian targets in Afghanistan. Since the escalation of tensions on Oct 9, Pakistan has focused its strikes on military and intelligence-linked sites, including the Kabul premises of the Taliban’s General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI). That strike, however, triggered a fire in an oil tanker, leading to civilian casualties.
Over the past year and a half, Pakistan has repeatedly targeted TTP sanctuaries in Afghanistan. These actions are often categorised by the Taliban as attacks on civilians. The new agreement, by prohibiting strikes against “civilians”, may complicate Pakistan’s ability to retaliate against TTP hideouts across the border in the future because of the Taliban’s categorisation of these targets as civilians.
Later in the day, Mr Mujahid issued a clarification, saying, “The statements regarding the agreement are not a joint declaration. In these statements, the sentence — ‘and support will not be given to the attacks of those groups that are against the Pakistani government’ — is the consistent stance of the Islamic Emirate that the soil of Afghanistan will not be allowed to be used against any other country.”
“An agreement has been reached between both parties not to undertake any hostile actions against each other, which is an important point,” he maintained.
 






Sunday’s ceasefire, though welcomed widely, is similar to earlier Taliban pledges, including those made during a Chinese-sponsored rapprochement earlier this year that led to the upgrading of diplomatic missions to ambassador level. However, those commitments were not followed by verifiable action.
Controversy over border
The Qatari Foreign Ministry’s statement ignited a controversy. The initial statement referenced “tensions on the border” as a key issue addressed during the negotiations in Doha. However, after objections from the Taliban, the ministry updated the statement, replacing the phrase with “tensions between the two brotherly countries.”
 






The alteration was hailed as a diplomatic victory by the Taliban, who have long refused to recognize the Durand Line as the legitimate border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Taliban saw the change as a step toward affirming their territorial claims, which could further strain relations with Pakistan.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office did not immediately comment on the change in text of communique.

Pakistan loses an estimated 30–40 per cent of its food production each year, largely after harvest and during transport.
According to multiple assessments, including the Asian Development Bank, the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, and data cited by the Ministry of National Food Security and Research, this wastage is valued at roughly $4 billion annually, or about Rs700–850bn.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation similarly reports that post-harvest losses in perishable crops such as fruits and vegetables can reach 20–44pc, underscoring the scale of inefficiency across Pakistan’s agribusiness food value chain.
 
 

This is not an accounting anomaly; it is a structural leak in the national purse, one that drives food inflation, weakens export competitiveness, and drains the incomes of rural producers.

The absence of an end-to-end cold chain network has led to chronic food spoiling and wastage during transportation costing the nation billion

Food loss and waste have moved beyond humanitarian concern. They now represent one of Pakistan’s greatest economic frontiers a sector where smart investment could deliver out-sized national returns.
The cold chain deficit — cracks in the system
Pakistan’s most glaring weakness lies in its absence of an end-to-end cold chain network.
According to the Pakistan Horticulture Development & Export Company, fewer than 6pc of perishable goods move through temperature-controlled logistics. Beyond the main urban centres, cold storage is almost non-existent.
The result: rapid spoilage of high-value perishables, such as mangoes, dairy, meat, and tomatoes, often occurs within hours of harvest.
“The mango that leaves Multan is a different product when it reaches the port,” noted one Karachi-based exporter, “Without data or refrigeration, the farmer always pays the price.”
To close this gap, Pakistan must invest in solar-powered, modular cold storage units placed at farm gates and collection centres. These small, off-grid systems are more cost-effective to operate and less susceptible to power outages.
Such investments should be structured through public–private partnerships and farmer cooperatives, ensuring shared ownership and long-term sustainability.
The logistics sector also demands modernisation. Reliance on open trucks and poor farm-to-market roads causes massive wastage. The World Bank estimates that inefficient post-harvest transport alone adds up to 20pc more losses to the value chain.
The solution lies in refrigerated trucks, equipped with temperature and humidity sensors for monitoring in transit. For grains, hermetic silos must replace the traditional mud-and-brick storage that welcomes rodents, moisture, and decay.
Innovation and the circular economy
Even with an improved cold chain, a fraction of produce will never make it to market shelves — too bruised, overripe, or oddly shaped. Today, most of it is simply discarded.
Yet this “imperfect produce” can be turned into economic gold. Overripe mangoes can be made into pulp and puree for export; tomatoes into paste and sauces; apples and citrus into vinegar and jams.
These products are in high demand across the Middle East, Central Asia, and markets within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, where Pakistan already has trade channels.
Meanwhile, waste from urban mandis (wholesale markets) can power biogas and bio-fertiliser plants. A 2023 United Nations Industrial Development Organisation pilot project in Lahore found that using organic market waste for biogas saved up to 15pc in fertiliser costs while generating renewable energy for cold storage operations.
This shift toward upcycling and energy recovery can transform the food sector from a linear economy — grow, sell, discard — to a circular one that recycles and reinvests value.
Policy and finance — making it bankable
Rebuilding Pakistan’s post-harvest ecosystem will require capital and policy muscle. The State Bank of Pakistan should direct commercial banks to provide low-interest, long-tenure credit lines for cold chain and food processing infrastructure, much like existing Green Banking initiatives.
The government can further ease the burden by waiving import duties and taxes on cold storage and food processing machinery.
On the human capital front, agricultural extension programmes must be revitalised. Farmers need practical training in grading, packing, temperature control, and storage, as well as digital literacy to access market information.
A national commodity grading and certification system, aligned with Codex and ISO standards, would help Pakistani exporters meet the stringent requirements of European Union and US buyers, rewarding quality and consistency over volume.
A national priority, not an afterthought
Food loss reduction is not charity; it’s a sound economic strategy. Curbing waste could save billions in lost revenue, stabilise prices, and boost farmer incomes. It could also help Pakistan conserve precious water and energy, since nearly one-third of agricultural water goes into growing food that never gets eaten.
Pakistan has the know-how, the sunlight, and the market. What it needs now is coordination and the political will to prioritize efficiency over expansion.

The survey found that support for climate change initiatives increased from 5 per cent in fiscal year 2021 to 34pc in fiscal year 2025. Similarly, support for water and sanitation rose from 9pc to 35pc in the same period.
While the World Bank Group’s (WBG) work in pandemic preparedness, gender equity, and disaster risk management received the highest effectiveness ratings, the overall perception of its support has decreased significantly since 2021 in other areas, especially for governance, education, and water and sanitation.
In qualitative comments, respondents called for the WBG to deepen its local engagement in Pakistan, “moving beyond federal-level interactions to more meaningful collaboration at the grassroots, provincial, and community levels to better understand local needs and ensure effective implementation”.

Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s support have declined in key sectors

The survey showed that financial resources were considered the WBG’s greatest value to Pakistan at 48pc, followed by knowledge products (33pc), technical assistance (32pc), and capacity development (24pc).
While ratings for many key performance indicators remained largely consistent with 2021 findings, the survey noted that the only rating to show a significant improvement was the perception of the WBG’s effectiveness in achieving development results in Pakistan.
More than half of respondents felt that the WBG has strengthened its work in improving people’s lives (52pc) and in being easy to work with (51pc).
Additionally, just under half believed the Bank has somewhat or significantly improved the technical quality of WBG-supported projects and partnered with others to increase development finance (49 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively).
A government institution respondent stated that “capacity building of the local stakeholders and impact assessment of the projects should be necessary in the project design”.
A parliamentarian suggested the WBG “develop people-to-people contact, and engage civil society along with the government for better results of project implementation.” The parliamentarian added that Parliament and local body members “must be taken in decision and implementation of projects”.
Collaboration with the national government received the highest ratings this year, but this perception has decreased significantly since fiscal year 2021. At the same time, perceptions of effective collaboration with civil society have improved significantly.
However, the group’s collaboration with the parliament and local government received relatively lower ratings, with stakeholders from the office of a parliamentarian giving some of the lowest ratings.
Respondents were most familiar with the WBG’s and the United Nations’ work among development institutions. The survey found the WBG to be one of the most trusted institutions in Pakistan, alongside the UN and the Asian Development Bank.
Significant differences emerged in how various groups perceive the WBG. Respondents from bilateral agencies and government institutions were more positive about WBG staff accessibility than those from the offices of parliamentarians, civil society, and academia. Respondents from local government organisations tended to be more critical of the WBG’s work.
The Country Opinion Surveys, which are part of the World Bank Group’s programme series, explore stakeholder opinions on the economy, future priorities, and perceptions of the WBG’s effectiveness, relevance, and ability to influence the development agenda.

• Calls for ‘National Agriculture Restoration Policy’
ISLAMABAD: The PTI’s Kisaan Wing (PTI-KW) has urged the federal and provincial governments to prioritise the restoration of agriculture sector, which suffered large-scale devastation due to the recent floods across the country, calling for the immediate formulation of a ‘National Agriculture Restoration Policy’.
This demand was made through a unanimous resolution passed at the PTI-KW meeting held on Sunday. The meeting was chaired by PTI-KW Organiser and MNA Sheikh Waqqas Akram, and attended by Central Information Secretary Khalid Nawaz Sadhraich, PTI Kisan Wing Punjab President Major (R) Ghulam Sarwar, General Secretary Muhammad Ijaz Shafi, MNA Khurram Shahzad Virk and a number of office bearers from various farmers’ organisations.
 
 

Briefing the media after the meeting, PTI-KW spokesperson Khalid Nawaz Sadhraich expressed deep concerns over the authorities’ handling of the post-flood situation. He said the recent floods caused a large-scale destruction across the country, resulting in estimated losses exceeding Rs822 billion. “The federal government’s preliminary flood damage assessment report admitted this loss, but the actual losses could be even higher as a detailed post-disaster assessment is still underway”, he added.
Mr Sadhraich said the meeting expressed dissatisfaction over the government’s post-flood relief and rehabilitation measures, terming them “highly disappointing” for the affected people, particularly farmers. He noted the initial estimates put the losses in agriculture sector alone at around Rs430 billion, excluding livestock and damage to the canal system.
“With the Rabi season fast approaching, helpless farmers have no access to basic inputs for sowing their crops, while they are being offered a mere Rs20,000 to Rs25,000 as compensation against losses worth millions,” he said.
The meeting emphasised the urgent need for rebuilding the destroyed agricultural infrastructure and called on the government to give the matter top priority. It also stressed the immediate formulation of a National Agriculture Restoration Policy and the creation of a committee comprising senior government officials and farmers’ representatives to rebuild the country’s agricultural economy, Mr Sadhraich concluded.

Mamdani, favoured to become New York’s mayor, is a self-described democratic socialist. Sherrill, who aspires to be her state’s next governor, is a former Navy helicopter pilot and centrist trying to woo moderates back to her party.
Sherrill, along with another centrist candidate, Abigail Spanberger, who is running for Virginia governor, are pitching themselves as the Democrats’ best hope in the November elections for flipping the page after President Donald Trump’s victory. While they are advocating pragmatism and consensus-driven solutions, Mamdani is pushing for a set of left-wing policies that would take the party in a new direction.
Despite their differences, all three have zeroed in on what Democrats hope will be a winning strategy that carries over to the 2026 midterm elections: the high cost of living for everyday Americans. Each campaign is channelling the same voter frustration that everything from energy to healthcare to groceries feels increasingly unaffordable.
That is the pain point right now with voters, said Mark Riddle, president of Future Majority, a Democratic firm that conducts voter research. And they’re blaming Trump.
Democrats exploit handling of economy
Since Democrats lost both the White House and Congress last year, the party has been searching for a policy framework and fresh voices. Success in the key Nov 4 mayoral and gubernatorial elections could help translate into victories next year, when control of both chambers of Congress will be up for grabs, strategists say.
One reason Trump won last year was that same economic anxiety. But Democrats argue that Trump slapping high tariffs on imports and his  “Big Beautiful” tax bill have only made things worse.
While inflation overall has cooled during Trump’s presidency, staples such as food, housing and power remain significantly more expensive than just a few years ago. Grocery prices are up 2.7pc over a year ago, according to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, while home electricity costs have jumped 6.2pc and home gas prices have shot up 13.8pc over a year ago.
After record-breaking price increases in 2021 and 2022, home values have continued to rise, though at a slower pace, now closer to 3pc annually. But rent and shelter costs, which factor heavily into the Consumer Price Index, haven’t meaningfully cooled. The cost of medical services excluding prescription drugs has increased 4.2pc in the last year.
About half of Americans polled in a June Reuters/Ipsos poll said they were  “very concerned” about the cost of living. The issue is something of a thorn in Trump’s side: In another Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted this month, just 27pc of respondents said they approved of his performance on the cost of living. Meanwhile, the price of imported goods has shot up 4pc during Trump’s time in office, with the cost of domestic goods increasing 2pc, according to an analysis this month. But while polls show voters are increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of the economy, they continue to trust Republicans more than Democrats to fix it.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll in September found Americans were more likely to trust the Republican Party over the Democratic Party (34pc to 24pc) on managing economic policy. Trump has repeatedly boasted about his economic record, arguing he’s lowered prices and inflation and that his tariff regime is a success. “We’ve had the best economy we’ve ever had,” he said at a Cabinet meeting this month.
A way forward
The Democratic Party has spent much of 2025 trying to figure out what went wrong last year.
Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’s vice-presidential nominee, has toured states speaking to party officials about his ticket’s failure to reassure voters about their everyday concerns.
Mamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger, the three most high-profile candidates running this year, have responded by promoting affordability as a central campaign theme.
Spanberger’s Affordable Virginia plan focuses on lowering healthcare, housing, and energy costs. Part of the plan would seek to force tech data centres to pay their fair share of electricity costs. A former CIA officer, she has also emphasised how federal job cuts and the US government shutdown are damaging her state, which is reliant on federal jobs.
Sherrill’s Affordability Agenda targets similar cost-of-living concerns. She has pledged to declare a statewide energy emergency and freeze rates. Housing, healthcare, and utility costs I’ll tackle them immediately, Sherrill said during a debate with Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli this month.
Ciattarelli is also promoting his  “affordability agenda” — one that cuts taxes and regulations and argues that Sherrill’s plans are anti-growth. Recent polls show that Sherrill’s lead over Ciattarelli is hovering around 6 percentage points. Spanberger’s lead over her opponent, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, has fluctuated between 3 and 10 points, depending on the poll.
Mamdani’s agenda includes a rent freeze, free bus service, universal childcare, and city-run grocery stores. He has drawn fire from Republicans, who cast him as a radical, and from some Democrats, including his rival for mayor, Andrew Cuomo, who argues that Mamdani’s policies are unworkable and would lead to large tax increases.
A Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed Mamdani with a 13-point lead over Cuomo. Rebecca Katz, a New York Democratic operative whose firm, Fight, has produced ads on behalf of Mamdani’s campaign, warned that Democrats would be imprudent to dismiss his success. If and when he wins in November, Democrats shouldn’t write him off, Katz said. They should look at why his message resonated.

The city once known for its gardens and greenery is now known for its smog. With the Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching 1,000+ last season, there is an urgent need for innovative climate-friendly practices to deal with this hazard.
In addition to the short-term measures to protect the citizens from health emergencies, there is a need for viable long-term solutions to tackle climate crisis as well. Clearly, extreme unpredictable climate changes call for shifting towards sustainable methods of production and consumption. This translates to shifting towards using more renewable energy sources as opposed to non-renewable ones in order to preserve the environment.
 
 

Although there are still gaps between the objectives for green energy and the results achieved, several global initiatives are making real progress by mobilising corporations to adopt renewable energy on a large scale. This growing corporate commitment has rapidly increased the demand for renewable energy sources by the corporate sector; and this demand is expected to grow further after it doubled compared to the peak in 2019.
Global initiatives such as the ‘RE100 Coalition’ and the ‘Clean Energy Buyers Association’ have brought on board over 400 leading companies, including the tech giants, to source 100 per cent of their energy from renewable sources and to advance low-cost, reliable, and carbon-free global electricity systems respectively.

The country needs a well-thought out transition plan to bring the theoretical green, sustainable economy into reality

In the context of Pakistan, even though renewable energy sources are a very efficient way of achieving a greener and sustainable economy in theory, it needs to be well thought out and properly executed to make a noticeable difference. Encouragement of innovation and efficiency by the government paves ways for achieving a cleaner environment.
One such example is the availability of electric vehicles by the Punjab provincial government. Along with the public sector, the responsibility also falls on the corporations to come up with ways to reverse the environmental degradation caused by their practices over the years. If the companies can achieve such technological advancement to come up with sustainable practices, they would also be following the United Nations Global Compact which expects and encourages the organisations to fully utilise their research and development facilities and come up with sustainable practices and environmentally friendly technologies.
The concept of demand and supply applies when it comes to energy production and consumption as well. The rise in demand for energy globally increases concerns about the security of the energy supply. Moreover, this demand forces more production, and then eventually leads to harmful emissions in the atmosphere when the energy needs are fulfilled by non-renewable resources. Therefore, managing the renewable energy supply is one viable option to nudge companies to shift towards sustainable production methods and reduce their carbon emissions.
 
 

In addition, it is believed that imposing carbon tax will eventually force companies to not rely on their current non-renewable energy sources and switch to more efficient and sustainable methods of production. Consequently, ensuring energy security as well as environmental security. This shift towards responsible production and consumption would ultimately help the companies in adhering to the Sustainable Development Goals given by United Nations Development Programme. Thus, proving to be beneficial in longer term.
Another option is through the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). An RPS is a policy that requires energy providers to generate or source a fixed percentage of their electricity from renewable sources to promote cleaner and sustainable energy production. Through this, multiple other resources of renewable energy would be entered into the already existing energy system. Thus, it will improve it by majorly two phenomena: by reducing energy dependency and by diversifying energy sources. RPS will clearly prove to be a suitable policy option for long-term sustainability.
In a nutshell, Pakistan’s path toward energy security and green development requires a pragmatic and phased approach with both corporate and government stakeholders playing their part. The reliance on fossil fuels cannot be eliminated overnight. However, policy efforts must focus on improving the efficiency of existing energy systems and investing in cleaner conversion technologies to gradually shift towards renewable energy sources. Moreover, public–private partnerships, subsidies for green innovation, and targeted awareness programmes can accelerate green transition. Only through a balanced strategy, aligning economic feasibility with environmental responsibility, will Pakistan be able to solve the dilemma of energy and environmental security.

• 95 bank accounts identified; parleys continue over fate of seminaries administered by the group
LAHORE: Authorities in Punjab claim to have traced the whereabouts of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas, saying the absconding leaders fled to Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) after the Muridke crackdown.
A senior official told Dawn that law enforcers had shared this information with AJK authorities and sought their help to nab the TLP leaders. The development follows speculation — fuelled by TLP circles — that their party chief was in custody.
The official said following the crackdown, several teams comprising senior officers from Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies had been tasked with tracking down the TLP chief and his brother.
He said Saad Rizvi and his brother were first spotted walking away from the protest camp in Muridke, and then fleeing on a motorbike.
At that time, an emergency message was circulated among the LEAs that a motorcycle rider carrying the TLP chief and his brother had moved towards nearby streets.
The three suspects, however, managed to dodge law enforcement personnel, any many rumours started to surface on social media regarding possible injury to them.
The officer said the special teams eventually traced the last location of the TLP leaders somewhere in AJK and sought the regional government’s help for their arrest.
It may be recalled that the Punjab government has formally sought the proscription of TLP and has sent a summary in this regard to the federal government.
Meanwhile, the Federal Inves­tigation Agency also traced nearly 95 bank accounts operated by the TLP chief, Saad Rizvi, the official said.
Of them, 15 were interest-bearing accounts, and the FIA was trying to get more details from the relevant banks to check the transactions made by the TLP chief, he added.
TLP seminaries
As a part of a wider crackdown on the radical outfit, the Punjab government also identified 61 seminaries run by the TLP across the province. The issue of these seminaries also came up during a meeting of Sunni clerics with the provincial authorities, as both sides discussed proposals about the fate of these institutions.
During the meeting, two proposals came under discussion to decide the future of these seminaries. It was suggested in the meeting that these seminaries be given under the administrative control of the Punjab Auqaf Department — this suggestion, however, was opposed by the majority of the participants who feared such a move would aggravate the situation. They said this action may create controversies in the future, particularly due to the huge financial expenses.
The second proposal pertained to handing over these seminaries to the moderate Sunni clerics – a move deemed workable. However, the authorities said in such a case, the clerics would run the TLP seminaries without the element of ‘militancy’. But a final decision on the fate of these seminaries is yet to be taken.
Meanwhile, the Multan district administration sealed 10 TLP seminaries and handed several over to the Auqaf department in line with the Punjab government’s orders. These seminaries were located in Multan, Shujabad, and Basti Malook.

These concerns, amplified by recent stablecoin legislation adopted by the US, have also led the European Central Bank to fast-track its plans for a digital euro, according to a Financial Times report. Why? The threat of a local currency substitution, particularly dollarisation, in this case of increasingly popular stablecoins pegged to the dollar.
Humza Khan, Binance’s regional operations lead for the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia, said, “The main risks with stablecoin adoption in Pakistan relate to dollarisation and the potential impact on the country’s monetary policies.”
Mubariz Siddiqui, a legal expert and founder of Carbon Law, further added that the biggest issue that the central bank has is the “dollarisation of the economy”. Therefore, Pakistan now faces a critical policy question: can a central bank’s fiat digital currency provide resistance to this threat posed by centralised fiat-backed digital currencies to preserve the central bank’s authority and Pakistan’s monetary sovereignty?
 
 

While confirming an uptake in interest in Binance and its users since government efforts to regulate virtual assets, Mr Khan said, “The community in Pakistan has been active for many years, and that strong foundation has supported the growth we have seen more recently.” He also confirmed, “In Pakistan, stablecoins are increasingly being explored as a tool for remittances and everyday transactions.”

As Pakistan prepares to pilot a central bank digital currency, stablecoins are emerging as a haven for institutional as well as retail investors, raising concerns of dollarisation and monetary sovereignty

He further acknowledged the interest of Pakistanis in stablecoins “being used for peer-to-peer [P2P] transactions” as it provides a means of hedging against local currency fluctuations. Delivering on these pain points for a population and an economy which relies heavily on cross-border transactions, with personal remittances contributing 9.4 per cent of the GDP in 2024, according to World Bank Data, “Stablecoins are a product-market fit for remittances and payouts,” said Faisal Aftab, Founder and CEO of Zayn VC.
According to Mr Aftab, stablecoins will “eventually terminate in RAAST, which is the State Bank’s central switch”. He added that “The central bank will then hold those stablecoins as reserves, convert them into digital rupees, most likely a central bank digital currency [CBDC], and from there distribute them into wallets and bank accounts.”
As much as this use case fulfils the current needs of this population, it is dependent on an unstable local currency. Therefore, with increased dependence on stablecoins, there is a structured incentive for an unstable local currency, compounded by an already dollarised textile and information technology sector.
These incentives are amplified by the unique nature of this form of centralised digital currency, as it makes it even more accessible to get “digital dollars”, and to retain the dollar as a local medium of exchange through P2P transactions. This, in the end, affects the central bank’s authority, as the dollar displaces even more use cases of the rupee, eventually weakening the impact of the central bank’s policies to manage inflation.
Mr Khan also explained, “The increase in stablecoin adoption and reliance on the stablecoin USDC’s risks reliability of the local rupee, delegitimising the currency and limiting the central bank’s ability to mitigate inflation and liquidity.” He further adds that this could lead to a Pakistan-backed stablecoin “to ensure that the central bank of Pakistan and the digital asset landscape in the country grow and adapt in unison.”
A veteran tech founder, currently building on a similar use case, shared “Stablecoins can help formalise a lot of this informal saving.” While wishing to stay anonymous, he added, “Emerging markets with unstable money usually have foreign exchange controls,” and that “any platform that gives people access to digital dollars should follow those foreign exchange controls”.
Furthermore, “when a government appropriately regulates stablecoins, this can actually result in tremendous inflows”, he explained, as these dollar stablecoins come from abroad; if stablecoins are allowed to come in, but not go out, it results in “net new inflows”.
Mr Aftab, on the other hand, while acknowledging the risk of dollarisation, said, “Regulators in Pakistan have made it clear that stablecoin activity will be channelled through RAAST and digital rupee rails, which means there will be a path to manage this risk.”
But this is just one of the many use cases that blockchain technology provides, which, if used correctly, are ideal for emerging economies like Pakistan. Talking about the different use cases, Mr Khan from Binance shared that “each emerging market is unique and looks to different use cases” within decentralised finance. “In South East Asia, we see strong interest in technology, smart contracts, and developing new projects,” he discussed, “While across Africa, adoption has been driven by tools and services such as cross-border payments.”
While the central bank avoided offering specific timelines, it confirmed exploratory work on CBDCs. The chief spokesperson for the State Bank of Pakistan, Noor Ahmed, says that as part of its exploratory initiative, “SBP is engaging with selected CBDC solution providers at the proof-of-concept stage to better understand the underlying technologies, operational models and their solution offerings.”

• Urges overhaul of slow, debt-heavy climate finance system
ROME: Climate finance is being held back by bureaucracy rather than a lack of funds, Adviser to the Prime Minister Dr Syed Tauqir Shah told a global forum last week, stressing that frontline countries like Pakistan have been left struggling to access vital support.
Addressing the FAO’s Rome Water Dialogue, where he presented Pakistan’s national statement to an audience of leaders, ministers and civil society representatives, Dr Shah said, “Water crises are no longer an abstract policy discussion but an existential challenge for many countries in the Global South.”
 






He said Pakistan is among the wor­ld’s most climate-vulnerable nations and has now crossed the threshold into official water scarcity, with national food security threatened by extreme weather and chronic resource stress.
The crisis, he noted, manifests both as “devastating abundance” — the 2022 floods that affected over 33 million people, destroyed four million acres of crops and left 10 million without safe drinking water, with this year’s floods “equally catastrophic” — and as crippling scarcity, with total storage limited to about 30 days’ supply.
“Our need is clear and urgent: we require massive, timely investments in climate-resilient water infrastructure. This must be a mix of traditional, high-storage solutions alongside nature-based solutions like restoring floodplains, developing resilient irrigation techniques, and implementing watershed management,” he added.
Calling out the global climate finance institutions, Dr Tauqir said Pakistan requires an estimated $7-14 billion annually for adaptation efforts alone by 2030. “Yet, we are met with a global finance architecture that has turned the required investment into a paradox,” he said.
 
 

While building a case for reform of glo­bal climate finance institutions, he opined that the current global climate fund mechanism is characterised by critical failings that directly hamper our ability to invest and innovate in water resilience.
He said that despite the staggering national need, Pakistan has been unable to fully utilise available global climate funds because international criteria often demand highly specific, technically complex and “bankable” project proposals, requiring a level of institutional capacity that takes years to build.
He further highlighted that even once approved, funds are subject to slow disbursement rates and multi-year legal processes.
Criticising the climate finance modalities, Dr Shah said, “We find that the maximum available climate finance takes the form of debt and concessional loans, with only a small fraction available as grants.”
He lamented that debt is being loaded onto vulnerable economies that are already struggling with macroeconomic stability.
Citing the Green Climate Fund, he said the average time from concept to board approval is 24 months or more, and stressed that the first disbursement typically takes months after approval.
He referred to the GCF Independent Evaluation Unit’s finding that internal processes are “complex, fragmented and marked by bottlenecks”.
He said major climate funds are criticised by development experts for sluggish processing, excessive bureaucracy and disbursement delays.
“We call upon our global partners to shift the paradigm from an architecture of complexity and debt to one of speed and trust,” Dr Tauqir Shah said. “We need a financial innovation component which focuses on leveraging blended finance, green bonds, insurance mechanisms and incubation programmes to de-risk private investment and increase access to finance for smallholder farmers.”
While flagging the 2030 global development agenda, Dr Shah said, “The Sus­tainable Development Goals, especially SDG 6 (clean water) and SDG 2 (zero hunger), will remain beyond reach unless we confront this challenge head-on.”

Party officials said Pun­jab Chief Minister Mar­yam Nawaz also joined the meeting, where subjects such as the ongoing talks with Afgha­nistan, a crackdown against the TLP, as well as the forthcoming local government polls in Punjab also came under discussion.
According to reports, PM Shehbaz briefed his elder brother on the ongoing talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
During the meeting, Nawaz Sharif reaffirmed that “no one will be allowed to look at Pakistan with malicious intent”, adding that “Pakistan is our red line, and the sons of this nation are defending their motherland without regard for their own lives”.
Views were also excha­nged on the party’s strategy to ensure the victory of its candidates in the local government polls, following the Ele­ction Com­m­ission of Pak­istan’s decision to hold the long-delayed elections in December.
They said that as the first phase of the electoral exercise in which 9-member panels will be elected in each union council, will be party-less giving the winning candidates 30 days to join a political party of their preference, the meeting discussed holding the second phase of the polls in selected districts first where the PML-N has a strong following.
It was decided to take other party leaders onboard for selecting districts for the second phase of polls.
Separately, PM Shehbaz also met with Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, the minister briefed the premier on the law and order situation in the country, as well as ongoing development projects in Islamabad.

Effective tax rates have reached a point where there is no economic incentive to invest in the economy, in the absence of which, economic growth will remain a distant dream. Total consumption as a percentage of GDP was almost 100 per cent in 2024-25; the highest ever.
Any growth to be driven by consumption will be short-lived. Any sustainable growth requires massive investment in the economy’s production capacity, and that remains constrained by one of the highest effective tax rates in the world, both at a corporate and at an individual level.
 
 

The country needs an overarching and coherent industrial policy that brings together a stimulating tax policy, a marginal-price-driven power policy, and a savings regime that incentivises formal savings that can provide capital to drive investments in the economy.
Taxes paid by salaried individuals amounted to Rs545 billion in FY25 — 66.7pc of which is estimated to have been contributed by roughly 129,000 individuals that belonged to the top slab.

An investment in lieu of taxes programme through a five percentage point reduction in corporate and salary taxes could create investment stimulus, generating Rs800bn in productive capital stock

These are estimates, interpolated from public data; the availability of public data on slabs can further refine this calculation. The distribution of our distorted slab structure is such that 10.8pc of total income tax payers were in the top slab. Effectively, the sovereign takes away an average of 28.6pc of top slab taxpayers’ taxable income, largely to fund a perpetual deficit.
That capital can potentially be better utilised through channelising it to private savings, and investments through directed policy interventions, rather than stimulating consumption.
It is also estimated that taxes paid by corporations amounted to Rs2.5 trillion, with only a small 0.5pc of corporates contributing 81pc of total corporate taxes paid. These are large corporations that can effectively reallocate capital, and drive investment growth — but a distorted tax regime penalises any such ventures.
A policy structure where a reduction in corporate tax rates can generate surplus after-tax income that can be channelised to investment in the economy can stimulate the investment component of the GDP, rejigging the economy from consumption to growth.
A five percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate of corporations and individuals can unlock Rs453bn in after-tax income (approximately Rs293bn from corporates, and approximately Rs160bn from salaried individuals), that — instead of being allocated to service perpetual deficits — can be used to stimulate private investment in the economy.
An ‘investment in lieu of taxes’ programme can be initiated, where a certain proportion of tax savings can be reallocated to investments that enhance overall productive capacity. It is critical that the same is ring-fenced to prioritising high-impact investments, rather than accumulation of land and real estate that has an abysmal impact multiplier.
 
 

A sunset clause can be put into place, such that corporations are incentivised to accelerate investment in the economy, wherein any income generated from fresh investment can be taxed at a marginally lower tax rate, but results in an overall expanded tax base.
Similarly, surplus income available with individuals can be incentivised to be redirected towards savings in the directed capital market or banking instruments, which complements the overall industrial policy.
An industrial policy cannot be created in isolation, without taking into consideration the dynamics of income and capital. Incentives that enhance the participation of individuals in capital markets, or financial institutions, to fund incremental capacity will be able to redirect income away from consumption and towards investments.
Assuming 70pc of the hypothetical Rs453bn in after-tax income can be invested, it could also unlock private sector credit, which can be linked to reduced tax rates for the banking sector. Assuming a 60-40 debt-equity ratio for fresh investment, capital allocation of almost Rs800bn can be unlocked for investment in the economy.
Policy levers that link the allocation of capital investment for all participants in the economy need to be at the core of any coherent industrial policy.
However, a reduction in tax collection by Rs453bn would create a gap in the fiscal space, and considering the National Finance Commission conundrum — provinces carving out their share right at the revenue level — the quantum of such a carve-out needs to change for any investment growth to happen.
It has been demonstrated by economic performance in the last few years that the economy simply cannot grow sustainably with a distorted fiscal regime. The question that needs to be asked is whether the Rs453bn redeployed in investments could be used effectively by provinces to generate economic growth?
In the absence of economic growth, the population is suffering, irrespective of a federal or provincial jurisdiction. A pivot to investment-oriented growth will enhance economic activity across all provinces, which simply cannot be done by expanding government expenditure. Instead of giving market-distorting subsidies, there is a need to let the market find the equilibrium.
The surplus after-tax income can be financed by provinces either through increases in provincial tax income or through reducing expenditure by an equivalent amount. With a population that exceeds 250 million, the country needs more investment-oriented growth, more export-oriented investments, higher productivity, and higher-quality jobs. That simply cannot be provided by a debt-fueled government expenditure machinery.

• Remarks come as credit agencies, banks seek clarity on country’s security outlook
WASHINGTON: Cur­bing militancy is essential for financial stability, Fin­ance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said as he wrapped up a week-long visit to Washington.
Officials accompanying the minister to the World Bank and IMF annual meetings said the security-economy link surfaced repeatedly in many of the delegation’s 65 meetings during the seven-day visit.
“From credit rating agencies to commercial banks, everyone wanted to understand whether Pakistan’s security environment is now aligned with its economic recovery,” one official said.
In a media briefing, Mr Aurangzeb acknowledged that sustained stability and investor confidence depend on internal peace and political cohesion. “From a financial angle, this action is necessary,” he said, a rare admission that the country’s economic prospects are inseparable from its ability to curb extremism.
His remarks came at a time when Pakistan’s strategic significance is being increasingly recognised in world capitals. Under US President Donald Trump’s second term, Islamabad has regained Washington’s attention after years of estrangement.
 
 

Mr Trump’s unconventional approach has brought former adversaries into dialogue, and Pakistan has leveraged this moment adroitly.
Earlier this week, Mr Aurangzeb held an exclusive meeting with US Congressman French Hill, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee — the first time a Pakistani finance minister met the head of this key congressional panel.
Mr Aurangzeb used the meeting to stress the importance of enhancing economic ties between Pakistan and the US.
 






As the finance minister emphasised the link between geopolitics and economics, Washington-based analyst Shuja Nawaz told CNN that Pakistan’s ability to defend itself against a much larger adversary has impressed the US leader.
“Trump likes winners,” he said, noting that the US president sees the Pakistan army chief as “a winner who is willing to make quick decisions”.
That rapport, and the growing security cooperation — from rare earth exports to US arms sales — form a new strategic backdrop for Mr Aurangzeb’s economic diplomacy.
 
 

Michael Kugelman of the Asia Pacific Foundation added, “The current global moment does benefit Pakistan due to its geographic proximity to the Gulf and its close partnerships with key stakeholders there.”
Analysts say Washington’s renewed interest in Pakistan is shaped by both geopolitical convenience and economic opportunity.
Fiscal credibility
Against this evolving backdrop, Mr Aurangzeb’s Washington visit served to consolidate a narrative of fiscal stability and policy credibility. Pakistan’s credit ratings have improved, with Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Global all upgrading their outlooks. The IMF’s recent staff-level agreement for a $1.2 billion disbursement further signalled institutional confidence in the country’s reform trajectory.
The IMF’s World Economic Outlook projected 3.6 per cent growth for FY2025, though it noted that the economic impact of this summer’s floods is still being assessed.
Still, global investors are beginning to return. Institutional funds, banks and advisory firms that had long viewed Pakistan as high-risk are reopening conversations — a shift attributed by senior officials to consistent fiscal signalling and a more stable security environment.
Privatisation
Mr Aurangzeb’s meetings with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) and JP Morgan reflected a focus on diversification and modernisation of Pakistan’s financing instruments. He briefed ADCB executives on the launch of the Panda Bond and the refreshing of the Global Medium-Term Note (GMTN) programme.
At a news briefing, the minister expressed optimism about the accelerated privatisation of the national carrier and disclosed that the government was close to achieving financial close on the Reko Diq project. He urged ADCB to expand its participation in Pakistan’s financial markets and trade flows.
At JP Morgan, Mr Aurangzeb discussed the forthcoming Green Panda Bond in China and the federal cabinet’s approval of the government-to-government sale of First Women Bank to a UAE conglomerate.
He also emphasised emerging digital cooperation with Saudi Arabia through the GO AI Hub and growing US interest in the Reko Diq mining venture.

The minister assurance came while presiding over a meeting to address the bottlenecks faced by meat exporters in exporting meat to Malaysia.
The meeting was attended by secretary of industries and production, Saif Anjum, along with representatives from both the public and private sectors.
The meeting discussed issues and recommendations related to meat exports to Malaysia. Exp­orters identified main challenges including feed quality, livestock breed, high production costs, lack of cold chain facilities, limited banking support, and documentation hurdles.
Exporters emphasised that the banking sector is not providing adequate support, forcing them to make cash payments in cattle markets. They also highlighted the absence of cold storage facilities at airports, compelling them to store meat in vehicles.
Representative of meat exporters pointed out that while India exports meat at USD 3.5 per kilogramme, Pakistan’s export cost stands at USD 5 per kilogramme. They further said that Pakistan currently exports meat to Taji­kistan at the same rate. The minister acknowledged the concerns raised by exporters and affirmed that Pakistani meat is of superior quality and capable of competing in international markets.

Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti condemned the incident in a statement and ordered the immediate arrest of the suspects.
“All resources will be used to provide justice to the affected family,” the CM said, according to a statement issued by his office.
According to the statement, the CM had sought a report from police regarding the incident.
Dawn.com has reached out to the police for further details.
Meanwhile, the NP also strongly condemned the incident in a statement, adding that the party would observe three days of mourning. It added that at the time of the incident, Waleed was celebrating his wedding.
It said that the incident was not only “the murder of an ordinary citizen but also the murder of a person belonging to a dignified and political family who has always believed in peace, non-violence, patience and tolerance and political values ​​and traditions”.
“The government has completely failed to protect the lives and property of citizens, and such incidents clearly indicate this failure,” the statement added, further calling the murder “a deep shock for the […] people and political classes of entire Balochistan”.
“Such violent incidents are conspiracies of anti-peace elements who are enemies of peace, development and political stability in Balochistan,” the NP said.
PPP leader Haji Ali Madad Jattak and adviser to the CM Dr Rubaba Khan Buledi also condemned the killing, calling it a “tragic and alarming incident” that threatened the peace of the entire province.
Today’s incident comes around two months after another brother of Rehmat Saleh Baloch was injured in an attack at the Quetta-Karachi National Highway near Mastung.

Police said in a statement that terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)  — tried to attack the Baka Khel police station from a distance.
However, it added, police personnel opened fire on them after detecting their movement using the “latest technology”. As a result, the statement said, the terrorists couldn’t come near the police station and fled.
According to police, “residents from nearby areas also fired at the attackers” and helped law enforcers.
The statement did not mention any loss of lives or property in the incident, which was earlier confirmed by Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan. He told Dawn.com that the attackers had used a hand grenade to target the police station.
“Unidentified attackers threw a hand grenade toward the police station, but it fell at a distance, causing no damage,” he said.
The RPO added that the attackers fled after the attempt and a search operation to hunt them was under way.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
On Friday night, police intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.
On Saturday, unkn­own assailants launched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan’s
According to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the FC personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee.

The development comes against the backdrop of the Punjab government tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a restrictive permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid soaring prices and wheat shortage there.
According to the PMO statement, a high-level meeting was held yesterday (Saturday) to discuss the 2025-26 wheat policy. It was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and attended by the chief ministers of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The statement said a representative of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM was also present at the meeting while the Azad Jammu and Kashmir PM and relevant stakeholders also attended the meeting.
It quoted PM Shehbaz as saying that Pakistan was an agricultural economy, for which wheat was of key importance.
“Wheat is not just a staple food item for the people of Pakistan but also the biggest source of earning for the farmers of the country,” he said, adding that the government was well aware of the difficulties of the farmers.
He assured that the all possible efforts were being made for the welfare of the farmers, the PMO statement said, further stating that the premier termed farmers the “backbone of the economy”.
PM Shehbaz told the participants of the meeting that the the government had consulted all stakeholders, including provincial governments, farmers’ associations and industrialists, over the wheat policy.
“We appreciate the cooperation of the provinces for this policy based on consensus,” PM Shehbaz stated.
He said the policy was aimed at safeguarding people’s interests while ensuring profits for farmers and hoped that it would contribute to progress in the agriculture sector.
The PM asserted that the policy would result in an increase farmers’ incomes and play an important role in in ensuring food security in the country.
According to the PMO statement, the meeting was told under the new policy, the federal and provincial governments would be able to acquire “strategic reserves of about 6.2 million tonnes” from wheat harvest in 2025-26.
It added that wheat would be procured at Rs3,500 per maund (40 kilogrammes), in accordance with the international import price.
“This measure will ensure market competitiveness along with fair prices and profits for farmers,” the PMO statement said, citing the briefing given to the meeting.
It further stated that the national food security would head committee, which would oversee the policy’s implementation. It would include representatives from all provinces and and meet every week, the statement said, adding that it would directly report to the prime minister.
According to the statement, the meeting’s participants were assured that fair pricing would be ensured for farmers and the government would by sufficient stock to ensure their security as well as “stable reserves”.</p><small>2025-10-19 19:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1922010395cb383.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949962/england-beat-india-by-4-runs-in-last-ball-thriller-to-qualify-for-womens-world-cup-semi-final' target='_blank'><strong>England beat India by 4 runs in last-ball thriller to qualify for Women’s World Cup semi-final</strong></a><br><p>Four-time champions England booked their ticket to the semi-finals of the ICC Women’s World Cup after pulling off a nail-biting four-run win over hosts India in Indore on Sunday.
England had posted a competitive 288-8 thanks to Heather Knight’s century and held their nerve in the field to defend it, despite their bowling, usually their strong suit, being a touch off colour.
 






India looked to be cruising towards victory, needing just 62 runs off the last 10 overs with seven wickets in hand. But the dismissal of Smriti Mandhana turned the tide, as scoreboard pressure crept in and dot balls piled up. Soon after, Richa Ghosh and Deepti Sharma departed in quick succession, leaving the tail high and dry.
Reckless batting cost India dear. Mandhana’s downfall opened the floodgates when she danced down the track to left-arm spinner Linsey Smith but failed to clear long-off. Then, after reaching her half-century, Deepti Sharma perished trying to take on Sophie Ecclestone, a slog sweep that found deep mid-wicket to perfection. From there, the writing was on the wall.
“We probably needed 300, but we did well to pull things back and I’m very happy. Didn’t contribute much in the last couple of games, so it felt good to come up with a match-winning hundred,” said Knight, whose classy 109 off 91 balls, laced with 15 fours and a six, was the backbone of England’s innings.
England’s openers gave them a brisk start with 73 runs for the first wicket before Knight joined captain Nat Sciver-Brunt in a 113-run stand that kept the scoreboard ticking.
At one stage, England looked set to go past 300, but Knight’s run out attempting a second run triggered a slowdown, as India tightened the screws and conceded only 74 runs in the final 10 overs. Deepti Sharma was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with four wickets.
It was India’s third successive defeat, leaving their next clash against New Zealand a virtual knockout. With both teams locked on four points, it’s a case of do or die to stay in the hunt for the last semi-final berth, with Australia, England and South Africa already safely through.
England, meanwhile, have been clinical, through to the semis with two games in hand. They sit second on the table with nine points, level with defending champions Australia, separated only by a whisker in Net Run Rate.
“Not sure how we lost this game. We had it in the bag. We’ve worked so hard and when the last five overs slip away from you, it’s heartbreaking. This is the third straight game we’ve lost after coming so close,” lamented India captain Harmanpreet Kaur.</p><small>2025-10-19 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1922520051acfad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949968/manchester-united-stretch-liverpool-losing-streak-to-four-games' target='_blank'><strong>Manchester United stretch Liverpool losing streak to four games</strong></a><br><p>Liverpool slumped to a fourth consecutive defeat for the first time in 11 years as Manchester United won 2-1 on Sunday to end their near decade-long wait for victory at Anfield.
Harry Maguire’s 84th-minute header secured back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time in Ruben Amorim’s tenure as United boss.
Twelve minutes from time, Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo’s opener after just 61 seconds.
Defeat leaves Liverpool four points adrift of Arsenal at the top of the table and Arne Slot still searching for answers in how to get the right blend after splashing out nearly £450 million ($604 million) on new players in the transfer market.
United close to within two points of their historic rivals and up to ninth in the table to ease the pressure on Amorim after his biggest win in nearly a year in charge.
Liverpool had only lost one of the previous 14 Premier League meetings between the sides and United had not tasted victory at Anfield since the early days of Jurgen Klopp’s reign in January 2016.
However, the Reds are in a state of flux after transforming the squad that stormed to the title last season and the tragic loss of Diogo Jota, who died in a car accident in July.
After three consecutive defeats for the first time in Slot’s reign, Liverpool could barely have imagined a worse start.
Mbeumo sped past Virgil van Dijk with ease before firing past Giorgi Mamardashvili from Amad Diallo’s pass after barely a minute.
The home side and support were furious that play was not stopped in the build-up after Alexis MacAllister went down with a head injury, inflicted by his own captain Van Dijk.
Slot left £100 million signing Florian Wirtz on the bench for the second consecutive game as he looked in vain to find the right balance between defence and attack.
Gakpo should have levelled for the defending champions when he hit the post from Mohamed Salah’s through ball in Liverpool’s one flowing move of the first half.
However, it was United who should have been further in front by half-time.
Bruno Fernandes spurned a glorious chance to double the Red Devils’ lead when he hit the outside of the post when unmarked from the edge of the area.
At the other end, Senne Lammens was rarely troubled in the first 45 minutes, but produced a big save when called upon to deny Alexander Isak his first Premier League goal since joining Liverpool for a British transfer record £125 million.
A Gakpo deflected cross then came back off the post and the Dutchman rattled the woodwork for a third time early in the second half.
Slot turned to his near £200 million in forward options off the bench as Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike were introduced on the hour mark to join Salah, Gakpo and Isak in a five-man attack.
Salah has scored more goals than any other player in this fixture, but his lack of form showed in a wild finish to slice wide with just Lammens to beat at the back post.
Liverpool’s wealth of attacking talent finally broke the door down when Federico Chiesa, who had replaced Isak moments earlier, drilled in a low cross that Gakpo converted from point blank range.
Yet, their defensive frailties meant parity only lasted six minutes as Maguire was left unmarked to head in Fernandes’s looping cross.
Gakpo should still have rescued a point when he headed wide with the goal gaping from Jeremie Frimpong’s inviting delivery.
But Liverpool fell to their first league defeat at Anfield in over a year in another blow to their hopes of usurping United with a record 21st English top-flight title.</p><small>2025-10-19 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/191917017424de0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949953/lahore-ranks-second-most-polluted-city-in-world-in-terms-of-air-quality' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ranks second most polluted city in world in terms of air quality</strong></a><br><p>Lahore was ranked the second most polluted city in the world in terms of air quality on Sunday, according to air quality monitoring platform IQAir.
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). Any IQAir AQI ranking above 150 is considered “unhealthy” and above 200 is considered “very unhealthy”.
The AQI reading for Lahore stood at a very unhealthy 189; it was just beaten by Delhi, which registered a reading of 212 around 7:30pm.
 


Additionally, levels of the pollutant PM2.5 were measured at 109 microgrammes per cubic metre of air (μg/m³), 21.8 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s annual PM2.5 guidelines.
PM2.5 particles are floating particulate matter in the air measuring 2.5 micrometres in diameter or less, according to IQAir. PM2.5 is so small that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream upon inhalation.
IQAir recommended on its website that residents in Lahore avoid outdoor exercise, run air purifiers and prioritise wearing masks. It also recommended closing all windows to avoid dirty air from outdoors.
Lahore has historically dealt with smog and poor air quality in the winter months.
Around this time last year, the air quality in Lahore was recorded at 394 amid the smog crisis, primarily fuelled by crop residue burning and industrial emissions. The smog caused widespread health issues among residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation and skin infections.
To combat smog this year, the Punjab government has introduced ‘smog guns’, with Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb stating that they were already in use across Lahore.
“Through this modern machine, tiny droplets of water are sprayed into the air to combat smog,“ she explained. “The water mist helps clean pollution and dust particles present in the atmosphere. This modern machinery is also being used in countries like China, India, and others to reduce smog.”</p><small>2025-10-19 15:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1911361470e6c73.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949908/suparco-launches-countrys-first-hyperspectral-satellite' target='_blank'><strong>Suparco launches country’s first ‘hyperspectral satellite’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Sunday launched its first Hyperspectral Satellite (HS-1) from a Chinese launch centre, the country’s space agency said, describing it as “a breakthrough achievement”.
Hyperspectral imaging is a type of advanced camera technology used in satellites to study the Earth and space, according to a study published in the Journal of Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience.
Unlike regular satellite cameras that capture only a few colours (like red, green, and blue), hyperspectral cameras capture hundreds of very narrow colour bands. This means they can detect tiny differences in light that the human eye, or even normal satellites, can’t see.
In a statement issued today, Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said, “The nation’s space agency today announced a breakthrough achievement with the successful launch of Pakistan’s first Hyperspectral Satellite (HS-1) from China.”

Detailing the function of the satellite, the statement said, “HS-1 satellite is engineered to capture ultra-precise hyperspectral imagery across hundreds of narrow spectral bands, offering unprecedented resolution for the analysis of land, vegetation, water, and urban features.”
“The cutting-edge technology is set to fundamentally transform Pakistan’s capacity in precision agriculture, rigorous environmental monitoring, urban planning, and proactive disaster management,” it said.
“HS-1 will empower the nation to precisely map crop vitality, soil moisture, and water quality, while rigorously tracking deforestation, pollution, and glacial melt.”
It added that the satellite will “enhance early warning systems and post-disaster assessments for catastrophic events like floods and landslides, especially across the northern regions”.
Per the agency, the satellite is also expected to aid “development initiatives such as CPEC by preemptively identifying geo-hazard risks and guiding sustainable infrastructure development”.
Chairman Suparco, Muhammad Yousaf Khan, “expressed profound gratitude for the Government of Pakistan’s support in bringing this pivotal national project to fruition”, the statement quoted him as saying.
“The data from the Hyperspectral Satellite is poised to revolutionise agricultural productivity, bolster climate resilience, and enable optimised management of the country’s vital natural resources.”
Underscoring the long-standing partnership between Pakistan and China in space science, the space agency continued: “The mission reflects the ever-growing strategic partnership and deep-rooted friendship between the two nations, who continue to cooperate in advancing peaceful space exploration and harnessing its benefits for socioeconomic development.”
“HS-1’s successful integration into Pakistan’s expanding space fleet marks a decisive step toward solidifying space technology excellence and reinforces Suparco’s vital role in driving national socioeconomic growth through innovative space applications.”
According to the press release, Project Director HS-1 Mushtaque Hussain Soomro stressed that the satellite “signals a definitive leap in Pakistan’s ambitious space roadmap, positioning the nation as an emerging leader in space technology for sustainable development”.
He also hailed the mission team’s collective dedication and technical brilliance, the statement said.
In a statement from his office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his appreciation for Pakistani engineers and scientists for the successful launch.
“The cooperation between Pakistan and China in space research, like in other sectors, is exemplary and of key importance,” the PM was quoted as saying. “We are grateful to our great and long-standing friend and strategic partner, China, for this exemplary collaboration.
“The hearts of Pakistanis beat with the Chinese people and leadership,” he added.
According to the statement,  the satellite will help Pakistan research environmental changes and geographical variations.
“This progress will prove to be an important milestone in combating the harmful effects of climate change,” PM Shehbaz said. “The satellite will significantly increase national capabilities in areas such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning and disaster management.”
Separately, in a statement issued today, the foreign office termed the development a major milestone and called it “a pivotal step forward in Pakistan’s space programme.”
 






FO said that the launch “reaffirms Suparco’s commitment to leveraging space technology for national development.”
It also “highlights the long-standing collaboration between Pakistan and China in the peaceful exploration of space and its application for socioeconomic progress.”
“Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar commended the scientists/technical teams from Pakistan and China working on HS-1 for their commitment, professional excellence and exemplary cooperation,” the statement said.
On October 15, Suparco announced the upcoming launch of the HS-1 satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in China.
Last month, a senior official from Suparco said the agency was integrating space-based applications into its disaster risk management framework, “paving a path anchored in science and international collaboration to better prepare for natural calamities”.
In July, the foreign ministry announced the successful launch of a remote sensing satellite from China, which aimed to “strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural monitoring and disaster management, among other capabilities”.
In August, Pakistan successfully launched a remote sensing satellite from a launch centre in China. The satellite aimed to strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural monitoring and disaster management, among other capabilities, according to a Foreign Office statement.</p><small>2025-10-19 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1914351690e2b39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949922/jewellery-stolen-from-louvre-priceless-says-french-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Jewellery stolen from Louvre ‘priceless’, says French minister</strong></a><br><p>France’s Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said that jewellery stolen from the Louvre Museum on Sunday in Paris was “priceless”.
The minister told French news outlets France Inter, France Info and Le Monde that “three or four” thieves had focused on two displays in the exhibition venue’s “Gallerie d’Apollon” (“Apollo’s Gallery”), completing their broad daylight robbery in just seven minutes.
Earlier in the day, France’s Culture Minister Rachida Dati reported a break-in at the Louvre in Paris, as the world-renowned museum said it was closing for the day.
“A hold-up took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre Museum,” she wrote on X, using a French word that can also mean “robbery”.
“No injuries reported. I’m on site with museum staff and police,” she added.
 






At least one person had entered the museum, a member of her team told AFP, without adding anything about any possible theft.
The Louvre said it was closing for the day “for exceptional reasons”.
The museum was not immediately available for comment.</p><small>2025-10-19 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1913085896107b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949914/pakistans-jf-17-block-iii-jets-touch-down-in-azerbaijan-for-bilateral-aerial-combat-exercise' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s JF-17 Block-III jets touch down in Azerbaijan for bilateral aerial combat exercise</strong></a><br><p>A Pakistan Air Force (PAF) contingent comprising JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets, accompanied by skilled air and ground crew, has landed in Azerbaijan to participate in a bilateral aerial combat exercise, the military’s media wing said on Sunday.
