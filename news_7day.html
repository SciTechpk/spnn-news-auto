The premier is participating in the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit, alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev.
 


Addressing the summit, PM Shehbaz congratulated Aliyev and the Azerbaijani nation on their Republic Day. “The way Azeri nation fought for its liberation, you earned a high position in the community of nations.”
He also felicitated the Turkish president for “very skillfully resolving the issue” of the PKK, referring to the Kurdish rebels’ recent decision to disband. “That goes to explain in volumes, my brother, your diplomatic skills to resolve this issue and by virtue of this, you have earned a high place and influence not only in the region, but beyond.”
Addressing Aliyev, the premier thanked him for the hospitality shown to him and his delegation, noting that today’s summit “reflects the meeting of hearts and souls of genuine friends and sincere well-wishers”.
Recalling the “most fruitful discussions” at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit last year in Kazakhstan, PM Shehbaz said, “We are now eagerly looking forward to taking our trilateral partnership to new heights that would be in consonance with the wishes and desires of our people.
“This would be no surprise to anyone as Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkiye are bound together by deep historical, cultural and spiritual ties forged through centuries of shared values and mutual support,” he asserted.
“This historical relationship has been further strengthened as we have stood by each other, whether it be on Karabakh, Kashmir or northern Turkish Cyprus. Our strength lies in our solidarity and mutual respect.”
According to Radio Pakistan, the prime minister will also address a ceremony marking Azerbaijan’s Independence Day later today.
PM Shehbaz arrived in Lachin yesterday on the third leg of his four-nation tour after visiting Tukiye and Iran. He will later depart for Tajikistan, where he will attend the International Conference on Glaciers in Dushanbe.
Yesterday, the premier held a bilateral meeting with President Ilham Aliyev and thanked him for Azerbaijan’s support during the recent confrontation with India. Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir was also present on the occasion.
Both leaders “underscored the importance of coordinated efforts to promote regional stability, mutual prosperity, and principled positions on key international issues”, a press release by the PM’s Office said.
The prime minister thanked Azerbaijan for its “steadfast support during the recent Pakistan-India confrontation in the face of Indian provocation and acknowledged the public expressions of solidarity from both the leadership and the people of brotherly Azerbaijan,” the statement added.
He said that people of Azerbaijan celebrated Pakistan’s success in the Marka-e-Haq against India.
They reaffirmed their shared commitment to diversifying the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues.
The Azerbaijan side agreed to the exchange of delegations regarding the progress of Azerbaijan’s investment in Pakistan. In this regard, it was agreed that delegation-level talks will be organised soon.
In a separate message, PM Shehbaz extended heartfelt felicitations to President Aliyev and the brotherly people of Azerbaijan on the joyous occasion of Azerbaijan’s Independence Day on the behalf of the people and Government of Pakistan.
In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan deeply values its close fraternal bonds with Azerbaijan-rooted in shared history, mutual trust and unwavering support for each other.
Shehbaz said that “it gives me great pleasure to be able to celebrate this historic day in Azerbaijan, alongside President Aliyev and our Azerbaijani brothers and sisters”.
The prime minister expressed confidence that under President Aliyev’s “wise and sagacious leadership, our multi-dimensional partnership will continue to grow from strength to strength”.

With a public holiday, the nation is celebrating Youm-i-Takbeer to mark the historic day of May 28, 1998 when Pakistan joined the ranks of nuclear powers after atomic tests in the hills of Chagai, Balochistan. Pakistan became the seventh nuclear nation in the world and the first Muslim state to have a nuclear arsenal.
PM Shehbaz emphasised that Youm-i-Takbeer was more than a celebration and was a solemn reminder of Pakistan’s resolve to safeguard its sovereignty, according to his statement carried by the Associated Press of Pakistan.
He linked this year’s commemoration with what he described as Pakistan’s recent success in defending itself from “an unjustified war imposed by India”. Appreciating the nation’s spirit during the confrontation, the premier said, “The joys of Youm-i-Takbeer have further increased for a nation filled with victory.”
 






President Zardari also observed: “In today’s evolving regional security situation, our nuclear capability continues to serve as a credible minimum deterrent that guarantees our peace and ensures that no one can undermine our sovereignty and national security.”
In a statement, he highlighted that the 1998 achievement was not “merely a demonstration of our technological advancement — it was a calculated decision to ensure peace through strength, to maintain the strategic balance in South Asia, and to protect our nation against any external aggression”.
Twenty-seven years ago, a team of Pakistani scientists led by Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr Samar Mubarakmand carried out nuclear tests in the Raskoh Hills in Chagai, upon Nawaz’s decision in response to Indian nuclear tests.
 
 

PM Shehbaz, in a post on X, said: “We thank Allah Almighty for His countless blessings and for granting us yet another glorious victory in the face of recent Indian aggression.”
“We commend our valiant armed forces for their unwavering resolve and determination to defend the nation’s frontiers against all external and internal threats.
“In the same spirit of unity and resolve, we pledge to build Pakistan into a strong economic power that would become the envy of the world,” the premier vowed.
He hailed his brother and then-PM Nawaz Sharif for making “Pakistan’s defence invincible with his bold and courageous decision in 1998 to go ahead with a peaceful nuclear test in the face of strong opposition from many powerful countries”.
He also paid tribute to former president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for his “visionary leadership”, as well as “brilliant scientists and engineers who turned the vision and aspirations of the entire nation into reality”.
 






In his statement on the occasion, PM Shehbaz urged the nation to carry the spirit of Youm-i-Takbeer beyond defence and into economic transformation.
Thanking patriotic Pakistanis, he said, “I salute the nation, which made immense sacrifices for the completion of the nuclear programme and wrote a proud story of its determination and faith.”
Reflecting on the historic nuclear tests conducted during Nawaz’s tenure, Shehbaz noted that the decision to respond with six nuclear tests, compared to India’s five, was a demonstration of “iron resolve” in the face of global pressure and sanctions.
“Mr Nawaz Sharif represented the aspirations and national interests of the entire nation … and made our geographical borders impregnable forever,” the premier stressed.
The premier also paid glowing tribute to the architects of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, including Bhutto and Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan. He invoked the leadership of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and said, “National history is a witness that the people and political leadership of Pakistan have always made the impossible possible.”
 
 

In his message on the occasion, President Zardari noted that Pakistan “demonstrated its strategic patience and commitment to peace” in the face of recent unprovoked Indian aggression.
“Our calibrated response, under Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, was measured and effective, which forced the enemy to cease its hostile actions.”
He reaffirmed that Pakistan did not seek conflict and was committed to the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for international law. “This day serves as a reminder of our commitment to safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of our beloved country,” the president said.
President Zardari also paid a rich tribute to Pakistani scientists, engineers, as civil and military leadership. He also appreciated Bhutto for laying the foundation of the nuclear programme and ex-premier Benazir Bhutto’s role in further strengthening it.
 






Armed forces renew ‘unflinching resolve’ to defend motherland against all threats
The armed forces of Pakistan, along with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the services chiefs, also extended their heartfelt felicitations to the nation on the 27th anniversary of Youm-i-Takbeer.
A statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) noted: “This day underscores Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to preserving its sovereignty and territorial integrity. It affirms our doctrine of credible minimum deterrence, rooted in the principle of maintaining peace and strategic stability in the region.”
 






The armed forces reiterated their “unflinching resolve to defend the motherland against all threats across the full spectrum of conflict”.
“As responsible custodians of the nation’s strategic assets, we reaffirm that our nuclear capability remains solely for defensive purposes and stands as a guarantor of peace,” the military reaffirmed.
“Youm-i-Takbeer commemorates the momentous occasion in 1998 when Pakistan emerged as a nuclear power — restoring the strategic balance in South Asia and asserting its sovereign right to self-defence,” it noted.
The ISPR highlighted that the historic achievement epitomised the nation’s resolve, unity and unwavering pursuit of a dignified and peaceful existence.
 
 

“Pakistan’s strategic capability is a national trust, reflecting the collective aspirations of its people. The commemoration of Youm-i-Takbeer is a tribute to the foresight of visionary leadership, the brilliance of our scientists and engineers, and the countless contributions of all those who rendered Pakistan’s defence unassailable,” it added.
“Let this day renew our collective pledge to remain vigilant, united and resolute in our commitment to the security, progress, and prosperity of our beloved homeland.” The armed forces honoured the “sacrifices that made this milestone possible”.
‘Pakistan’s defence is unshakable’
Nawaz, hailed for his leadership during the 1998 nuclear tests, posted on X: “Happy Youm-i-Takbeer to the nation.”
 






The ex-premier’s daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, addressing his father, said: “The service to Pakistan that Allah Almighty wrote in your destiny, has not been shared by anyone else.”
 






In his message, Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah noted: “May 28 marks Pakistan’s dignity, resolve and scientific strength.”
Paying tribute to Bhutto and Benazir, he asserted, “Pakistan’s defence is unshakable, we stand united.”
 






Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi noted that Youm-i-Takbeer had become a “metaphor for pride, determination and dignity for the Pakistani nation”.
“Youm-i-Takbeer is not just a day, but an ideology, a pledge, a message that Pakistan will always remain strong and enduring.”
The Balochistan government’s X account called the 1998 tests a “historic moment of strength, unity and deterrence”.
The PTI paid tribute to the late Dr Abdul Qadeer, saying: “The credit for making Pakistan a nuclear power goes to Dr Abdul Qadeer and his colleagues.
“The entire nation is grateful to them for this great achievement. May Allah Almighty reward them greatly for it. We pay tribute to them for this great service to the country and nation.”
 






Former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari “credited the “foresight and unparalleled courage” of his grandfather Bhutto, who “showed the dream of making Pakistan a nuclear power and provided a practical basis for it”.
“Our nuclear defence is a symbol of the trust of these martyrs and their unparalleled sacrifices, and a strong shield for future generations. We should never forget how much struggle and sacrifice are behind it,” the MNA said in a post on X.
“Let us all work together to build a Pakistan that is a true reflection of peace, progress and the hopes of the people.”
 






In a separate statement issued by his party, Bilawal “saluted the tireless efforts of Pakistan’s scientists, engineers, armed forces and visionary political leadership”.
He also remembered his mother Benazir, who, “with her sagacity and determination, protected and advanced the nuclear programme during her tenure”.</p><small>2025-05-28 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/281502197d06053.jpg?r=150337' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913860/pen-international-calls-on-govt-to-halt-mass-deportations-of-afghans-from-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>PEN International calls on govt to halt mass deportations of Afghans from Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>PEN International, an association of writers, called on the government to immediately halt the mass deportation of Afghans from Pakistan, including writers, journalists and others at risk of persecution from the Taliban, according to a statement.
As of May 18, a total of 55,865 Afghan nationals including 35,975 ACC holders and 19,890 illegal migrants have left for Afghanistan since April 1, the day the second phase began after the deadline for repatriation of registered Afghan nationals ended on March 31.
The PEN International-led joint statement, signed by freedom of expression and human rights organisations, concerns the recent acceleration in the mass deportation of Afghans from Pakistan, including at-risk writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders and others at risk of persecution from the Taliban for their peaceful expression.
 
 

More than a dozen organisations called on the government to “immediately halt the arbitrary mass deportation of Afghan nationals in line with the country’s human rights obligations, including the principle of non-refoulement.
“We urge the international community to continue to provide safety to at-risk Afghans, including writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders and others who fled the Taliban’s persecution,” PEN International said.
It noted that the government’s decision to deport Afghan nationals, announced on October 3, 2023, drew “significant concern” from international institutions, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration, who urged the government to continue to protect at-risk Afghans.
“Despite the UNHCR’s active non-return advisory for Afghanistan and calls from UN experts to halt the deportations, the government of Pakistan has accelerated its forced returns in recent months, resulting in over 30,000 deportations in April alone,” the statement said.
“Included among those deported who are at greatest risk of persecution are writers, journalists, artists, and human rights defenders who continue to face significant threats of arbitrary arrest, torture and imprisonment for any form of expression that the Taliban deem incompatible with their ideology.
“Women and girls deported to Afghanistan will face overwhelming levels of repression impacting every aspect of their lives, amounting to what UN experts have described as ‘gender apartheid’,” the statement read.
Many of those who fled across the border into Pakistan following the Taliban’s return to de facto rule in August 2021 had planned to travel onwards to a country of safety, PEN International stated
“However, the suspension of humanitarian visa pathways and inadequate support for at-risk Afghans in countries around the world, including the US, the UK and Germany, has left many stranded in a situation of abject precarity and insecurity.”
For the over one million Afghan refugees and asylum seekers who remain in Pakistan, the intensifying crackdown by Pakistani authorities, which includes mass arrests and other forms of harassment, has instilled a renewed sense of fear in a community already blighted by conflict and marginalisation, PEN International emphasised.
“In light of the severe risk posed by the Taliban, the undersigned organisations call on the government of Pakistan to immediately suspend its ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’.
“We also call on the international community to ensure safe and legal passage for Afghan refugees and asylum seekers, including writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders, and others at risk of persecution for their peaceful expression.

He was also critical of the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) performance, especially in terms of the Tajir Dost Scheme (TDS).
Under the TDS, taxes were to be collected from shopkeepers at a fixed rate of Rs100 to Rs60,000 per month based on the fair market value of the stores and sales. The scheme was implemented to bring traders and wholesalers into the formal tax structure to fulfill the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) requirement.
The former finance minister said the FBR had failed to bring more people under tax net, while responding to a query on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’ on the board’s inability to raise Rs5.6 million under the TDS.
Mandviwalla criticised the “1960’s system” at the FBR and emphasised on the need to introduce officers who could use technology to improve the taxation system, giving examples of Turkey and India.
“Every year we hear the FBR will be reformed but it doesn’t happen.”
He also confirmed that the upcoming budget will be a “standard-type budget” and will be a burden on public’s pockets.
“I have no expectation of relief from the budget.”
The chief of the Senate standing committee on finance said the petroleum levy will be increased as to offset the shortfall of Rs700 billion revenue.
“Levy will be applied, public will pay for it and this is how budget’s deficit will be will be overcome.”
Last year, the federal government had set a target to collect Rs1.28 trillion through the petroleum levy in the fiscal year 2024-25, marking a 47.4 per cent increase over the previous year’s target.
In June, the government decided not to let the petroleum prices decline from Rs80, as it could trigger increased demand, encourage carbon emissions and cost higher foreign exchange.
Moreover, the government had also given an undertaking to the IMF to impose about Rs5 per litre carbon levy as part of the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility with effect from July 1.</p><small>2025-05-28 10:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/28143850cc29075.jpg?r=143859' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913862/death-toll-from-heavy-downpour-across-country-rises-to-10' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from heavy downpour across country rises to 10</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from heavy rains across the country has risen to 10, with 43 people injured, as strong winds and thunderstorms triggered flash floods and destroyed homes in central and northern parts of Pakistan, officials said on Wednesday.
This is the second time in a week that a storm of such intensity wreaked havoc in many parts of the country, damaging crops, properties, and other infrastructure. At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains had battered many areas in Islamabad, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday.
Four women and a man died in Kashmir and three in KP, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said, while other officials said two died in Punjab.
“One person is still missing,” Haroon Rasheed, a senior government official in Kashmir, told AFP, adding that 12 houses and a mosque were destroyed in one village.
According to the NDMA, stormy weather is expected to continue in northern and central parts of the country until Saturday.
Pakistan is grappling with increasingly frequent extreme weather events blamed on climate change. Temperatures reached near-record levels in April — as high as 46.5 Celsius in parts of Punjab. Schools in Punjab and Balochistan have closed early for summer vacations because of the heat.</p><small>2025-05-28 10:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/281340526d3679d.jpg?r=134057' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913855/pakistan-slams-modis-inflammatory-monologue-urges-india-to-honour-international-order' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan slams Modi’s ‘inflammatory monologue’, urges India to honour international order</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Wednesday condemned the “inflammatory monologue” delivered by Indian PM Narendra Modi in Gujarat, urging India to “return to the core principles of international order”.
The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
In a video posted by Indian news outlet ANI, Modi, addressing India’s youth, calls into question the contents of the Indus Waters Treaty. He said, “If you study the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, you’ll be shocked.”
 






He continued, “It was decided that the dams built on the rivers of Jammu and Kashmir would not be cleaned… For 60 years, these gates were never opened. Reservoirs that were supposed to be filled to 100 per cent capacity have now been reduced to only 2pc or 3pc.”
Stating that the treaty has only been held in abeyance as of now, he added, “Right now, I haven’t done anything, and people are sweating there [Pakistan].”
Calling Modi’s remarks “unexpected”, the FO in its statement urged India to set aside its project of “historical revisionism”.
 






The FO termed India’s approach towards the treaty as a “troubling departure from international norms”, while drawing a contrast between Pakistan and India’s regional conduct and global ambitions.
“A leadership truly in pursuit of international respect might first look inward, and seek to cleanse its conscience before issuing threats to others,” the statement read.
It further added, “Pakistan urges India to return to the core principles of international order including respect for sovereign rights of others and its treaty obligations, as well as restraint in both language and action.”
The FO in its statement cautioned that “Jingoism may stir applause on the campaign trail, but it undermines long-term peace and stability”. It continued that “India’s youth, often the first casualty of chauvinistic nationalism, would do well to reject the politics of fear and instead work toward a future defined by dignity, reason, and regional cooperation”.
The statement read that such acts may serve domestic optics but cannot withstand international scrutiny or inspire India’s image as a responsible regional power, while highlighting that “the ideological followers of India’s current government have normalised mob violence, promoted hate campaigns and targeted religious minorities”.
“The Indian government is linked to extraterritorial assassinations and foreign subversion.
India is in occupation of foreign people and territories. Its record in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir is defined by systematic repression. It is ironic that such a state now attempts to claim the mantle of victimhood.“</p><small>2025-05-28 08:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/28123124a5b534c.jpg?r=124129' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913853/competition-commission-fines-housing-society-rs150m-for-misleading-advertising' target='_blank'><strong>Competition Commission fines housing society Rs150m for misleading advertising</strong></a><br><p>In a significant move to curb deceptive marketing practices, the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) imposed a hefty fine on a housing society for false and misleading advertisements.
“The commission imposed a penalty of Rs150 million on Kingdom Valley Pvt Ltd for misleading advertisements concerning its housing project,” read a statement by the CCP.
The CCP’s Office of Fair Trade initiated an investigation after taking notice and found that the company “falsely advertised its project as Kingdom Valley Islamabad, despite it being located in Mouza Choora, tehsil and district Rawalpindi”.
It added that the company misrepresented affiliations with the Naya Pakistan Housing Program (NPHP) and Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority (NAPHDA).
Furthermore, it was noted that the company publicised the project as ‘NOC [no-objection certificate] Approved’ without accurate or complete disclosure regarding its approval status.
The commission’s bench, comprising Saeed Ahmed Nawaz and Abdul Rashid Sheikh, concluded that the company violated Sections 10(2)(a) and 10(2)(b) of the Competition Act, 2010, which prohibits dissemination of false or misleading information to consumers.
Consequently, the companied imposed a fine of Rs75 million for each violation, amounting to a total fine of Rs150 million.
In addition, the commission noted serious non-compliance on behalf of the company, including its failure to submit audited financial statements.
The company has not filed financials with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for several years, raising concerns about its governance and transparency.
In the statement, the CCP reiterated its commitment to protecting consumers from “deceptive marketing practices and ensuring fair competition in the housing and real estate sector”.
It urged buyers and stakeholders to report deceptive advertisements or anti-competitive behaviour to the commission.</p><small>2025-05-28 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/281211067fcd21d.jpg?r=133801' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913851/spacexs-starship-spins-out-of-control-after-flying-past-points-of-previous-failures' target='_blank'><strong>SpaceX’s Starship spins out of control after flying past points of previous failures</strong></a><br><p>SpaceX’s Starship rocket roared into space from Texas on Tuesday but spun out of control about halfway through its flight without achieving some of its most important testing goals, bringing fresh engineering hurdles to CEO Elon Musk’s increasingly turbulent Mars rocket programme.
The 400-foot tall (122 metre) Starship rocket system, the core of Musk’s goal of sending humans to Mars, lifted off from SpaceX’s Starbase, Texas, launch site, flying beyond the point of two previous explosive attempts earlier this year that sent debris streaking over Caribbean islands and forced dozens of airliners to divert course.
For the latest launch, the ninth full test mission of Starship since the first attempt in April 2023, the upper-stage cruise vessel was lofted to space atop a previously flown booster — a first such demonstration of the booster’s reusability.
 

People wait to watch SpaceX’s next-generation Starship spacecraft launch on its ninth test, at South Padre Island, Texas, US, May 27, 2025.— Reuters

But SpaceX lost contact with the 232-foot lower-stage booster during its descent before it plunged into the sea, rather than making the controlled splashdown the company had planned.
Starship, meanwhile, continued into suborbital space but began to spin uncontrollably roughly 30 minutes into the mission. The errant spiraling came after SpaceX cancelled a plan to deploy eight mock Starlink satellites into space — the rocket’s “Pez” candy dispenser-like mechanism failed to work as designed.
“Not looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,” SpaceX broadcaster Dan Huot said on a company livestream.
Musk was scheduled to deliver an update on his space exploration ambitions in a speech from Starbase following the test flight, billed as a livestream presentation about “The Road to Making Life Multiplanetary.” Hours later, he had yet to give the speech and there was no sign that he intended to do so.
In a post on X, Musk touted Starship’s scheduled shutdown of an engine in space, a step previous test flights achieved last year. He said a leak on Starship’s primary fuel tank led to its loss of control.
“Lot of good data to review,” he said.
“Launch cadence for next three flights will be faster, at approximately one every three to four weeks.”
 






SpaceX has said the Starship models that have flown this year bear significant design upgrades from previous prototypes, as thousands of company employees work to build a multi-purpose rocket capable of putting massive batches of satellites in space, carrying humans back to the moon and ultimately ferrying astronauts to Mars.
Risk-tolerant
The recent setbacks indicate SpaceX is struggling to overcome a complicated chapter of Starship’s multibillion-dollar development. But the company’s engineering culture, widely considered more risk-tolerant than many of the aerospace industry’s more established players, is built on a flight-testing strategy that pushes spacecraft to the point of failure, then fine-tunes improvements through frequent repetition.
Starship’s planned trajectory for Tuesday included a nearly full orbit around Earth for a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean to test new designs of its heat shield tiles and revised flaps for steering its blazing re-entry and descent through Earth’s atmosphere.
But its early demise, appearing as a fireball streaking eastward through the night sky over southern Africa, puts another pause in Musk’s speedy development goals for a rocket bound to play a central role in the US space programme.
NASA plans to use the rocket to land humans on the moon in 2027, though that moon programme faces turmoil amid Musk’s Mars-focused influence over US President Donald Trump’s administration.
Mishap probe
Federal regulators had granted SpaceX a licence for Starship’s latest flight attempt four days ago, capping a mishap investigation that had grounded Starship for nearly two months.
The last two test flights — in January and March — were cut short moments after liftoff as the vehicles blew to pieces on ascent, raining debris over parts of the Caribbean and disrupting scores of commercial airline flights in the region.
The Federal Aviation Administration expanded debris hazard zones around the ascent path for Tuesday’s launch.
The previous back-to-back failures occurred in early test-flight phases that SpaceX had easily achieved before, in a striking setback to a program that Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who founded the rocket company in 2002, had sought to accelerate this year.
Musk, the world’s wealthiest individual and a key supporter of US President Donald Trump, was especially eager for a success after vowing in recent days to refocus his attention on his various business ventures, including SpaceX, following a tumultuous foray into national politics and his attempts at cutting government bureaucracy.
Closer to home, Musk also sees Starship as eventually replacing the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as the workhorse in the company’s commercial launch business, which already lofts most of the world’s satellites and other payloads to low-Earth orbit.</p><small>2025-05-28 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2807401366afc0a.png?r=074024' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913808/government-plans-curbs-incentives-to-push-cashless-economy' target='_blank'><strong>Government plans curbs, incentives to push cashless economy</strong></a><br><p>• Finance minister vows to shift tax burden away from salaried class, other documented sectors

ISLAMABAD: As part of pre-budget consultations with stakeholders, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday promised to shift the tax burden away from the salaried class and documented sector to others through digitisation, and hinted at major steps towards the compulsory use of digital payments to maximise a cashless economy and increase documented transactions.
A Ministry of Finance team, led by the minister, had a series of meetings with commercial banks, development financial institutions, regulators and industrial representatives, including ceramics manufacturers and steel producers, to discuss policy measures for inclusion in the next year’s federal budget.
 
 

Some of the proposals finalised during these meetings are believed to be strategic in nature to capture most of the undocumented economy through digitisation, including additional tax measures on cash transactions, incentives on digital payments and outrightly blocking cash payments in certain critical sectors to be identified by the Federal Board of Revenue with the support of Karandaaz, the Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited and the banking sector.
One of the meetings on accelerating Pakistan’s transition to a digital and less cash-dependent economy finalised a host of measures for inclusion in the federal budget to expand access to digital financial services, encourage the use of digital transactions, and reduce reliance on cash in everyday economic activity.
The meeting decided to fine-tune measures for the budget given the fact that digital payment options were widely available and accessible across various sectors, including retail, services and public sector transactions.
The participants supported steps that would encourage broad-based interoperability, leveraging Raast instant payments system in particular, leading to improved consumer choice in using digital payments platforms, according to a statement.
 
 

The meeting agreed that creating a more level playing field between cash and digital transactions was essential, and that incentive structures should be rebalanced to make digital payments more attractive and cost-effective for both consumers and businesses.
The importance of imp­r­oving cost structures related to digital transaction infrastructure, including merchant acquisition and service provision, was taken as a priority to enable wider outreach, especially for small merchants and underserved communities.
The finance minister believed that moving towards a cashless economy was not simply a policy aspiration, but a practical necessity for long-term fiscal resilience, competitiveness and inclusive growth.
“Digitalisation is the foundation of a modern financial system. We must move with urgency and coordination to create a payments environment that is inclusive, interoperable, and focused on ease of use for every Pakistani citizen,” he said.
Engagements with industry
In a meeting with a delegation of the All Pakistan Ceramic Tiles Manufacturers Association (APCTMA) and Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSA), Mr Aurangzeb said the government was committed to shifting the tax burden away from the already compliant formal sector and the salaried class towards segments of the economy that have so far remained undocumented or under-taxed.
The prime minister is personally leading high-level meetings to drive forward reforms that enhance transparency, documentation and economic equity across all, he said, adding that broadening the tax base is essential to achieving fiscal balance and promoting fairness in the economy.
The ceramic tiles manufacturers reported the manufacturing capacity at about 560,000 square metres per day, backed by over Rs100 billion in investments, nearly 60 per cent of which is foreign direct investment from China. They said the industry has reduced import dependency from 74pc to just 4pc and now relies almost entirely on local raw materials and labour.
 
 

The minister also assured the delegation that reforms in the energy sector were a top policy priority and envisaged a series of measures aimed at improving affordability, ensuring reliability, and moving towards a more efficient and targeted energy pricing structure.
He also pledged to simplify regulatory procedures, reduce compliance burden, and create a stable and predictable policy environment to attract further investment.
Credit access for small farmers
The finance minister also chaired a meeting of the Task Force on National Initiative to Unlock Un-Collateralised Credit for Small Farmers Through Tech-Driven Solutions. He reviewed the recommendations for the National Subsistence Farmers Support Initiative, aimed at unlocking uncollateralised financing for small-scale farmers through innovative, technology-based solutions and enhanced access to credit.
The proposed scheme would employ an end-to-end digital process to ensure transparency, efficiency, and a seamless customer experience.
 
 

Designed as a federal programme with nationwide coverage, the initiative aims to align provincial and national efforts to boost agricultural productivity, enhance food security, and contribute meaningfully to GDP growth through inclusive agri-development.
A revised scorecard was presented by the task force with a greater emphasis on agronomic factors — raising the weightage of agronomy from 40pc to 60pc — while maintaining a 40pc weight on financial indicators, thereby rebalancing priorities to better reflect the realities of smallholder farming.
The prototype scheme, developed by the Ministry of Finance’s Task Force on Access to Finance, calls for a multi-bank and microfinance institution (MFI) delivery model implemented through a unified methodology, ensuring wide outreach and operational standardisation across financial institutions.
It was decided to make the entire process time-bound and action-oriented to achieve lasting impact and then replicate a parallel, tech-supported model for the dairy and livestock segment, as most smallholder farmers maintain herds but faced difficulties in securing financing for livestock acquisition, maintenance, and dairy product marketing.
The delegation of Large Steel Producers raised critical challenges facing the steel industry, including high energy costs, regulatory inconsistencies, and the need for a stable policy environment to ensure long-term investment and growth. They also highlighted the impact of taxation policies on formal businesses and sought government support to level the playing field.
The finance minister promised to resolve these challenges and reiterated that every sector must play its role in stabilising and growing the economy.
“We cannot allow the burden to fall solely on the formal sector and the salaried class,” he was quoted as saying, adding that the government was pursuing a broad-based strategy to expand the tax base, reduce reliance on over-taxed segments and bring the undocumented economy into the fold.

• One killed, 10 injured in Attock; three injured in Rawalpindi, residents forced to take steps to protect their vehicles and other property
ISLAMABAD: As windstorms have become rampant in the federal capital, the district administration has decided to remove billboards in the city to avoid the risk of accidents.
On Tuesday, a billboard fixed at the National Press Club (NPC) fell down due to a windstorm. Moreover, a number of trees were broken and several fiberglass shades on terraces and rooftops dislodged and fell onto the roads.
Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Irfan Nawaz Memon directed that all billboards within the limits of the federal capital be removed.
It is worth mentioning that in urban areas, there are only two locations — NPC and Srinagar Highway (near G-13) - where billboards have been displayed. However, there are a number of billboards in the rural areas of the city which are also under the administrative control of the deputy commissioner.
Meanwhile, after the windstorm, the district administration directed all field teams to remain in the field and deal with any kind of emergency situation. “All the assistant commissioners were also directed to keep an eye on low-lying areas to avoid the risk of floods,” a spokesperson said.
Last month, a hailstorm lashed Islamabad and its surrounding areas, causing severe damage to vehicles, solar panels, and property, especially in sectors located near the Margalla Hills. The incident panicked residents as they experienced a similar, though slightly less intense, hailstorm just a few days later.
This has strengthened the belief and fear that the city will continue to face similar situations in the coming months and years. The windstorm on Tuesday again disrupted life in the federal capital and forced residents to take steps to protect their vehicles and other property. As soon as the gusty winds began, a number of bikers took refuge under bridges, fearing injury from the hailstorm.

Rawalpindi
Three people, including two children, were injured in different areas as gusty winds battered the garrison city on Tuesday afternoon. The light rain, accompanied by gusty winds, lashed the twin cities while providing some relief to residents from the heatwave.
The wind speed was recorded at 50 knots (98 kilometres per hour) from north to west at Islamabad International Airport, and 45 knots (80km per hour) from south to west at Zero Point. The Met Office recorded nine millimeters of rain at the Islamabad airport, 1mm at Golra in Islamabad, 2mm at Shamsabad and 1mm at Chaklala in Rawalpindi.
Though the gusty winds blew away some signboards and shelters, there were no reports of damage to public property. The wind and rain made the weather pleasant and provided some relief to people who had been facing scorching heat and humid conditions in the afternoon.
District Officer Emergency Sibghatullah told Dawn that due to strong winds, two incidents were reported in the garrison city. He said two children at Girja Road and one person at Mir Haider Colony were injured.
The two children were injured at home when an iron door on the roof fell during the thunderstorm. Rescue 1122 rushed to Malik Colony, Girja Road and shifted the children to Rawalpindi Teaching Hospital. The children were identified as Anabia Zara, aged 10 months, and Rajab Ali, 12 years.
In the second incident, a person fell from a ladder during the gusty winds at Mir Haider Colony near Ashra Mubashara Masjid. Rescue 1122 shifted him to Military Hospital.
 
 

A Met official said moist currents were also penetrating the upper and central parts of the country. A westerly wave is also affecting the western and upper parts of the country.
However, she added that hot and dry weather was expected in most parts of the country, but partly cloudy weather with rain-wind/thunderstorms at isolated places in Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
She said the temperature was expected to rise again on Wednesday morning. Due to high pressure in the upper atmosphere, day temperatures are likely to increase in most parts of the country.
Taxila
A storm swept through various parts of Attock on Tuesday resulting in the death of one person and leaving 10 others, including five minors, injured. The storm accompanied by heavy rainfall, strong winds and hail caused widespread disruption, uprooting trees, damaging property, walls and causing roof collapses in various parts of the district.
According to Rescue 1122, a passenger van overturned due to rain and duststorm on Ghazi-Lawrencepur road near Ghazi Interchange in the limits of Hazro police station, resultantly in the death of one passenger and injuring five other.
Separately, four children aged between nine and 12 years were injured when the wall of their house collapsed during the windstorm in the village Rehmo in the limits of the same police station.
A 25-year-old woman received multiple injuries when the roof of her house collapsed in the limits of the same police station. Moreover, an eleven-year-old girl was critically injured when the wall of her house collapsed in Saghirabad area in the limits of Jand police station. Rescue 1122 shifted all the injured to health centres for medical treatment.

The report presented to the Punjab Assembly details the theft, disappearance and non-recovery of arms from police stores in 12 districts. The total value of the missing equipment is reported to exceed Rs245.5 million, none of which has been recovered to date.
As per the report, weapons worth over Rs83.4m went ‘missing’ from the Muzaffargarh DPO office between 2021 and 2023; arms and bullets valued at over Rs47.1m are unaccounted for in the DIG Operations Lahore office; weapons worth more than Rs46.8m missing from the Police Office Lahore have not been recovered.
Likewise, rifles and ammunition exceeding Rs7.4m value have disappeared from the CPO Multan’s office; the record of rifles issued to various officers in 2009 is missing from the Central Jail Lahore; weapons and equipment valued at Rs5.614m are missing from the DPO Sialkot office; arms worth Rs4.3m are missing from the DPO Sahiwal office; weapons and equipment exceeding Rs3.8m have disappeared from the DPO Okara office.

Home dept orders probe; house echoes with criticism of CCD, proposed Goonda Act

Arms worth Rs3.5m are missing from DPO Gujrat office; weapons and ammunition valued at over Rs2.6m have disappeared from the DPO Faisalabad office.
 
 

In response to the alarming findings, Punjab Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal has ordered an inquiry into the missing weapons’ report.
An inquiry committee has been formed, headed by the Additional IG Special Branch, with the Director-General Monitoring and Additional Secretary Judicial (Home) as members, says a spokesperson for the department.
The committee has been tasked with submitting a report within 10 days. It will also require responses regarding the irregularities detailed in the audit report.
The home department clarifies that it does not directly store weapons; rather, they are held by law enforcement agencies, who are responsible and accountable for the use of arms. Action will be taken against those found responsible upon receipt of the inquiry report, the spokesperson says quoting the home secretary.
Meanwhile, a general debate on law and order in the Punjab Assembly saw strong criticism from Leader of Opposition Ahmad Khan Bhachar regarding the absence of home department officials from the gallery.
“I am dismayed to see that no representative from the department was present.”
Following Bhachar’s strong objections, Panel of Chairperson Samiullah Khan expressed his displeasure, emphasising that the presence of senior home department officials is mandatory during discussions on law and order. He announced that a letter of disapproval would be sent to the home department regarding their absence.
Despite their absence, the opposition chose not to boycott the session, vowing to deliver speeches that would cause “annoyance to the government”.
Bhachar accused the government of failing completely to establish law and order in the province. He criticised the creation of a crime control department (CCD) that empowered 4,000 individuals despite the existence of a police force of 250,000.
Contradicting government claims of reduced crime, he cited alarming statistics for Lahore: 324 incidents on one day and 370 on another. He also recounted instances of police high-handedness, including stopping MPAs outside Adiala Jail, continued FIRs against them, and leaving them stranded after release. He labeled the Punjab Police as “savage beasts” serving only the “elite class.”
Bhachar condemned the government’s proposed “Goonda Act,” calling it a “black law” from the 1930s British era, designed to empower district intelligence committees and officers to intrude into people’s homes and expose them to sensitive agencies.
 
 

Opposition MPA Sheikh Imtiaz regretted that the standing committee chairmen would give protocol to the police officers summoned by the committee in different cases. He claimed that Punjab University students say that most of the ice in the varsity was sold by policemen.
Ahsan Raza, another PTI MPA, criticised the creation of CCD saying it is a system parallel to the police and leading to clash with the police.
Treasury MPA Rana Arshad defended the creation of CCD as a step to improve protection of the people.
Malik Arshad, another PML-N MPA, sought expansion of CCD to the whole province.
Opposition’s Junaid Sahi said CCD could become only a unit of the home department and not a full department. He demanded abolition of the 250,000-strong police department if 4,000 CCD officials could maintain order in the province.
Parliamentary secretary Khalid Ranjha wondered that the opposition cried hoarse on the law and order issue and when a department like CCD is established to improve the situation, it is criticised before giving it time to show performance. He asked why the opposition feared that the Goonda Act was being introduced for them.

Yet a victory celebration in an ongoing conflict seems premature. The exchange of missiles and drones may have stopped, but the tension between the two countries is far from over. In the words of the Indian prime minister, it’s just a “pause”. It’s an extremely dangerous situation that needs caution and not triumphalism.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s comment that Pakistan has taken revenge for the 1971 war seems highly questionable. Is there really any comparison between a war that led to the disintegration of the country and defeating the recent Indian attack? The 1971 tragedy was more than India’s military invasion; it was also a war within that we as a nation must never forget. The tragedy is etched in our conscience.
Attempts to politicise national security must also be avoided. The Indian aggression has united the country across the political spectrum. Political parties set aside their differences and stood behind the armed forces. But soon after the hostilities eased the daggers were out again, not realising the serious challenges the nation’s security continues to confront. The major responsibility obviously lies with the government to bring down the political temperature as the threat of another Indian escalation looms large. A politically divided country weakens the country’s defence.
Then there is also a question about the elevation of the army chief to field marshal and the extension in the air force chief’s tenure. Undoubtedly all the three forces did remarkably well in thwarting the Indian attack. The air force particularly played the most critical role not only in defending our airspace but also downing several Indian aircraft. It re-established Pakistan’s deterrence even in the conventional field. There is also no doubting of the leadership of the army chief.

Most troubling for India has been the strengthening of China-Pakistan defence collaboration.

Still, it’s difficult to understand the need to promote the army chief to the highest position just on the basis of four days of conflict. It was certainly not winning an all-out war. Gen Munir is the second military chief to be promoted to the five-star rank after Ayub Khan, the country’s first military dictator.
While giving full marks to the professional capabilities of our armed forces in taking on a much more powerful adversary, there is also a need to do a critical assessment of our vulnerabilities. It must be a cause for concern that the Indian missiles managed to hit some of our key airbases, including Nur Khan Airbase close to the capital. Surely the damage was not as much as being claimed by the Indian prime minister. Nevertheless, these gaps have to be plugged, as another Indian military strike seems very much on the cards.
The four-day military face-off that drove the two nuclear-armed neighbours close to a full-blown war also brought to the fore the fast-shifting regional and global geopolitics. India’s expectation of winning international approval for its military operation against Pakistan in response to the terrorist attack at a tourist spot in disputed territory failed miserably. Perhaps the most shocking development for the Modi government was President Trump’s claim to have brokered the ceasefire using trade as leverage.
One of the reasons for India’s failure to muster support for its military action even from its strategic allies in the West was that it failed to provide any solid evidence of Pakistan’s alleged involvement in the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India mostly relied on past incidents that allegedly had links to local militant groups. Israel was perhaps the only country which publicly backed India’s military action against Pakistan.
Another plausible reason for the US and other Western countries to counsel restraint to both states was the fear of the conflict turning into a nuclear confrontation; this would have had disastrous consequences for global peace. The Modi government in its hubris completely miscalculated India’s strategic and economic importance. But it will be a mistake to read too much into Trump’s offer to mediate between the two countries on Kashmir and other outstanding issues. No external mediation will be accepted by New Delhi. Moreover, India remains a strategic ally of the US despite the friction between the two countries on trade and tariffs issues. But there is certainly an opportunity for Pakistan to reset its relations with Washington.
Most troubling for India, however, has been the strengthening of China-Pakistan defence collaboration. Pakistan’s spectacular success in air warfare is largely the result of our strategic alliance with China. Besides close cooperation between the two air forces, the China-Pakistan naval axis is also visible.
Pakistan and China both share security, military, and financial concerns. Advancing and reinforcing conventional and strategic relations with China is an essential component of Pakistan’s foreign and national security policies. Beijing, however, would not like the conflict between its two nuclear-armed neighbours to escalate. Surely any fresh flare-up between India and Pakistan will have serious implications for the entire region and beyond.
It now seems that the battlefront has moved to the field of diplomacy with both countries sending teams to various capitals to explain their respective positions on the sources of conflict. It’s obvious that both sides will be raising the issue of terrorism apparently being used against each other as a tool in the ongoing covert war. But there are limits to what the international community can do in bringing the two countries together on the negotiating table. Both sides have now declared victory in a conflict that has resolved nothing. It’s a war without an end.

Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn that both the girls, aged 15 and 8, were brought to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) by their maternal and paternal uncles at 5:30pm.
She said that the girls were examined at the health facility and “findings are strongly suggestive of sexual violence”.
 
 

Evidentiary samples had been collected for serology and DNA profiling and cross matching, she said, adding that both sisters bore marks of “severe physical violence”.
The condition of the eight-year-old was serious, she said.
Dr Summaiya said the relatives had on May 25 brought the girls to a government hospital in New Karachi with complaint of sexual harassment and torture.
Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said that their father had died four years ago and their mother had married another man and was living with him with her four children.
He said that a few days ago the girls’ mother had informed the Khwaja Ajmer Nagri police that her daughters were “maltreated by an intruder”.
However, the girls’ uncles had informed hospital officials on Tuesday that they were beaten by their stepfather.
He said that the police were investigating the case.

By late afternoon, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said it had distributed about 8,000 food boxes, equivalent to 462,000 meals, after an almost three-month-old Israeli blockade of the devastated enclave.
In Rafah, which is under full Israeli army control, thousands of people, including women and children, some on foot or in donkey carts, flocked towards one of the distribution sites to receive food packages.
Videos showed lines of people walking through a wired-off corridor and into a large open field where aid was stacked. Later, images shared on social media showed large parts of the fence torn down as people jostled their way onto the site.
 



Private relief agency’s closeness to US and Israel’s endorsement of its distribution method have raised doubts about its neutrality

Hamas denies accusation
“The real cause of the delay and collapse in the aid distribution process is the tragic chaos caused by the mismanagement of the same company operating under the Israeli occupation administration in those buffer zones,” Ismail Al Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, said.
The Israel military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound and that control was re-established.
A UN spokesperson called images of the incident “heartbreaking”.
Israel’s foreign ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein wrote on X that 8,000 “food packages” were delivered to Pale­stinians on Tuesday, the first day of what he described as an American initiative.
 






Screening procedures
Although the aid was available on Monday, Palestinians appeared to have heeded warnings, including from Hamas, about biometric screening procedures employed at the foundation’s aid distribution sites.
“As much as I want to go because I am hungry and my children are hungry, I am afraid,” said Abu Ahmed, 55. “I am so scared because they said the company belongs to Israel and is a mercenary, and also because the resistance (Hamas) said not to go,” he said in a message on WhatsApp.
The Israeli military said four aid sites have been established in recent weeks across the enclave, and that two of them in the area of Rafah began operations on Tuesday and “are distributing food packages to thousands of families in Gaza Strip”.
Israeli officials said one of the advantages of the new aid system is the opportunity to screen recipients to exclude anyone found to be connected with Hamas.
Humanitarian groups briefed on GHF’s plans say anyone accessing aid will have to submit to facial recognition technology that many Palestinians fear will end up in Israeli hands to be used to track and potentially target them.
Aid groups boycott GHF
The United Nations and other international aid groups have boycotted the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which they say undermines the principle that aid should be distributed independently of the parties to a conflict, based on need.
“Humanitarian assistance must not be politicised or militarised,” said Christian Cardon, chief spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters the UN has a sound plan “to get aid to a desperate population” and that Israel was allowing it to deliver relief, but with a lot of obstacles.

Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students and the lucrative income stream they provide into doubt.
She  had threatened last month to block international students at the school  unless it turned over records on visa holders’  “illegal and violent activities.” But a judge quickly suspended the move after the university sued to “stop the government’s arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, and unconstitutional action.” There will be an injunction hearing on Thursday, a court filing showed.
Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement that the attempted foreign students ban “imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities  throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams.”
In addition to undermining the independence of storied US universities — which attract top students from around the world and produce much of the country’s lucrative scientific research — Trump has sought to dismantle the government’s traditional soft power tools, including humanitarian aid and the Voice of America radio network.
Meanwhile, the US government intends to cancel all remaining financial contracts with Harvard, a senior official said on Tuesday, in President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to force the prestigious university to submit to unprecedented oversight.
The administration “will send a letter to federal agencies today asking them to identify any contracts with Harvard, and whether they can be canceled or redirected elsewhere,” the official said.
The ending of contracts — estimated by US media to be worth $100 million — would mark the severance of business ties between the government and an institution that is both the country’s oldest university and a global research powerhouse. Amid a broad push to amass power in the White House, Trump has singled out Harvard for particularly fierce punishment.
His administration accuses the Cambridge, Massachusetts university of permitting anti-Semitism and pervasive liberal bias.
Harvard has rejected orders to allow a series of extraordinary measures, including an audit of political leanings on campus and a ban on students deemed to be  “hostile to the American values.”
In the last few weeks, the elite educational bastion has seen billions of dollars in federal grants frozen and an attempt — paused last Friday by a court ruling — to end its ability to host foreign students.
The university is fighting back, arguing that the Trump attacks are unconstitutional and would cripple its ability to function.
On Monday, Trump vowed he would prevail in the increasingly public struggle. In a social media post he claimed that foreign students at Harvard included  “radicalised lunatics, troublemakers.”

This evolving challenge requires a clear and adaptive strategy to effectively counter it.
These operations, which Delhi has designed to stay below the nuclear threshold, have manifested the shrinking space in which our deterrence operates in the highly volatile South Asian environment. The time has come to rethink and update our understanding of deterrence — one that reflects the realities of today, where conflict no longer arrives with armies massing at borders, but with drones in the sky and missiles that strike and disappear before the world has time to respond.
On May 7, India launched “Operation Sindoor” — a coordinated assault involving air strikes, drone swarms, and missile attacks deep inside Pakistani territory. The strikes hit a disturbing range of targets from religious institutions like mosques to strategic military installations. Pakistani armed forces that follow a “quid pro quo plus” policy with regards to India, responded robustly and swiftly, downing multiple Indian aircraft — including Rafale, Mirage 2000, MiG-29, and Su-30 jets in a short span of less than an hour — employing stand-off weapons and air defence systems to signal its resolve.
But instead of de-escalating, India escalated further.

Pakistan’s quid pro quo plus aims at preventing all-out conflicts, but India’s reckless behaviour to expand geographic scope of its strikes risks miscalculation resulting in a nuclear catastrophe

By the next morning, a wave of drones swarmed Pakistani skies, followed a day later by fresh missile attacks on airbases. It was a moment of real danger. The international community scrambled to contain what was quickly becoming a runaway crisis. Deterrence, while not broken, was undeniably shaken.
 
 

India’s willingness to act and expand geographic scope of its strikes, echoing Uri in 2016 and Pulwama-Balakot in 2019, points to a gap in Pakistan’s ability to deter reckless Indian behaviour due to emergence of newer technologies. To put it simply, Pakistan’s shield is holding, though it may be fraying at the edges.
Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme, born from the trauma of 1971, was built on a simple promise: to make any future aggression against the country unthinkable. Between 1998 and 2015, that promise largely held. Even during moments of extreme tension like the Kargil crisis of 1999, months-long military standoff in 2002 or the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, India refrained from crossing the Line of Control and the international border or undertaking major strike in Pakistani heartland. But that calculus began to shift post-2015 especially following the Gurdaspur attack barely weeks after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met then Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif at Ufa. First came the claimed “surgical strikes”, then the 2019 aerial incursion following Pulwama.
“South Asia has neither crisis stability nor arms race stability. While I do not expect a crisis for some time — perhaps several years — the region remains unstable and dangerous,” said Chris­to­­pher Clary, a security aff­airs expert at the University at Albany, the US.
The May 2025 clash — an intense 88-hour exchange of air strikes, drones, and missile fire — marked a deeper evolution of this trend of a rapid escalation under the nuclear overhang. It laid bare a dangerous new reality: India believes it can operate in a “grey zone” just below the nuclear threshold, using limited, precise force to impose costs without triggering all-out war. Indian leaders appear beholden to the idea that they can hit Pakistan without provoking an uncontrollable escalation. From Uri to Balakot, and now Pahalgam, the visible trend is that each strike is a calculated test of Pakistani resolve, and each one pushes the boundaries a little further.
Pakistan’s “quid pro quo plus” policy, adopted after 2016, meant to meet Indian aggression with a harder blow, aimed to slam this door of a military conflict below nuclear rung shut. But three incidents in nine years show Pakistani “plus” isn’t scaring India enough. The policy’s success is bittersweet: it prevents all-out conflict, but India does exploit some space to commit aggression.
Elizabeth Threlkeld, director for South Asia at the Stimson Center, the US, agrees “the limitations of Pakistan’s quid pro quo plus approach are becoming more visible in light of India’s increasing willingness to engage in limited conventional actions.”
Misstep towards catastrophe
Each Indian operation is designed to normalise limited raids in the eyes of the world. If this continues, and strikes on mainland Pakistan are repeated, it would increase the risk of a misstep towards nuclear catastrophe as each crisis raises the stakes. Getting an opportunity to dump the payload on a Balakot hill in 2019 gave way to mainland strikes in 2025, setting a higher baseline for the next clash. A more worrying aspect is that if this cycle will persist, each round will compress decision making windows in a world of hypersonic weapons.
India’s playbook is clear: use modern technology — drones, standoff missiles — to inflict pain while staying below nuclear tripwires. Modi is therefore attempting, at least on his part, to rewrite the rules, projecting strength to domestic audiences and signalling that Pakistan’s nuclear shadow won’t paralyse India. Whispers of pre-emptive counterforce strategies, meanwhile, have in the past few years circulated with growing frequency, though such a gamble remains improbable.
“In March 2022, an Indian BrahMos missile landed in Mian Channu. Delhi called it an error, Pakistani leadership accepted the explanation, but I saw it as a deliberate test of our defences, including our response time. BrahMos is central to India’s pre-emptive strike plans, its speed and precision leave little time to respond, making such incidents dangerously destabilising for Pakistan,” Dr Shireen Mazari, who was a federal minister in 2022, said, alluding to the debates within the system at that time.
India’s confidence in multi-domain warfare, blending crewed and uncrewed platforms, creates a false sense of control, as if escalation can be neatly managed.
The proponents of such an approach forget that wars don’t always proceed as per calculated decisions, rather they often unravel through confusion.
A single misstep, like a missile or an artillery piece gone astray or a misunderstood signal, can unravel restraint and push a tense standoff into full-blown catastrophe.
 
 

What makes it scarier in Indian case is that the extremist Hindutva mindset currently dominating New Delhi and electoral pressures push the government to demonstrate strength through limited strikes, confident they can avoid nuclear escalation. This dynamic perpetuates the very crises their leaders must manage.
“The very presence of recurring conventional engagements highlights the precariousness of the situation, where misperceptions of red lines could lead to inadvertent escalation between the two nuclear-armed adversaries,” Threlkeld maintained.
Deception or internal dysfunction?
Following India’s aerial strikes on the morning of May 7 and Pakistan’s forceful retaliation, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval conveyed messages through international intermediaries indicating that New Delhi wanted to de-escalate. But to Islamabad’s surprise, shortly after it received these signals, Pakistan’s airspace was swarmed by hostile drones. Whether this was a deliberate act of deception or a sign of internal dysfunction within the Indian system remains unclear. However, one plausible explanation is that hardliners within India’s security establishment pressured the military to climb the next rung of the escalation ladder — targeting Pakistani military installations with unmanned platforms, despite diplomatic overtures suggesting restraint.
In this scenario, Pakistan faces a stark choice: continue pursuing a doctrine that punishes India after the incident or forge one that stops India cold.
First, there is a need to strengthen our conventional arsenal, which includes acquisition of modern fighter jets, advanced air defences, rapid-response units, and precision munitions, to make limited strikes too costly. Second, ambiguity, using cyber-attacks, economic pressure, or international legal action to raise India’s costs without nuclear risks, should be embraced. The ‘catalytic posture’, which involves signalling nuclear readiness to draw international mediation has worked well so far in South Asian environment, but its overuse risks diminishing returns.
Dr Adil Sultan, a dean at the Air University and a former SPD official, while explaining his vision of next generation of deterrence, said, “The future conflict is likely to be more intense, complex, and short, thus requiring quick response through ‘multi-domain integration’ (MDI) of all three services, and ground and space-based assets, with PAF being in the lead due to its inherent agility and capacity to act in a shortest possible time with maximum effect.”
Pakistan should also re-emphasise red lines through robust crisis channels especially after the targeting of the airbases.
So here we are back, 27 years later, on the same razor’s edge — thanks to the technological advancement. The nuclear bombs remain the ultimate guarantor of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, but every knife-edge attack or missile/drone strike cannot be stopped. The nukes can only promise that if the worst comes, both sides will pay an unthinkable price.

Eleven victims remained in hospital in a stable condition on Tuesday, police said, adding that they all appeared to be recovering well. British police believe the incident, in a packed Liverpool city centre on Monday, was isolated and not an act of terrorism.
They said the driver of the grey Ford Galaxy people-carrier involved in the incident was believed to have followed an ambulance into a closed street when a road block was lifted to allow paramedics to attend to a suspected heart attack victim.
Videos posted online showed the vehicle driving through the street crowded with fans, sending several flying into the air and dragging at least four under its wheels.

Police identified the driver as ‘53-year-old white British man to cool social media speculation’

When the vehicle stopped, angry people converged on it and began smashing the windows as police officers battled to prevent them from reaching the driver. Police said 50 people, including children, had been treated for their injuries, with 11 still in hospital.
“They are all in a stable condition, and I am pleased to say that they appear to be recovering well,” Deputy Chief Constable Jenny Sims said.
King Charles, who is visiting Canada, said he was  “deeply shocked and saddened to hear of the terrible events”. His sister, Princess Anne, met medics who had treated some of the injured at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.
Million people
With most people off work for the Spring Bank Holiday, officials estimated that around 1 million people descended on the 10-mile (16 km) parade route to watch the Liverpool team travel through the city on an open-top bus with the Premier League trophy.
Liverpool last won the league in 2020, ending a 30-year-wait, but fans were unable to celebrate due to lockdowns during the pandemic. Police said the car hit the spectators as the event was winding down. In the aftermath, a photographer saw emergency services carrying victims on stretchers and in their arms to nearby ambulances.
One source told MailOnline that it looked like the driver panicked when he realised he was in the crowd and people started banging on his car. The driver, who was sounding his horn, reversed and then accelerated forwards, according to reports from other witnesses.
Police were unusually quick to provide a description of the man they arrested, saying around two hours after the incident he was a  “53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area.”  Former police officers and local politicians said that statement was needed to cool social media speculation that the episode was an Islamist attack.
“That was one of my first concerns, that we needed to get the story out quickly,” Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram told the BBC. “If there’s a vacuum, we know there are some elements that will try to inflame the situation and to create that speculation and to put misinformation out there.”

Nepra set K-Electric’s base tariff at Rs40 per unit for the fiscal year 2023-24, which is almost 40pc higher than even the national average tariff of about Rs28 per unit in 2025-26 for the 10 public sector power distribution companies (Discos).
The delta between the Discos’ average and K-Electric’s tariff is transferred to the taxpayers through the federal budget in the form of tariff differential subsidy.
In a detailed determination, the regulator changed K-Electric’s tariff mechanism based on 100pc recovery of bills and instead allowed recovery losses in the tariff, starting from 6.75pc in FY24 and gradually declining to 3.5pc by F30.

Nepra sets utility’s base rate at Rs40 per unit, 40pc higher than national average tariff

Interestingly, the Discos’ tariff is still based on a 100pc recovery of bills. The judgement on K-Electric indicated that a similar charge may be coming up for Discos’ tariff in the shape of higher costs to honest consumers.
 
 

“To ensure sufficient liquidity in the power market and to align the collection targets with current market realities, the authority has decided to allow recovery loss to K-Electric,” Nepra said, directing K-Electric to ensure collection of 93.35pc of FY24 billing, 93.6pc in FY25, 94.4pc in FY26, 95.19pc in FY27, 95.7pc in FY28, 96.10pc in FY29, and 96.5pc in FY30.
The loss recovery allowance, starting at 93.25pc, was opposed by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division). Although it supported the loss recovery allowance through tariff, apparently to claim similar dispensation for government-owned Discos, it said a lower recovery ratio should be allowed, starting with 96.7pc, and an increase in commercial losses should be benchmarked against efficient Discos to arrive at reasonable targets.
Nepra set the total average tariff at Rs39.97 per unit for FY24, which included a power purchase cost of Rs31.96, transmission cost of Rs2.86, distribution cost of Rs3.31, and supply margin of Rs2.28, with a negative prior-year adjustment of 44 paise per unit to ensure total revenue requirement of Rs606 billion.
Interestingly, the above tariff is based on almost half of the power supply from the national grid; otherwise, K-Electric’s average base rate would have been much higher.
This determination covers a total power dispatch of 17,768 gigawatt-hours (GWh) — 48pc sourced from the national grid, 42pc from K-Electric’s own generation, and 9.9pc from private suppliers.
K-Electric’s total revenue requirement determined by Nepra at Rs606.92bn for FY24 included a supply margin Rs34.68bn, operations and maintenance (O&M) allowance at Rs5.91bn, negative working capital adjustment of Rs1.244bn, recovery loss of Rs36.25bn, gross margin of Rs40.92bn, and net margin of Rs34.68bn after a negative prior-year adjustment of Rs6.69bn.
The power regulator noted that K-Electric’s previous multi-year tariff (MYT) for 2017-23 did not allow any provision on account of recovery loss. Instead, actual write-offs were allowed subject to prescribed criteria.
Considering that FY24 had already lapsed and FY25 was almost 10 months gone, K-Electric’s actual recovery for FY24 remained at 91.5pc, whereas FY25 was expected to close at 90.5pc, it said. The financial impact of these under-recoveries was around Rs40bn and Rs57bn, respectively.
“The authority noted that return allowed to K-Electric for its distribution function is around Rs21.6bn, meaning thereby that effectively K-Electric would be incurring losses for the first two years of MYT, if no recovery loss is allowed to K-Electric. This may compromise the financial viability of the company, which is neither in the interest of the consumers nor power system as whole,” Nepra said.
The regulator said that Discos were not allowed any recovery loss, but the federal government had the power to levy surcharges to offset the inefficiencies of Discos arising from high losses and under-recoveries. However, no such option is available for K-Electric, as it can only charge the regulated tariff.
It said the National Electricity Policy 2021 empowered Nepra to revisit the target for collections and align with the current market realities through “efficient tariff structures for sufficient liquidity in the power market” as “international precedents also suggest that 100pc billing recovery is generally not mandated”.
Solar projects
In a separate development, Nepra approved bidding results of K-Electric’s two solar-powered plants with a combined capacity of 150 megawatts, promising the lowest-ever rates in Pakistan.
Under the determination, Master Textile Mills Limited has been declared the lowest bidder at the lowest offered tariff of Rs11.6508 (4.0363 US cents) per kilowatt-hour for the 50MW Winder project, and Rs11.21 (3.8826 US cents) per kWh for the 100MW Bela project.
The two projects are estimated to bring savings, both in terms of cost and forex outflow, in both national and K-Electric’s grids, by displacing the existing expensive generation, Nepra said.
It added that energy cost savings due to fuel displacement were estimated at Rs2.3bn annually, amounting to a total of Rs57.8bn over the life of the projects. Additionally, the projects are estimated to generate annual foreign exchange savings of $17.01 million, totalling $425.2m in savings over their lifespan.

The explanation came after a member of the five-judge constitutional bench, Justice Shakeel Ahmed, asked whether the law secretary was “competent to clarify” in the notification that judges would not be required to take a fresh oath on their posting to the IHC.
The AGP also explained that no question was raised on the judges’ transfer in the report of the chief justices and registrar of four high courts. He said the then chief justice of the IHC Aamir Farooq was completely independent in determining their seniority while deciding the representation of five IHC judges.
At this, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, who was heading the constitutional bench, observed that the counsel representing the petitioner judges did not apprise the court about the representation moved by the judges the high court and its decision. The attorney general explained that the IHC judges had requested for determination of seniority upon taking the oath.

Justice Aamir had complete independence in determining IHC judges’ seniority while deciding their representation, SC told

Also, Justice Shakeel Ahmed observed that none of the counsel earlier mentioned the representation and subsequent decision by the then CJ of the high court.
The AGP said Article 200 of the Constitution explained the method of transfer of the judges, whereas the power of veto to question any such transfer was with the judiciary and not with the executive. At the time of transfer, all the chief justices had expressed their willingness over the transfer, he added.
But Justice Salahuddin Panwhar observed that an opinion of chief justice on the issue of seniority was never sought.
During the hearing, the bench raised questions whether the authority of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) could be made ineffective by transferring judges on a permanent basis, also asking about any principles for judges’ transfer.
Mr Awar reminded the court that Article 200 could not be made ineffective. Even when the 18th Amendment was made, Article 200 was not changed, he said. The AGP further said, in his opinion, setting a time for transferred judges was like adding new words to the Constitution.
When Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan said that the minutes of JCP meeting held on Feb 10 should be provided, the AGP explained that two additional judges were appointed to the IHC in Jan 17 meeting of the commission whereas in the subsequent JCP meeting held on Feb 10, IHC CJ Aamir Farooq was elevated to the Supreme Court.
Justice Afghan asked if acting IHC CJ Sardar Sarfaraz Dogar, too, was among those on the list to be considered for elevation by the JCP on Feb 10, the AGP replied in affirmative.
The AGP requested the court to reject petitions of the PTI founder and others by declaring them as inadmissible.  On the other hand, the KP Advocate General said he supported the arguments advanced by lawyers on behalf of the petitioners.
The AGP took the position that a judge was brought for a limited time only when the number of permanent judges of the high court was complete.

A.T.M. Azharul Islam, from the Jamaat-i-Islami party, and who has been in custody since 2012, was acquitted of crimes against humanity by the Supreme Court, which ordered his release.
Azharul Islam, who was born in 1952, was among six senior political leaders convicted during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, whose 15-year-long autocratic rule as prime minister ended in August 2024 when a student-led revolt forced her to flee.
Political parties, including Jamaat-i-Islami, are readying for hugely anticipated elections which the interim government has vowed will take place by June 2026 at the latest.
Islam’s lawyer Shishir Monir said he was “fortunate” because the five other senior political leaders who had been convicted — four from Jamaat-i-Islami, and another from the key Bangladesh National Party (BNP) — had already been hanged.
“He got justice because he is alive”, Monir told reporters. “The appellate division failed to review the evidence in other cases for crimes against humanity.”
Azharul Islam had been sentenced to death in 2014 for rape, murder and genocide during the 1971 military operation.
Hasina banned Jamaat-i-Islami during her tenure and cracked down on its leaders.
Azharul Islam appealed in 2015, but the court upheld the verdict in 2019, and he filed a review petition in 2020.
Hasina, 77, fled to India last year as crowds stormed her palace, and she remains there in exile.

• Babusar Top receives heavy snow; authorities say extreme conditions likely to persist through May 31
ISLAMABAD: Seven people were killed and over two dozen others sustained injuries on Tuesday as severe rain and windstorms swept through parts of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
This is the second time in a week that a storm of such intensity wreaked havoc in many parts of the country, damaging crops, properties, and other  infrastructure. At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others  injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains had battered many areas in Islamabad, Punjab and KP on Saturday.
On Tuesday, two people were killed and around 20 injured after a thunderstorm swept through various parts of Punjab. The storm, accompanied by heavy rainfall, strong winds, and hail, caused widespread destruction.
According to Rescue 1122, a passenger van overturned due to rain and dust storm on Ghazi-Lawrencepur Road near Ghazi Interchange in Attock, which resulted in the death of one passenger and left five others injured.
Separately, four children aged between nine and 12 years were injured when the wall of their house collapsed during the windstorm in Rehmo village of Attock district.  Also, a 25-year-old woman received multiple injuries when the roof of her house collapsed in the same area. An 11-year-old girl was critically injured when the wall of her house in Saghirabad area of Attock collapsed.
According to the Rescue 1122’s provincial headquarters, a man was killed after lightning struck him in Mianwali’s Kalabagh.
The district experienced multiple emergencies including a wall collapse that left one person injured at the Makkharwal police station and a falling solar panel that inju­red another resident.
In Gujran­wala, a young girl fell from roof due to powerful gusts.
In Taunsa Sharif, a woman was injured when the wall of her house collapsed.
Three people, including two children, were inj­ured in Rawalpindi as gusty winds battered the garrison city in the afternoon.
According to the PDMA, these ext­r­eme conditions are likely to persist through May 31, with upper and central Punjab districts inc­luding Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala and Faisalabad, facing the highest risk.
Two killed in KP
In Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, two people lost their lives and another 10 sustained injuries in rain-related incidents.
Rains lashed many areas of the province, leaving several people injured.
A child died while four others were injured in a roof collapse incident in Swabi. Another person died and three members of the same family were injured in a lightning strike in Shangla district. In the Mattani area of the provincial capital, three persons were injured when the roof of their house collapsed, while another one was injured in another rain-related incident in the Badershi area of Nowshera district.
The upper parts of the Hazara division on Tuesday received heavy downpour and snowfall, blocking the Karakoram Highway to all sorts of traffic at two locations in the Lower Kohistan.
“The floodwater carrying heavy rocks and stones from nearby mountains blocked the Karakoram Highway at two points in our district,” Mohammad Duraj, an official from Rescue 1122, Lower Kohistan, told reporters. Babusar Top, the highest point in the Kaghan Valley, received heavy snowfall, significantly dropping temperatures across the district.
KP’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in a statement issued here said that the spell will continue till May 30. It said the rain caused widespread damage to the crops.
PDMA said wheat, vegetables and fruit crops were badly damaged in Mardan and its surrounding areas due to the hailstorm. Besides, rains also disrupted the power supply across the province as 113 of Peshawar Electric Supply Company tripped due to rain and thunderstorm.
Three killed in AJK
In Kashmir, three women lost their lives and a man went missing while several properties were damaged after a “cloudburst-induced flood” wreaked havoc in a suburban area of Muzaffarabad on Tuesday afternoon, officials said.
Saeed Qureshi, a senior director at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), told Dawn that the “cloudburst” triggered a flood in a water channel in Balgran village, located around 35 kilometres from Muzaffarabad on the right bank of the Neelum River, at about 4pm.
Among the victims were Zaiwar Jan, 75, and her daughter Shireen Bibi, 35, who died when the raging current swept into their house and filled it with mud.
Station House Officer (SHO) of Panjgran Iftikhar Awan, who spoke to Dawn from the affected village, said the mother’s body was recovered immediately, while the daughter’s body was later pulled from the debris.
In another severely affected house nearby, rescuers found 35-year-old Gori Bibi critically injured and unconscious. She was rushed to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Patikka, where she succumbed to her injuries later in the evening.
 
 

Gori Bibi’s father, 65-year-old Jalal Deen, was reported missing.
“We have been trying to locate him, but to no avail,” said SHO Awan.
Videos shared by residents showed muddy water gushing through the ground floor of the village’s main mosque, which was built almost along the course of the water channel, where water flow is usually minimal. According to SHO Awan, the flood, which lasted for about half an hour, completely destroyed the mosque.
Mr Qureshi from the SDMA said initial assessments indicated partial damage to 20–25 houses and the mosque. However, SHO Awan feared that the figure could be higher. “At the moment, our priority is to assess the human losses. Material damages will be evaluated in daylight on Wednesday,” he said.
Separately, in Islamabad, the district administration decided to move billboards out of the city after a hoarding fixed at the National Press Club collapsed due to a windstorm that had also uprooted several trees.

Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Aleema claimed that court cases involving her brother were being manipulated, and that petitions were being removed from cause lists under pressure.
“I want to tell the unseen forces that I am ready to negotiate,” she said.
“They should tell us what Imran has done to them. Instead of fearing Imran and his sisters, they should speak to me directly.”
She further alleged that these hidden elements were exerting undue influence on judges and parliamentarians, calling for transparency and direct dialogue.
Later, she attempted to meet her brother at Adiala Jail but was denied access, though her two other sisters and several lawyers were granted a meeting.
In a separate media talk in the neighbouring garrison city, Aleema Khan questioned Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chair­man Barrister Gohar Ali Khan over his repeated claims that Imran Khan would be released before Eidul Azha, which will fall on June 7. “If he has good news, he should share it with party workers,” she said.
She said the PTI was preparing for massive nationwide protests, while clarifying that Imran Khan had no plans to summon workers to Islamabad because he was aware that “snipers are stationed in the capital to target them”.
She stressed that Mr Khan had clearly said he could spend the rest of his life in jail if it was in the country’s best interest.
Gandapur criticises federal govt
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Chief Min­ister Ali Amin Gand­apur, standing alongside her, criticised the federal government and judiciary, blaming the 26th Amend­ment for the current political instability.
He claimed that the amendment had worsened the situation and vowed to repeal it once his party returned to power.
Mr Gandapur reiterated that the Feb 8 general elections were rigged and that PTI’s mandate was ‘stolen’. “There is no case against Imran Khan, and there is no justification for keeping him behind bars,” he said.

ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on Tuesday questioned the Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) standing in the reserved seats case, noting that the original order had allocated seats to the PTI and not SIC.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the 11-judge bench resumed the hearing on a set of petitions seeking to revisit the July 12, 2024, majority judgement.
The issue about the locus standi of SIC cropped up when Justice Musarrat Hilali questioned the party’s counsel, Faisal Siddiqi, whether he was representing PTI or SIC.
“Did PTI authorise the counsel to advance the arguments on their behalf too and did SIC know the counsel is also advocating for PTI since it may undermine their interest?” the judge observed.
The counsel said he has a “right to support the majority judgement” and criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not implementing the apex court’s order after more than 11 months.
The judgement had declared that 41 independents will file duly signed and notarised statements before the ECP within 15 days, explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party — PTI.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar wondered whether lawmakers had submitted any declaration indicating that they intended to join PTI after the majority judgment.
If they had submitted the affidavits, then how the SIC can now stand before the court as its members resiled after submitting the declaration, the judge remarked.
The ECP counsel said lawmakers did submit declarations, but the commission did not accept them.
Then these lawmakers are still independent members, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail observed.
The counsel replied that the ECP recognises them as SIC members.
Justice Mazhar interjected, saying the Supreme Court declared these lawmakers independent, irrespective of whether the judgement had been implemented or not.
Mr Siddiqi, who was representing the SIC, argued the objection on the locus standi didn’t apply to the respondents but to the petitioners.
When the lawmakers decided to join PTI, their connection or relation with SIC was terminated, emphasised Justice Mazhar.
He asked the counsel to explain his position, as he could not understand the argument.
The lawyer accepted the judges’ remarks “for the time being” and suspended his argument.
“So you agree that presently these members are independent,” Justice Mandokhail interjected again, adding that if the answer was affirmative, then the question was whether any one of them could even approach the court.
Though conceded, the SIC lawyer said he wanted to argue on the maintainability of the review petitions first. “If these members are independent, then the role of SIC is still intact here,” Justice Mazhar remarked.
Another bench member, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, asked about the “understanding” between PTI and questioned Mr Siddiqi whether the members he was representing belonged to PTI or SIC.
Justice Hilali asked about the symbol on which Sahibzada Hamid Raza, the SIC chairman, contested the elections. She added that Mr Raza himself contested the February 2024 general election as an independent candidate.
“Why did Hamid Raza not contest the election from the platform of SIC?” Justice Hilali asked and expressed her annoyance at Mr Siddiqi for agreeing to answer the questions but later avoiding them.
“What was the philosophy behind SIC members contesting elections as independents?” she wondered.
The counsel explained the lawmakers were not candidates of SIC, but rather independent and the majority judgement classified them as such. Later, they were candidates of the PTI and not independent.
Mr Siddiqi said the court can grant three types of relief — set aside the majority judgement, the consequence of which would be that the Peshawar High Court judgement and the ECP’s decision will be revived. The second being substituting the majority judgement with the minority and the third being the majority judgement set aside and the appeals before PHC revived for re-hearing.
Justice Khan observed that whatever record the majority judgment had relied upon was “not admissible” evidence as per the law. “No one knows which nomination papers — out of four — of these independent candidates were submitted by the ECP during the hearing.” 
He reminded the minority jud­gment, which he and Justice Nae­­em Akhtar Afghan had authored, did not rely on these records since they were not admitted as evidence.
“Therefore, these were not part of the record of the case.”
Justice Mandokhail remarked that it should be left to the court to consider whether the right of any party was being infringed upon or not.
Later, the case was adjourned till Thursday.

An incident report issued by the district headquarters hospital (DHQ) in Wana mentioned a “drone attack” at 8pm, which injured 22 people aged between 13 and 60 years.
The condition of a 13-year-old and a man was listed as “serious”, and they were referred to “tertiary care”. Seven, including three aged 15, 18 and 19 years, had “major” injuries. The rest of the 13 had “minor” injuries, of which two were discharged.
PTI-affiliated MNA Zubair Khan Wazir echoed the hospital’s tally and told Dawn.com, “The young men were playing volleyball when the quadcopter fired shells on them.”
He added that people in the area were “scared and restricted to their homes after the attack”.
Wazir, in a post on Facebook, strongly condemned the “drone attack in which innocent citizens were targeted”. He demanded that the federal government and the relevant institutions “immediately investigate the incident, provide justice to the affected families, and take immediate and effective steps to prevent such attacks in the future”.
“Targeting common people under the guise of an attack on a Taliban post is extremely regrettable, shameful and unacceptable,” Wazir claimed, terming the incident a “part of a heinous conspiracy to sabotage regional peace”.
The incident comes within a fortnight after a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Locals there staged a sit-in for over a week with the victims’ bodies, demanding justice, before finally announcing today that they had ended their protest after reaching an agreement with the local administration.</p><small>2025-05-27 19:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/28094134b5b6d78.jpg?r=094200' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913690/karachi-braces-for-monsoon-as-dumping-waste-in-drains-banned' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi braces for monsoon as dumping waste in drains banned</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government on Tuesday imposed a complete ban on waste disposal into drains for two months in Karachi to prevent their blockage during the incoming monsoon season.
The monsoon season wreaks havoc in the metropolis every year as the drains become clogged causing them to overflow.
According to a notification issued by Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi, the ban was imposed under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The notification said that throwing waste into the drains “causes serious environmental hazards, discharge of less water, choking of nullahs and a major cause of blockage of the nullahs during the monsoon season”.
 
 

It further said that this “warrants immediate action” to impose the ban “to prevent [the] throwing of garbage, solid waste and dumping of debris and other materials into the nullahs”, barring the people from the above actions.
The order also authorised the police to register complaints against violators under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In March, the Karachi administration imposed a similar ban on the dumping of garbage and solid waste debris in drains for two months. The commissioner had said that all private, public and autonomous institutions had been urged to play their due role in improving the city’s sanitation conditions.
KPT issues monsoon alert
Separately, the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) issued an alert on precautionary measures for the monsoon season.
In the alert dated May 26, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the KPT listed the steps which would be taken as safety measures for heavy rains, wind and flooding.
The measures included close monitoring and assessments of the safety of ships, ensuring mooring lines were set optically, and all pilots were to be on standby.
The alert also said, “Small boats are to be parked at locations less prone to wind and water pressures and to be properly secured.”
“Perform periodic maintenance for electrical items and standby generator should be readily available on short notice,” it added.</p><small>2025-05-27 18:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271355148b61044.jpg?r=135856' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913645/mir-ali-sit-in-over-alleged-drone-strike-comes-to-an-end-as-agreement-reached' target='_blank'><strong>Mir Ali sit-in over alleged drone strike comes to an end as agreement reached</strong></a><br><p>Locals staging a sit-in against a suspected drone strike in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil last week, which claimed the lives of four children, announced on Tuesday that they have ended their protest after having reached an agreement with the local administration.
For over a week, the locals in Mir Ali had been staging a sit-in, demanding justice in the wake of a suspected strike that took place in Hurmuz village on May 19 during the daytime, leaving four children of the same family dead and injuring five others, including a woman. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Allama Iqbal Dawar, one of the organisers, told Dawn.com that following a series of talks held between the protesters and officials, both sides reached an agreement on late Monday night.
The bodies of the deceased have been buried, and the roads previously blocked by the protesters are now open, while officials are set to meet the affected families and announce compensatory measures soon.
Additionally, Mufti Baitullah, spokesman for the Jirga, also announced the agreement while addressing the protesters in a video seen by Dawn.com. Baitullah was seen lauding the Jirga members for playing a positive role in the whole affair.
When approached by Dawn.com, District Police Officer Waqar Ahmad confirmed that the agreement had been signed but did not reveal any details about the pact.
Similarly, Mir Ali Tehsildar Sher Bahadar told Dawn.com that a four-point agreement had been reached. However, he too did not elaborate any further.
However, North Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Yousuf Karim told the local media that he had held thorough talks with the tribal leaders, assuring them that the government and the army would pay “serious attention” to the safety of the residents during operations against the militants.
Last week, the local elders had threatened to march to Islamabad to protest against the drone strike in case their demands were not met.</p><small>2025-05-27 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271913311b9374e.png?r=003041' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913684/pakistan-to-celebrate-eidul-azha-on-june-7-as-zilhaj-moon-not-sighted' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to celebrate Eidul Azha on June 7 as Zilhaj moon not sighted</strong></a><br><p>The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee (RHC) on Tuesday announced that it has not sighted the Zilhaj moon, meaning Pakistan would observe Eidul Azha on June 7.
The committee’s meeting took place on a roof in Islamabad’s Kohsar Block, where the religious affairs ministry has its office.
Addressing a press conference, RHC Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad said, “No testimony of sighting the moon of the month of Zilhaj was received from any part of Pakistan […]. Therefore, it was decided with consensus that Zilhaj 1, 1446AH would be on May 29, Thursday and Eidul Azha would be observed on June 7, Saturday.”
He noted that the weather remained cloudy in most parts of the country and clear in some.
Maulana Azad presided over the meeting of the RHC earlier in the evening, with officials and experts from other departments also gathered to sight the moon.
Simultaneous zonal meetings of the RHC also took place at their respective headquarters in the provincial capitals to send testimonies.
Dr Mohammad Hasan Ali, director of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics at the Pakistan Meteorological Department; Shaukatullah Khan of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco); and Zainul Abedin from the science and tech ministry were among those present during the meeting, Azad said.
Earlier this week, Suparco predicted that the festive occasion of Eidul Azha would likely be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.
 
 

According to Suparco, while the birth of a new moon for Zilhaj 1446 AH would occur on May 27, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country today would be extremely low even under optimal weather conditions.
Cloudy weather reported in the federal capital further reduced the sighting probability.
Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p><small>2025-05-27 16:41</small></div><hr>
