• Victim shot dead on May 8; Indian media celebrated incident
• Killing linked to ‘transnational terrorism’ involving RAW handler Sanay Sanjeev Kumar
KARACHI: The Counter-Terro­ri­­sm Department (CTD) on Saturday claimed that it has unearthed a network of India’s intelligence agency, the Res­earch and Analysis Wing (RAW), which used Pakistanis and a separatist outfit in Sindh to carry out the targeted killing of a well-known soc­ial worker in Matli, Badin district.
CTD chief Additional Inspector General (AIG) Azad Khan told a press conference that the killing was an outcome of ‘transnational terrorism’ involving a Gulf-based handler of RAW.
He said Abdul Rehman, a man actively engaged in social welfare activities in Matli, was targeted by three suspects on May 8, 2025. He added that the Indian media was ‘rejoiced’ over the killing by portraying the victim as “an enemy of Bharat”.
He opined that this targe­ted killing was carried out in the ba­­ckground of the May 9-10 war betw­een India and Pakistan in which New Delhi had been “defeated”.
The AIG said law enforcement agencies were expecting hostile activities from India following that conflict. With the help of technology, four suspects were arrested on July 8, and their links with RAW were established.
CTD claimed that a Gulf-based RAW agent, Sanay Sanjeev Kumar alias Fauji, was involved in planning the killing. He had recruited Salman, a Gulf-based resident of Sheikhupura.
Salman reportedly arrived in Karachi on May 12, proceeded to Hyderabad, while four other suspects travelled from Muridke and Sheikhupura. Three of them carried out the killing in Matli, while Salman and another suspect stayed at a Hyderabad hotel to coordinate the attack. They remained in contact with Sanjay during the operation. Later, Salman left Karachi for the Gulf and eventually escaped to Nepal.
Mr Khan further claimed RAW had provided “huge sums of money” to the network through banks and other channels. He added that the banned separatist group, the Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA), had facilitated RAW in executing the targeted killing.
Terming the incident as “state-sponsored terrorism,” the CTD chief said India’s hostile agency had also been found involved in other terrorist attacks and targeted killings in Pakistan, often using criminal groups and proxies.
During the press conference, the CTD also showed slides to the media containing documentary evidence of links between the RAW agent Sanjay and the killers.
To a question, the AIG said since it was ‘transnational terrorism’ case, the Pakistan government was likely to take it up at international forums. He added this was also a case of ‘terror financing’ that would be highlighted at every forum.
He revealed that the arrested suspects had criminal records and were also planning to target other individuals named by RAW.
Responding to another question, the CTD chief clarified that the victim, Abdul Rehman, had no political or criminal record. “He was a normal citizen with a good reputation, actively involved in welfare activities in Matli. He was a landlord and had no political affiliation,” the AIG said.
He admitted that prosecution in transnational terrorism cases was challenging but assured that the CTD would pursue the case to ensure successful prosecution.

The judge was attending a documentary screening organised by rights group Defence for Human Rights Pakistan, where he delivered remarks to attendees and noted that cases regarding missing persons and disappearances were the most difficult he had come across.
Addressing the gathering, Justice Minallah said that when he ordered that disappearances be investigated or missing people be found, “the authorities would come and they would all say that we don’t know where they are.”
At this, the judge pointed out: “The judge and the court cannot do anything when you don’t have independent investigators.”
Minallah added: “Every judge of the Supreme Court is responsible personally for every violation of fundamental rights that takes place in Pakistan.”
The judge recounted an instance when he suddenly heard the sound of a child crying in his courtroom. Upon asking his staff, the child came forward with his grandmother.
“That was Mudassar Naaru’s child,” Minallah said, referring to the journalist who went missing in 2018. “His mother had passed away and the state had failed to at least let them know whether he was alive, he was dead, or where he was.
“Yes, I wanted to sensitise the issue because there was nothing else that I could do and I would go by the constitution,” he added.
“Under the Constitution, the executive head is the prime minister. I passed an order that this child and his grandmother be taken to the then-prime minister of Pakistan.
“It’s very, very difficult for the courts when the state is not cooperating with you. But the Constitution says that it is the prime minister, the cabinet and then the provinces, the chief minister and the ministers who are responsible. You can’t blame someone else.”
Minallah recalled that he summoned the then-PM to appear in court. “Naaru’s son was also there. He (the prime minister) also assured that child [in court], that his (Naaru’s) whereabouts would be known,” he stated.
“Well, I was in haste elevated to the Supreme Court. But before that, let me say to you, the Islamabad High Court, the first priority was to have competent and fearless judges,” Minallah said. “And for a judge or for a court, the only test is the confidence of the people in that court.”
 
 

The judge noted that it was the duty of the state to investigate these incidents and hold people accountable. Recalling the first judgment he gave, he stated that the directions he gave were “extremely effective during the four-year period that I served as the chief justice”.
“I had made it very clear to the executive that I will not tolerate a single incident of enforced disappearance from within my jurisdiction,” he said.
“But let me say a word. As a judge, I have always respected the parliament and the elected representatives,” he continued. “They have been victims for the past 77 years.”
However, the judge said that in his experience, “those who are in the government … don’t want to be told that this is an issue. And they also want to pretend that this is not an issue. It is an issue.
“It is for the political leadership. When they are in opposition, they are absolutely different.”
Minallah said that during the four years he served as the Islamabad High Court’s chief justice, students from Balochistan would approach the court about disappearances in the province.
“I knew I didn’t have the jurisdiction, but I assumed the jurisdiction,” he said, noting that the Supreme Court and other courts were there.
“When the Balochistan students came, I didn’t know what to do because it was out of my jurisdiction. The investigations had to take place in Balochistan. But the law did provide me with that jurisdiction.”
The judge urged the need for an independent judiciary, adding that the fact that women from Balochistan had to march in the streets for rights was a matter of “shame” for everyone and him.
Concluding his speech, he said: “Those holding exalted offices, I am afraid they haven’t spoken truth in the last 77 years. The day they start speaking the truth, things will change. We have heard some sitting ministers, some former ministers. I wish one day they will also speak the truth because we all know the truth. Everyone knows the truth, but we pretend that we do not know the truth.”
Earlier this week, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan assured the National Judicial Policy Making Committee that a mechanism for producing detained people in cases of enforced disappearances would be presented before the body in its next meeting.
Earlier this month, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) revealed that enforced disappearances and other issues were fuelling public alienation and political instability in Balochistan following a fact-finding mission to the province.
According to the report, titled Balochistan’s Crisis of Trust, the HRCP undertook the mission from July 9-12 to respond to the “escalating concerns over the deteriorating state of fundamental rights and civic freedoms in the province”.
The mission aimed to examine the state of fundamental freedoms in the province and the broader impact of conflict and militarisation on civilian life, the report said in its terms of reference.
In the first half of 2025, a total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said.
In December 2024, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emphasised that only parliament held the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances — a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.</p><small>2025-08-24 03:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/24080258c99716a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936549/punjab-govt-pti-in-war-of-words-over-arrest-of-imrans-nephews' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt, PTI in war of words over arrest of Imran’s nephews</strong></a><br><p>• Azma defends arrests, says evidence of ‘May 9 conspiracy’ in public domain
• Moonis accuses Maryam administration of ‘blackmailing tactics’
LAHORE: The Punjab government has criticised those who are trying to blame Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for the arrest of PTI patron-in-chief Imran Khan’s two nephews.
“Anyone who is blaming Maryam Nawaz for the crimes of May 9 culprits…let me be very clear that under her leadership, rule of law prevails in Punjab. This is not Imran Khan’s government where decisions were made about who to abduct or release. This is Maryam Nawaz’s administration, where every institution functions independently and with full autonomy,” Punjab Infor­mation and Culture Minister Azma Bokhri said in a statement here on Saturday.
Responding to criticism of CM Maryam for her ‘role’ in the arrest of Imran Khan’s nephews — Shahrez and Shershah — and his supporters, Azma Bokhari said the individuals nominated and wanted in May 9 cases must be jailed, and there was no escape from legal accountability.
“It is not a matter of personal desire (to arrest anyone) rather it is the state’s responsibility to arrest absconders and proclaimed offenders,” she said.
Condemning the attack on the Corps Commander House, Bokhari said: “Those who disrespected a military officer’s uniform are now trying to play the victim card and hiding behind the excuse of privacy and ‘sanctity of home.’
Azma Bokhari reiterated that the Punjab government was acting strictly within the bounds of justice, law, and the Constitution, and no one would be considered above the law.
She made it clear that both the PML-N government and “state institutions” are committed to bringing all those involved in May 9 riots to justice.
“The May 9 riots were a well-orchestrated but failed rebellion against the state.
“All evidence related to the conspiracy is now in public view and those involved can no longer hide behind political facades,” Bokhari said.
On the other hand, Imran Khan’s former wife Jemima Goldsmith said on X: “In the last few days, my sons’ cousins, Shahrez & Shershah (Aleema Khan’s sons), have been abducted from their homes in front of their young children & held in prison. Their other cousin Hassan Niazi, has been held in a military prison for over a year.
“The government has also threatened my sons Sulaiman and Kasim Khan with arrest if they travel to Pakistan to visit their father.
“No state should be allowed to target families to settle political scores.”
 






The PTI has lambasted the Maryam administration and the Punjab police for the arrest of Aleema’s sons in “fake cases.”
“The abduction and unlawful arrest of Aleema Khanum’s sons Shahrez and Shershah is a vile attempt to stop a sister from struggling for her brother’s release. But through such blackmailing tactics, the rulers can neither bend Imran Khan nor suppress the voice of truth,” PTI senior leader and former federal minister Moonis Elahi said in a post on X.
 






“This worst form of vengeance against Imran Khan’s family marks the darkest chapter in Pakistan’s political history,” he added.

“During an intense exchange of fire with terrorists in Sistan-Baluch­istan province, six assailants were killed and two others arrested,” official news agency IRNA said, citing a statement from the intelligence services.
Sistan-Baluchistan, which borders Pakistan and Afg­hanistan, has long been a flashpoint for clashes bet­ween security forces and armed groups.
The news agency said there were “documents” indicating  “the Zionist nature” of the group targeted in the latest raid, adding that its members had planned to attack a  “vital” facility in Iran’s east, without elaborating.
The report said that “the main operation team” was composed of “seven non-Iranian terrorists”, but did not specify their nationality.
Two intelligence agents and a police officer were wounded in the gunfight.

In an interview with The Times newspaper, Farage said he would withdraw Britain from the Euro­pean Convention on Human Rights and sign deals with Afghanistan, Eritrea and other top countries of origin to repatriate illegal migrants.
“We can be nice to people, we can be nice to other countries, or we can be very tough to other countries … I mean (US President Donald) Trump has proved this point quite comprehensively,” Farage said.
Asked if he was concerned that asylum seekers would be killed or tortured if they were sent to countries with poor human rights records, Farage said he was more worried about the threat he believed asylum seekers posed to Britons.

Small-scale protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers have become frequent

“I can’t be responsible for despotic regimes all over the world. But I can be responsible for the safety of women and girls on our streets,” he said.
Britain has seen regular small-scale protests in recent weeks outside hotels housing asylum seekers, spurred in part by concerns about public safety after some migrants were charged with sexual assault.
 
 

Broader opinion polls show that immigration and asylum are the public’s greatest concern, just ahead of the economy, and Reform UK — which won five seats at last year’s general election — has topped recent voting intention polls.
Last year 37,000 people — mostly from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Vietnam and Eritrea — arrived in Britain from France by crossing the English Channel in small boats. The total was up by a quarter from 2023 and accounted for nine per cent of net migration.
About two-thirds of people who arrive via small boats and claim asylum are successful and only three per cent have been deported, according to figures analysed by the University of Oxford.
Farage told The Times he would end the right to claim asylum or to challenge deportation for those who arrived by small boats by replacing existing human rights legislation and opting Britain out of refugee treaties, citing a national emergency.
“The aim of this legislation is mass deportation,” Farage said, adding that a “massive crisis” caused by asylum-seekers was fuelling public anger.
The Times said Farage wanted to create holding facilities for 24,000 migrants on air bases at a cost of 2.5 billion pounds ($3.4bn) and operate five deportation flights a day, with total deportations reaching the hundreds of thousands.
If that failed, asylum seekers could be held on Ascension Island, a British territory in the South Atlantic, to send a symbolic message, Farage said.

Footage from Gaza’s largest city, which Israel plans to seize as part of an ex­­panded military operation, showed wo­men and children among the chaotic jostle of dozens clamouring and shouting for food.
One young boy used his hands to scrape a few leftover grains from the inside of a cooking vat. A girl sat on the edge of a tent and scooped rice from a plastic bag on the ground.
“We have no home left, no food, no income… so we are forced to turn to charity kitchens, but they do not satisfy our hunger,” said Yousef Hamad, 58, who was displaced from the northern city of Beit Hanoun.

The chief of UN agency for Palestinian refugees asks Israel to ‘stop denying the famine it has created’

Further south at a charity kitchen in Deir el Balah, 34-year-old Umm Mohammad said the UN’s declaration of a famine had come “far too late”. The children are  “staggering from dizziness, unable to wake up because of the lack of food and water”, she added.
 
 

The UN officially declared a famine in Gaza on Friday, blaming the “systematic obstruction” of aid by Israel during more than 22 months of conflict. The Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) said famine was affecting 500,000 people in Gaza governorate, which covers about a fifth of the Palestinian territory, including Gaza City.
‘Moral duty’
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the famine report as “an outright lie”.
On Saturday, the head of the UN agen­­cy for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said it was “time for the government of Israel to stop denying the famine it has created in Gaza”.
“All of those who have influence must use it with determination & a sense of moral duty,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini posted on X.
 






The IPC projected that the famine would expand to Deir el Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of Sept­ember, covering around two-thirds of Gaza. Israel kept up its bombardment of the Palestinian territory, with a footage sho­wing heavy smoke billowing above the Zeitoun district of Gaza City as Pales­ti­nians picked through the wreckage of buildings.
‘Feel like end is near’
The spokesman for Gaza’s civil defence agency, Mahmud Bassal, called the situation in the Sabra and Zeitoun neighbourhoods “absolutely catastrophic”, describing the “complete levelling of entire residential blocks”.
“We are trapped here, living in fear, with nowhere to go. There’s no safety anywhere in Gaza. Movement now leads to death,” said Ahmad Jundiyeh, 35, who was displaced to the northern outskirts of Zeitoun. “We constantly hear the sound of bombing… we hear fighter jets, artillery shelling and even drone explosions,” he said. “We’re extremely afraid — it feels like the end is near.”
Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed on Friday that Israel would destroy Gaza City as it has other parts of the territory if Hamas did not agree to disarm, release all remaining prisoners and “end the war on Israel’s terms”.
Residents of Gaza City said the Israeli strikes targeting the area had been relentless for days. “Let them come and see what’s happening to us here on the ground in Zeitoun district. We have been ruined,” said Aymen Daloul, a 53-year-old from Gaza City whose home had been destroyed.
“We shall sleep on the streets as if we were cattle. Have mercy on us.”
Mahmud Abu Saqer, 24, said there had been a quickening exodus of residents ever since Israel announced its plans to seize Gaza City. “Just this morning, more than 500 to 600 families left, and yesterday thousands left,” he said.

• Omar says PkMAP chief’s nomination to boost opposition alliance
ISLAMABAD: Amid controversy surrounding the nomination of Mahmood Khan Achakzai — the head of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party — and Senator Azam Swati as opposition leaders, PTI insiders have said these appointments will only proceed if former leaders Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz remain barred from parliament.
The party plans to avail all legal options to reverse the disqualification of National Assembly Oppo­s­ition Leader Omar Ayub and Senate opposition leader Shibli Faraz, who were disqualified by the  Election Commission of Pakis­tan in light of the May 9 sentences.
Against this backdrop, the PTI chief earlier this week named Mr Achakzai, who also heads the PTI-led opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan, and Senator Swati for these coveted roles. The decision, however, upset many in the party, and a debate ensued over why an outsider was picked to lead the PTI-dominated opposition.
In an apparent move to placate these concerns, insiders in the party told Dawn that the priority was the return of former opposition leaders Omar Ayub and Mr Faraz.
According to PTI’s political com­m­ittee, new nominations will not be made until the appeals of Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz are decided. Party Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said that the party would stand by the two leaders, hoping that the court would give a favourable ruling in their cases.
Meanwhile, Omar Ayub told Dawn that the new appointment would be finalised only after exhausting all legal means.
“However, it should be kept in mind that Mr Achakzai is a senior leader and also the head of the opposition alliance,” he said, adding, “It is the prerogative of the party founder [Imran Khan] to nominate any person as a candidate for the opposition leader.” Mr Ayub said the decision to nominate the PkMAP chief would strengthen the opposition alliance.
Ex-opposition leader Omar Ayub said that Salman Akram Raja had already made it clear that all the legal platforms would be used to reverse their disqualification but if the government demanded the names for new opposition leaders, in that case, these names would be forwarded to the speaker.
A senior PTI leader, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that although both names were announced, but during the parliamentary party meeting, participants demanded the details of the meeting with Imran Khan.
“Ali Bukhari informed (the meeting) that Imran Khan had said that all legal platforms should be exhausted and after that names of Mr Achakzai and Azam Swati can be given. Khan sahib suggested these names as he feared he might not get an opportunity to meet the party leaders, his sisters, or lawyers till the nomination of the opposition leaders,” he explained.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said both Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz had gotten stay orders from courts. “Mr Achakzai was supported by the PTI as a presidential candidate. Imran Khan wants all opposition voices to unite. In the past, we approached Maulana Fazlur Rehman under the same idea and visited his house many times,” he said.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser said that the first priority was to bring both Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz back to the NA and Senate.
“However, as a second option, Mr Achakzai has been nominated,” he said, adding the PkMAP chief was named for this role because Mr Khan supported political figures from Balochistan. Mr Achakzai is also a seasoned politician who can lead the movement, he said. “However, I would again say that the priority would be to bring Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz back as leaders of the opposition in both houses,” he reiterated.
It may be noted that Mr Achakzai is a veteran political figure from Balochistan, particularly known for his outspoken stance against the establishment. Swati, a PTI veteran who joined the party before the 2013 elections, was jailed a few years ago and allegedly tortured for his tweet against then army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa.

• GB survivors face shortage of essentials; over 3,000 displaced in Ghizer; Glof-II project probe demanded
LAHORE: A day before the arrival of a fresh monsoon spell, the Punjab government on Saturday evacuated thousands of people along the Sutlej River, as the river surged to a high flood level at Ganda Singh Wala, recording a dangerous flow of 129,866 cusecs.
The Provincial Disaster Manag­ement Authority (PDMA) initiated evacuations and emergency operations across multiple districts amid a new and intense monsoon spell forecast on August 24-27. According to a hydrological report by the Board of Revenue, the situation at Ganda Singh Wala was critical and expected to persist for the next 48 hours.
 
 

In response, district administrations in central and southern Punjab were racing against time to relocate communities living along the riverbanks. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said that over 19,000 people were evacuated from multiple flood-affected areas of the province.
He said a high alert had been issued for the districts of Kasur, Okara, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar, and Vehari. He said that the evacuation and transportation of 19,947 people from areas adjacent to the Indus, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Jhelum rivers had been completed.
“The evacuation of populations settled in the riverbeds of the Sutlej and Ravi is our utmost priority. All resources are being employed for the protection of citizens,” stated Khawaja Salman Rafique, provincial minister and chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Disaster Management, following an emergency meeting at the PDMA headquarters.
‘Mixed picture’
The river situation across Punjab showed a mixed picture as the Indus River at Tarbela and Kalabagh was rising. The Chenab and Ravi river systems were stable and within normal bounds at all major gauges. The hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan, though normal at the time, were also being closely monitored.
The epicentre of the crisis remains Sutlej, where authorities were focusing evacuation efforts in areas like Jalalpur Pirwala. “We have begun relocating residents to prevent any potential damage. Their lives and property are our primary concern,” said Multan’s Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu.
The urgency of these operations is compounded by a fresh weather warning. The Paki­stan Meteorological Depart­ment has forecast an “eighth spell” of monsoon rains from August 24 to 27, expected to bring torrential rains to the upper regions of Punjab and other parts of the country.
Punjab Relief Commis­sioner Nabil Javaid said rescue teams had been pre-deployed to sensitive locations and that relief camps were fully operational. “These camps are equipped with all basic facilities, including medicines and vaccines. We are ensuring announcements are made in mosques and at the local level to guide people to safety,” said PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia.
The provincial government urged citizens to cooperate fully with rescue agencies, avoid all recreational activities near water bodies, and immediately contact the PDMA helpline 1129 in case of an emergency.
 
 

With the new monsoon spell looming, the next 96 hours are critical for Punjab as it takes measures to relocate thousands of people living along the rivers.
GB survivors struggle
Meanwhile, the rain spell is also expected to bring heavy rain and flash floods to Gilgit-Baltistan — a region already reeling from successive floods over the past few weeks. A day earlier, a glacial flood in Tal­idas village rendered hundre­ds of people homeless, whe­r­eas the roads, including Shan­dur-Ghizer Road, across the mountainous region rema­in closed after landslides and floods.
Meanwhile, the survivors in the flood-hit areas faced a shortage of water for drinking and irrigation. Israruddin Israr, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan GB coordinator, said 330 households, comprising over 3,000 individuals, had become internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to the recent glacial lake outburst flood in Talidas village in Ghizer district.
The number of IDPs in this incident is the second-largest since the 2010 Attabad disaster, he noted.  GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said residents of Talidas had been shifted to a tent settlement.
The GB chief minister also visited the affected area, Mr Faraq said, adding that the CM announced a cash reward for the shepherd who warned about the flood in time.
 
 

The GB government spokesperson said the shepherd will be invited to the Chief Minister’s Secretariat and a ceremony will be held in his honour. He said an alternative village would be established for the Glof-affected residents, and the prime minister would be approached for this initiative. The early warning system was not active in the Ghizer district, he admitted.
Former GB chief minister Hafeezur Rehman, in a statement, said they had reservations about the Glof-II project for early warning systems, installed by the UNDP across GB for Rs10 billion. He alleged these funds were misused and demanded an investigation into the system’s failure.

The minister noted that Mr Saqib had been specifically appointed to advance this agenda, and his participation in the seminar was therefore of considerable importance. However, he affirmed that his ministry remains open to engaging with the event organisers on this critical issue.
 
 

Mr Aurangzeb reiterated that Pakistan’s banking infrastructure is comparatively more intricate than global standards and called for improvements in legislation governing digital investments. He also revealed that crypto mining was under active consideration, with a dedicated crypto council alr­e­ady established to explore its regulatory and economic implications.
‘Regulatory framework’
The minister outlined the regulation of this transformation. He cautioned that given the scale of activity, ignoring digital assets could expose Pakistan to risks related to KYC, AML, sanctions, and monitoring, potentially reversing hard-earned progress on the FATF front.
The minister emphasised that regulatory dimensions would be thoroughly examined. “It took five years of sustained effort to exit the grey list,” he said, adding, “We have no intention of re-entering that cycle.”
 
 

In this context, he highlighted the establishment of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA), whose inaugural meeting is scheduled for next week, as a milestone towards a balanced regulatory framework.
Senator Aurangzeb stressed that Pakistan must leverage international experience, drawing on models from Dubai, Singapore, and the EU, while ensuring that national interests remain paramount. He commended the support received from international experts and organisations in helping Pakistan fast-track its regulatory and policy frameworks.
FM Aurangzeb emphasised the need to embrace blockchain to drive innovation, financial inclusion, and transparency, while urging a balanced regulatory approach as the nation’s youth increasingly adopt digital assets.
“We have to accelerate our journey in terms of adopting transformative technologies like blockchain and digital assets, assuring the government’s full support,” he remarked. He noted that 20-25 million Pakistanis, particularly young people, were already engaged in digital asset-related activities in one form or another.  “This scale of participation cannot be ignored,” he remarked, stressing the need for acknowledgement, education, and structured policy responses to harness this growing trend.
Calling it an opportune time to move forward, he underscored the importance of ensuring that all developments remain within a regulatory framework.
He highlighted that while Pakistan was making strides in achieving macroeconomic stability, the next imperative was to actively participate in shaping the new economy driven by blockchain, artificial intelligence, and Web 3.0 technologies.
He underscored three key drivers for blockchain adoption in Pakistan: financial inclusion, transparency, and speed. By enabling faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions, blockchain and allied technologies can provide critical solutions for banking, remittances, agriculture, IT, freelancing, and energy.
He cited successful initiatives such as the development of e-KYC systems through blockchain, which reduce duplication of compliance processes in banking, as practical examples of progress.
“We must harness their energy, channel it through education and regulation, and integrate it into a system that strengthens the economy while safeguarding national interests. This is not just about keeping pace with global change—it is about ensuring Pakistan’s rightful place in the new economy.”
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to providing an enabling environment for the private sector to lead economic growth. He emphasised that facilitating traders and investors was a top government priority. He noted that economic reforms were underway and the national economy was gradually moving toward stability.
The minister said the country must embrace this shift as part of its new economy by fostering financial inclusion, transparency, and efficiency, while ensuring a balanced regulatory framework through collaboration between government, academia, and the private sector.
Reflecting on the broader vision of the government, the minister reiterated the government’s commitment to fostering an enabling environment while allowing the private sector to lead innovation, with academia providing knowledge and talent.
“This trilateral partnership of government, academia, and private sector is essential to scaling up our journey into the new economy,” he stated.

Brennan Johnson and Joao Palhinha struck for the Europa League winners just before half-time as Spurs went top of the table, making it a perfect start for Thomas Frank after two league games in charge.
City’s run of four consecutive Premier League titles came to a spectacular end last season as they finished a distant third behind Liverpool and Arsenal. A 4-0 thrashing of Wolves on the opening weekend of the campaign showed glimpses of a revamped City back to their best.
However, they were again easily exposed on the counter-attack, while manager Pep Guardiola must decide who will be his number one goalkeeper after a day to forget for James Trafford.

Ederson was left on the bench amid rumours the Brazilian could join Galatasaray before the transfer window closes. City have been linked with a move for out-of-favour Paris Saint-Germain keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.
Tottenham took the lead on 35 minutes when Richarlison squared for Brennan Johnson to power past Trafford.
Trafford was fortunate to avoid being punished after rushing outside his box to block Kudus with his arm. But moments later, the England goalkeeper had a moment of madness when he attempted a pass to Nico Gonzalez inside his own box.
Pape Mate Sarr intercepted and, even though the goalkeeper recovered to deny Richarlison, Joao Palhinha smashed home the rebound.
Spurs let a two-goal lead slip late on against Paris Saint-Germain to lose the UEFA Super Cup in Frank’s first game in charge earlier this month, but rarely looked in danger of suffering a similar fate.
“From every game you learn and games where you don’t get the result you learn even more,” said Frank. “Defensive principles and the mentality is the key thing. We need this mentality to win games like this.”
Promoted trio on the board
Villa have failed to score in their opening two games and Brentford secured a big win for new boss Keith Andrews thanks to record signing Dango Ouattara.
The Bees lost not only Frank, but their top scorer last season, Bryan Mbeumo and captain Christian Norgaard in the close season, while Yoane Wissa has sat out Andrews’ first two games in an attempt to force through a move to Newcastle.
Brentford spent a reported £42 million ($58m) on Ouattara to replace Mbeumo and he delivered with the only goal at 12 minutes. The Burkina Faso international sprinted clear of Pau Torres before firing in at the second attempt after Emi Martinez saved his first effort.

Marcus Tavernier scored the only goal as Bournemouth beat 10-man Wolves 1-0. Toti Gomes was dismissed early in the second half for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. Wolves remain without a point.
Burnley secured their first points back in the top flight with a 2-0 win over Sunderland. The Black Cats beat West Ham 3-0 last weekend on their return to the Premier League after an eight-year absence.
But goals from Josh Cullen and Jaidon Anthony brought Sunderland back to earth.
All three promoted sides have now secured a win as they aim to avoid the trend of the past two seasons, when all three teams to come up have gone straight back down.
Leeds began their season by beating Everton 1-0 on Monday, but face a daunting trip to title-chasing Arsenal in Saturday’s late kick-off.
Champions Liverpool travel to Newcastle on Monday with the clubs at a stand-off over Magpies striker Alexander Isak. The Swede will miss the game as he attempts to force through a move to Liverpool before the end of the window.</p><small>2025-08-23 18:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/23215129daa3d38.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935344/fm-dar-hails-new-phase-of-islamabad-dhaka-reinvigorated-partnership-in-landmark-bangladesh-visit' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar hails new phase of Islamabad-Dhaka ‘reinvigorated partnership’ in landmark Bangladesh visit</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday hailed the “new phase of reinvigorated partnership” between Pakistan and Bangladesh in a landmark visit to the nation on Saturday, the first state visit by a foreign minister in 13 years.
Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government being toppled in August of last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
FM Dar arrived in Dhaka earlier today for an official two-day trip. Addressing a press conference at the Pakistani High Commission in Dhaka, he extended an invitation to everyone in the gathering to visit Pakistan to engage with their counterparts and contribute to this “new phase of our reinvigorated partnership”.
“Our hearts are open and our intent is most sincere,” FM Dar noted.
The deputy PM said he wanted to underscore the federal government’s “strong desire to forge a cooperative and forward-looking relationship with Bangladesh”.
Dar said Pakistan was committed to engaging with all stakeholders, including the government, political parties, academia, civil society, media and the youth for the realisation of common goals, including peace, progress and prosperity of the two nations and the region.
He said his visit came at a time when the region and the world were undergoing a “rapid transformation”, adding that the challenges of climate change, economic volatility, global inequality and security threats threatened everyone.
“We must work together to create an environment where youth from Karachi to Chittagong, Quetta to Rajshahi, Peshawar to Sylhet and Lahore to Dhaka joined hands to face these challenges and realise their shared dreams.”
He said he was glad to note that bilateral relations had witnessed many positive developments in the past year and there was “significant progress in almost all streams of bilateral cooperation” with an increase in the frequency of high-level exchanges, institutionalised mechanisms of bilateral engagements were being revived, economic and commercial cooperation was gaining momentum, educational and academic collaboaration was being explored and cultural exchanges were also taking place.
“In a nutshell, today, our bilateral relations are characterised by a new energy and fresh enthusiasm.”
He said the developments reflected the desire of both countries to move forward and tap the potential for greater bilateral cooperation for the benefit of their people.
The foreign minister also noted that the two nations enjoyed a commonality of views on many regional and international issues, such as the revival of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).
FM Dar said Pakistan appreciated Bangladesh’s role in Saarc’s conception and stressed that South Asia, home to “nearly a quarter of humanity”, could not afford to lag behind in regional cooperation and integration.
“We are hopeful that Saarc will be reinvigorated and our distances will shorten. I sincerely believe that the future of bilateral relations should be characterised by a forward-looking approach based on mutual respect and insulated from external pressures.
“It is our collective responsibility to ensure that our children inherit a relationship that is fraternal, cooperative and filled with affection and opportunities.”
The foreign minister said he was looking forward to his engagements with the Bangladeshi leadership during his trip.
He said it was a “great honour” to be in the Bangladeshi capital at the government’s invitation and expressed his gratitude for the welcome afforded to him and his delegation.
“This evening is special as it brings together a broad spectrum of prominent personalities from politics, academia, business community and media,” he said, adding that he valued the opportunity to interact with them.
He said Pakistan and Bangladesh enjoyed a “multifaceted relationship” that was rooted in shared history, common faith and cultural similarities. “We are two vibrant and dynamic and resilient nations. Our countries are home to the proud people who have faced enormous challenges with dignity and forbearance.”
FM Dar said the bilateral relationship between the two countries was not only political but also grounded in cultural, spiritual and familial ties that stemmed from “centuries of shared traditions, Islamic heritage, social norms, linguistic connections and literary expressions”.
The foreign minister said the above “threads of commonalities were woven into the very fabric of our two societies”, adding that “notwithstanding the twists and turns of history, the people of Pakistan have fraternal sentiments towards the people of Bangladesh and hold them in the highest esteem.
“We recognise and respect the sovereign choices of the Bangladeshi nation and believe in a future where our relations are defined by not what divides us but what unites us.”
 


Earlier, FM Dar received a delegation of the National Citizen Party (NCP), led by General Secretary Akhtar Hossain. He appreciated the NCP leadership’s vision for reform and social justice and emphasised the need for greater interaction between the youth of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The delegation members apprised FM Dar on different facets of countrywide political mobilisation in 2024. The Foreign Office (FO) said the two sides also discussed possibilities to promote cultural exchanges between Pakistan and Bangladesh in the days ahead.
 






The deputy PM also held a meeting with a delegation of Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami, led by Naib Amir Dr Syed Abdullah Mohammed Taher.
“The ways to strengthen Pakistan-Bangladesh relations and the recent developments in the region were two key areas of discussion. The DPM/FM lauded the courage and steadfastness of the Jamaat leaders and activists in the face of hardships and difficulties,” the FO said.
 






In a third meeting, FM Dar welcomed a delegation from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir. The FO said the meeting was held in a “cordial atmosphere”.
It said FM Dar expressed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening bilateral relations with Bangladesh on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit.
It added that regional cooperation featured prominently in the discussions, during which Bangladesh’s foundational role in establishing the Saarc was “fondly acknowledged”. The FO said the leaders also reflected on past high-level interactions between Pakistan and Bangladesh.
 






According to a press release by the FO, Dar arrived in Dhaka today “on a landmark official visit from August 23-24” on the invitation of Bangladesh’s government. He was received by Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Ambassador Asad Alam Siam, High Commissioner of Pakistan to Bangladesh Imran Haider, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan Muhammad Iqbal Khan and officials of the Pakistan High Commission, it said.
The press release added, “During the visit, the deputy prime minister will hold important meetings with the Bangladeshi leadership, including Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, Adviser for Foreign Affairs Mr Md Touhid Hossain, and Adviser for Commerce Mr SK Bashir Uddin.
“Discussions will encompass the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation, including regional and international issues of mutual interest.”
 






Earlier today, the FO said that Dar embarked on a “historic visit to Bangladesh” as the deputy premier departed from the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi. “In Dhaka, he will hold important meetings with Bangladeshi leaders,” it added.
“The visit is a significant milestone in Pakistan-Bangladesh relations as a Pakistani foreign minister is visiting Bangladesh after a gap of around 13 years,” the FO highlighted.
 






The last time a foreign minister paid an official visit to Dhaka was in November 2012, when Hina Rabbani Khar made a six-hour visit to Bangladesh to formally invite then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina to a summit in Islamabad later that month.
 
 

FM Dar’s meetings are likely to take place tomorrow, according to Bangladeshi news outlet BSS.
The visit is expected to see the signing of four to five memorandums of understanding to strengthen bilateral ties in the fields of trade, culture, media, training, and travel, a senior official of Bangladesh’s foreign ministry told BSS.
Dar’s visit comes on the heels of Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan’s official tour to Dhaka, where he met Bangladesh’s advisers for commerce and industries.
 
 

Islamabad and Dhaka are in the process of establishing a joint working group on trade to enhance the economic ties and foster greater cooperation in trade, according to the commerce ministry.
The two countries started direct government-to-government trade in February with imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice, while Fly Jinnah has also secured approval to operate flights from Karachi to Dhaka.
Diplomatic ties were rekindled after 15 years in April with the visit of Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch for Foreign Office Consultations (FOC).
Last month, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka, Paki­stan and Bangladesh agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side.</p><small>2025-08-23 17:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2312504685ac286.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935447/imrans-nephew-shershah-handed-over-to-lahore-police-for-5-days-as-hrcp-sounds-alarm' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s nephew Shershah handed over to Lahore police for 5 days as HRCP sounds alarm</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Saturday granted the police a five-day physical remand of PTI founder Imran Khan’s nephew Shershah Khan in a case pertaining to the Jinnah House attack during the May 9, 2023 riots.
The Lahore Police arrested Shershah, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from outside his home on Friday. His brother Shahrez Khan, who was picked up on Thursday, was also handed over to police custody yesterday for eight days over the same allegations.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill presided over today’s hearing, where PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja appeared as Shershah’s counsel and Imtiaz Sipra as the prosecutor.
The prosecution sought a 30-day physical remand, while the defence counsel requested that the suspect be discharged from the case. Judge Gill then granted the police Shershah’s five-day custody.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.
Addressing a press conference outside the Lahore ATC, Aleema said her sons had not committed any crime to warrant arrest.
“What is their crime? Their crime is that they are Imran Khan’s nephews … that they are Imran Khan’s family,” she said.
She said that the arrests aimed to put “pressure” on Imran and his family, but added that they were not succumbing to this pressure.
“This is a fight of every Pakistani — it is a duty of every Pakistani — that for this country, its freedom … they play their part,” Aleema said.
She added, “We can play our part by standing with Imran Khan, because he is standing for Pakistan.”
Amnesty International slammed the arrests as part of a “political witch-hunt aimed at intimidating the family members of political opponents” and called on the authorities to immediately release the siblings.
“Their arrest is part of a larger pattern of politically motivated targeting and detention against the PTI to crush political opposition and muzzle dissent in the country. Targeting family members of opposition leaders and activists by the government is becoming an increasingly common practice in Pakistan and must stop.”
 






With both Shahrez and Shershah now in police custody, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it was “alarmed” by the arrest of Imran’s two nephews.
“The fact that the arrests were made 27 months after the incident is difficult to understand for any independent observer, having occurred at a time when the trials of other accused persons have been long underway or already concluded,” the HRCP said in a statement.
The commission said it was “deeply concerned about the further backsliding of citizens’ rights and expresses its disappointment in the policing and legal system, particularly when it comes to dealing with political opponents”.
“We demand that the authorities ensure transparency and the rule of law in all such matters,” the HRCP added.
 






Shahrez’s wife, Maria, wrote on her newly made X account that the triathlete was in Chitral on May 9, 2023 at her family home.
She shared a purported image of the metadata of a group photo taken in Chitral that day of Shahrez with her family and friends.
 






Imran’s son Kasim Khan, who along with his brother Sulaiman has been more vocal in recent months about his imprisoned father, had termed his cousins’ arrests as “blatant state repression”.
 






Jemima Goldsmith, the former spouse of Imran, said that no state should be allowed to “target families to settle political scores”.
 






Meanwhile, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’ that as far as the arrest of Shahrez and Shershah was concerned, questions should be raised in a court of law as opposed to against the government.
“Where will these questions be raised? Will they be raised against the government? They should be raised in the court that detained them,” he said.
When pushed on whether politicians should be questioned on politically-motivated arrests, Sanaullah recalled when he was arrested and jailed during the PTI’s tenure in a drugs case.
“We used to question the PTI because they used to politically victimise us — when 15-20 kilogrammes of heroin was found in my car, I didn’t raise those questions with the party, I did it in a court of law,” he explained. “We got relief from the court, not from raising questions in public.”
The adviser, who previously served as an interior minister, stated that in order to create an environment to talk, there cannot be any precondition to drop legal proceedings.
“Has there ever been any dialogue like this, where someone has committed a criminal offence, but their cases need to be withdrawn to negotiate?” Sanaullah asked
“If this is a condition, then present it. As far as Imran Khan’s release is concerned, the PTI’s negotiating committee told us that his release was not up for discussion. This issue (Shahrez and Shershah) can also be discussed if they come to the table.”
When pressed on the possibility of Shahrez having an alibi, Sanaullah highlighted the issue that if there was a picture of him in Chitral or any other country, then the prosecution had photographs of a man standing on a burning car.
“This photo has been on social media for some time,” he said. “They have been in court; they can argue alibis and make statements there. I do not want to be involved because it is not my position to find out the truth.”
The adviser noted, however, that if there was any politically-motivated case against them, then it was “absolutely political victimisation”.
“However, if they were detained in a criminal case or for violence, then the matter will be discussed in court. Then we will see how much truth there is,” he emphasised.
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that individuals nominated and wanted in May 9 cases must be jailed and there was “no escape” from legal accountability.
“It is not a matter of personal desire — it is the state’s responsibility to arrest absconders and proclaimed offenders,” she said in a statement without naming either of the two sons.
Condemning the attack on Jinnah House, she remarked, “Those who disrespected a military officer’s uniform are now trying to play the victim card and hiding behind the excuse of ‘privacy’ and ‘sanctity of home’.“
She reiterated that the Punjab government was acting strictly within the law and no one would be considered above it.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests yesterday, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
He asserted that both siblings were present at the scene of the Jinnah House vandalism.
ATC hearing
Similar to the request made in Shahrez’s case, the prosecution today sought Shershah’s 30-day physical remand in the Jinnah House attack case registered at the Sarwar Road police station.
“The suspect was present at the crime scene. A weapon was used at the site,” Sipra told the court, adding that Shershah was allegedly seen in a video from the incident.
“The suspect’s social media accounts have to be recovered,” he contended.
On the other hand, Raja argued that the arrest was “illegal”, noting it was made 27 months after the incident.
“The suspect had appeared in this same court yesterday with Shahrez and was arrested the same day,” the PTI counsel said. “Where was the police for 27 months?” he asked.
 
 

Raja, citing the Supreme Court’s previous directives related to videos, contended that a video had “no value [as evidence] till the person who recorded it appeared in court and spoke of its authenticity”.
Aleema’s lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassir, detailed that Shershah was arrested while on his way home after appearing for his brother’s case hearing.
 


“This case is like Shahrez’s case. We request that the court discharge Shershah from the case,” Mudassir pleaded.

A glacial burst, or glacial lake outburst flood (glof), refers to an outburst of water from a glacial lake which could lead to severe flooding downstream. At least 200 people were rescued after a glacier burst in GB, blocking the Ghizer River a day prior.
 
 

Due to yesterday’s glacial burst, water containing debris and heavy stones fell into the river and stopped it from flowing for eight to nine hours.
“The water remained standing, causing river water to spread for seven kilometres and become an artificial lake,” provincial government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq told Dawn.com.
Meanwhile, the GB Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) said that the Ghizer River changed course in the district on August 4 and began flowing over the Gilgit-Chitral Road.
“A lake measuring 2,000 feet long and more than 50 metres wide has emerged in Khatam village as a result of the flood debris, due to which the Gilgit-Chitral Road is still closed,” GBDMA district official Ghufranullah Baig told Dawn.com.
“This lake has affected a small settlement nearby, while trees and a large area of ​​land have been submerged.”
Asraruddin Asrar, a prominent social figure from Ghizer, told Dawn.com that lakes being formed by natural floods in the area were an ongoing phenomenon for a long time.
“Khalti Lake was formed in the 1980s; it still exists and has a great reputation in the area as a tourist attraction,” he said. “Sost Lake came into existence in the 1990s, and a lake was also formed at Haim last year as a result of floods. The largest number of lakes is found in Ghizer district.”
In 2010, a landslide in Attabad blocked the Hunza River, resulting in the renowned Attabad Lake, which is a popular destination for tourists.
Pakistan is home to over 13,032 glaciers, the largest reservoir of glaciers outside of the polar regions. However, experts have warned that about 10,000 glaciers in Chitral and GB have been reported to be receding due to climate change–induced temperature rise.
Earlier this month, a glof from the Shishper Glacier tore through Hassanabad Nullah, swee­ping away part of the Karakoram Highway and destroying public and private properties.
A glacier burst in Bagrot Valley caused the death of one person on August 1, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.</p><small>2025-08-23 16:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/23180743e5fa5f3.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935792/any-talks-with-india-will-be-on-equal-footing-no-begging-for-negotiations-pcb-chief-mohsin-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Any talks with India will be on equal footing, no begging for negotiations: PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday said that any talks on sporting ties with India would be held on equal footing and there would be no more pleading for negotiations.
The suspension of bilateral ties between Pakistan and India has now been officially extended beyond cricket to all sports. On Thursday, India’s sports ministry issued a new policy that ends bilateral sporting ties with Pakistan, even on neutral venues. However, no stoppage has been announced for engagement at multilateral tournaments, paving the way for the much-anticipated Asia Cup cricket clash between the two rivals next month.
Last month, the Pakistan Sports Board had asked sports federations in the country to seek approval before participating in sporting events held in India.
Questioned about sporting ties with India during a press conference in Lahore, Naqvi said: “I think we are very clear that whenever talks are held will be on an equal footing with India and there will be no more begging for negotiations. That time has passed and whatever will happen will be on the basis of equality.”
 


Questioned about the team’s dismal performance and the need for any revamping in it, the PCB chief reassured that the squad would exhibit improvement very soon.
The PCB chief was also asked about visa issues for sports journalists for the upcoming Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates, to which he said that a cell had been set up to coordinate visa issuance and whoever needed one would be provided.
Naqvi was also quizzed about the team composition that saw notable players Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan left out to make way for new players, to which he responded: “I do not even have a one per cent role in the team selection.”
He said there was a selection team and an advisory body, adding that all of them sat down and reviewed the squad selection multiple times over long hours and days.
“I have told them that whatever decision is made should be on the basis of merit and I will support it. Whatever lot was available to us, we polished it and took it forward. Our effort is to bring as many new people as possible so we have more competition in cricket and the best people come up.”
The PCB chief called on people to support the team in the Asia Cup match against India and to desist from criticising them, saying that “needless criticism” demotivated players during tournaments.
He also expressed hope of improvement soon in the national women’s squad.</p><small>2025-08-23 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/23201932f1eda9b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935910/indias-federal-investigator-files-criminal-case-against-tycoon-anil-ambani' target='_blank'><strong>India’s federal investigator files criminal case against tycoon Anil Ambani</strong></a><br><p>India’s national investigative bureau opened a criminal case against tycoon Anil Ambani after receiving a complaint from the country’s biggest bank alleging fraud, the agency said on Saturday.
Anil, the younger sibling of Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has business interests that range from power to defence.
The State Bank of India (SBI) alleged Anil and his former telecom firm, Reliance Communications, “misappropriated” bank funds by entering into transactions that violated the terms of the loans.
SBI claims it was hit with a loss of 29.29 billion rupees ($335.4 million) as a result of their actions.
The Central Bureau of Investigation said it had registered a case and that the bank’s complaint would be subjected to “thorough investigation”.
The agency searched premises linked to Reliance Communications and Anil’s residence on Saturday.
His spokesperson said the tycoon “strongly denies all allegations and charges” and “will duly defend himself”.
“The complaint filed by SBI pertains to matters dating back more than 10 years. At the relevant time, Ambani was a non-executive director of the company, with no involvement in the day-to-day management,” the spokesperson said.
“It is pertinent to note that SBI, by its own order, has already withdrawn proceedings against five other non-executive directors. Despite this, Ambani has been selectively singled out.”
Anil was last in the public spotlight seven years ago after Indian politician Rahul Gandhi accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and him of dodgy dealings related to the purchase of Rafale jets from France — allegations that both denied.
India’s Supreme Court in December 2018 dismissed calls for an investigation into the controversial jet deal, saying it did “not find any substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to any party by the Indian government”.</p><small>2025-08-23 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/23192940f663130.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935857/ppp-pml-n-announce-jointly-contesting-upcoming-by-elections' target='_blank'><strong>PPP, PML-N announce jointly contesting upcoming by-elections</strong></a><br><p>The PML-N and PPP on Saturday announced that they would contest the upcoming by-elections together.
PTI’s 12 lawmakers were disqualified in Punjab by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) following their conviction in the May 9 (2023) cases. The disqualified lawmakers hailed from eight National Assembly and four Punjab Assembly constituencies. The PPP has shown interest in contesting on six vacant seats — NA-143 and PP-203 (Sahiwal), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan), and NA-96, NA-104 and PP-98 (Faisalabad) — and sought applications from the interested candidates.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi made the announcement during a press conference in Islamabad with PPP MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and Secretary General Nayyar Bukhari.
“We want to tell our workers and the whole of Pakistan that we are a democracy,” Abbasi said, adding that they would contest the by-polls according to a “predetermined formula”.
“We will contest together. Wherever a PPP candidate is running, the PML-N will support them,” he said. “Wherever a PML-N candidate is running, the PPP will support them.”
Ashraf talked about a meeting between the leadership of both parties regarding the by-elections, stating that a “predetermined formula” had been decided for the polls.
“If a PPP candidate is runner-up in a constituency, federal or provincial, the PML-N will support them,” he stated. “If a PML-N candidate is runner-up in a constituency, then the PPP will support them.”
The PPP leader and former premier said that there was a full agreement between the leaders of both parties, adding that this plan was made on their directions.
“Now there will be no more confusion between us or our candidates,” Ashraf added.
“The people of Pakistan need to know that we are allies,” Abbasi said. “Our leadership makes intelligent decisions. We make sure to say that we are allies in all fora.”
The railways minister said that Sindh and Punjab wished each other well, while both had positive wishes for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, especially amid the recent floods in the northern areas.</p><small>2025-08-23 14:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/23151214e092778.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935589/india-says-us-trade-negotiations-are-still-going-on-as-fresh-tariffs-loom' target='_blank'><strong>India says US trade negotiations are still going on as fresh tariffs loom</strong></a><br><p>India’s foreign minister said on Saturday that trade negotiations with Washington are continuing but there are lines that New Delhi needs to defend, just days before hefty additional tariffs by the United States are due to hit.
Indian goods face additional US tariffs of up to 50 per cent, among the highest imposed by Washington, due to its increased purchases of Russian oil. A 25pc tariff has already come into effect, while the remaining 25pc is set to be enforced from August 27.
A planned visit by US trade negotiators to New Delhi from August 25-29 has been called off, dashing hopes that the levies may be lowered or postponed.
“We have some redlines in the negotiations, to be maintained and defended,” Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said at an Economic Times forum event in New Delhi, singling out the interests of the country’s farmers and small producers.
 
 

India-US trade talks collapsed earlier this year due to India not agreeing to open its vast agricultural and dairy sectors. Bilateral trade between the world’s largest and fifth-largest economies is worth over $190 billion.
“It is our right to make decisions in our ‘national interest’,” Jaishankar said.
Analysts at Capital Economics said on Friday that if the full US tariffs come into force and stick, the hit to India’s economic growth would be 0.8 percentage points both this year and next.
“The longer-term harm could be even greater as a high tariff could puncture India’s appeal as a global manufacturing hub.”
The Indian minister described US President Donald Trump’s policy announcements as “unusual”.
“We have not had a US president who conducts his foreign policy so publicly as the current one and [it] is a departure from the traditional way of conducting business with the world,” Jaishankar said.
 


He also said Washington’s concern over India’s Russian oil purchases was not being applied to other major buyers such as China and the European Union.
“If the argument is oil, then there are [other] big buyers. If the argument is who is trading more [with Russia], then there are bigger traders,” he said.
Russia-European trade is bigger than India-Russia trade, he added.
The minister also said India’s purchases of Russian oil had not been raised in earlier trade talks with the US before the public announcement of tariffs.
India to suspend postal deliveries to US over tariff confusion
India will temporarily suspend postal deliveries to the United States, the government said today, citing confusion stemming from tariffs imposed by Trump.
India’s communications ministry said the executive order issued last month requires transport carriers or other “qualified parties” approved by US authorities to collect and remit the tariff duties.
But “several critical processes relating to the designation of ‘qualified parties’ and mechanisms for duty collection and remittance remain undefined,” the ministry said in a statement.
“Consequently, US-bound air carriers have expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after August 25, citing lack of operational and technical readiness.”
 






As a result, India’s department of posts will temporarily suspend bookings of “all types of postal articles” destined for the United States from Monday except letters, documents and gift items of up to $100 in value.
“These exempt categories will continue to be accepted and conveyed to the USA, subject to further clarifications from CBP (Customs and Border Protection) and USPS (United States Postal Service),” the ministry said, adding that “every effort is being made to normalise services”.
The move follows similar steps taken by postal services and mail carriers across Europe. France’s La Poste told AFP it would suspend most package deliveries to the United States from Monday.
It said the new implementation rules were issued by the CBP on August 15, “leaving European postal services with an extremely limited timeframe to get prepared”.
The Trump administration has said that it would abolish a tax exemption on small packages entering the United States from August 29.</p><small>2025-08-23 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2312592326b0c81.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935449/ctd-finds-raw-ties-to-targeted-killing-in-sindh-as-6-suspects-arrested' target='_blank'><strong>CTD finds RAW ties to targeted killing in Sindh as 6 suspects arrested</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Saturday said that it found involvement of the Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in the target killing of a man in Badin district and arrested six suspects in this connection.
On July 30, the CTD had said it arrested four suspected members of a banned separatist militant group in Karachi over charges of killing a man in Badin’s Matli on May 18. During interrogation, the suspects had confessed that they had gunned down the victim, identified as Abdul Rehman. A case was registered under terrorism charges.
According to a statement by the law enforcement agency today, “In a joint operation, Sindh CTD and the state intelligence agencies traced the network working for the Indian intelligence agency RAW (Research & Analysis Wing) and arrested six suspects.”
It added that the 45-year-old victim was “an innocent citizen who actively participated in welfare work”.
“The suspects escaped after unjustly killing him,” the statement said, adding that the Indian media had expressed “immense joy” over the murder and claimed that “an Indian enemy was killed in Pakistan”.
The statement further said that the provincial government had appointed a joint investigation team under the leadership of the CTD deputy inspector general of police for investigation.
“During the investigation, thoroughly reviewing all aspects, including suspects’ statements, records and bank transactions, there was clear evidence suggesting the involvement of the banned organisation Sindh Revolutionary Army in the facilitation of RAW,” it said, adding that teams have been formed for further arrests.
Speaking during a press conference today, CTD Additional Inspector General (AIG) Azad Khan said, “Based on technical information, four suspects, Umair Asghar, Sajjad, Ubaid and Shakeel were arrested on July 8. Upon investigation, there was proof of their links to RAW.”
He continued, “The investigation also proved that the mastermind of this (killing), residing in a Gulf state, was an Indian agent and handler Sanjay Kumar alias Fauji.”
He explained that Sanjay had hired a resident of Sheikhpura named Salman. “On May 12, Salman travelled to Hyderabad and stayed at a hotel. His four accomplices came from Muridke and Sheikhpura,” he said, adding that they monitored the target’s movements for five days.
AIG Azad said that three of the suspects — Shakeel, Ubaid and Sajjad — went to Matli to carry out the killing, adding, “Umair and Salman stayed at the hotel in Hyderabad and handled the operation from there.”
“Sanjay stayed in contact [with them] from a foreign country throughout the incident,” he explained, adding, “Salman returned to the Gulf country through Karachi airport and escaped to Nepal.”
He further noted, “CTD also found that RAW spent a ton of money, sending money through banks and various sources.” Within terror financing, the CTD arrested Arsalan on Aug 17 and Talha Umair on Aug 22, he said.
The CTD recovered one 9mm pistol, one 30 bore pistol, one 125cc motorcycle and mobile phones from the suspects, he said. He added that RAW also utilised a separatist organisation and further investigation is underway.
The official also stated that “such extra-territorial killings” are considered state-sponsored terrorism under international law.
Noting the Indian spy agency’s previous involvement in “similar actions in other countries”, he said, “They use criminal elements, terrorist groups and proxies. That was also the modus operandi in this case, as evident in the facts on RAW’s involvement during our investigation.”
On Monday, an anti-terrorism court in Karachi remanded a suspected RAW agent in the CTD’s custody, Muhammad Arsalan, over his alleged terror financing and facilitation in this targeted killing case.
The CTD claimed that initial interrogation revealed Arsalan and Umair’s involvement in terror financing, while the remaining suspects were directly linked to the targeted killing of the citizen. It added that an “Indian national” had given them the target and paid Rs3 million.
In June, four suspected Indian agents were arrested in a raid carried out in Karachi’s Quaidabad area. “The suspects had made videos and captured pictures of the country’s sensitive installations, which they used to send to RAW using specialised software,” police claimed.</p><small>2025-08-23 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/231650155a25dce.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935642/islamabad-court-orders-release-of-journalist-khalid-jamil' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court orders release of journalist Khalid Jamil</strong></a><br><p>A judicial magistrate in Islamabad on Saturday ordered the release of journalist Khalid Jamil, who was arrested by the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA) a day earlier, noting that “there is no incriminating material” against him.
According to a first information report (FIR), seen by Dawn.com, Jamil was accused of “sharing highly intimidating content on social media X on May 7”.
It stated that he “knowingly disseminated/propagated, fake, false, misleading and misinterpreted information leading to hatred against the government functionaries, including members of national security”.
The FIR said that a review of Jamil’s “broader social media activities reveals a deliberate pattern of conduct involving mocking, ridiculing, and maligning state institutions with the clear intent to instigate public discontent”.
A case was registered at the NCCIA Cyber Crime Reporting Centre on Aug 8 under Section 20 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca) (offenses against dignity of natural person) and Section 26A (dissemination of false and fake information).
The investigation officer (IO) today presented Jamil before the Islamabad Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Mureed Khan Abbas Khan. The IO sought the journalist’s remand for six days for “for the purpose of investigation as well as collection of evidence”.
However, the magistrate in his order noted that “as per (the) contents of FIR remarks quoted in FIR does not fall within any ambit of propagation or derogation”.
He added that “it is prime liberty of every citizen regarding the freedom of speech which is also guaranteed by Constitution of Pakistan”.
“Therefore, request for physical remand of accused person is hereby turned down and accused namely Khalid Jamil is hereby discharged from the instant case.”
Human rights lawyer and the petitioner’s counsel Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir confirmed to Dawn.com that Jamil was discharged today.
“The constituent elements for either of the offences could not be seen from the FIR itself or the record. These sections simply were not made out — in fact, that specific tweet was mainly about historical facts,” she said.
“So there is no question of Section 20 or 26A being invoked.”
 






In 2023, Jamil was arrested on charges of spreading “provocative narrative” against state institutions through social media posts. He was detained under Section 20 of the Peca Act and subsequently released after getting bail.
Peca, since its introduction in 2016, has been widely criticised as a “black law” created mainly to punish dissent. In the eight years since its enactment, it has been used extensively against politicians, journalists, rights activists, and even ordinary political workers.
The National Assembly in January passed a controversial amendment bill to the country’s cybercrime laws amid a walkout by PTI lawmakers and journalists from the proceedings.
On March 20, journalist Farhan Mallick, the founder of media agency Raftar and a former news director at Samaa TV, was arrested in a case pertaining to running allegedly “anti-state” content on his outlet’s YouTube channel. He was booked under Peca and the Pakistan Penal Code. He was later granted bail by separate Karachi courts, but the proceedings are still underway.
A few days later, journalist Waheed Murad, who works with Urdu News, was produced before an Islamabad court by the Federal Investigation Agency, which had booked him under Sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyber-terrorism), 20 (malicious code) and 26A (punishment for false and fake information) of the Peca. He too was granted post-arrest bail by an Islamabad court against Rs20,000 surety bail bonds following his two-day physical remand. However, he still facing legal proceedings.</p><small>2025-08-23 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/23075915d579d68.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934901/pakistanis-in-us-face-uncertainty-amid-visa-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistanis in US face uncertainty amid visa crackdown</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Pakistani students and other visa holders in the United States are facing growing uncertainty, as even minor infractions, political activity, or incomplete documentation could put their stay at risk.
Recent cases indicate that traffic violations and campus protests may be reported to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), raising alarms among the Pakistani community.
Two Pakistani students in northern Virginia were shocked when a traffic court judge informed them that courts are now required to share records of traffic violations with DHS.
“We were planning to drive to Chicago, but we’ve been advised not to,” said Y*, a student from Baltimore, Maryland. “We are on visas and even a minor mistake could lead to revocation.”

US reviewing social media for anti-American or extremist content; Pakistani embassy says it’s monitoring the situation, advises caution in political activities

Students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests, are even more anxious. “Some of us joined those demonstrations and now we don’t know if we can stay or might face deportation,” said S* from Baltimore.
 
 

M*, a student at George Mason University, said, “Most of us work part-time to pay tuition. Now we don’t know whether we can continue working.”
K*, who attends a community college in northern Virginia, added, “Almost all foreign students are scared. We don’t know whether we can work, drive, or even go out. This is not the America that we dreamed of.”
Those living in the US under political asylum face even greater concerns.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington estimates that between 700,000 to a million Pakistanis live in the United States, most as citizens or long-term residents. Many do not register officially, so exact numbers are unclear.
According to the latest Open Doors report by the Institute of International Education, the United States hosted 1,126,690 international students in 2024, up 7 per cent from the previous year.
Pakistan sent 10,988 students in 2024, compared to 17,099 from Bangladesh and 16,742 from Nepal. India topped the list with 331,602 students.
The Pakistani embassy estimates that the number of Pakistani students has risen to about 12,500 in 2025, still far below other South Asian countries.
 
 

As part of the broader vetting process, US authorities are reviewing social media activity for any signs of hostility toward US citizens, culture, government, or institutions.
Officials have also been instructed to monitor for support of designated foreign terrorists or engagement in antisemitic harassment or violence.
Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for US Citizenship and Immigration Services, stated, “America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies.”
In addition, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a pause in the issuance of worker visas for truck drivers, citing safety concerns and the impact on American livelihoods.
Visa holders from Malawi and Zambia are now required to pay a $15,000 deposit for tourist or business visas, while travel bans remain in effect for 12 countries, with partial restrictions on seven more.
The crackdown has left Pakistani students and visa holders anxious about their future.
Pakistani authorities in Washington continue to receive queries from students and other visa holders and forward them to the US State Department. Embassy officials are closely monitoring the situation, emphasising the importance of legal documentation, awareness of rights, and caution in political activity.

Names of students have been withdrawn to protect their privacy.

The draw for the 48-team football championship will be held at the Kennedy Center in the US capital, where Trump recently installed himself as chairman in what he called a war on “woke” culture.
“It’s the biggest, probably the biggest event in sports,” Trump, flanked by FIFA chief Gianni Infantino, said as he made the announcement in the Oval Office of the White House.
The 2026 World Cup is being hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico next year, and Trump has made a big deal about it happening during his presidency.
 






Infantino, who has fostered close ties with the billionaire US president, brought the World Cup with him for the announcement and even let Trump get his hands on it.
“Only the FIFA president, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it, because it’s for winners only. And since you are a winner, of course you can as well touch it,” Infantino said.
“Can I keep it?” replied Trump, who won a second term in the White House last year, as he lifted the trophy with both hands.
“That’s a beautiful piece of gold.”
Trump appeared to be joking — although the separate FIFA Club World Cup trophy remains in the Oval Office more than a month after English side Chelsea won it in New Jersey last month.
Putin ‘may be coming and he may not’
There was a brief moment of nerves as Trump appeared to fumble the World Cup before placing it on his desk — as Infantino reached out a hand to steady it.
Infantino later presented the US leader with a giant ticket — Row 1 Seat 1 — for the World Cup final on July 19 at the MetLife stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just outside New York.
Trump also suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin may attend the World Cup.
Holding up a photo that he said Putin had sent him after their summit in Alaska last week, Trump said the Kremlin chief “wants to be there very badly,” but that he “may be coming and he may not” depending on the outcome of Ukraine peace efforts.
The United States was named as a joint host of the 2026 World Cup during Trump’s first term as president in 2018. He lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden but won a second term last year.
Since his return to power, Trump has launched a major crackdown on immigration, but he said it would be “very easy” for most World Cup fans to get a visa.
For visitors from some countries, it would be “obviously a little bit more difficult,” said Trump, who has banned all travelers from 12 nations including Afghanistan, Haiti and Iran.
‘Trump-Kennedy Center’
The World Cup draw was reportedly due to be held in Las Vegas but the new venue has more political overtones.
Trump led a takeover of the Kennedy Center earlier this year, saying that the venerable performing arts venue named after late Democratic president John F. Kennedy had become too “woke.”

He added on Friday as he made the announcement that “some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we’re not prepared to do that quite yet, maybe in a week or so.”
Trump visited the Kennedy Center just before the Oval Office announcement on Friday. He has said he is going to make major improvements to “beautify” it, including adding marble cladding.
The US president also hailed a major federal crime crackdown in Washington that has seen US National Guard troops deployed on the streets of the capital.
Trump said the move would make Washington safe for football fans visiting the city during next year’s tournament.</p><small>2025-08-23 10:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2314393683604b8.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935358/coas-munir-visits-turbat-reaffirms-support-for-improving-balochistans-socio-economic-development' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir visits Turbat, reaffirms support for improving Balochistan’s socio-economic development</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir visited Turbat and reaffirmed the military’s unwavering support for initiatives aimed at improving Balochistan’s socio-economic conditions, the military’s media wing said on Saturday.
The government has repeatedly voiced its commitment to the development of Balochistan — a province with severe infrastructure deficits, recurring protests and a bleak law and order situation. In June, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed it one of the top priorities.
Field Marshal Munir interacted with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and representatives of the Turbat civil administration during his visit, according to a press release from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“The visit aimed to review the prevailing security situation, assess development initiatives, and reinforce coordination between military and civil institutions for the stability and prosperity of Balochistan,” the statement read.
 


During his interaction with the Turbat administration’s representatives, the army chief “reaffirmed unwavering support for all initiatives aimed at improving the southern Balochistan’s socio-economic development”.
COAS Munir emphasised the significance of joint civil-military efforts in addressing the challenges faced by the people of Balochistan. He also highlighted the need for good governance, infrastructure development, and the importance of inclusive, people-centric progress, the ISPR said.
The field marshal reiterated the army’s resolve to “stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Balochistan in their pursuit of peace, prosperity and sustainable development”.
He was also given a comprehensive briefing on the province’s security dynamics, including threat perspective and successful operations against Fitna al Hindustan, ongoing development projects, and efforts to enhance socio-economic conditions in southern Balochistan.
The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
During his interaction with troops, COAS Munir “appreciated their high morale, operational readiness, and unflinching commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty”. He hailed their role in ensuring peace and stability in the region under challenging circumstances.
Upon his arrival, the army chief was received by the Balochistan corps commander.
Addressing the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025 in April, COAS Munir said Pakistan’s goal was to create manpower, experts and human resources for the mineral sector, adding that economic security has emerged as an important component of national security.
 
 

He said the military would ensure a robust security framework and proactive measures to protect the interests and confidence of Pakistan’s partners and investors in Balochistan.
Under its provincial budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026, the Balochistan government has allocated Rs249.50 billion for the Annual Development Plan (ADP) and has decided to launch several development projects under the public-private partnership model.
Last month, the Balochistan cabinet approved a series of security enhancements, economic initiatives and public welfare projects, including the establishment of new police stations and a major subsidy for farmers.</p><small>2025-08-23 09:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2313180612610c4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935477/india-to-develop-fighter-jet-engines-at-home-with-french-company' target='_blank'><strong>India to develop fighter jet engines at home with French company</strong></a><br><p>India is working with a French company to develop and manufacture fighter jet engines in the country, New Delhi’s defence minister said.
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in May approved the prototype of a fifth generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), calling it a “significant push towards enhancing India’s indigenous defence capabilities”.
Singh, in a speech at a conference in New Delhi on Friday, gave more details about developing fighter jet aircraft engines in the country.
“We are moving forward to manufacture aircraft engines in India itself,” Singh said, in comments broadcast by Indian media.
“We are collaborating with a French company to start engine production in India.”
Singh did not name the company, but Indian media widely reported the company to be Safran, which has been working in India for decades in the aviation and defence sectors.
There was no immediate confirmation.
India, one of the world’s largest arms importers, has made the modernisation of its forces a top priority, and made repeated pushes to boost local arms production.
The world’s most populous nation has deepened defence cooperation with Western countries in recent years, including the Quad alliance with the United States, Japan and Australia.
India signed in April a multi-billion-dollar deal to purchase 26 Rafale fighter jets from France’s Dassault Aviation.
It would join 36 Rafale fighters already acquired, and replace the Russian MiG-29K jets.
Singh has also promised at least $100 billion in fresh domestic military hardware contracts by 2033 to spur local arms production.
This decade India has opened an expansive new helicopter factory, launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier, warships and submarines, and conducted a successful long-range hypersonic missile test.
India was engaged with Pakistan in a four-day conflict this year, their worst standoff since 1999.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.</p><small>2025-08-23 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/231044195a05bba.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934722/na-66-by-election-cheemas-meet-nawaz-promise-to-lend-support-to-party-nominee' target='_blank'><strong>NA-66 by-election: Cheemas meet Nawaz, promise to lend support to party nominee</strong></a><br><p>GUJRAT: In a major breakthrough, the ruling PML-N has managed to muster support of disgruntled former MNA Dr Nisar Cheema and his brother Zulfiqar Cheema, a retired IGP, for NA-66, Wazirabad, by-election.
The ballot is scheduled for Sept 18.
The seat fell vacant after the Election Commission of Pakistan de-seated Punjab PTI President MNA Ahmed Chattha in the wake of his conviction in May 9 riots.
In the upcoming by-poll, the PML-N did not award ticket to its last two-time aspirant Dr Nisar Cheema, who won the seat in 2018 and lost in February 2024 as a runner-up.
The party announced ex-MPA Bilal Farooq Tarar, the brother of federal minister for information Attaullah Tarar, as its candidate in the Wazirabad by-poll.
Following the nomination of the PML-N candidate, the Cheema group got  annoyed as earlier Nisar Cheema’s elder brother Justice retired Iftikhar Cheema had won the seat thrice as PML-N candidate.
However, on Friday the PML-N president and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif held a meeting with Dr Nisar Cheema and Zulfiqar Cheema at his residence in Murree where Punjab PML-N President Rana Sanaullah, former federal minister Khurram Dastgir Khan, ex-MNA Mudassar Qayyum and party’s Gujranwala division president former MNA Abid Raza Kotla and others were also present.
Participants in the meeting apprised Nawaz of the political situation in Gujranwala region, particularly the party’s campaign for the by-poll.
The party chief reportedly promised to address their concerns.
 






 
 

Gujranwala division PML-N President Abid Raza told Dawn that the meeting was ‘very successful’ as the Cheema brothers had later called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad where they announced a complete support to the PML-N candidate.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Rana Sanaullah were also present in the meeting in the PM office, Mr Raza said.
 






Sources said the Cheemas had been feeling ignored by the PML-N leadership since the February 2024 election and lack of coordination between them and the leadership had created a distance due to which the party opted to change its candidate.
The Cheema clan is said to have an edge in terms of population over the Chattha clan in Wazirabad that’s why most of the times the seat was won by representatives of this clan.
The PTI is yet to announce its candidate since it is not clear to contest the vote.
Sources said a member of senior politician Hamid Nasir Chattha’s family might contest the by-poll if the party opted to contest the election.

The suspect was seen with a 10-year-old girl at Zaheerabad Colony of Chunain through a viral video. The child was in the street when he molested her and CCTV footage captured him committing the crime. The girl child’s father had reported the matter to the police and registered an FIR.
The police claimed when they conducted a raid to arrest the suspect, he tried to attack them with his pistol that went off. As a result, his private parts were critically injured. The suspect was hospitalised in an injured condition.
According to sources in the police, he belonged to the same area as that of the child he molested. He is stated to be 27/28 years old, a daily-wager with no regular job. He is married and has a daughter.
About three weeks back, a video of a man molesting a girl child who was playing in the street of Shah Inayat Colony had gone viral, causing an outrage on social media.
DPO Essa Khan Sukhera had taken notice of the footage and directed Station House Officer Asif Javed to arrest the suspect. Three days later, the suspect, a labourer from Okara, was arrested by City police in an injured condition. He too had suffered a bullet injury to his private parts.
The police said the suspect was caught at Dhanpat Road where he pulled out a pistol to escape arrest. However, the pistol went off during a firing exchange, causing an injury to him.

The Pakistan Tele­comm­unication Authority (PTA) said the tariff adjustments highlighted in the audit observations had been duly approved by the authority in line with the prescribed regulatory framework.
“All relevant records substantiating these approvals were shared with the audit authorities for verification,” the PTA stated.
In a statement, PTA said, “Certain misleading information is being circulated on social media, suggesting that Jazz charged its subscribers tariffs beyond those approved by PTA during the financial year 2023–24, as referenced in the Auditor General of Pakistan’s report.”
 
 

It reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding consumer interests and ensuring a fair, transparent telecom ecosystem.
The authority maintains continuous oversight of all operators’ tariff structures to ensure strict compliance with regulatory requirements and to prevent any unfair commercial practices.
 






Meanwhile, Jazz has also issued a statement claiming that it was reviewing the observations shared in the audit report on the PTA for Audit Year 2024–25.
“We remain confident that Jazz has acted lawfully and transparently at every step, in full alignment with PTA’s rules and regulatory procedures, including those related to tariff approvals and mandated contributions.”

• Naveed Qamar argues lawmakers deserve same relief as civil servants
ISLAMABAD: A National Assembly panel on Friday failed to reach consensus on a bill seeking secrecy of lawmakers’ assets after members from PML-N and PTI joined hands to oppose the move tabled by PPP legislators.
Under the existing law, all members of the National Assembly, Senate, and provincial assemblies are required to submit to the Election Commission, on or before Dec 31 each year, a statement of their assets and liabilities, including those of their spouses and dependent children. Section 138 of the Elections Act also requires the ECP to publish these declarations in the official gazette.
The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs, which met under the chairmanship of Rana Iradat Sharif Khan, considered the bill introduced by Shazia Marri and Syed Naveed Qamar.
The proposed amendment to Section 138 seeks to insert a proviso stating: “Provided that the extent of disclosure, under this section, shall give due regard to the balance between public interest for good governance and an individual’s privacy and security. Provided further that the extent to which the first proviso shall apply will be determined by the Speaker of the concerned Assembly and, in the case of the Senate, by the Chairman.”
 






According to the statement of objects and reasons, the amendment aims to strike a balance between transparency and the protection of individual rights.
It states: “While the publication of statements of assets and liabilities serves a vital role in promoting public accountability, enhancing trust in public office, and ensuring good governance, it is recognised that unrestricted or excessive disclosure could potentially compromise the personal security and privacy of parliamentarians and their families.”
During the proceedings, Mr Qamar referred to the recently passed amendment to the Civil Servants Act, which requires civil servants in grades 17 to 22 to disclose all domestic and foreign assets, including those of their spouses and dependent children.
He pointed out that civil servants can approach their heads of departments if they believe disclosure of their assets could pose a security threat. He argued that similar relief should also be available to lawmakers.
The committee was also apprised that National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) was expanding its operational capacity. The agency has also enhanced coordination with the PTA to curb the misuse of illegal SIMs. It also raised concerns over financial crimes, fraudulent activities targeting the BISP.
