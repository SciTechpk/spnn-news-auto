International outrage has built over a crackdown on the demonstrations, which a rights group said has likely killed thousands in one of the biggest challenges yet to Iran’s clerical leadership.
Iranian authorities have insisted they have regained control of the country after successive nights of mass protests, repeatedly accusing the demonstrators of carrying out “acts of terror” of the kind committed by militant Islamic State group.
Judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said on a visit to a prison holding protest detainees that “if a person burned someone, beheaded someone and set them on fire then we must do our work quickly”, in comments broadcast by state television.
Iranian news agencies also quoted him as saying the trials should be held in public and said he had spent five hours in a prison in Tehran to examine the cases.
Trump on Tuesday said in a CBS News interview that the United States would act if Iran began hanging protesters.







“We will take very strong action if they do such a thing,” said the American leader, who has repeatedly threatened Iran with military intervention.
“When they start killing thousands of people — and now you’re telling me about hanging. We’ll see how that’s going to work out for them,” Trump said.
Tehran called the American warnings a “pretext for military intervention”.







Iran’s UN mission posted a statement on X, vowing that Washington’s “playbook” would “fail again”.
“US fantasies and policy toward Iran are rooted in regime change, with sanctions, threats, engineered unrest, and chaos serving as the modus operandi to manufacture a pretext for military intervention,” the post said.







Rights groups accuse the government of fatally shooting protesters and masking the scale of the crackdown with an internet blackout imposed on January 8.
“Metrics show Iran remains offline as the country wakes to another day of digital darkness,” said internet monitor Netblocks on Wednesday in a post on X, adding that the blackout had lasted 132 hours.







However, some information has trickled out of Iran.
New videos on social media, with locations verified by AFP, showed bodies lined up in the Kahrizak morgue just south of the Iranian capital, with the corpses wrapped in black bags and distraught relatives searching for loved ones.

Tehran prosecutors have said Iranian authorities would press capital charges of “waging war against God” on some detainees.
Calls to halt executions
The US State Department on its Farsi language X account said 26-year-old protestor Erfan Soltani had been sentenced to be executed on Wednesday.
“Erfan is the first protester to be sentenced to death, but he won’t be the last,” the State Department said, adding more than 10,600 Iranians had been arrested.







Rights group Amnesty International called on Iran to immediately halt all executions, including Soltani’s.







Trump urged on his Truth Social platform for Iranians to “KEEP PROTESTING”, adding: “I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY.”
It was not immediately clear what meetings he was referring to or what the nature of the help would be.







Some personnel advised to leave US base in Qatar: diplomats
Meanwhile, some personnel have been advised to leave the US military’s Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar by Wednesday evening, three diplomats told Reuters, amid warnings from Washington that it could intervene.
The US embassy in Doha had no immediate comment and Qatar‘s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for confirmation or comment.
Al Udeid is the Middle East’s largest US base, housing around 10,000 troops.
“It’s a posture change and not an ordered evacuation,” one of the diplomats told Reuters. The diplomat said he was not aware that a specific reason had been given for the posture change.
A senior Iranian official told Reuters earlier that Tehran warned regional countries it would strike U.S. military bases in case of an attack by Washington, after President Donald Trump threatened to intervene in Iran.
‘Rising casualties’
European nations have also signalled their anger over the crackdown, with France, Germany and the United Kingdom among the countries that summoned their Iranian ambassadors, as did the European Union.
“The rising number of casualties in Iran is horrifying,” said EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, vowing further sanctions.
Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights claimed it had confirmed 734 people killed during the protests, including nine minors, but warned the death toll was likely far higher.
“The real number of those killed is likely in the thousands,” IHR’s director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam insisted.







Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies.
Authorities in Tehran have announced a mass funeral ceremony in the capital on Wednesday for the “martyrs” of recent days.
Amir, an Iraqi computer scientist, returned to Baghdad on Monday and described dramatic scenes in Tehran.
“On Thursday night, my friends and I saw protesters in Tehran’s Sarsabz neighbourhood amid a heavy military presence. The police were firing rubber bullets,” he told AFP in Iraq.

 

Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah, called on the military to stop suppressing protests.
“You are the national military of Iran, not the military of the Islamic Republic,” he said in a statement.
‘Serious challenge’
The government has sought to regain control of the streets with nationwide rallies that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed as proof that the protest movement was defeated, calling them a “warning” to the US.
In power since 1989 and now aged 86, Khamenei has faced significant challenges, most recently the 12-day war in June against Israel, which forced him to go into hiding.

 

Analysts have cautioned that it is premature to predict the immediate demise of the theocratic system, pointing to the repressive levers the leadership controls, including the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is charged with safeguarding the Islamic revolution.
Nicole Grajewski, professor at the Sciences Po Centre for International Studies, told AFP the protests represented a “serious challenge” to the Islamic republic, but it was unclear if they would unseat the leadership, pointing to “the sheer depth and resilience of Iran’s repressive apparatus”.</p><small>2026-01-14 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14145403291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966929/journalist-aslam-shah-granted-bail-in-defamation-case' target='_blank'><strong>Journalist Aslam Shah granted bail in defamation case</strong></a><br><p>Journalist Aslam Shah was granted bail on Wednesday, a week after his arrest on the charges of “defamation through social media” under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA).
In a hearing held today on his bail application, Judicial Magistrate (South) granted Shah bail and directed him to submit surety bonds of Rs30,000.
A large number of journalists were present at the hearing, while the lawyer representing the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Shiraz Rajper, appeared as well.
On January 7, the NCCIA arrested Shah on charges of “defamation through social media”.
Shah had moved an application through his counsel, Nasir Ahmed, before the Judicial Magistrate (South), seeking post-arrest bail in the case.
On January 12, the magistrate took up the bail plea, but an NCCIA official appeared and informed the court that the investigating officer was on leave and that the case file was not available with the prosecution. He requested that the matter be adjourned to Jan 14.
In the application, counsel Ahmed submitted that the case against Shah had been registered with malafide intent, alleging that he had been implicated solely to “take revenge” and to save the complainant.
He argued that the applicant had 30 years of experience in journalism and had worked with recognised print and wire media organisations.
The counsel further submitted that Shah was protected under Section 7 of the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act, 2021.
The case was registered on December 29, 2025, on the complaint of Tabish Raza Husnain, said to be an official of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), under Sections 20 (offences against the dignity of a natural person) and Section 24 (cyberstalking) of PECA.
In the FIR, the complainant had alleged that Shah was doing “defamation propaganda” against him and his senior, Colonel Anjum, on social media groups.
He also alleged that he had used abusive language, which caused him significant distress and damage to his reputation.
In August 2025, the Senate Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting showed its concern over registration of cases against journalists under the controversial Peca and called for urgent action to address growing concerns of media persons regarding FIRs and arrests of journalists.</p><small>2026-01-14 11:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14141130c72b667.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966923/karachi-mayor-says-water-hydrant-system-to-be-abolished-soon-kswc-to-develop-alternate-strategy' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi mayor says water hydrant system to be ‘abolished’ soon, KSWC to develop alternate strategy</strong></a><br><p>Mayor Karachi Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday announced that the city administration would soon end the supply of water through hydrants, saying he had directed the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) to develop an alternative water distribution strategy.
Karachi faces an acute water shortage as the metropolis requires over 1,200 million gallons of water daily (MGD), but gets only 650MGD. Many parts of the city are supplied via water tankers from hydrants.
Speaking to the media after the inauguration of the Jehangir Road Rehabilitation project, Mayor Wahab outlined plans to “abolish” the hydrant system and directed KWSC officials to develop a strategy for fair distribution of water across the metropolis.
“The contract period for each hydrant is two years, and that period for the city’s seven hydrants has expired,” the mayor said, adding that when deciding if the contracts should be renewed, he recommended that the hydrants should be closed instead.
“There should be fair distribution of water in the city,” he said.
He further said that KSWC officials were currently working on a proposal for developing an alternate system.
“When they complete the proposal, I will present it to the City Council,“ he said.
“Once the City Council gives approval, we will stop tanker services”.
The mayor maintained that the hydrant system had been inherited, and “the beneficiary is someone else”.
“There is a shortage of water, but it should be distributed fairly,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-14 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/141532224e3a80e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966927/pakistan-in-talks-with-multiple-countries-for-sale-of-jf-17-jets-confirms-defence-production-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan in talks with ‘multiple’ countries for sale of JF-17 jets, confirms defence production minister</strong></a><br><p>Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj has confirmed that Pakistan is engaged in discussions with “multiple” countries for the sale of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets.
In recent weeks, Pakistan has reportedly been in talks with several friendly countries for a deal on the JF-17, a light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan.
“These negotiations are taking place and they take some time. Many countries have shown interest in these aircraft,” the minister was quoted as saying in an interview with BBC Urdu, published on Tuesday.
“I cannot take the name of any country. Neither can I tell on what level our negotiations are with any country,” he told the British broadcaster.



“When these jets are exported, then the world will know which countries have bought them,” the report quoted him as saying.
He stressed that such matters were a country’s “jealously guarded secrets”.
Harraj further said, “Firstly, we must ensure that we only sell [JF-17s] to those who are our friendly countries. So they are not used against us.”
He added that China is on board whenever Pakistan signs such a deal with any country.
The defence production minister highlighted that the jets were battle-tested during the four-day conflict with India last year: “The entire world’s air forces saw these jets’ performance during that time and praised it.”
The minister termed the price of the jet “an important” aspect, detailing that while the average value of such planes around the world was $250-350 million, the JF-17 Thunder was cheaper.

 

Asked about the exact value, he told BBC Urdu, “Its value is around $40-50m; this depends on the jet’s features, and the price can also be higher than this”.
When enquired about whether China also received a share from the sale, Harraj was quoted as saying, “A lot of matters are discussed on the table. China is definitely included in them; it should be and it is their right”.
‘Production capacity a secret’
On a question about Pakistan’s production capacity, especially considering the interest of several countries, the minister told BBC Urdu, “This is a question related to our national defence. These are our secrets, let them remain secrets”.
He stressed that producing such “state-of-the-art” jets was a time-consuming task.
According to the minister, “some portion of the jet is readied in Pakistan, and some portion is readied in China”.
Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at China’s Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), told BBC Urdu that “technology” involved in the jet was likely controlled by China. Therefore, any sale pact would be a joint agreement, with Beijing being a “senior partner”.
“China might even increase Pakistan’s defence production, but all this will be in Beijing’s control,” the expert was quoted as saying.
Earlier this month, the air chiefs of Pakistan and Bangladesh held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17s.
Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu also visited Iraq this week, where he met with the air chief, who expressed a “keen interest” in the fighter aircraft.
Recently, Reuters, citing two Pakistani sources, reported that Islamabad and Riyadh were in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 deal.
Indonesia’s Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin also visited Pakistan last week, holding meetings with the army chief and ACM Sindhu. The military’s media wing said that the minister expressed Jakarta’s desire to further expand defence ties with Islamabad.
Defence cooperation with KSA, Turkiye
According to BBC Urdu, Harraj refrained from disclosing details about the Pak-Saudi defence pact signed in September 2025.

 

“This is a defence agreement between the field marshal, the prime minister and the Saudi government. I cannot tell any more than this,” he explained.
Last week, Bloomberg reported that Turkiye was seeking to join the pact.
“From a strategic point of view, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan are close friendly countries of Pakistan, and there is a close relationship with them in terms of strategic policy.”</p><small>2026-01-14 10:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/141521252a56273.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966922/pakistan-signs-mou-with-trump-linked-world-liberty-finance' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan signs MoU with Trump-linked World Liberty Finance</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan said on Wednesday it had signed an agreement with a firm connected to World Liberty Financial, the main crypto business of US President Donald Trump’s family, to explore using World Liberty’s stablecoin for cross-border payments.
The Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA) said in a statement that a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with SC Financial Technologies, a little-known company it described as an “affiliated entity” of World Liberty, would enable “dialogue and technical understanding around emerging digital payment architectures”.







The announcement represents one of the first publicly announced tie-ups between World Liberty, a crypto-based finance platform launched in September 2024, and a sovereign state. It also comes amid a warming of ties between Pakistan and the United States.

 

Under the agreement, SC Financial Technologies will work with Pakistan’s central bank to integrate its USD1 stablecoin into a regulated digital payments structure, allowing the token to operate alongside Pakistan’s own digital currency infrastructure, a source involved in the deal said.
World Liberty CEO visits Pakistan
The announcement of the memorandum came during a visit to Pakistan by Zach Witkoff, son of US special envoy Steve Witkoff and co-founder and chief executive of World Liberty.
Zach Witkoff is also CEO of SC Financial Technologies. The company, registered in Delaware, co-owns with World Liberty the USD1 stablecoin brand, according to documentation on the stablecoin’s reserves from July 2025.

Witkoff met with “senior Pakistani stakeholders” to discuss how digital payment infrastructure, cross-border settlement and foreign exchange processes, the statement said.
“Our focus is to stay ahead of the curve by engaging with credible global players, understanding new financial models, and ensuring that innovation, where explored, is aligned with regulation, stability, and national interest,” said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.
Stablecoins, digital tokens typically pegged to the dollar, have ballooned in value in recent years. Under Trump, the United States has introduced federal rules widely seen as beneficial to the sector, and countries across the world are beginning to examine the potential role of stablecoins in payments and financial systems.

 

World Liberty fuelled a sharp increase in income for the Trump family business, known as the Trump Organisation, including from foreign entities, in the first half of last year, Reuters reported in October.
Last May, MGX, a state-controlled Abu Dhabi investment company, used the World Liberty stablecoin to buy a $2 billion equity stake in Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.
Pakistan has been exploring digital currency projects as it seeks to reduce cash usage and improve cross-border payments such as remittances, a key source of foreign exchange.
Its central bank governor said in July it was preparing to launch a pilot for a digital currency and is finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets.</p><small>2026-01-14 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/141349590003881.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966921/ji-demands-islamabad-lg-polls-be-held-on-schedule' target='_blank'><strong>JI demands Islamabad LG polls be held on schedule</strong></a><br><p>Emir Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) Hafiz Naeemur Rehman demanded that local body polls in the federal capital be held as per the earlier announced schedule.
President Asif Ali Zardari approved an ordinance that introduces several amendments to the Local Government Act 2015. The new ordinance was introduced at a time when the local governments in Islamabad were scheduled to be held on February 15.
Chances are now slim that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will assert holding the elections as scheduled.
“The elections should be held on time and on the basis of nominations that have been done, while the ordinance needs to be abolished and undemocratic practices need to end,” he said, while speaking to the media in Islamabad.
The JI chief claimed the officials did not intend to hold elections as they had also removed a clause in the ordinance that specified its duration of six months.
“Usually, it is considered that the administration of Islamabad is well-established, but the federal capital is facing a severe crisis, including water and infrastructure. No work is being done to address the issues, as elected representation of the people is missing,” said Rehman, questioning who will take responsibility for the federal capital.
Giving an example of heavy rainfall in the city and the lack of a rain harvesting system in the federal capital, the JI chief lamented that “no work” was being done to address such issues.
“It means the government is not fulfilling its responsibilities. They are not holding elections to represent people who are elected from grassroots levels through local government elections,” he said.
Deforestation in Islamabad
Speaking on the issue of deforestation in Islamabad, Rehman strongly condemned the act and said officials had cut at least 40,000 to 50,000 trees, which was detrimental to the environment and to humans.
“You have started cutting trees to achieve your small targets without realising the impact on the environment,” he said.
He demanded to know the reason for the tree-cutting, under whose orders the action was taken, and the names of those responsible.
“The responsibility needs to be fixed and the people involved should be apprehended,” he demanded.
Referring to the National Assembly session held on Tuesday, he said that multiple political parties that were part of the government had discussed the issue in the House.
Questioning the authority of the ruling party, he asked, “Where were they when the trees were being cut?”
He further said that officials were cutting trees and planting saplings in the same areas. “After cutting 40,000 trees, even if they plant the same number of saplings, it would not amount to even five per cent,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-14 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14134652da6bc14.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966925/ppp-continues-to-question-islamabad-deforestation-expresses-dissatisfaction-with-answers-given-in-na' target='_blank'><strong>PPP continues to question Islamabad deforestation, expresses dissatisfaction with answers given in NA</strong></a><br><p>The PPP on Wednesday continued questioning the government on the recent deforestation in Islamabad, expressing dissatisfaction with the answers given by the government in a session of the National Assembly (NA) a day earlier.
In the past few days, there has been widespread criticism over the cutting of thousands of mature trees in various locations of the federal capital, including the levelling of acres of tree cover around Shakarparian.
On Tuesday, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had informed lawmakers that 29,115 trees had been removed from the Islamabad Capital Territory region (ICT), but that more than this number would be planted in the coming months.
PPP lawmaker Shazia Marri, addressing a press conference, said that the issue had been raised in the NA as “all parliamentarians were concerned”, hoping that they would receive answers to the “questions that have been flying about”.
However, she said, the response by the state minister for interior during Tuesday’s NA session had only raised more questions.
“Sometimes it is said that it is because of pollen allergies … yesterday another impression was given, that there are some brown districts and some green districts — so you have to keep some brown and some green,” Marri said.
“At what cost? At the cost of your environment? At the cost of urban planning? At the cost of biodiversity in your urban areas? At what cost?”
She pointed out that not only were political parties asking these questions, but also civil society, adding that the World Wide Fund of Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) had also shown serious concern about the way the trees were being cut down.
“It is not just cutting,” she said. “It is an action that is challenging your environmental governance; it raises questions on transparency.”
Marri particularly took exception to the lack of transparency shown by the government in its response to the outcry.
“You tell us: for however many trees you have cut, how many have you planted? We are not being shown this. We are only shown trees being cut, not planted.“
“We don’t know how many trees are being planted — we are only told that these many thousands have been planted. But what proof is there of this?” she added.
The lawmaker further said, “To give them some benefit of the doubt: if you cut the trees and there was some good reason for it, then why are you running from giving answers?”
Marri added that Chaudhry “should have given a patient answer” in the NA session yesterday.
“He felt that maybe the CDA [Capital Development Authority] was being attacked; it was not like that.”
She further said, “If you’re going to cut trees by the thousands in Pakistan’s capital — that is the face of your country — and so boldly, then the question will be raised… and will not just be asked to you by political parties, by the PPP, but the public will ask, civil society will ask, journalists will ask. They ask you and you get upset — that is not appropriate.”
“If there is indeed purity in this action of yours, then share it. Tell us,” she added.
Marri regretted that the government had not given a press conference on the matter of the trees, saying, “There’s a press conference on everything. But why did the government not take the public into confidence on the cutting of trees, through a press conference or a media briefing? This should have happened, and I regret to say it did not.”
The CDA has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed, as they had been causing pollen allergies. However, social media users had alleged that, besides paper mulberry, indigenous trees were also chopped down, making Shakarparian look like barren land.
Climate Change Minister Musadiq Malik has defended the move, stating that paper mulberry was an invasive and “life-threatening” species.
Load shedding concerns
At the same press conference, Marri slammed the state of load shedding in Pakistan, particularly focusing on Sindh.
She said that if one called their sub-divisional officer, they would be told that the load shedding was because a household had not paid their electricity bill: “If one house didn’t pay the electricity bill, then you’ll cut electricity for the whole neighbourhood? … If not paying the bill is illegal, then cutting the electricity of those who do pay the bill is also illegal.”
Marri lamented that this was the state of affairs in winter, wondering what would happen in summer.
She also condemned gas load shedding and the lack of gas provided to Sindh, including Karachi, although it was a natural resource found in Sindh.
She added that according to Article 158 of the Constitution, the first right to gas went to the people of the wellhead region.
However, she said, people were being deprived of gas and when gas was available, they were being sold imported gas at high prices.</p><small>2026-01-14 09:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14083641736ef2a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966792/lahore-high-court-orders-nccia-to-identify-maligners-of-judiciary-on-social-media' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore High Court orders NCCIA to identify maligners of judiciary on social media</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday directed the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to compile a report identifying all individuals involved in maligning, scandalising, or attempting to subvert the dignity and authority of the judiciary through social media accounts, directly or indirectly.
Justice Ali Zia Bajwa was hearing a petition filed by a lawyer, Chaudhry Pervez Elahi Bhaddar, challenging an alleged character assassination campaign on social media against female judges of the high court.
The judge observed that any conduct amounting to contempt does not enjoy the protection of constitutional liberties and is not immune to legal action.
He maintained that no individual has the licence to scandalise the courts or obstruct the course of justice under the pretext of freedom of expression.
He noted that the law mandates that such acts be dealt with firmly to preserve the authority and sanctity of the judicial institution.
“Respect for the judiciary is of paramount importance in a constitutional framework, as it serves as the cornerstone for the rule of law, the separation of powers and the effective functioning of democratic institutions,” Justice Bajwa observed in his written order.
The judge said the indifference and inaction of the state functionaries amounted to a clear disregard of their statutory obligations.
Advocate General Punjab (AGP) Amjad Pervez appeared before the court and stated that the provincial government shall leave no stone unturned in curbing and countering any campaign aimed at undermining the dignity, independence and authority of the judiciary.
He asserted that any attempt to malign the judiciary is deeply deplorable and must be unequivocally condemned. He sought time to file a comprehensive written reply on the next date of hearing.
Earlier, Advocate Mian Dawood argued on behalf of the petitioner that an organised and deliberate campaign had been launched across various social media platforms with the manifest objective of maligning, scandalising and weakening the authority and dignity of the judiciary.
He said such conduct is not only condemnable, but also poses a serious threat to the independence of the judicial institution and the sanctity of the justice system.
He argued that despite the gravity of the situation, the public functionaries and regulatory authorities showed conspicuous and unexplained inaction.
Justice Bajwa ordered the authorities that any individual found involved in maligning, scandalising, or otherwise attempting to diminish the dignity and authority of the judiciary shall be proceeded against strictly in accordance with law.
The judge summoned the NCCIA director general on the next hearing to explain the apparent failure of cyber policing, which serves as a critical instrument in preventing the circulation of objectionable material on social media platforms.
The judge also sought a report from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) chairman, outlining the statutory role and responsibilities of the authority in identifying, blocking and removing contemptuous content from digital and social media.
The judge will resume further hearing on Jan 15.

All three matches are scheduled to take place at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on January 29, 31 and February 1, PCB said in a statement. The toss will take place at 5:30pm and matches will begin at 6pm.
Australia’s T20I squad will arrive in Lahore on Jan 28.







“The series serves as crucial game time for both the sides ahead of the all-important ICC Men’s T20I World Cup 2026, where Pakistan are placed in Group A and Australia in Group B,” PCB said.
This is the third time Australia are touring Pakistan; they played a three-match Test and ODI series in March-April 2022, followed by a solitary T20I where they bagged a close three-wicket win at Gaddafi Stadium.
Australia also played three of their 2025 Champions Trophy matches in Pakistan.
“We are excited and look forward to hosting Australia for the three-match T20I series here in Lahore,“ PCB Chief Operating Officer Sumair Ahmed Syed said.
“The tour marks a blockbuster beginning of the year for Pakistan Cricket fans and I urge them to turn out in numbers during the series to support both the teams as they put final touches to their T20 World Cup preparations.”
The COO added: “I’m sure the Gaddafi Stadium has become a familiar sight for Australian Cricket team as they have played a Test, five ODIs and a T20I here since March 2022.”

The structure was completely destroyed, severing land links between the area and Miranshah, Bannu and other adjoining regions.
The incident has once again raised serious questions about the law and order situation in the volatile district.
According to local sources, unidentified attackers planted a large quantity of explosives beneath the bridge during the early morning hours.

 


The explosion was heard from many miles away, spreading fear and panic among the area’s residents.
Following the incident, police and security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area. An investigation was launched into the incident.
The destruction of the bridge — a vital line of communication in the region — is likely to cause severe hardships for the people as it served as an important route for the daily movement of civilians, patients, students, traders and government employees.
Its collapse has also disrupted access to healthcare facilities, supply of essential goods and routine commercial activities, forcing the region’s residents to use much longer and more difficult alternative routes.
Local sources added that security forces’ convoys occasionally used the route as well, leading to concerns that the attack may have been aimed at destabilising the region and undermining peace.
According to official sources, the bridge was primarily used by civilians for relief operations and movement.
Tribal elder Malik Islam Khan and other local elders strongly condemned the incident, calling it a “heinous and cowardly act”.
They said such actions primarily harm innocent civilians who are already suffering due to years of insecurity and underdevelopment. They demanded immediate and strict action against those responsible.
Local political leader Abdullah Khan also expressed grave concern over the incident, stating that the people of North Waziristan had made immense sacrifices for peace, and such attacks were an attempt to sabotage those efforts.
He urged the government to further strengthen security in the area and ensure the protection of critical infrastructure.
Authorities said a comprehensive investigation is underway, while a report has been sent to senior officials regarding the bridge’s reconstruction and interim alternative arrangements.
Attacks on infrastructure
While attacks targeting infrastructure are fairly common in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has also seen a rise in such incidents in recent months.
On December 7, unidentified terrorists blew up a link bridge in the Mamandkhel area of the Bannu district using explosive material, affecting public movement in the area.
Also last month, within a span of a week, North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil witnessed two incidents of terrorists blowing up government schools.

 

November also saw two incidents of terrorists attempting to blow up bridges in Bannu. One plot was foiled by the police’s bomb disposal squad, while the improvised explosive device (IED) in the other detonated prematurely, killing the attacker.</p><small>2026-01-14 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14105813a4eafd1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966915/fm-aurangzeb-says-some-firms-left-pakistan-due-to-high-taxes-energy-costs' target='_blank'><strong>FM Aurangzeb says some firms left Pakistan due to high taxes, energy costs</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday acknowledged that some multinational companies have left Pakistan due to “high taxes and energy costs”, but called on them to revise their business models, aligning them with the “modern world”.
During the past few years, multiple MNCs have shut down their operations in Pakistan, including Procter & Gamble, Eli Lilly, Shell, Microsoft, Uber and Yamaha.
He made the remarks while addressing the Pakistan Policy Dialogue, hosted by Policy Research & Advisory Council (PRAC), in Islamabad.
The minister, in his address, talked about the exodus of multinational companies from the country, stating, “There are firms that are leaving Pakistan, which is true, and we must acknowledge if the taxation is high, energy cost is high, or financing cost, those have been real issues”.
However, the minister continued: “But it takes two to tango [..] if you are wedged into your business models from the last 50 years, it is not going to work in the modern world”.

 

Citing Nestle and Unilever as examples of MNCs successfully operating in Pakistan, he said, “If Nestle and Unilever can do local sourcing, which keeps their margins high, they are now able to export, which is why they continue operating here.”
The minister also shared that in the last 18 months, “20 new foreign investors had entered the country”.
Talking about the government’s privatisation efforts regarding State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), he said that 24 SOEs have been handed over to the Privatisation Commission.
He elaborated that the losses suffered due to SOEs were a “huge gap” and expressed hope that the amount saved by the national exchequer could be put to a much better use going forward.
The finance czar recalled that the government had to close down the Utility Stores Corporation, Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (PASSCO), “not because 1,000-5,000 people were employed there, but because of the subsidies that the government was providing them”.
“More importantly, it was the corruption built into those subsidies that was the real cost to the exchequer,” the finance minister maintained.
“By June this year, all government payments are going to go through digital channels,“ said Aurangzeb while referring to the government’s digitisation efforts.
Speaking about tariff reforms, the minister said that Regulatory Duty (RD), Customs Duty (CD) and Additional Customs Duty (ACDs) will be phased out in five years.
“This is to bring our intermediary and raw material costs down so we can take it towards an export-led discussion,” Aurangzeb said.
He held that this was being done for the first time in the country‘s history, stressing that it could be Pakistan’s “East Asia moment”.
The finance minister further said that the protection given to industries had led to a decline in competition.
“If we are to take this forward [..] and move toward export orientation, we have to start from somewhere,“ he said.
The finance minister also spoke of debt servicing, and termed it the “single largest expense item” for the country.
He outlined plans to modernise the debt management office, stressing the need for “having proper investor relations, a front office, a middle office, a back office so we can take it forward professionally”.
“Past year, we saved roughly Rs850bn in terms of debt servicing,” the finance minister said, expressing hope to achieve similar results this year.
The minister further said that the government planned to issue Panda Bonds “in the next couple of weeks if all goes well”.
In his address, the minister reiterated the government’s commitment to bring crypto into the “regulatory environment”.
“We have billions of dollars in discussion of trading volumes [..] activity which is happening at this volume has to be brought into a regulatory environment.”
In October 2025, American multinational corporation Procter & Gamble announced that it was winding down its manufacturing and commercial activities in Pakistan.
The MNC said that it will rely on third-party distributors to continue to serve customers in the country.
In September last year, Yamaha Motor Pakistan Ltd (YMPL) also announced the discontinuation of its motorcycle assembly operations.
The decision came as part of a change in the company’s business strategy.
In the same year, Careem suspended its ride-hailing operations in Pakistan after nearly a decade in the industry.
Analysts suggest that the reasons for the shift are often varied, including restructuring at the company’s end, growing competition from local companies, and security conditions, among others</p><small>2026-01-14 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/141211488eddb07.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966919/over-20-killed-dozens-injured-in-train-accident-at-china-backed-project-in-thailand' target='_blank'><strong>Over 20 killed, dozens injured in train accident at China-backed project in Thailand</strong></a><br><p>A crane at a China-backed high-speed rail project in Thailand collapsed onto and derailed a passenger train on Wednesday, killing at least 22 people and injuring scores, local authorities said.
Footage from the scene verified by AFP showed the crane’s broken structure resting on giant concrete pillars, with smoke rising from the wreckage of the train below.
Rescuers worked to extract passengers from the tilted carriages in Nakhon Ratchasima province, northeast of the capital Bangkok.
Thatchapon Chinnawong, the district police chief, told AFP that 22 people had been confirmed dead and 80 more were injured.
“We are now asking the hospital to say how many people are in critical condition,” Thatchapon said.







“At around 9:00am, I heard a loud noise, like something sliding down from above, followed by two explosions,” said 54-year-old local resident Mitr Intrpanya, who was at the scene.
“When I went to see what had happened, I found the crane sitting on a passenger train with three carriages.
“The metal from the crane appeared to strike the middle of the second carriage, slicing it in half,” Mitr told AFP.
The accident happened at a construction site that is part of a $5.4-billion project backed by Beijing to build a high-speed rail network in Thailand.
It aims to connect Bangkok to Kunming in China via Laos by 2028 as part of China’s vast Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

 

“A crane collapsed onto a train causing it to derail and catch fire,” the Nakhon Ratchasima provincial public relations department said in a statement.
Live footage aired by local media showed rescue workers rushing to the scene, with a brightly coloured train derailed on its side as smoke billowed from the debris.
Thatchapon, the police chief, later told AFP that authorities were pausing the rescue operation due to “chemical leakage” at the scene.
The Nakhon Ratchasima provincial department said the train was travelling from Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani province.
Transport Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said 195 people were on board the train and authorities were rushing to identify the deceased.
He ordered officials to determine the cause of the accident, according to a statement.
Thailand already has around 5,000 kilometres of railway, but the run-down network has long driven people to favour travel by road.
Upon completion of the 600km high-speed railway, Chinese-made trains will run from Bangkok to Nong Khai, on the Mekong River border with Laos, at up to 250 km/h.
Industrial and construction site accidents have long been common in Thailand, where lax enforcement of safety regulations often leads to deadly incidents.
In 2023, a freight train killed eight people after it struck a pickup truck crossing railway tracks in eastern Thailand.
A freight train killed at least 18 people and injured more than 40 others in 2020 when it crashed into a bus carrying passengers to a religious ceremony.</p><small>2026-01-14 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14105515db4142a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966914/ctd-kills-3-terrorists-in-successful-ibo-in-kps-di-khan' target='_blank'><strong>CTD kills 3 terrorists in successful IBO in KP’s DI Khan</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan on Wednesday, said a statement by the department.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“On the special instructions of the inspector general of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, targeted operations against Fitna-al-Khawarij have been intensified in response to the attacks on the police,” the CTD said.
It added that this morning, DI Khan’s CTD successfully carried out an operation on a confirmed intelligence report.
“CTD teams reached the spot and surrounded the terrorists, who opened fire to avoid arrest. CTD teams also retaliated in self-defence, as a result of which the khawariji terrorists were killed,” said the statement.
During the search operation, it said, the bodies of three terrorists were recovered and identified. According to the CTD, the slain terrorists were directly involved in attacks on police and security forces.
The statement added that three Kalashnikovs, nine magazines, two hand grenades and several cartridges were also recovered from the slain terrorists.
“In view of the presence of more terrorists and facilitators in the area, the scope of the investigation, including search operations, has also been expanded,” it said.
According to the press release, KP’s Inspector General (IG) of Police Zulfiqar Hameed and the CTD additional IG paid tribute to the personnel of the CTD special weapons and tactics teams for the successful operation, and said that the series of targeted operations would be further intensified to make an example of Fitna al-Khawarij.
“He added that the response to attacks on police and security forces will be very severe and the struggle will continue until the last khawarij is destroyed,” the statement said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi commended the CTD for “sending three Indian-sponsored terrorists to hell” in DI Khan, a statement from his ministry said.
Hailing their courage and professional abilities, the statement said the CTD had thwarted the “nefarious intentions” of the terrorists.
“The entire nation proudly stands with the brave forces in completely eradicating the menace of Fitna al-Hindustan,” Naqvi was quoted as saying.
The state has designated some terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.







Surge in terrorism
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
At least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts on Monday, officials said.
On Saturday, the military’s media wing said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP.
Also on Saturday, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu.
The day before, a policeman was martyred after gunmen attacked him in the Bajaur tribal district, while another died in Khyber when gunmen ambushed a car.
Three cops were injured in Bannu last week as a police vehicle transporting prisoners to Hangu came under attack by “terrorists”. Also in Bannu, a former tehsil nazim was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on January 6.</p><small>2026-01-14 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06152551e50c385.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957913/from-reading-rooms-to-commercial-centres-the-lost-libraries-of-lyari' target='_blank'><strong>From reading rooms to commercial centres: The lost libraries of Lyari</strong></a><br><p>My journey into higher education began in my coastal hometown of Pasni, passed through the sprawl of Karachi, and eventually settled in Lyari — a neighbourhood with its own rhythms and ruptures.
Life here is compressed into narrow lanes, where only a sliver of sky is visible between tangled wires, flags, and ageing buildings. Power outages are routine, and space is scarce. In such a place, a library is not a luxury; it is a necessity.
For many residents, the only familiar name is the Mulla Fazil Hall Library. Established in the 1980s, it was known as the Lyari Textbook Library in its early days and became a homestay for students across the town, including myself.
My days were spent there, not just studying, but also listening. With pricked ears, I would eavesdrop on conversations at neighbouring tables with determined attention that drifted from philosophy and poetry to art and music. These conversations were as much shaped by curiosity as they were by survival.


The entrance to the Mulla Fazil Library before it was demolished.

Today, the main library building is undergoing construction and the facility has temporarily been relocated. Reaching it now requires a Qingqi ride along fractured roads, a jolting passage that ends on the main road, followed by a short walk. The bumpy ride often culminates in a locked door as the temporary facility remains closed on most days.
When it is open, access comes at a cost: mosquito-infested rooms where dengue and malaria are constant threats, dilapidated and broken toilets, and the air thick with dust.
This is a paradox at the heart of Lyari — a neighbourhood long known for its intellectual traditions and political consciousness, yet one that today has almost no functioning public library. The hunger for learning persists, but the spaces meant to sustain it have quietly disappeared.
The heart of Lyari
Until a few years back, the Mulla Fazil Hall Library stood tall in the heart of Lyari, at the Aath Chowk, where eight roads finally unite. Every day, this neighbourhood throbs to that heartbeat: dust rising from chipped streets, the foul odour of overflowing drains, bare electrical wires tangled with red and green striped flags, and walls stained with chalk markings of political slogans.
Young boys dart through untidy lanes wearing worn-out football t-shirts featuring Messi, Neymar, Ronaldo and the likes, manholes lie open, puddles glisten with sewage, and yet people move through it all effortlessly, too well-versed in an art that only Lyari teaches. But amid the chaos, a short pause shows what is often missed: Lyari as it truly is — alive, familiar, and stubborn.
In today‘s Lyari, the Mulla Fazil Library has been replaced by a ‘mini civic centre’. In late 2022, the Sindh government, in a notification, announced the demolition of the library.



Initially, no one took the notification seriously. “I remember reacting with a laughing emoji when I first saw it,” said Imran Fakhir Baloch, a lecturer at the Abdullah Haroon College. In Lyari, he told Dawn, such notices arrived often full of promise but were rarely followed into reality.
“But we were wrong this time,” said Imran.
On January 2, 2023, the Sindh government awarded the contract for the civic centre’s construction. The plan featured a basement, five floors, and a sixth to be added later, all to be completed within one year. Yet, no one clarified where the books, the readers, or the library would fit into the design.
A rare offering
Imran, who also presides over the Lyari Literary Forum — a Baloch-based literary group that has held study circles in the locality since 2017 — recalled that the Mulla Fazil Library was his group’s home. At gatherings there, discussions and debates went on for hours, seamlessly flowing from literature to art, sociology, philosophy and more.
The library, neither too well-equipped nor too visually attractive, was a classic example of years of neglect; its iron shelves rusted, the wood chipped, and books covered in dust.
Yet, the building offered something rare in Lyari — space and light. In a town where the noise never dies and light scrambles to get past the closely-knit multi-storey buildings, the library, with its wide windows and thick walls, was all people needed to sit and read.


A snapshot of literary circles organised at the Mulla Fazil Library.

“The beauty of the LLF circles at the library was that they brought together everyone from Lyari in one place, from young students, literary enthusiasts, to the elders. People of all ages sat side by side, listening, debating, learning,” Imran reminisced.
But even before the literary forum came to be, the building had long been a quiet gathering spot for Baloch students. “They would bring their own books, meet after classes, and choose a topic to discuss. That’s how it always was here — people gathering at the day’s end,” said Zahid Barakzai, a central member of the LLF and a regular at the Mulla Fazil Library.
Thus, when the news of the library‘s demolition spread, a shiver of concern ran through Lyari’s avid readers, manifesting in the form of a protest. They had one clear demand: the books must be saved, and the library relocated. Subsequent discussions and meetings took place, but no one stepped up to offer space.
Eventually, Nasir Karim, the then and current chairman of Lyari Town, volunteered to “give space”, all the while emphasising that he was not officially responsible for it. The “space” was a football house owned by him, located a few minutes from the original site of the library.
Demolition day
And then, on a hot summer afternoon, the day of demolition arrived. Amaan Qazi, a longtime resident of Lyari, has the image of that day etched in his mind. “On one side stood the people of Lyari, those who had spent years at the Mulla Fazil Library and on the other, the local stakeholders: councillors, UC office staff, and others.”
“We were waiting, hoping the bulldozers would arrive a little later, just so we could glance at the building one more time,” he recounted to Dawn. But the weak thread of hope that the residents held on to angered the authorities, eventually resulting in an altercation.


A view of the torn down Mulla Fazil Library.

“There was a fight among the stakeholders over who would take more sariya (iron rods) from the remains of the library,“ said journalist Shabir Arman, who covered the day’s events. “But none of them spoke about the books,” he recalled, adding that during the chaos, several bookshelves disappeared. “Maybe they took those too, to sell.”
At a short distance from the site stood Suzuki pickup trucks. They weren’t there for the books, clarified Qazi, but for the officials who loaded the salvaged iron from the library to sell later.
The Mulla Fazil Library housed a total of 10,000 books, of which only 7,000 reached their new home. “During the shifting, so many books and shelves were lost,” recalled Akbar Faiz, who was then in charge of libraries in Lyari.


Books at the football house.

At the football house, the books stayed untouched and unsorted for nearly six months. Rehman Baloch, a member of the Baloch Students Action Committee and another regular at the library, visited the Lyari town office countless times.
“Each time, we were told that the football house was being renovated for the library,” he told Dawn.
But when the time for sorting finally arrived, not much had changed, contrary to what Rehman and his friends had been told for days and months.
The ground floor of the football house, where the library was relocated, was dusty and crumbly. Only the first floor, where the football house’s main gatherings were held, had been freshly painted.
A sad state of repairs
The first time I visited the ‘new’ library — a pale shadow of what it used to be — was a few months back. It is slumped across the main road in Chakiwara, a restless stretch where a bulk of the traffic from Lee Market rushes toward Shershah, and onward to Hub Chowki.
A few steps from the library’s gate, a crowd converges every few hours to catch the Rind Coach, which ferries people between Lyari and Hub Chowki. The sound of engines, horns and chatter never really stops.


The entrance of the temporary site of the library.

Inside, the library feels small and dim. As I stepped inside, a thin blanket of dust rose, filling my nostrils. Three men greeted me at the entrance: a peon, a member of the football house, and a familiar face from the neighbourhood — all of them conversing at a volume otherwise reprimanded inside libraries.
I cleaned my chair before sitting; a spare handkerchief came in handy in wiping off the dust that covered the seat. The table greeted me with yet another layer to clear. A glance around showed scattered books, some out of shelves, some lying in corners — a telltale sign of the shelves lost during the relocation.
Finally, when I settled down to read and write, my feet itched incessantly. For the first few minutes, I tried to resist the temptation to scratch until I finally gave in. Mosquito bites. Yet, I was adamant. But every few minutes, the noise from the football house upstairs grew louder, making it impossible to concentrate.
When I returned in late September, I found a student bent over his notes, preparing for a medical entry test, a coil of machar jalebi burning beside him, its smoke curling against the walls.
“We wrote to the town chairman about the mosquito issue,” said Akmal Khan, a resident of Chakiwara. “But nothing happened. Most students stopped coming. But I can’t afford to go to Liaquat Library (located in another part of the city) every day, so I bring this coil and sit here anyway.”
Before the demolition, a local donor had gifted a UPS to the LLF for the Mulla Fazil Library — a small relief against the frequent power outages. After the library was shifted to its temporary space at the football house, LLF central member Barakzai said they brought the UPS along. “But it got stolen.”


Dusty tables and chairs at the library relocated to the football house.

Much like the rest of Lyari, here too, electricity is elusive. “The football house bill hasn’t been paid,” he explained. “Whenever a new line is installed, it’s cut again. Even with the line there, not much changed because electricity here only lasts from 3pm to 5pm.”
In October, I made several visits to the library. Most days, the shutters were shut, but one afternoon I found them open. Inside sat Akbar Baloch, a retired library staffer, along with a few members of the football house. The man currently in charge of the library was away for Zuhr prayers. “He comes around noon,” one of them told me, “and leaves after prayers.”
I waited. When he returned, he quietly walked across the dim room, wheeled out his motorcycle parked inside the football house lawn and left. I stayed back with the staff. Akbar Wali told me he had retired recently, but still came by to pass the time. “Students don’t come here anymore,” he said. “Maybe one or two in a month, by chance.”
Riaz Baloch, known locally as Ustad Jogh, joined in, his voice heavy with irony. “Look around, no water to drink, no washroom, no electricity. Who would want to study in the dark?”
“If you ask the councillor to help with the library, he’ll say he has more important things to handle: like putting lids on manholes,” Ustad added.
The great fall
Lyari, being one of Karachi‘s oldest neighbourhoods, has for decades attracted the biggest names of Pakistan’s literary world: for poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, the locality was home, where he often frequented to teach, write and read. Muhammad Baig Baloch is another literary figure from Lyari, who wrote several books in Urdu, English, Sindhi and Persian in addition to translating major literary works into the Balochi language
But politics, neglect, and poverty took a toll on what used to be a literary hub.
Ramzan Baloch, who has authored seven books on Lyari’s history and social fabric, has witnessed this progression and fall since the 1960s. “In 1962, Lyari had 27 municipal units, each of which had elected members and a chairman,” he explained. “An ordinance at the time mandated the creation of reading rooms in every unit — places where people came to read newspapers before work, or in the evening after returning home. There was even a separate budget for them.”
“By the 1970s, the local government system changed, and reading rooms began turning into offices; some even got encroached,” he said. “There used to be a fixed annual budget for textbooks, literature, religious works, art, even Balochi titles.”
But the decline began quietly after the year 2000. “The focus on libraries vanished,” Ramzan lamented. “Magazines stopped coming, then newspapers too. Eventually, there was no bill left.”
In 1992, Lyari had 27 libraries, excluding the reading rooms. The number shrank to 11 in the early 2000s, and new books stopped coming in after 2005.


The collage shows (left to right) Baghdadi-Shabaik Lane- Kalari Library, Nishtar Library, and the Syed Mehmood Shah Library — all of which are in decay.

Ramzan explained that the Mulla Fazil Library had its own set of flaws even in its prime — the sewer outside overflowed, its compound was taken over by a Nadra office, and long queues of people left the area crowded. Yet, despite the myriad of issues, the library never failed to provide one thing: space — for dialogue, for ideas, for silence.
“Whatever I’ve written, the knowledge, the habit of reading — it came from that place,” he said, adding that the library’s demolition also halted gatherings of the LLF. “Those meetings were a relief, especially after years of gang violence.”
The fate of the remaining libraries, all visited by Dawn, reflects Lyari’s slow erasure of public learning spaces:

Baghdadi–Shabaik Lane–Kalari Library (BSK Project) –now a community hall where weddings and Nikkah ceremonies are held
Syed Mahmood Shah Library – now serves as a UC office for registration of births, deaths, and marriages
Nishtar Library – converted into a UC office
Iqbal Shaheed Library, Bihar Colony – deteriorated and damaged
Umer Lane Library – now functions as a community hall and madrassa
Iqra Library, Singolane – turned into a boxing club
Meeran Naka Library – converted into a community hall.
S. Mohamadin Library, Rangiwara – a library in name only; a few books lie on a table under a roof, shedding sand and stones
Satellite Library and Reading Room – a twin of the temporary library now housed at the football house

The collapse wasn’t just social, it was also intellectual.
Professor Hasil Murad Baloch of the Benazir Bhutto University, Lyari, explained: “This decline didn’t come overnight. The gang war period destroyed the social structure that made Lyari what it was, affecting the youth the most.”
For decades, newspaper reading had been a daily ritual in Lyari. Elderly men would walk to libraries and reading rooms, flipping through Urdu and Balochi dailies before heading home. “By 2016, even when the streets were calm again, newspapers stopped arriving,” said Nabi Baksh. “There was a tussle between Lyari Town and UC offices over who would pay for them. In the end, no one did.”
By 2020, even the Mulla Fazil Library stopped receiving newspapers. “There was no payment for months, maybe years.”
Ismail Baloch, the newly appointed Human Resource Director of Lyari Town, admitted that the Town Municipal Commissioner (TMC) is responsible for facilitating the libraries. “There’s always a fund,” he said. “But it’s not always allocated … maybe.”
Development or plundering?
Back at the Aath Chowk, construction of the mini civic centre continues unabated. Town officials insist it will revive the library in a “modern form”.
Nasir Karim, the Lyari town chairman, told Dawn that the first floor of the centre has been allocated for the library. “It will be a digital library,” he said, “and both boys and girls will have their own sections.”
The ground floor of the complex, he continued, would accommodate Nadra. “There will also be other civic facilities, like offices for K-Electric, the water board, and the passport department, as well as an auditorium for Lyari’s artists, similar to the Karachi Arts Council, and a cafeteria.”


The mini civic centre under construction at Aath Chowk.

Karim‘s assurances, however, do nothing to placate the readers of Lyari, who are convinced that the construction of the new complex would entirely erase the Mulla Fazil Library’s essence.
“Where will a library fit between offices and government departments?” questioned Ramzan Baloch. “A library needs silence, space, an aura of its own.”
“This isn’t development. It’s just plundering.”

“The warming spike observed from 2023-2025 has been extreme, and suggests an acceleration in the rate of the Earth’s warming,” Berkeley Earth said in a separate report.
The landmark 2015 Paris Agreement commits the world to limiting warming to well below 2C and pursuing efforts to hold it at 1.5C – a long-term target scientists say would help avoid the worst consequences of climate change.
UN chief Antonio Guterres warned in October that breaching 1.5C was “inevitable” but the world could limit this period of overshoot by cutting greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible.
Copernicus said the 1.5C limit “could be reached by the end of this decade – over a decade earlier than predicted”.
But efforts to contain global warming were dealt another setback last week as President Donald Trump said he would pull the United States – the world’s second-biggest polluter after China – out of the bedrock UN climate treaty.
Temperatures were 1.47C above pre-industrial times in 2025 – just a fraction cooler than in 2023 – following 1.6C in 2024, according to the EU climate monitor.
Some 770 million people experienced record-warm annual conditions where they live, while no record-cold annual average was logged anywhere, according to Berkeley Earth.
The Antarctic experienced its warmest year on record while it was the second hottest in the Arctic, Copernicus said.
An AFP analysis of Copernicus data last month found that Central Asia, the Sahel region and northern Europe experienced their hottest year on record in 2025.
2026: Fourth-warmest?
Berkeley and Copernicus both warned that 2026 would not break the trend.
If the warming El Nino weather phenomenon appears this year, “this could make 2026 another record-breaking year”, Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, told AFP.
“Temperatures are going up. So we are bound to see new records. Whether it will be 2026, 2027, 2028 doesn’t matter too much. The direction of travel is very, very clear,” Buontempo said.
Berkeley Earth said it expected this year to be similar to 2025, “with the most likely outcome being approximately the fourth-warmest year since 1850”.
Emissions fight
The reports come as efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions – the main driver of climate change – are stalling in developed countries.
Emissions rose in the United States last year, snapping a two-year streak of declines, as bitter winters and the AI boom fuelled demand for energy, the Rhodium Group think tank said Tuesday.
The pace of reductions of greenhouse gas emissions slowed in Germany and France.
“While greenhouse gas emissions remain the dominant driver of global warming, the magnitude of this recent spike suggests additional factors have amplified recent warming beyond what we would expect from greenhouse gases and natural variability alone,” said Berkeley Earth chief scientist Robert Rohde.
The organisation said international rules cutting sulfur in ship fuel since 2020 may have actually added to warming by reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, which form aerosols that reflect sunlight away from Earth.</p><small>2026-01-14 05:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/14100340dd19b37.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966912/fatima-sana-to-lead-pakistan-odi-t20i-squads-for-south-africa-tour' target='_blank'><strong>Fatima Sana to lead Pakistan ODI, T20I squads for South Africa tour</strong></a><br><p>Fatima Sana will continue to lead Pakistan in both T20I and ODI formats as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday unveiled the women’s squads for their upcoming tour of South Africa.

According to CNN, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, purchased the device for millions of dollars in the waning days of the Biden administration, using funding provided by the Defence Department, according to two of the sources. Officials paid “eight figures” for the device, these people said, declining to offer a more specific number.
The device is still being studied and there is ongoing debate — and in some quarters of government, scepticism — over its link to the roughly dozens of anomalous health incidents that remain officially unexplained.
CNN has asked the Pentagon, HSI and the DHS for comment. The CIA declined to comment.
The device acquired by HSI produces pulsed radio waves, one of the sources said, which some officials and academics have speculated for years could be the cause of the incidents. Although the device is not entirely Russian in origin, it contains Russian components, this person added.
Officials have long struggled to understand how a device powerful enough to cause the kind of damage some victims have reported could be made portable; that remains a core question, according to one of the sources briefed on the device. The device could fit in a backpack, this person said.
The acquisition of the device has reignited a painful and contentious debate within the US government about Havana Syndrome, known officially as “anomalous health episodes”.
The mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of US diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including vertigo and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world.
In the subsequent decade the intelligence community and the Defense Department have sought to understand if those officials were the victims of some kind of directed energy attack by a foreign government — with senior intelligence officials saying publicly that there wasn’t enough evidence to support that conclusion and victims arguing that the US government has gaslit them and ignored important evidence that Russia was attacking American government officials.
Still, defence officials considered their findings serious enough that they briefed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees late last year, including reference to the acquired device and its testing.
One key concern now for some officials is that if the technology proves viable it may have proliferated, several of the sources said, meaning that more than one country could now have access to a device that may be capable of causing career-ending injuries to US officials.
CNN was not able to learn where — or from whom — HSI purchased the device, but HSI has a history of collaboration with the Defence Department for operations that take place all over the globe. The office has broad jurisdiction to investigate crimes linked to customs violations, including investigations into the proliferation of US-controlled technology or expertise overseas.
Those investigations are “the single biggest collaboration point between HSI and the US military,” according to a former Homeland Security official.

The issue was raised in the House by PPP lawmakers Syed Naveed Qamar, Dr Sharmila Faruqui and others through a calling attention notice expressing alarm over diversion of resources from nationally strategic projects.
Slamming the Centre for breaching fiscal protocols and undermining provincial autonomy, questioning why a provincial motorway project was being “federalised”, Syed Naveed Qamar criticised the diversion of funds from key federal projects to the Motorway project.
“Such projects are dealt best at the provincial level,” he said. Chaudhry Armaghan Subhani, Minister of State for Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives, in response said that no funds had been diverted from PSDP to the Lahore-Bahawalnagar Motorway project.
Mr Qamar, however, said it was best course that the government does not divert funds from any source. “And if at all you need to build infrastructure projects, they should come under public-private partnership mode as Sindh is doing. Why it can’t be done in Punjab,” he asked.

 

Another PPP leader Sharmila Faruqui accused the government of violating fiscal agreements by including the provincial project in the PSDP without provincial consent.
She expressed concern over the National Highway Authority’s Rs2.5 trillion “throw-forward,” calling the project’s federal funding a significant issue. “You cannot include a project in the PSDP unless the province agrees to 50 per cent funding,” she said.
State Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Chaudhry Armaghan Subhani also said that the government was giving top priority to the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway project and it will be incorporated into the next Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
He said the project comprising five sections will be completed on a fast-track basis and noted that building motorways was the hallmark of the PML-N.
The National Assembly speaker referred the matter to the Planning and Development Panel for further review.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry informed the House that illegal call centres operating across the country were being targeted, pointing out that many had been set up in remote areas where there was no legitimate basis for such facilities to exist.
These centres, he claimed, were often linked to financial fraud and scams involving multiple nationalities and were contributing to the country’s negative image abroad.
Responding to another point of order raised by members of the House, Mr Chaudhry said the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) is facing capacity challenges, which had replaced the FIA’s cybercrime wing.
He said at present, only around 523 personnel were available in the country in the authority, whereas complaints of financial fraud, online harassment and other cyber offences were increasing rapidly.
He said the government was according full attention to strengthening the NCCI with experienced officers being posted and new recruitments initiated.
Former speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qaisar raised the issue of his bill seeking the right of appeal against verdicts of military courts and was assured by the chair the bill will be placed on agenda on the next private members’ day.

Spot gold steadied at $4,591.49 per  ounce as of 01:31pm ET (1831 GMT), following a record high of  $4,634.33 earlier in the session. US gold futures for February settled  0.3 per cent lower at $4,599.10.
“The reason for the slightly  positive tone across the board in the markets was the benign US CPI data,”  said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. The  core CPI rose 0.2pc month-on-month and 2.6pc  year-on-year in December, falling short of analysts’ expectations of  0.3pc and 2.7pc, respectively.
The  Fed is expected to keep rates steady at its January 27-28 meeting,  though investors currently anticipate two interest rate cuts this year.  Lower interest rates tend to be favourable for non-yielding bullion.
Elsewhere, spot silver gained 2.1pc to $86.74 per ounce, after hitting an all-time high of $89.10 earlier in the session. Spot platinum was unchanged at $2,343.35 per ounce and palladium rose 1.4pc to $1,868.68 per ounce.

He highlighted the vast potential for Pakistan–Saudi cooperation in the minerals sector and assured that Saudi Arabia’s knowledge resources and technical expertise would be available to support Pakistan’s mineral sector.
Mauritius envoy
Separately, Mauritius High Commissioner Munsoo Kurrimbaccus underscored the need for collective efforts to restore the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) that previously existed between Pakistan and Mauritius, under which approximately 120 commodities enjoyed preferential market access.
He noted that the agreement became inactive due to various reasons and stressed that its revival could significantly boost bilateral trade.

WASHINGTON/DUBAI/DOHA: Iranian authorities will press charges punishable by death against some individuals arrested during recent demonstrations, prosecutors said on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump urged Iranians to keep protesting, saying help was on the way.
“Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING — TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!… HELP IS ON ITS WAY,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding he had cancelled all meetings with Iranian officials until the “senseless killing” of protesters stopped.







But when asked to expand on his message to protesting Iranians, he said: “You’re going to have to figure that one out. I’m sorry.”
Following the US president’s post, Iranian security chief Ali Larijani said on social media platform X that Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were the “main killers” of the Iranian people.







The message came hours after Trump slapped 25pc import tariffs on products from any country doing business with Iran — a major oil exporter.
The move triggered movement in global markets, with oil prices surging by about 3pc on Tuesday as the prospect of disruptions to Iranian crude exports overshadowed possible increased supply from Venezuela.
While foreign monitors continued to speculate on the number of casualties from the crackdown on recent anti-government protests, Reuters quoted an Iranian official as saying that around 2,000 people had been killed.
The official blamed “terrorists” for the deaths of both protesters and security personnel, but did not give a breakdown.
Iran’s authorities have tried to take a dual approach to the demonstrations, calling protests over economic problems legitimate while enforcing a harsh security crackdown.
The office of the Tehran prosecutor said in a statement quoted by state television that an unspecified number would be charged with “waging war against God”.
“The government sees security forces and protesters as its children. To the best of our abilities, we have tried and will try to listen to their voices even if some have tried to hijack such protests,” government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Tuesday.
Communications restrictions including an internet blackout over recent days have hampered the flow of information. The UN rights office said on Tuesday that phone services had been restored but internet links with Iran remained patchy.
Addressing the blackout, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera: “The government was in dialogue with the protesters. The internet was cut only after we confronted terrorist operations and realised orders were coming from outside the country.”
Videos of nighttime clashes between demonstrators and security forces over the past week, including several that were verified by Reuters, have shown violent confrontations with gunfire and burning cars and buildings.
World wary
World leaders and capitals also weighed in on the tensions simmering in the Islamic Republic, as well as the confusion surrounding the protests and the possible fallout from Trump’s tariff imposition.
Qatar said Tuesday that a military escalation between the United States and Iran would have grave consequences for the region, while China vowed to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests, in the context of President Trump’s punitive tariff announcement.
“We have always believed that there are no winners in a tariff war, and China will resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news conference when asked about Trump’s levy announcement.
Russia also condemned what it described as “subversive external interference” in Iran’s internal politics, saying any repeat of last year’s US strikes would have “disastrous consequences” for the Middle East and international security.
In a call with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani, Qatari PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani expressed Doha’s support on Tuesday for “all efforts aiming to de-escalate and peaceful solutions”.
The Qatari foreign ministry said the two men had discussed the latest regional developments, without directly mentioning ongoing protests that have convulsed Iran.
In addition, the UAE Minister of Foreign Trade Thani Al Zeyoudi said on Tuesday it is unclear how President Trump’s announcement of tariffs on countries trading with Iran will be implemented and whether it will impact food imports.
Sanctions
Saying that he was horrified by the mounting violence against protesters, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk urged Tehran to halt all forms of violence and repression against peaceful protesters, and to restore full access to the internet and phone services.
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen also Brussels would “swiftly” propose new sanctions on Iran.
“The rising number of casualties in Iran is horrifying.
“I unequivocally condemn the excessive use of force and continued restriction of freedom,” she posted online.







Underscoring international uncertainty over what comes next in Iran, which has been one of the dominant powers across the Middle East for decades, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he believed the government would fall.
But Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi dismissed Merz’s criticisms, accusing Berlin of double standards and saying he had “obliterated any shred of credibility”.
‘Royal family’
White House envoy Steve Witkoff over the weekend met with Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, to discuss the protests roiling that country, Axios reported on Tuesday, citing an unidentified senior US official.
Meanwhile, the widow of the deposed shah of Iran has also called on Iranian security forces to support protests.
Farah Pahlavi, 87, echoing calls made by her son the former crown prince Reza Pahlavi, said she believed “light will triumph over darkness” despite a crackdown by authorities that activists fear has left hundreds dead.
She left Iran on January 16, 1979 alongside her husband Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, just two weeks before the return to the country of Islamic revolution leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Her husband died in 1980.
Farah Pahlavi had on January 2 welcomed the protests as “filling my heart with pride”, but this is her first statement since they grew into large-scale demonstrations last week calling for an end to the Islamic republic.
Farah Pahlavi was the third wife of the shah, who she met while a student in Paris.

Protesters alleged that thousands of fruit and non-fruit trees had dried up and crops over thousands of acres of agricultural land were damaged due to water shortages. A large number of local residents staged an indefinite sit-in at Nasirabad, blocking the KKH.
They said Nasirabad valley has been facing a shortage of water, particularly during the summer season, for a long time. The local population depends on agriculture and fruit trees as their main source of income. Last year, acute water shortages severely affected crops and fruit orchards.
According to the protesters, a water supply scheme from Minapin to Nasirabad in Hunza was approved 15 years ago to address the issue. However, they alleged that despite the passage of 15 years, the pipeline-based water supply scheme has not been completed.
Baba Jan, a leader of the Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Workers Party and a resident of the area, said the livelihoods of local people have suffered for many years. “Fruit trees, including blackberry, cherry, apricot and other unique varieties in the valley, have dried up. Crops, which are the backbone of the local economy, were badly damaged last year due to the unavailability of irrigation water,” he said.
He added that the water supply scheme, initiated 15 years ago, had completed about 90 per cent of its work, but was later revised. The revised project requires approval from a Gilgit-Baltistan CWP meeting; however, for the past three years, it has not been included in the meeting’s agenda.

 

Another protester, Wajid Baig, said local residents were also facing difficulties in accessing water for drinking and daily use. Protesters pointed out that while the GB government claims to promote plantation and the billion tree project, agricultural land and thousands of trees grown by local people are suffering due to water shortages.
They said they had repeatedly met officials and requested intervention, but no action was taken. The protesters staged the sit-in on the KKH despite temperatu­res dropping to minus eight degrees Celsius. Traffic remai­ned suspen­ded for several hours; however, in the evening, the road was ope­ned for an hour to allow stranded tou­rists and emergency vehicles to pass.
The protesters warned that if practical work on the project does not start this year, half of the village could be completely destro­y­­ed agriculturally, further worsening the local economy and living conditions. They appealed to the caretaker chief minister to take immediate notice of the situation and direct the relevant departme­nts to start work on the water supply project on an emergency basis.
They said the sit-in would conti­nue until a notification is issued to begin work on the water project.

“The federal government has allowed potato and kinno exports following the chief minister’s special efforts,” the provincial government said in a statement.
The move follows calls from Punjab’s potato growers for urgent government support, including subsidised exports, after a production surplus coincided with weak domestic demand and shrinking export prospects.
Farmers had blamed months-long disruption in trade through the Afghanistan border for a sharp decline in potato prices, saying rates had fallen below production costs in parts of Sahiwal, Okara, Pakpattan, Kasur and adjoining districts. Some growers, they said, had ploughed standing crops back into the soil to avoid further losses.
In a statement, CM Maryam Nawaz said the hard work of potato and kinno farmers would not be allowed to go to waste.

Move comes after CM Maryam intervenes on growers’ complaints

“I remain in contact with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to help farmers overcome their difficulties,” she said, adding that the Punjab government had approached the Centre for the formation of a high-level committee to facilitate exports of kinno and potatoes.
She said the committee, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, would include representatives of relevant ministries and key stakeholders to address the issue in a coordinated manner.
The chief minister said the province had also urged the Centre to explore new international markets and reduce export-related costs to ease difficulties faced by exporters and farmers.
“Practical measures are being taken on a daily basis to resolve issues related to kinno and potato exports and to maximise foreign exchange earnings,” she said.
She said Punjab produced about 95 per cent of the country’s potatoes and kinno.
She added that potato output in the province was expected to reach about 12 million tonnes this year, while kinno production was projected at four million tonnes.

At a time when there is no indication that the border with Afghanistan will reopen soon, importers engaged in Afghan Transit Trade (ATT) have requested that the Ministry of Commerce grant a one-time waiver for the re-export of over 6,500 containers stuck at Karachi ports, as they are incurring rising demurrage charges.
The need for re-export arose after the border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan was closed on Oct 11, 2025 leading to a near-complete halt of bilateral trade and movement of transit cargo.
Pakistan-Afghanistan relations have deteriorated amid tensions over the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). After successive rounds, Pakistan declared the talks effectively over on Nov 7, after which Afghanistan suspended trade ties. Pakistan had already closed its border following the October clashes.

Over 6,500 containers stuck at Karachi ports since closure of Pak-Afghan border in October

“Yes, we have issued letters to individual importers who are approaching the ministry to re-export their cargo,” an official at the Ministry of Commerce told Dawn on Tuesday. The official added that the commerce minister had the power to grant a one-time exemption.
Interestingly, the commerce ministry has not officially announced the decision but has begun issuing letters to intended importers who approached the ministry for re-export permission.
The largest number of stranded containers — approximately 3,000 — originates from Malaysia and contains palm oil intended for edible use in Afghanistan. “We have already issued letters to most palm oil importers to re-export their containers,” the official said. But he declined to specify the exact number of palm oil containers approved for re-export.
Re-export is subject to approval from the Ministry of Commerce on a case-by-case basis.
A customs official told Dawn that the number of containers stranded at the Chaman and Torkham borders was not big, ranging between 600 and 700.
Instead, the bulk of transit cargo was stuck at the two ports in Karachi.
Envoys’ plea to Islamabad
The cargos, sourced mostly from China and Vietnam, are currently stranded at Karachi, the official said. He added that the ambassadors of these countries had approached the government to seek approval for re-export.
Following these consultations, the government has decided to allow all importers to re-export their cargo from Karachi.
This move offers Afghan importers an opportunity to use alternative ports or routes to transport their goods to the Afghan market.
This decision, according to the official, will allow importers to use other ports for the transportation of their goods to Afghanistan.
On Dec 3, Islamabad allowed clearing of consignments imported on humanitarian grounds. In the first phase, 143 containers carrying such goods were given permission for transit at Chaman and Torkham.
A breakdown shows that 67 of the containers carried assistance from the World Food Programme, 74 were loaded with supplies for children donated by Unicef, and two containers had healthcare and family support items from another UN agency.
According to the customs official, since the Taliban government has barred the entry of these containers, none had crossed the border for the past three months.
The volume of Afghan imports transiting through Pakistan has declined sharply over the past two years falling to $2.4 billion in FY24 from $6.7bn in FY23, and dropping further to $1.01bn in FY25.
With the current suspension of trade, industry estimates suggest the figure could slip below the $1bn mark during the current fiscal, deepening the shift in Afghanistan’s import routes and suppliers.

Malik made executive committee chairman
ISLAMABAD: On the second day of its meeting, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) recommended the confirmation of 10 additional judges of the Sindh High Court (SHC) out of a total list of 12, by a majority of its total membership.
Presided over by Chief Justice of Pakis­tan Yahya Afridi, the JCP, after due consideration of the relevant data forms, ant­ecedents and evaluation material placed before it, confirmed Justice Miran Muha­mmad Shah, Justice Ms Tasneem Sultana, Justice Riazat Ali Sahar, Justice Muham­mad Hassan (Akber), Justice Abdul Ham­id Bhurgi, Justice Jan Ali Junejo, Justice Nisar Ahmed Bhanbhro, Justice Ali Haider ‘Ada’, Justice Muhammad Osman Ali Hadi and Justice Muhammad Jaffer Raza as permanent judges of the SHC.
Meanwhile, the JCP also recommended the extension of two additional judges for another six months, namely Justice Khalid Hussain Shahani and Justice Syed Fiazul Hassan Shah.
The meeting was held at the conference room of the Supreme Court to make recommendations for the confirmation of additional judges as judges of the SHC, as well as for the reconstitution and extension of constitutional benches.
Similarly, the commission, by a majority vote, also nominated four judges to the constitutional bench of the SHC, besides extending the tenure of the constitutional benches by six months. The nominated judges are Justice Amjad Ali Bohio, Justice Muhammad Hassan (Akber), Justice Ali Haider ‘Ada’ and Justice Muhammad Osman Ali Hadi.
On Wednesday, the JCP will consider the confirmation of 10 additional judges of the Peshawar High Court.
Meanwhile, in a separate development, the 248th meeting of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) elected Pir Muham­mad Masood Chishti as the new vice chairman of the PBC for the year 2026 by a majority vote.
Presided over by Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, who is also the chairman of the PBC, the meeting was held at the council’s office in the Supreme Court building and transacted a number of items on the agenda.

 

While acting as the Returning Officer for the election, the AGP invited proposals for the post of vice chairman. In response, Farooq Hamid Naek proposed the name of Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti from Lahore, which was seconded by Syed Qalb-i-Hassan. On the other hand, Muhammad Maqsood Buttar proposed the name of Qazi Muhammad Arshad from Abbottabad as the other candidate.
Both Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti and Qazi Muhammad Arshad consented to the proposals of their respective candidature. As there was a contest, the election was held through a secret ballot. After the completion of the polling process, the ballot papers were taken out of the ballot box, counted and found to be 23 in number.
As per the count of the ballot papers, Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti secured 15 votes, while Qazi Muhammad Arshad obtained eight votes. Resultantly, the Returning Officer declared Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti as the elected vice chairman of the Pakistan Bar Council for the year 2026.
The council also elected Muneer A. Ma­­l­­ik from Karachi as the chairman of the PBC executive committee for the year 2026.
Meanwhile, the PBC strongly condem­n­­ed the campaign of character assassinati­­on against judges of the Lahore High Cou­rt and the Islamabad High Court on baseless allegations, terming it an attack on the prestige and dignity of the judiciary.
The council reiterated that the legal fraternity would never allow anyone to succeed in nefarious designs aimed at targeting judges.

Based on existing tax rates, informed sources said the ex-depot prices of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) are expected to drop by about Rs4.50 per litre and Rs2.75 per litre, respectively (over 1pc), depending on final calculations.
The ex-depot prices of kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) are also estimated to reduce by Rs1.8 (1pc) and Rs2 per litre (1.4pc), respectively. The kerosene rate and LDO rates currently stand at Rs177.88 and Rs146.18 per litre, respectively.
The ex-depot petrol price set by the government currently stands at Rs253.17 per litre, but is sold at more than Rs254.40 per litre at retail stations. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and has a direct bearing on the budgets of middle- and lower-middle-class households.
The ex-depot price of high-speed diesel (HSD) stands at Rs257.08 per litre, which may drop to around Rs254 per litre on Jan 15. The retailers are selling the product at a higher price of Rs258 per litre.
Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary, as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains, and agricultural engines such as trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells, and threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Transporters had already increased their fares on the basis of about Rs27 per litre increase between May and August, and have not reversed despite the Rs17 and Rs20 per litre cut since October 1. The government is currently charging about Rs100 per litre on petrol and about Rs97 per litre on diesel.

“Both enactments stand on firm constitutional footing, not in conflict but in constitutional harmony, each valid in its own aspect,” observed Justice Aamer Farooq, who headed a two-judge FCC bench that dismissed a challenge filed by Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd against amendments introduced by the Balochistan government to a federal excise law.
In its 15-page verdict, the court explained that while the imposition of excise duty squarely falls within federal legislative competence, the advancement of labour welfare, when viewed from the perspective of public interest, lies well within the provincial domain.
The controversy at hand revolved around a petition instituted by Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd, an entity engaged in the production and sale of cement, with its manufacturing facility located at Hub, Lasbela, Balochistan. The petition challenged a Nov 27, 2023 order of the Balochistan High Court.

Attock Cement’s challenge to BHC verdict dismissed

The petition was initially filed before the Supreme Court but was later transferred to the newly established FCC following the enactment of the 27th Amendment.
On Jan 15, 2021, the factory was served with a notice by the Mines Labour Welfare Department, Balochistan, requiring payment of excise duty on minerals to the Labour Welfare Commissioner, Balochistan, at rates revised pursuant to the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020.
In response, the factory submitted three separate representations to the department, seeking revision of the applicable rates. However, all three representations were declined.
During the hearing before the FCC, counsel for the factory, Khurram M. Hashmi and Noman A. Farooqi, argued that the provincial assembly, by amending Section 3 of the Excise Duty on Minerals (Labour Welfare) Act, 1967 through Section 7 of the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020, had acted without legislative competence. They contended that the imposition of excise duty fell within the exclusive federal legislative domain and that the Balochistan Assembly therefore lacked the authority to amend the 1967 Act, particularly where such amendment effectively altered the rate or nature of excise duty.
However, in the judgement, Justice Farooq observed that the objective of the Labour Welfare Act, 1967 was unmistakably oriented towards the advancement of labour welfare, a domain constitutionally entrusted to the provinces.
The mechanism through which this objective is pursued — the imposition of a duty of excise — is not an end in itself but a means carefully designed to finance a broader public interest. The statute, the judgment noted, does not merely levy a tax; rather, it establishes an administrative framework for the collection, allocation and utilisation of the proceeds, all of which are inextricably linked to the welfare of labour employed in the industry.
Thus, while the recovery of excise duty constitutes the operative mechanism of the Act, its spirit, essential character and constitutional essence lie in the realisation of labour welfare. The excise duty, the court held, is instrumental in achieving this predominant provincial objective, rendering the Act, in its true nature, an expression of social welfare legislation rather than mere taxation.
Even if, by a strict reading of the preamble and operative provisions of the 1967 Act, its dominant character were to be construed as the collection and imposition of excise duty, its underlying purpose could not be ignored. Such a conclusion, the court said, merely reveals an overlap between two constitutional competences: the federal authority to levy excise duty and the provincial responsibility to advance labour welfare.
This incidental overlap, the judgment added, does not justify invalidating the statute. Justice Farooq emphasised that the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) of 2010 consciously embraced the ethos of cooperative federalism, wherein legislative fields are not rigid silos but, at times, interacting spheres.
In this constitutional landscape, incidental overlap does not render a statute ultra vires. The court further observed that following the 18th Amendment, the Concur­rent Legislative List was abolished, significantly expanding provincial legislative authority, with matters not explicitly listed in the Federal Legislative List falling within the exclusive domain of the provinces.
The FCC also acknowledged the traditional use of the “pith and substance” doctrine in determining legislative competence, noting that courts have increasingly relied on the “double aspect” doctrine, which permits a single subject to be legislated upon by both federal and provincial governments from different perspectives. 
In the end, the FCC denied leave to appeal and dismissed the petition filed by the cement manufacturer.
