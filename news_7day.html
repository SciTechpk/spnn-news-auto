Both countries have witnessed an improvement in bilateral relations after taking steps to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and upgrading diplomatic ranks. Dar visited Kabul earlier this month, where an agreement was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek­istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional connectivity.
According to a Foreign Office (FO) statement issued on Saturday, Dar engaged with the Pakistani-American community at the Pakistan Consulate in New York, where he “shared Pakistan’s expectation that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism, noting recent assurances received from Afghan authorities in that regard”.
The foreign minister also highlighted the “country’s outreach to Afghanistan with a view to enhancing regional connectivity through rail and trade corridors to Central Asia”.
 






Dar’s statement follows Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s visit to Kabul last week, when he discussed counterterrorism efforts and mechanisms for regulating cross-border movement with his Afghan counterpart, Sirajuddin Haqqani.
Naqvi had expressed concerns over the infiltration by terrorist organisations causing “chaos and instability” and the need to stop them.
Islamabad accuses Afghan-based terror groups of launching cross-border attacks and planning and executing terrorist attacks here, facilitated by the Afghan Taliban administration’s indifference to Pakistan’s concerns. In response, Pakistan has conducted military strikes against terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan and initiated a mass deportation drive targeting Afghan nationals.
In April, Afghanistan’s acting prime minister, Mullah Hasan Akhund, had assured Pakistan that Afghan territory would not be used for hostile activities against any country.
Dar invites diaspora to contribute to Pakistan’s development
During the interaction in New York, Dar stated that Pakistan was experiencing a significant positive boost in its standing on the world stage, saying it had emerged from a period of diplomatic isolation and is witnessing economic revival.
“We have made considerable progress, especially in political and economic fields, in the past three years, despite heavy odds. We are indeed a resilient nation,” he said. Dar underscored that Pakistan was actively engaging on the international stage, including through recent high-level visits and multilateral diplomacy.
He invited the diaspora to actively contribute to Pakistan’s development, particularly in investment, trade, education, and digital innovation. He appreciated the contributions of the Pakistani diaspora to both Pakistan and the United States, acknowledging their vital role in strengthening bilateral relations and enhancing Pakistan’s image globally.
 
 

The foreign minister informed the community gathering on Pakistan’s economic recovery, noting that the country had successfully completed the IMF programme, significantly reduced inflation, and restored investor confidence.
Sharing that global credit rating agencies had recently acknowledged Pakistan’s improved macroeconomic outlook, he reaffirmed the government’s aspiration for Pakistan to join the ranks of G-20 economies.
He outlined key initiatives of the government, particularly the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), designed to streamline investment procedures and unlock opportunities in priority sectors.
Dar assured the community that the government was actively working toward the early resumption of PIA flights to New York, including steps toward restoring routes to Europe and the United Kingdom.
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to engaging the Pakistani-American diaspora as strategic partners in national development as well as in strengthening mutually beneficial Pakistan–US bilateral cooperation.
‘Pakistan to defend sovereignty’
Speaking to the Pakistani community in New York, FM Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to defend its sovereignty and regional stability.
He recalled the country’s firm and resolute response during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos that led to the downing of six Indian aircraft, praising the unity demonstrated by the nation and the diaspora during this critical moment.
He appreciated the solidarity and support extended by Pakistani-Americans during the recent tensions with India and their constructive role in amplifying the voice of the Kashmiri people.
 
 

The government termed its retaliatory operation against India as ‘Bunyan-un- Marsoos’ after Pakistan and India clashed in May. After India launched a series of strikes under ‘Operation Sindoor’, Pakistan’s military swiftly responded and downed 6 Indian jets before a ceasefire came into effect following US mediation.
The foreign minister also visited Washington, DC days ago, where he held a “cordial” meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “The meeting went very well. We discussed key global and regional issues,” he said, expressing hope that bilateral ties would be further strengthened.
Rubio had lauded Pakistan’s role in “global and regional peace” in his first meeting with Dar.</p><small>2025-07-27 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2716480043222db.jpg?r=165131' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926933/byc-continues-islamabad-sit-in-amid-id-checks-by-police' target='_blank'><strong>BYC continues Islamabad sit-in amid ID checks by police</strong></a><br><p>Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) activists marked the 12th day of their sit-in in Islamabad on Sunday, demanding the release of their jailed leaders, as protesters alleged police were asking to see their Computerised National Identity Cards (CNICs).
BYC, a Baloch advocacy group active since 2018, has been campaigning against enforced disappearances. Its chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other activists were arrested on March 22 for allegedly attacking Quetta Civil Hospital and inciting violence, a day after police cracked down on their protest. Earlier this month, an anti-terrorism court remanded them into 15-day police custody.
The Islamabad sit-in began on July 16, with BYC leaders and members demanding the release of its activists. Political leaders, journalists and activists have joined the sit-in over the past few days.
Last week, the BYC continued the demonstration on the road leading to the National Press Club in Islamabad, as the route had been blocked by police with barbed wire, preventing activists from returning to their original protest site.
An alleged video recorded by the protesters showed police demanding to see their CNICs and warning that failure to comply would result in them not being allowed to continue the demonstration.
In the video, protesters can be heard questioning why police were demanding identification after 12 days of demonstrating, to which an officer responds, “This rule was implemented today.”
A protester can be heard in the video refusing to show their ID card, saying their lawyer was on the way to the protest site.
Meanwhile, in a post on X, the BYC condemned the police’s demand for ID cards, accusing them of “further escalating the harassment” and attempting to “suppress and intimidate” the protesters.
“Last night, personnel from law enforcement and intelligence agencies began tailing protestors, following elderly mothers and women back to their temporary residence,” the BYC alleged in the post, adding that these personnel allegedly photographed the residences.
 






“These threatening tactics are taking place with the full backing and coordination of [the] Islamabad Police. Inside the protest space itself, LEA officials are regularly entering and capturing videos of students’ faces to instil fear,” the post further alleged.
According to the BYC, the route to the National Press Club remains blocked and demonstrators have not been allowed to set up a protest camp, despite heavy rain and extreme heat in the city.
“Every day, multiple elderly women and children faint from heat exhaustion,” the post added.</p><small>2025-07-27 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2717093691b37d4.jpg?r=171004' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926916/thailand-and-cambodia-agree-to-malaysian-mediation-malaysian-minister-says' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand and Cambodia agree to Malaysian mediation, Malaysian minister says</strong></a><br><p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to Malaysia acting as a mediator in their border conflict, the Malaysian foreign minister said on Sunday, as the combatants each said the other had launched further artillery attacks across contested areas.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thai Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai are expected in Malaysia on Monday evening, Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan told state news agency Bernama.
“They have full confidence in Malaysia and asked me to be a mediator,” Mohamad said, adding he had talked with his Cambodian and Thai counterparts and they agreed no other country should be involved in the issue.
The talks in Malaysia come after Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, chair of the regional Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) forum, had proposed a ceasefire on Friday and US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the two leaders had agreed to work on a ceasefire.
 
 

Four days after the worst fighting in more than a decade broke out between the Southeast Asian neighbours, the death toll stood above 30, including 13 civilians in Thailand and eight in Cambodia. More than 200,000 people have been evacuated from border areas in the two countries, authorities said.
Fresh artillery clashes erupted on Sunday morning near two long-contested ancient temples in the frontier region between northern Cambodia and northeast Thailand, which has seen the bulk of the fighting.
Cambodian defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said Thai forces began attacking areas around the temples at 4:50am (6:50am PKT).
The regular thump of artillery rattled windows in the Cambodian town of Samraong, around 20 kilometres from the frontline, AFP journalists said.
Thai Army Deputy Spokesman Ritcha Suksuwanon said Cambodian forces began firing artillery around 4am (6am PKT) as the two sides battled for control of strategic positions.
Ceasefire calls
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet on Sunday said his country “agreed with the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between the two armed forces”.
He said his Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn will talk to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to coordinate with the Thais, but warned Bangkok against reneging on any agreement.
After Trump’s call, Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said he had agreed in principle to enter a ceasefire and start talks “as soon as possible”.
While both sides have expressed a desire for talks to end the crisis, neither has so far been willing to back down. On Sunday, they again each blamed the other for undermining peace efforts.
The Thai foreign ministry also accused Cambodian forces of firing shells into civilian homes in Surin province.
“Any cessation of hostilities cannot be reached while Cambodia is severely lacking in good faith and repeatedly violating the basic principles of human rights and humanitarian law,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
From the Cambodian side, defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata issued a statement denying that they fired first.
The statement accused Thailand of “deliberate and coordinated acts of aggression”.
A long-running border dispute erupted into combat this week with jets, tanks and ground troops battling in the rural border region, marked by a ridge of hills surrounded by wild jungle and agricultural land where locals farm rubber and rice.
Thailand says seven of its soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed, while Cambodia has confirmed eight civilian and five military deaths.
The conflict has forced more than 138,000 people to be evacuated from Thailand’s border regions, and 80,000 have been driven from their homes in Cambodia.
After an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday in New York, Cambodia’s UN Ambassador Chhea Keo said his country wanted “an immediate ceasefire” and a peaceful resolution of the dispute.
UN chief Antonio Guterres urged both sides on Saturday to “immediately agree to a ceasefire” and hold talks to find a lasting solution.
As well as blaming each other for starting the fight, Cambodia has also accused Thai forces of using cluster munitions, while Thailand has accused Cambodia of targeting civilian infrastructure, including hospitals.
The fighting marks a dramatic escalation in a long-running dispute between the neighbours over their shared 800-kilometre border, where dozens of kilometres are contested.</p><small>2025-07-27 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/271627142386f38.png?r=162742' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926904/fatima-sana-aims-to-continue-pakistan-womens-winning-momentum-on-ireland-t20-tour' target='_blank'><strong>Fatima Sana aims to continue Pakistan women’s winning momentum on Ireland T20 tour</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan women’s cricket captain Fatima Sana on Sunday said that her team will look to continue their winning momentum on the upcoming Ireland tour.
On Wednesday, the Pakistan Cricket Board named the squads, with Fatima continuing to lead the team, as the national selection committee named a 15-member squad for the forthcoming T20 International series in Ireland.
The three-match T20 series against Ireland will be played at the Clontarf Cricket Club in Dublin from August 6 to 10.
In their last encounter in April, Pakistan women defeated Ireland by 38 runs in a low-scoring thriller to win the opening One-Day International (ODI) encounter of the ICC Women’s World Cup 2025 Qualifiers. Led by Fatima, Pakistan subsequently qualified for the World Cup after winning the tournament unbeaten, which was held in Lahore earlier this year
Responding to a question by Dawn.com at the National Stadium in Karachi, Fatima said, “Despite the difference in conditions, batters are confident and since our Qualifiers went well, we are going into the series with confidence.
“We are looking to continue that momentum and looking forward to do well — along with developing the T20I side as well.”
She also spoke about how she tries to contribute to the team in any domain, whether batting, bowling or fielding, adding, “I’ve been trying to improve my batting and play a role in the team’s victory in any aspect that I can.”
Top-order batter Muneeba Ali, speaking on the team’s batting performance, said: “Despite the difference in formats between the Irish tour and the World Cup, we are looking to focus on T20Is and work on 50-over format game alongside as well.”

The Southpaw opener added, “We have identified where we were lacking in the Qualifiers tournament, and have tried to overcome that [during the training camp] and build upon the positives from that tournament.”
On Saturday, the first phase of preparations for the Pakistan team’s tour to Ireland concluded in Karachi.
The 27-day camp, which started on July 7, was being conducted at the Hanif Mohammad High Performance Centre and the Oval Ground, with an emphasis on refining skills and improving fitness levels ahead of the upcoming tour.
A separate training camp for the 15-member squad will be held from July 28 to August 2, with the team leaving for Ireland on Aug 3.
Before participating in the 50-over ICC Women’s World Cup in September, Pakistan will play one series consisting of three matches against South Africa in Lahore from Sept 16 to 22.
 
 

The World Cup is scheduled to be held in India from Sept 30 to Nov 2, but Pakistan will play their matches of the global event in Sri Lanka under the hybrid model, according to which neither India nor Pakistan will visit each other’s venues due to political strains between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Pakistan’s highly anticipated clash with arch-rivals India is scheduled for October 5, followed by encounters against defending champions Australia on October 8 and 2017 champions England on October 15.
The national side will then face New Zealand (October 18), South Africa (October 21), and co-hosts Sri Lanka (October 24) to conclude their round-robin stage.</p><small>2025-07-27 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/27164041a6b5aaa.jpg?r=164443' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926932/us-passenger-plane-evacuated-in-denver-due-to-brake-fire' target='_blank'><strong>US passenger plane evacuated in Denver due to brake fire</strong></a><br><p>Passengers on a US domestic flight were forced to evacuate onto a runway due to a brake fire just ahead of the plane taking off in Denver, the airline said.
American Airlines Flight 3023 was departing for Miami on Saturday but “experienced a mechanical issue” while accelerating ahead of takeoff at Denver International Airport, the airline told AFP, adding all 173 passengers and six crew “deplaned safely”.
One passenger sustained a minor injury and was taken to a hospital for evaluation, American Airlines said.
Blown tires and the deceleration of the plane while braking resulted in an isolated brake fire, which was extinguished by city firefighters, according to the airline.
Social media videos published by US media outlets showed passengers frantically evacuating an American Airlines plane via an emergency slide as smoke billowed from beneath the aircraft.
A man held a child as they rushed down the slide, stumbling as he hit the ground.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement that the crew onboard the Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane “reported a possible landing gear incident during departure” at around 2:45 pm Saturday.
 
 

The FAA said it was investigating the incident.
It occurred just a day after a Southwest Airlines flight plunged mid-air to avoid colliding with another aircraft while en route to Las Vegas, injuring two flight attendants.
The latest scare adds to growing concerns over aviation safety in the United States after a string of recent accidents and near misses.
In January, a mid-air collision between a commercial aircraft approaching Ronald Reagan Airport near downtown Washington and a military helicopter killed 67 people.
 
 

In May, US President Donald Trump’s administration announced plans to overhaul its “antiquated” air traffic control system, which suffers from a shortage of controllers in FAA-managed towers.
The government has laid off hundreds of FAA employees as part of its plan to slash the federal workforce.</p><small>2025-07-27 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/271619432c8ee97.jpg?r=162000' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926929/pakistani-pilgrims-barred-from-by-road-travel-to-iran-iraq-this-arbaeen-interior-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani pilgrims barred from by-road travel to Iran, Iraq this Arbaeen: interior minister</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani pilgrims will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Sunday.
Pilgrims visit Iraq to attend the chehlum commemoration — also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) — to mark the 40th day of mourning for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
“After extensive consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [the] Balochistan Government, and security agencies, it has been decided that zaireen (pilgrims) will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road for Arbaeen this year,” Naqvi said on X.
He added that the “difficult decision was taken in the interest of public safety and national security”.
However, the pilgrims will be able to travel by air, the minister noted.
 






Naqvi stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed authorities to “arrange maximum flights to facilitate their pilgrimage in the coming days”.
Naqvi’s statement came after he met with PM Shehbaz earlier today to brief him on the new policy for pilgrims, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The premier also directed Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif to arrange “special flights for the pilgrims, APP stated, citing a press release from the PM Office.
Iraq’s Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than 21 million devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.
Pakistan is set to introduce a new travel management system from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.
 
 

Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.
Earlier this month, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf retracted his statement that 40,000 pilgrims had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq. He clarified that a “misunderstanding” of outdated paper records that had not yet been fully digitised resulted in the statement.
PM tells Naqvi to start work on Gwadar Safe City project
During their meeting, PM Shehbaz and Naqvi also discussed the law and order situation in Balochistan, with the premier telling the minister to initiate work on the Gwadar Safe City project.
The project aims to provide a safer city for the residents of Gwadar, particularly at the identified strategic locations and also help law enforcement agencies in detecting and investigating crimes by collecting evidence.
 






The delay in the project had been highlighted by Senator Quratulain Marri in May as she chaired a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Special Initiatives.
Senator Marri had sought a report on a critical discrepancy — the Gwadar Development Authority officials blamed a lack of funds for the project delays, while the Finance Division said it had received no funding demand from the Balochistan government.
 
 

On July 11, a representative of the Balochistan government told a high-level government meeting that 30 per cent of the project was complete, with full completion expected by June 2026.
With the initial plan prepared in 2016, the first phase of the Gwadar Safe City project had been approved by the Central Development Working Party in February 2023 for Rs4.97bn.</p><small>2025-07-27 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/27153731ac393b4.png?r=153824' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926918/gb-floods-death-toll-at-10-as-rescue-operations-continue-need-for-aid-mounts' target='_blank'><strong>GB floods death toll at 10 as rescue operations continue, need for aid mounts</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from floods in Gilgit-Baltistan stood at 10 as search and rescue operations continued across the region and stranded tourists were moved to safer locations, officials said on Sunday.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
Floods swept across GB on Monday, causing landslides, leaving many stranded, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said flood-related incidents in the region have claimed 10 lives since Monday, when four were killed and 15 went missing in Babusar.
The toll in Babusar has risen to seven, while two deaths were reported from Diamer’s Thore Valley and another from the Astore district, Faraq added.
The body of an unidentified woman was recovered from the Indus River in Chilas’s Minar area. “The body could be that of one of the tourists swept away at the Babusar Highway,” he said.
While speaking about the search operation yesterday, Faraq had said there may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at Babusar valley.
“Search operations are underway on Babusar Highway by personnel of the Pakistani Army, district administration and other institutions,” he said, adding that rescue and relief operations were also underway in Ghanche, Ghizer and Gilgit.
 


Most tourists trapped in Ferry Meadows have been rescued and moved to a safe place, Faraq said, adding that the Silk Road had been restored for all types of traffic.
“At least Rs20 billion worth of damage has been caused by flooding in Gilgit-Baltistan,” he said.
“The province runs on grants and aid; it will be difficult redressal for the provincial government alone. The federal government should announce a separate reasonable grant for the relief of flood disasters.”
A day earlier, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7bn in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced disasters that approximately “caused damages exceeding Rs20bn across the region.”
He said unprecedented floods had impacted seven districts, with Diamer being the worst affected. “People in GB are facing daily flood events. At least one flood occurs every day,” he said.
The chief minister said that 300 homes were destroyed, 200 were partially damaged, 40 water channels in 30 villages were swept away and 15 kilometres of roads, bridges, agricultural land, crops and public and private infrastructure were severely damaged.
He noted that only Rs1bn was allocated in the GB budget for emergencies and that the local government is also burdened with Rs3bn in liabilities from past disaster rehabilitation efforts.</p><small>2025-07-27 10:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2712403143cef91.jpg?r=124647' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926915/3-new-polio-cases-confirmed-in-kp-sindh-as-nationwide-tally-climbs-to-17' target='_blank'><strong>3 new polio cases confirmed in KP, Sindh as nationwide tally climbs to 17</strong></a><br><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Islamabad on Saturday confirmed three new polio cases in the country, taking the total number of cases detected this year to 17.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
The latest cases include one each from the Lakki Marwat and North Waziristan districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and one from Sindh’s Umerkot district, a statement by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme (PPEP) said.
A 15-month-old girl from Takhtikhel in Lakki Marwat, a six-month-old girl from North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil and a five-year-old boy from Umerkot’s Chajro were the latest polio cases confirmed by the NIH’s Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication.
With these new detections, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has risen to 17 — including 10 from KP, five from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.
 
 

A special vaccination campaign was held from July 21-27 in the bordering area of KP and Balochistan to coincide with Afghanistan’s sub-national polio campaign.
In addition, a fractional vaccination campaign began in Chaman on July 21 and will roll out in six districts of Balochistan from July 28.
“Despite substantial progress in polio eradication efforts, the continued detection of polio cases underscores the persistent risk to children, especially in areas where vaccine acceptance remains low.
“It is crucial for communities to understand that poliovirus can resurface wherever immunity gaps exist. Every unvaccinated child is at risk and can also pose a risk to others,” the statement said.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif reaffirmed Pakis­tan’s commitment to eradicating polio, vowing to intensify efforts with the support of international, provincial and local teams.</p><small>2025-07-27 09:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2712042251ec868.jpg?r=141914' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926914/9-dead-30-injured-in-bus-accident-on-islamabad-lahore-motorway-in-chakwal' target='_blank'><strong>9 dead, 30 injured in bus accident on Islamabad-Lahore Motorway in Chakwal</strong></a><br><p>Nine passengers died and 30 others were injured after the bus they were travelling on fell into a ditch near Balkassar Interchange in Punjab’s Chakwal district on Sunday morning.
According to a spokesperson of Chakwal Rescue 1122, the bus was heading to Lahore from Islamabad when one of its tyres burst near the Balkassar Interchange on the Islamabad-Lahore Motorway (M2).
The driver lost control of the bus, causing the vehicle to fall into a ditch and overturn.
“Nine people died in the accident and 30 were injured,” Dr Saeed Akhter, chief executive officer of the Chakwal District Health Authority (DHA), said in a statement.
It added that Chakwal Deputy Commissioner Sarah Hayat and Assistant Commissioner Zeeshan Sharif also visited the injured at the District Healthquarters (DHQ) Hospital.
DC Hayat, who was briefed on the accident’s details, directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to the wounded.
Eight passengers died on the spot, while one succumbed to her injuries at the hospital, according to an earlier police statement. The bus driver was among the deceased.
 

Rescue personnel on the site after a bus heading to Lahore from Islamabad overturned near the Balkassar Interchange on July 27, 2025. — Rescue 1122

According to the Rescue 1122 statement, there were over 40 passengers on the bus.
As per the list issued by the rescue service, an eight-month and a one-year-old infant were among four children who lost their lives. The eldest person among the deceased was 45 years old, while the injured were aged between 16 and 55 years.
Two sisters aged 14 and two years were among the dead, while their mother was injured. A woman from Philippines, identified as Emy Dela Cruz and married in Lahore, was also among the wounded.
Rescue 1122 had dispatched six rescue vehicles to the crash site, while personnel of National Highways and Motorway Police, the Chakwal police and a team of the Frontier Works Organisation also reached the incident site.
Some of the injured were rushed to Kallar Kahar Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, while others and the bodies were taken to the Chakwal DHQ Hospital.
Dr Mukhtar Sarwar Niazi, medical superintendent at the DHQ Hospital, told Dawn.com earlier today that four out of 12 injured persons brought there were “critically injured” and were being referred to Rawalpindi.
Chakwal District Police Officer Ahmed Mohiuddin took notice of the incident and sent a team comprising senior police officials. “The site has been cordoned off and police are acting as per law”, a spokesperson of Chakwal Police said.
Chakwal Rescue and Safety Officer Shaukat Ali said: “Our rescue teams responded with professional expertise, providing immediate medical aid to the injured and transporting the deceased to the hospital.”
He urged the public to ensure complete vehicle fitness checks — especially tyre, brake and steering system inspections — before embarking on long journeys to prevent such tragic incidents.
Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, mainly due to overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.
 
 

On July 13, six people lost their lives while 27 others were injured as a bus carrying them crashed on the M2 motorway near Chakri Interchange.
On February 28, eight passengers were killed while over 40 were injured on the same motorway when a Karachi-bound bus fell into a ditch near Bhagal village, a few kilometres away from Balkassar Interchange.
In August last year, 27 passengers were injured when a bus overturned on the M-2 near the Sial Mor service area.

Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on March 2 after ceasefire talks broke down. In late May, it began allowing a small trickle of aid to resume, amid warnings of a wave of starvation.
Yesterday alone, over 50 more Palestinians had been killed in Israeli strikes and shootings, some as they waited near aid distribution centres, the Palestinian civil defence agency said.
The pause in fighting would be limited to areas where the military says Israeli troops are not currently operating — Al-Mawasi, Deir el-Balah and Gaza City — and last from 10am (12pm PKT) until 8pm every day.
 


The military also claimed it had begun air-dropping food into the territory and rejected allegations it was using starvation as a weapon against Palestinian civilians.
In a statement, the army said it coordinated its decisions with the UN and international organisations to “increase the scale of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip”.
There was no immediate official response from the UN or non-governmental aid agencies operating in Gaza, and privately sceptical humanitarian sources said they were waiting to see the results on the ground of the Israeli announcement.
The Israeli statement added that “designated secure routes” had been opened across all of Gaza to enable the safe passage of UN and humanitarian aid organisation convoys delivering and distributing food and medicine.
The Israeli military insisted these operations, alongside its ongoing campaign against Palestinian armed groups, should disprove “the false claim of deliberate starvation in the Gaza Strip”.
Before Israel announced the airborne delivery of seven pallets of food, the United Arab Emirates had said it would restart aid drops and Britain said it would work with partners, including Jordan, to assist them.
“We ask God and our Arab brothers to work harder to reach a ceasefire before we all die,” Gaza resident Hossam Sobh told AFP, adding that he had feared death as he recovered a bag of flour under the nose of an Israeli tank.
Activist boat seized by Israeli troops
Also on Saturday, Israeli troops boarded a boat carrying activists from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition as it attempted to approach Gaza from the sea to challenge a naval blockade.
 






“Israeli forces illegally boarded ‘Handala’ in international waters, abducting 21 unarmed civilians,” the FFC said on X, sharing a video that showed purported Israeli soldiers taking away the activists.
“Demand your government end its complicity in Israeli war crimes, ensure the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid, and call for the immediate release of all crew members,” the coalition said.
 






The live feed on the Handala boat belonging to the FFC showed Israeli troops boarding the vessel.
The soldiers moved in as the boat approached Gaza and three live video feeds of the scene broadcasting online were cut minutes later.
The boat carries at least five citizens from the United States, three from France, two from Italy, Spain and Australia, and one each from the United Kingdom, Norway and Tunisia.

The humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory has gravely deteriorated in recent days, with more than 100 NGOs warning this week that “mass starvation” was spreading in Gaza.
On Telegram, the Israeli military announced it “carried out an airdrop of humanitarian aid as part of the ongoing efforts to allow and facilitate the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip”.
Humanitarian chiefs are deeply sceptical that air drops can deliver enough food safely to tackle the deepening hunger crisis facing Gaza’s more than two million inhabitants.
But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed the idea, vowing to work with Jordan to restart air drops. The United Arab Emirates said it would resume air drops “immediately”.
‘Starving civilians’
A number of Western and Arab governments carried out air drops in Gaza in 2024, when aid deliveries by land also faced Israeli restrictions, but many in the humanitarian community consider them ineffective.
“Air drops will not reverse the deepening starvation,” said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
“They are expensive, inefficient and can even kill starving civilians.”
 






Israel’s military insists it does not limit the number of trucks going into Gaza, and alleges that UN agencies and relief groups are not collecting aid once it is inside the territory.
But humanitarian organisations accuse the army of imposing excessive restrictions, while tightly controlling road access within Gaza.
A separate aid operation is under way through the controversial Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has faced fierce international criticism after Israeli fire killed nearly 800 aid seekers near distribution points since May 27.
A report by The Guardian revealed that food-deprived Palestinians in Gaza get as little as eight minutes to grab aid from GHF sites, which are located in evacuation zones, meaning that displaced Palestinians have to enter the areas they have previously been ordered to leave.

Much of Gaza now lies in ruins after 15 months of fighting, which erupted on October 7, 2023 when thousands of Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip, resulting in the deaths of 1,219 people, according to Israeli tallies, and abducting 251 hostages into Gaza.
The Israeli campaign in response has killed at least 59,733 Palestinians and destroyed much of the housing and infrastructure in the enclave, including the hospital system. The death toll is feared to be much higher due to thousands still missing under the rubble.</p><small>2025-07-27 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/271124377682b72.jpg?r=112443' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926908/at-least-6-crushed-to-death-at-temple-stampede-in-indias-uttarakhand' target='_blank'><strong>At least 6 crushed to death at temple stampede in India’s Uttarakhand</strong></a><br><p>At least six people were crushed to death at a popular Hindu temple in northern India’s Uttarakhand state on Sunday, officials said, after a massive crowd surge.
The stampede occurred on the stairway leading to the Mansa Devi temple in the Hindu holy city of Haridwar, on the banks of the Ganges River, and left many injured.
“Six dead and more than 10 injured are admitted to the hospital,” senior city police official Parmendra Dobhal told AFP.
Uttarkhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said relief and rescue operations were underway.
“I am constantly in touch with the local administration regarding this matter, and continuous monitoring of the situation is being done,” he said in a statement.
Deadly stampedes and crowd crushes are a common occurrence at Indian religious festivals.
In June, a sudden crowd surge at a Hindu festival in the coastal state of Odisha triggered a stampede that killed at least three people and injured several others.
The previous month, six people were crushed to death in the western state of Goa after thousands gathered for a popular fire-walking ritual.
And in January, at least 30 people were killed in an early morning crush at the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu mega-festival in the northern city of Prayagraj.</p><small>2025-07-27 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/27105619d2973f4.jpg?r=110123' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926905/iran-executes-two-members-of-banned-group-for-targeting-infrastructure' target='_blank'><strong>Iran executes two members of banned group for targeting infrastructure</strong></a><br><p>Iran executed two members of the outlawed Mujahideen-e-Khalq opposition group for targeting civilian infrastructure with homemade projectiles, the judiciary news outlet Mizan reported on Sunday.
Mehdi Hassani and Behrouz Ehsani-Eslamloo, “operational elements” of the MEK, were sentenced to death in a verdict upheld by the Supreme Court, Mizan said.
“The terrorists, in coordination with MEK leaders, had set up a team house in Tehran, where they built launchers and hand-held mortars in line with the group’s goals, fired projectiles heedlessly at citizens, homes, service and administrative facilities, educational and charity centres, and also carried out propaganda and information-gathering activities in support of the MEK,” the report said.
The defendants were indicted with “moharebeh”, an Islamic term meaning waging war against God, destroying public property and “membership in a terrorist organisation with the aim of disrupting national security”.
Semi-official Mehr news agency reported on Sunday that Ehsani-Eslamloo had been arrested in 2022 following an explosion at the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology claimed by the MEK.
The MEK, known in English as People’s Mujahideen Organisation of Iran, was a powerful leftist-Islamist group that staged bombing campaigns against the shah’s government and US targets in the 1970s but ultimately fell out with the other factions of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Since then, the MEK has opposed the Islamic Republic, and its leadership in exile has been Paris-based. The group was listed as a terrorist organisation by the US and the European Union until 2012.</p><small>2025-07-27 06:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/27093145ceaaf5f.jpg?r=093355' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926853/dispute-erupts-over-punjab-cotton-output-data' target='_blank'><strong>Dispute erupts over Punjab cotton output data</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A major controversy has emerged over the methodology used by the Crop Reporting Centre (CRC) Punjab in determining provincial cotton output, with serious allegations of inflated and misleading statistics surfacing.
It has been revealed that CRC Punjab is allegedly estimating total cotton production using hypothetical calculations — extrapolating yields based on the number of bolls per plant across an acre or, in some districts, from small sample plots as small as eight feet by six feet.
This has exposed a long-standing discrepancy between the figures reported by CRC Punjab and those of the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA), with the former consistently reporting significantly higher production.
Ihsan-ul-Haq, Chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, stated that this variance has long complicated decision-making for stakeholders in the cotton industry. He noted that while some attribute the CRC’s inflated figures to unrecorded lint sales by certain ginners, the presence of two conflicting national datasets has damaged Pakistan’s credibility in international cotton forums.
“As of July 15, the PCGA reported Punjab’s cotton production at 145,000 bales, while CRC Punjab claimed 335,000 bales — a staggering difference,” Haq said, adding that such figures appear divorced from ground realities. “It is entirely inaccurate to determine provincial output from a handful of bolls or a couple of micro-plots,” he stressed.

CRC’s figures sharply contradict PCGA data, raising concerns over planning and international credibility

He urged the CRC to adopt a more grounded data collection approach, similar to that of the PCGA, which gathers cotton and lint sales and stock data on a fortnightly basis from every ginning factory. Haq proposed that CRC staff collect real-time data from ginneries and grain markets to provide more accurate and credible figures.
 
 

In response, CRC Punjab Director-General Dr Abdul Qayyum defended the Centre’s methodology. Speaking to Dawn by phone, he said around 1,600 staff members in cotton-growing areas gather data weekly from approximately 4,000 locations.
“Our teams measure boll size and weight, count bolls per plant, and monitor picking activity in the field,” he explained.
Dr Qayyum asserted that the CRC’s calculations are based on standardised field practices with no incentive to inflate or deflate figures. He attributed the divergence from PCGA data to differences in collection points.
“While we report from the picking stage, PCGA collects data at the ginning stage — where under-invoicing by ginners to evade sales tax is a known issue, as acknowledged by the industry itself,” he said.
Despite these explanations, the growing gap between CRC and PCGA data continues to raise concern among cotton stakeholders, who warn that unreliable production figures could undermine effective policymaking and market confidence.

In a judgment, the judge highlighted inefficiencies in the prosecution’s handling of case records and proposed the use of WhatsApp as a tool to streamline the process.
The judge noted that delays in providing case records to prosecutors often waste valuable judicial time.
The judge had taken notice of the situation during the hearing of a post-arrest bail petition, when he observed a female deputy prosecutor general attempting to collect the facts haphazardly to respond to the queries of the court.
Asked by the court, the prosecutor said the record of the case had just been tabled before her in the court.
Being irked with the response and waste of precious time of the court, the judge had summoned the prosecutor general of Punjab.
Justice Rafiq criticised the practice of physically transporting documents that could easily be shared electronically.
To address this issue, the judge directed the prosecutor general of Punjab to implement guidelines ensuring that police officers share detailed fact sheets and progress reports with prosecutors via WhatsApp or other approved electronic platforms at least one day prior to hearings.
The judge further instructed the prosecutor general to establish a mechanism for obtaining WhatsApp numbers of police officers responsible for producing records in court. These numbers are to be shared with prosecutors to facilitate real-time communication and ensure timely submission of case details.
The judge noted that this approach would save judicial time and enhance the effectiveness of prosecution efforts.
Justice Rafiq highlighted the importance of prosecutors exercising their powers independently and in the public interest as mandated by the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service Act, 2006.
He also highlighted the need for disciplinary action against any dereliction in adhering to these guidelines.
SUMMONED: An anti-terrorism court has summoned the investigating officers and prosecution witnesses of alleged conspiracy of May 9 riots for cross-examination in two cases including the burning of Shadman police station.
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill conducted the hearing inside Kot Lakhpat Jail.
The defence concluded cross-examination of four prosecution witnesses in the police station attack case.
Separately, cross-examination of eight other prosecution witnesses was also conducted in a May 9 case of burning police vehicles near Jinnah House.
The defence lawyers completed cross-examination of a total of 12 prosecution witnesses.
The judge adjourned further proceedings of the jail trial till July 28.
During the hearing, the attendance of detained accused including PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Punjab President Dr. Yasmin Rashid was marked.
In the Shadman police station attack case, 14 accused have been declared proclaimed offenders for not joining the hearing after securing bail.
The judge also adjourned the hearing of two other cases including the burning of police vehicles at Zaman Park till July 28.

Two things are at work here. First, they want to present Gen Munir as a scary Islamist with a nuclear arsenal. This portrayal is largely shaped to trigger the attention of western powers. 
Secondly, there is also the possibility that these analysts clearly aren’t aware that there is nothing called ‘Islamist nationalism.’ Either way, theirs is a rather ignorant portrayal. 
‘Islamism’ is opposed to the whole concept of nationalism. According to prominent Islamist ideologists such as Hassan al-Banna, Sayyid Qutb and Abul A’la Maududi, nationalism was a European construct and is inherently secular and bound by geography. Islamists argue that Islam’s ‘universalist’ vision is at odds with this equation. 
Nationalism indeed is a European concept. Therefore, for instance, Maududi’s concept of hakumat-i-ilahi [God’s rule/regime] was not about nationalism or a nation state. It was about an Islamist state ruled by a vanguard of ‘pious men’ who were to expand it. Ironically, though, the idea of the state as we know it today and as applied by the purveyors of Islamism is also a European construct.  

Pakistan’s ideological evolution, from Muslim nationalism to Islamic nationalism, has often been misunderstood. Now, the state is quietly reforming its ideological identity — one that is distinct from both secularism and Islamism

Nevertheless, both mainstr­eam and militant Islamists detest nationalism. But mainstream Islamists often enter politics to get seats in parliaments from where they strive to achieve their goals without having to resort to violence. They treat this as a temporary arrangement, though, which is to be held till Muslim polities and politics are ‘Islamised’ enough to embrace wider Islamist goals. 
But most experiments of this nature failed in various Muslim-majority nation states because, eventually, the nationalist impulse and the inherently secular make-up of the idea of the nation state clashed with the ambitions of the Islamists. 
Pakistan, a nation state, defines itself as an ‘Islamic Republic’ but one that was founded on ‘Muslim nationalism.’ Muslim nationalism seeks to advance the interests and aspirations of Muslims through nationalistic frameworks. It treats Islam as a ‘guiding force’ — not a political blueprint.
 
 

However, in the 1970s, the core of Pakistani nationalism began to move from Muslim nationalism towards ‘Islamic nationalism.’ Islamic nationalism retains many aspects of Muslim nationalism but is slightly more open towards co-opting certain theocratic elements of Islamism. 
Islamic nationalism’s immediate outcome in Pakistan was ‘Islamic republicanism.’ Islamic republicanism in Pakistan’s context meant a middle ground between a theocratic state and a secular republic. It encourages a democratic form of government, a democratically agreed cons­titution, and a mixture of secular and ‘Islamic’ laws. 
It treats Islam as an identity marker, and constitutionally, guarantees religious freedoms to non-Muslim citizens. It also provides enough room for entirely secular activities — as long as they do not contradict the way the constitution has defined Islam. 
The transition from Muslim nationalism to Islamic nationalism/republicanism has not been a smooth one, though. The latter was almost immediately seized by civilian-political and state actors as a tool to portray their political manoeuvres as ‘divinely-ordained.’ The appetite of the constitution to allow the co-option of more and more Islamist notions of law and morality was expanded. 
Consequently, Islamic nation­alism’s evolution was thrown into disarray. Pakistan came close to becoming an outright ‘theodemocracy’, or a blend of the principles of traditional republican democracy and theocratic rule. To some, it did become that. 
From the late 1980s onwards, the parliamentary route was rejected by most later-day Islamists and more militant and violent means were adopted by them. Mainstream Islamists, though, became desperate to sustain the route to theodemocracy that was becoming extremely bumpy. 
 


This desperation in them is still present. This means they sense that a change is afoot. And it is. The violence and confusion that the creeping theodemocracy unleashed in society began to threaten the state itself.
Gradually, the state (dominated by the powerful military establishment) is trying to reshape Islamic nationalism, and the government is following suit. Understandably, it is going to be a slow but prudent process.
The idea now is to position Pakistan’s Islamic nationalism/republicanism in opposition to contemporary Hindu nationalism in India, which is viewed as being regressive, violent and racist. What is also afoot is a quiet tweaking in this respect of rhetoric, textbooks and the constitution.
Some simple examples in this regard are constitutional bans on child marriage, the reintroduction in textbooks of a 1947 speech by the country’s founder that was expunged from the curriculum in 1977 for being ‘too secular’, etc. 
 
 

This is being done to refigure Islamic nationalism as a tolerant, inclusive and ‘balanced’ idea that is in tune with 21st century requirements, but also one that gives the state an overwhelming monopoly on violence against those perceived to be threatening the state. 
Gen Munir is not an Islamist nationalist. The term is inherently contradictory, as discussed above. One might say he’s an Islamic nationalist, but one whose nationalism is being informed by the reshaped version of Islamic nationalism, which is flexible, as opposed to what it became in the 1980s. 
During the country’s recent war with India, in which Pakistan downed multiple Indian fighter jets, the word ‘jihad’ was only sparingly used. The chant of “Allah-o-Akbar” [God is great], though, was common, as it has always been, even among the most liberal Pakistanis. It is entirely rhetorical and doesn’t carry any shadowy agenda. It’s more of a cultural chant than a declaration of any questionable intent, unless one was a violent, anti-state Islamist militant. 
The changing world order and Pakistan’s increasing importance in the region is compelling the state to constantly tweak the country’s Islamic nationalism. It is now well understood that the nationalism that began to mutate into something quite problematic in the 1980s is at odds with how the state has begun to see itself now.

Adam Abro told the police that he murdered his granddaughter, Fahmida Abro, “for honour” when she returned home after staying away for many days. The family is a resident of Adam Abro village, which is named after the elder and situated in the Fateh Abad union council.
The area police went to his home and took the woman’s body into their custody for a post-mortem examination. They said the suspect used a knife to slit her throat.
 
 

Fazil Rahu DSP Abdul Rahim Khaskheli told the media that circumstantial evidence suggested some other persons might also be involved in the murder. He said Abro surrendered before the Tarai police, who shifted him to the Model police station from where he was to be handed over to the Kario Ghanwer police for the registration of the murder case.
Residents of the village told the media that the woman had left her home to contract a freewill marriage with a man who lived in the same neighbourhood but he deceived her. She returned to her parents’ home in the early hours of Friday and was killed hours later, they added.
Her body was handed over to the heirs after legal formalities.

• CM Gulbar says region lacks funds to tackle flood damage
• Seven districts affected; Diamer worst hit by daily flash floods
• Villagers flee Rajanpur, Bhakkar, Layyah, Muzaffargarh as low-lying districts in Punjab submerged
GILGIT / LAHORE / DERA GHAZI KHAN: Gilgit-Balti­stan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan on Saturday appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7 billion in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced disasters that have caused damages exceeding Rs20bn across the region.
Speaking at a press conference at the CM House in Gilgit, the chief minister said the GB government lacks the financial capacity to handle the unprecedented disasters.
CM Khan was accompanied by GB Home Minister Shams Lone, GB Assembly member Jamil Ahmed, Special Assi­stant on Infor­mation Eman Shah and Special Assistant on GB Disaster Management Auth­ority Muhammad Ali Quaid.
He said unprecedented floods had impacted seven districts, with Diamer being the worst affected. “People in GB are facing daily flood events. At least one flood occurs every day,” he said.
He said that so far, 10 fatalities and four injuries have been reported. Seven deaths were reported from Babusar, two from Thore Valley (Dia­mer) and another from Astore district.
The chief minister said that 300 homes were destroyed, 200 were partially damaged, 40 water channels in 30 villages were swept away and 15 kilometres of roads, bridges, agricultural land, crops and public and private infrastructure were severely damaged.
He noted that only Rs1bn was allocated in the GB budget for emergencies and that the local government is also burdened with Rs3bn in liabilities from past disaster rehabilitation efforts.
“I appeal to the prime minister of Pakistan to immediately release at least Rs7bn to restore roads, electricity, water channels and to undertake other essential relief efforts,” the chief minister said and requested the premier to visit the region.
He recalled that the federal government provided Rs3bn during the 2022 floods, but criticised the previous GB administration for misusing the funds, with the exception of a model village established for flood victims in Ghizer’s Bubor area.
“This year’s disasters are beyond our resources. I urge the federal government to help the people of GB,” he added, while also appealing to non-governmental and international organisations for support. A formal request has been sent to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he said.
Meanwhile, the Karakoram Highway, which was blocked at Chilas on Saturday, was reopened for traffic on Sunday. However, flash flood events continued to be reported across GB.
In Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat, a flash flood swept away over 200 goats, sheep and surrounding greenery. Rescue 1122 reported multiple flash floods in the Shigar district on Saturday, affecting crops and infrastructure in Qaimabad Tisar, Chatron and Garam Chashma.
 
 

Residents said flash floods disrupted road access, mobile networks and electricity. In Kondus village of Ghanche district, a devastating landslide destroyed over 50 homes. Survivors are in dire need of shelter, food, medical care and internet access.
Flood-affected communities in Diamer and elsewhere are facing severe shortages of clean drinking water and essential supplies.
Punjab grapples with flooding
Meanwhile, thousands of residents across several districts in Punjab were displaced on Saturday as widespread flooding inundated low-lying areas. In some regions, such as Rojhan tehsil of Rajanpur, residents resorted to hiring private boats after failing to receive government assistance.
Several villagers in Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan and Muzaffargarh also had to leave due to a medium-level flood. All their crops were damaged due to the flood, and their houses were also surrounded by water.
The hundreds of people living in the catchment areas of the rivers Sindh and Chenab also had to migrate on their own, along with their cattle, struggling to find fodder and shelter. They protested the government’s lack of relief efforts.
 
 

In Layyah, the third flood wave in the Indus River raised water levels to 450,000 cusecs. A protective embankment near the under-construction Taunsa Bridge collapsed, submerging adjacent villages and farmlands. Rescue machinery, including a multimillion-rupee excavator, was at risk of being lost.
Dera Ghazi Khan Commissioner Chaudhry Ashfaq told Dawn that the situation was under control and that the excavator would be recovered once the water receded. Relief camps have been set up in Karor tehsil of Layyah at several locations.
Meanwhile, Dera Ghazi Khan Deputy Com­missioner Usman Khalid said water levels were expected to remain stable by evening and noted that seven relief camps had been established in Taunsa. He confirmed that no mass evacuations had occurred yet.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb visited flood-hit areas in Pindi Bhattian and Hafizabad, where dozens of villages were submerged due to heavy rains. She met with residents, announced one-month rations for affected families and inspected medical and livestock camps.
She said a survey had been conducted to assess flood damage and pledged to provide financial assistance in a transparent manner. Emergency measures have been implemented in affected areas, with residents advised to relocate from dilapidated structures.
Earlier, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Punjab issued flood warnings for the Chenab and Jhelum rivers and their tributaries, anticipating rising water levels from July 28 to 31.
Punjab’s Relief Com­missioner Nabil Javed directed local officials and departments, including agriculture, irrigation, health, livestock and transport, to remain on high alert and ensure that emergency arrangements, including food, shelter and clean water, were in place.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia urged the public to follow safety advisories and cooperate with authorities during emergency evacuations. He assured that the government would provide full support to both people and their livestock.

At the same time, imports from the region surged more than fourfold, deepening the trade imbalance.
According to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan, exports to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan fell to $197.06 million in FY25 from $288.23m in FY24.
In contrast, imports from these countries jumped by 411pc to $245.09m, compared to just $47.94m in the previous year, with the bulk originating from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.
Despite multiple high-level visits and the operationalisation of transit trade agreements — particularly with Uzbekistan — trade volumes remain below potential. Uzbekistan has begun utilising its transit agreement with Pakistan, and Tajikistan last year imported three truckloads of potatoes under a similar arrangement.

Exports to five Central Asian states drop 32pc, while imports soar over fourfold

However, these developments have yet to translate into a significant boost in exports.
Country-wise data shows that Kazakhstan remained Pakistan’s top export destination among the CACs, but exports dropped sharply by 47.12pc to $97.96m in FY25, from $185.25m the previous year. Meanwhile, imports from Kazakhstan rose to an all-time high of $129.63m, up from just $0.677m in FY24.
Exports to Uzbekistan declined by 18.17pc to $63.65m from $77.79m a year earlier, while imports surged 177.6pc to $79.23m from $28.54m. Similarly, exports to Kyrgyzstan dropped by 58.26pc to $3.99m in FY25, compared to $9.56m last year, while imports rose modestly to $0.571m from $0.357m.
Pakistan’s exports to Turkmenistan increased by 42.73pc, reaching $1.67m from $1.17m, whereas imports grew by 35.48pc to $16.57m from $12.23m. In contrast to the broader trend, exports to Tajikistan more than doubled, rising by 106pc to $29.79m in FY25, up from $14.46m. However, imports from Tajikistan also jumped by 211pc to $19.09m from $6.13m a year earlier.
Pakistan’s annual trade with the CACs, routed mostly via Afghanistan, ranges between $400m and $500m — a fraction of its overall trade volume. The figures highlight the persistent underperformance of Pakistan’s trade with Central Asia, despite diplomatic and logistical efforts to strengthen economic ties.

• Governor bemoans Centre’s uplift measures focused on Punjab
PESHAWAR: A jirga organised by the Awami National Party (ANP) at its headquarters in the provincial capital on Saturday rejected any new military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as it demanded an end to terrorism and restoration of peace across the province thro­ugh a political leadership-driven jirga.
The gathering, which was attended by almost all major political parties, was held at Bacha Khan Markaz, followed by a press conference in which a 28-point declaration was read out by ANP provincial president Mian Iftikhar.
The jirga demanded an end to terrorism and the restoration of constitutional rights, as well as the protection of Pashtun rights. The declaration emphasised the need for a durable peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former tribal areas through a political leadership-driven jirga to engage in “serious negotiations” with the military establishment. It demanded the full implementation of the 18th Amendment, an end to proxy wars, and the early restoration of the NFC Award.
 






It urged the government to eliminate all terrorist outfits in the province without any discrimination while also rejecting all forms of violence, including military operations. It agreed on the establishment of a peace process led by the political leadership to address the root causes of militancy. It also demanded the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the killing of ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb.
The jirga also demanded concrete steps to address enforced disappearances, internally-displaced persons’ problems, and the reconstruction of infrastructure damaged during multiple military operations. It said all missing persons should be produced in relevant courts to provide justice to the affected families. It further called for an end to proxy wars, neutral stance in international conflicts, and the strengthening of diplomatic relations with the neighbouring countries.
The jirga asked for the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) and the rollback of the Action in Aid of Civil Power 2019 to stop injustices. It also sought funds and facilities for the ex-Fata region as per the promises made by the federal government.
The gathering was attended by representatives from the ANP, the PML-N, the PPP, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, the Jamaat-i-Islami, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement, the Qaumi Watan Party, the National Democratic Movement, the Pashtunkhwa Awami National Party, and the Mazdoor Kisan Party.
Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi told journalists at KP House in Islamabad that the Fata merger could not be rolled back without a constitutional amendment and sought funds for the region promised at the time of its integration. He also demanded that a tribal jirga be constituted to resolve the issues faced by these areas. The governor said that the situation in the province was “ser­­iously dangerous” as people were being kidnapped for ransom in broad-daylight.
He also criticised the federal government and said that its focus was only on the development of Punjab, saying that the KP youth had been ignored by the  government in its projects . He said the province lacked proper playgrounds, as a result of which the PSL matches could not be held in KP. He also claimed that the PTI founder, Imran Khan, would not come out of jail and his sons would not travel to Pakistan.
The jirga participants warned that they would march on Isla­mabad if their demands were not met.

• Barrister Gohar urges end to political exclusion
ISLAMABAD: As many as five Senators have submitted their affidavits to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, indicating their intention to officially join the party.
However, a sixth Senator — Murad Saeed — remains “missing.” According to party sources, his intimation regarding joining PTI may be received electronically.
PTI’s Information Secretary, Sheikh Waqas Akram, while speaking to Dawn, said that five Senators who were recently elected as independent candidates from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have handed over their affidavits to Mr. Gohar.
“The affidavits will be submitted to the Election Commission of Pakis­tan (ECP) on Monday (tomorrow),” he said.
The Senators who submitted affidavits to join PTI include Azam Swati, Faisal Javed, Noor-ul-Haq Qadri, Mirza Muhammad Afridi, and Robina Naz.
However, it is pertinent to mention that PTI stalwart Murad Saeed — who secured the highest number of votes on general seats — has not yet submitted his affidavit to Mr. Gohar.
According to party sources, the government is actively attempting to arrest Murad Saeed, who has been in hiding for a considerable period. As a result, his affidavit might be delayed or submitted electronically.
When contacted, Azam Swati told Dawn that he and the other candidates had made every effort to obtain official PTI tickets but were denied.
“In my case, my nomination papers were rejected multiple times and were only accepted following a court order, which remarked: ‘If Azam Swati cannot contest the election on a technocrat seat, then who can?’ As we did not have party tickets, we formed a group of six independent candidates and went on to win the election,” he said.
In response to another question, Mr Swati confirmed that he and the other four Senators had submitted their affidavits to Barrister Gohar on July 23.
He expressed confidence that the affidavits would be submitted to the ECP, as rules require Senators to formally join a political party within three days of the election.
Hammad Azhar to contest by-polls
Meanwhile, PTI plans to nominate the party’s former Punjab president, Hammad Azhar, to contest the by-election from NA-129— the constituency where his late father, Mian Muhammad Azhar, was elected in the February 8, 2024, general elections.
It is worth mentioning that Hammad Azhar was also elected as an MNA from the same constituency in the 2018 general elections.
Last year, Mian Azhar had contested the election because Hammad Azhar failed to submit his nomination papers.
At the time, the younger Azhar had been declared an absconder, although he later attended his father’s funeral.
‘Not a good omen’
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan has stated that sidelining a major political party is not a good omen for the country, stressing that every stakeholder must play a role in upholding democracy.
He made these remarks on Friday after visiting Hammad Azhar’s residence to offer condolences on the passing of his father, Mian Azhar, former Punjab governor and PTI MNA.
While acknowledging that the dialogue process has not progressed, Mr Gohar said that people need to put aside their unwarranted egos. He lamented that PTI was first accused of rec­eiving foreign funding and later blamed for the country’s current political instability. He made it clear that PTI has never attempted to create chaos or provoke confrontations in politics.

Police produced Gul Jan Bibi before Judge Muhammad Ali Mobeen of the ATC-I after the expiry of her two-day physical remand and the investigation officer informed the court that she was not required for further investigation.
After the initial arguments from both sides, the jud­ge sent the woman on judicial remand.
Gul Jan Bibi was arrested after her video statement went viral, in which she defended the killing of her daughter, Bano Bibi, and a man in the name of ‘honour’ in Dagari, on the outskirts of Quetta.
“They were killed according to the Baloch traditions and customs and we have not committed any sin by killing them,” Gul Jan Bibi said about the incident that shook the nation after videos of a group of men shooting the victims surfaced online earlier this month.
So far, around 15 people, including the tribal chief of Satakzai tribe, Sardar Sherbaz Khan Satakzai, have been arrested. However, the prime accused, Jalal Satakzai, who allegedly opened fire and killed his elder sister, and the man, could not be arrested.
Protest
Meanwhile, human rights organisations and civil society staged a protest on Saturday to condemn the killings.
The protest was jointly organised by the Women Action Forum, National Commission on Human Rights, HRCP and Bol Utho Group.
A large number of human rights activists and members of civil society gathered in front of the Quetta Press Club. They took out a rally led by rights activists Prof Farkhanda Auran­g­zeb, Huma Fouladi, Seema Batool, Hameeda Noor and others.
The protesters condemned the incident and said honour killings were an intolerable act.
They demanded that all those involved in this crime be brought to justice.
“Nobody has the right to take law in his hand and kill people in the name of so-called honour,” Ms Aurangzeb said.
The protesters urged the government to protect women from such atrocities.

FM Dar is currently on a visit to the US. He spoke at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, a day ago, during which he had drawn a parallel with the case of Dr Aafia, who has spent years in a US prison, when responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan’s incarceration.
He noted that Pakistan did not interfere in that process because “the Americans had followed their judicial system”. Furthermore, he said, Imran was sentenced by Pakistan’s judiciary, following the due process of law. “When the due process is followed, others do not have the right to interfere,” he said.
Dr Aafia, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her sentence at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.
FM Dar’s remarks were criticised by her lawyer as being “idiotic”.
Subsequently, a post by FM Dar on X said: “Yesterday, in response to a question about Imran Khan’s case at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the reference to Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s case is being taken out of context. During the tenures of PML-N governments, we have consistently provided all diplomatic and legal assistance for Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release, and we will continue to do so until the matter of her release is resolved.”
He said every country had its judicial and legal procedures, which were to be respected, whether it was Pakistan or the US.
“Our government’s stance on the issue of Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release is clear and unequivocal.”
 






Responding to Dar’s comments earlier in the day, Dr Aafia’s lawyer Clive Stafford Smith OBE said: “Sorry but this is idiotic! ‘Due process’ does not equal something where Aafia had no witnesses, they lied & it was all false. That’s called a miscarriage of justice not what’s ‘due’.”
 






Dar “appeared to be going out of his way to undermine Aafia’s case yesterday by acting like she got ‘due process’ when all she got was torture and a trial in New York when all the real witnesses were in Afghanistan”, he said in a separate post on X.
 






Speaking to Dawn.com, Smith said: “As you may have seen from the deputy PM’s statement, he was trying to justify what is happening to Imran Khan by using the Aafia Siddiqui case — saying her case is a result of ‘due process of law’ in the US and so therefore it is only something a judge can deal with.
“He goes on to say that disagreeing with a legal verdict against him does not give Imran Khan the right to provoke people to dissent, which should be done through the courts.”
Smith said that in his opinion, “I suspect we can all disagree with what he is saying: in all of the scores of people whom I have exonerated in the US, I have used publicity to help force the system to correct its mistakes, and obviously, in Aafia’s case, I tried to do that through the clemency process with Biden too.”
He said that FM Dar’s analogy was “unwise as well as misplaced”.
On the PTI founder’s incarceration and legal troubles, he said: “I suspect many people will disagree with the notion that Imran Khan has received anything that approaches ‘due process of law’ in the cases against him, just as we can agree that Aafia is where she is today due to the criminal actions of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), along with others, rather than any ‘due process’.”
He added that FM Dar should not talk about Dr Aafia’s case in the context of Imran’s cases.
“In every instance, Pakistan’s officials need to be towing the consistent line, set out in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s excellent letter to Joe Biden, that no matter what you believe, Aafia has suffered enough,” Aafia’s lawyer added.
He added that he was very optimistic that Pakistan would continue with efforts to secure Dr Aafia’s release.
Speaking on the circumstances of her trial, Smith said: “The defence brought no witnesses to New York, not one.
“The prosecution brought the people they wanted — soldiers who all tried unsuccessfully to tell the same story, and an Afghan interpreter who was promised US residency and given a substantial amount of money.”
He said that the physical evidence solidly disproved the prosecution’s theory, even then, but before trial, the defence did not locate the videotape that proved beyond argument that the holes in the wall were not from Dr Aafia shooting, since they were from earlier that day.
“I have promised to file her appeal in New York in the next week or ten days,” Smith said.
A day ago, PM Shehbaz had assured Dr Fouzia Siddiqui that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of her sister.
On July 12, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had expr­essed dissatisfaction over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report was not presented. IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq on July 21 had issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for refusing to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia’s case in the US.
However, the IHC Registrar Office had on Wednesday put on hold the processing of the contempt of court notices issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.
In February, the IHC was told that the proposal to exchange Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible. The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that  Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.
Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had requested that Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.
In a letter dated October 13, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia’s “fragile mental and frail physical health” while in prison. “Now 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.
“Numerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui … all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,” the letter read. “In fact, they fear she may take her own life.”
Consequently, the US State Department declined to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.</p><small>2025-07-27 03:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/68856a416fe42.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926814/un-conference-eyes-solution-to-gaza-deadlock' target='_blank'><strong>UN conference eyes solution to Gaza deadlock</strong></a><br><p>• New York meeting to be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia next week
• Israel and US to skip conference; 11 more Palestinians killed
• UK plans to airdrop aid, evacuate injured children from Gaza
UNITED NATIONS: Fired by France’s imminent recognition of Palestinian statehood, UN members meet next week to breathe life into the push for a two-state solution as Israel, expected to be absent, presses its war in Gaza.
Days before the July 28-30 conference on fostering Israeli and Palestinian states living peacefully side-by-side to be co-chaired by Riyadh and Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would formally recognise the State of Palestine in September.
His declaration “will breathe new life into a conference that seemed destined to irrelevance,” said Richard Gowan, an analyst at International Crisis Group.
“Macron’s announcement changes the game. Other participants will be scrabbling to decide if they should also declare an intent to recognise Palestine.” According to an AFP database, at least 142 of the 193 UN member states —including France — now recognise the Palestinian state proclaimed by the Palestinian leadership in exile in 1988.
The New York conference is a response to the crisis, with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa and several dozen ministers from around the world expected to attend.
‘No alternative’
The meeting comes as a two-state solution is “more threatened than it has ever been (but) even more necessary than before, because we see very clearly that there is no alternative,” said a French diplomatic source.
Beyond facilitating conditions for recognition of a Palestinian state, the meeting will have three other focuses — reform of the Palestinian Authority, disarmament of Hamas and its exclusion from Palestinian public life, and normalisation of relations with Israel by Arab states that have not yet done so.
Ahead of the conference, Britain said it would not recognise a Palestinian state unilaterally and would wait for “a wider plan” for peace in the region.
Macron has also not yet persuaded Germany to follow suit and recognise a Palestinian state in the short term.
The conference “offers a unique opportunity to transform international law and the international consensus into an achievable plan and to demonstrate resolve to end the occupation and conflict once and for all, for the benefit of all peoples,” said the Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour.
Israel and the United States will not take part in the meeting.
Meanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli operations killed 11 people including four Palestinians in the Al-Rimal neighbourhood. Another person was killed “after Israeli forces opened fire on people waiting for humanitarian aid” northwest of Gaza City, the agency said.
Witnesses said several thousand people had gathered in the area for aid. Another man was killed by a drone strike near the southern city of Khan Yunis, while one was killed by artillery fire in the Al-Bureij camp, the civil defence said.
UK to airdrop Gaza aid
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday spoke to his French and German counterparts and outlined UK plans to get aid to people in Gaza and evacuate sick and injured children, his office said.
“The prime minister set out how the UK will also be taking forward plans to work with partners such as Jordan to airdrop aid and evacuate children requiring medical assistance,” a statement said.
In a phone conversation, Starmer, Fre­nch President Emmanuel Macron and the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza “which they agreed is appalling”.
“They all agreed it would be vital to ensure robust plans are in place to turn an urgently needed ceasefire into lasting peace,” according to a readout released by Downing Street.
Handala near Gaza shores
Meanwhile, the activist group Freedom Flotilla announced that its latest aid boat dispatched to Gaza was approaching the territory and planned to land there on Sunday morning in defiance of an Israeli blockade.
The vessel, named the Handala after a popular Palestinian cartoon character, was 194km from its destination, organisers said — closer to Gaza than its predecessor the Madleen was when it was intercepted in June.
Carrying 19 activists, including Swed­ish activist Greta Thunberg, as well as two journalists from different countries, the  Handala first set sail from Sicily on July 13 in a bid to break the  Israeli blockade on Gaza and deliver aid to its population. However, the Israeli navy said it would block the new vessel from reaching Palestine.

The premier was chairing a meeting to review progress on FBR reforms in Islamabad on Saturday.
He directed the FBR to continue dialogue with the business community over tax compliance concerns, emphasising that any form of harassment will not be tolerated.
The government, he stated, remains committed to creating a facilitative environment for businesses across the country. The directive comes amid mounting tensions, as trade associations have announced a nationwide strike in response to budgetary tax measures aimed at documenting the retail sector and curbing tax evasion.
An official source told Dawn that the prime minister has directed senior FBR officials to ensure that no member of the business community is subjected to harassment. “We have to keep businesses running,” he stated, adding that any coercive actions against traders would be unacceptable. “We do not want to close businesses,” he said.
Mr Shehbaz further emphasised that the FBR should rely on digital surveillance rather than physical crackdowns to identify tax evaders. “Utilise technology to detect tax evasion and then issue recovery notices,” the prime minister instructed.
The FBR has deployed tax officials across 10 key sectors — including ghee, tobacco, and sugar — to monitor actual production and detect instan­ces of concealment. Section 40B of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 authorises the FBR to station officers directly at business premises for this purpose.
To ensure transparency, FBR personnel are accompanied by representatives from the Intelligence Bureau and other relevant agencies.
Preliminary findings indicate that certain sectors have been deliberately underreporting production in order to evade taxes.
The prime minister has underscored the need for equitable tax contributions across all segments of the economy. Expressing concern over the narrow focus of current tax collection efforts — primarily targeting the manufacturing sector and salaried individuals — he termed the approach as unjust.
He directed that high-net-worth individuals, retailers, wholesalers, and other economic actors be brought under the tax net to ensure a broader and fairer revenue base.
“The tax collection process must be rational and efficient so that we reduce reliance on domestic taxation,” the premier stated, emphasising that every sector carries a responsibility to contribute its fair share to the national exchequer.
According to the tax official, the issues with traders are expected to be resolved by the coming Monday.
“We have addressed most concerns and reached an understanding,” the official stated, adding that the remaining issues will be settled during the final round of negotiations.

• Aleema claims jail authorities denied lawyers entry to plead Toshakhana case
ISLAMABAD: PTI founding chairman and ex-premier Imran Khan has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the rejection of his bail by lower courts.
On June 24, the Lahore High Court (LHC) denied post-arrest bail to the incarcerated PTI leader in eight cases related to May 9 violence, including an attack on the house of Lahore corps commander. Mr Khan had moved the LHC after an anti-terrorism court denied bail to the former prime minister in these eight cases.
The petition, filed through senior counsel Salman Safdar on Saturday, claimed Mr Khan has been accused of conspiring and abetting violence on May 9.
However, at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Khan was in the custody of NAB. Therefore, his involvement in violence was “impossible,” the petition argued.
The appeal was filed a day after Mr Khan’s sister, Aleema, accused the Adiala jail authorities of trying to sabotage the case by confiscating documents required to submit the petition.
The fresh appeal contended the PTI founder had been subjected to an “unprecedented campaign of political victimisation” since his ouster as prime minister two years ago.
The present case is yet another attempt by the state and the police to “implicate” Mr Khan in a criminal matter, based solely on “vague and unsupported allegations of abetment”.
The prosecution has no “convincing” evidence connecting Mr Khan to the alleged occurrence, the petition claimed.
After Mr Khan’s “unlawful and invalid” arrest from the premises of the Islamabad High Court on May 9, 2023, multiple FIRs were registered in Lahore and Islamabad, the petition contended, adding none of these complaints contained any specific allegations or details regarding the purported conspiracy.
At a later stage in these cases, the prosecution introduced supplementary statements by police officials in an apparent attempt to “falsely implicate” Mr Khan.
If, as per the prosecution’s claim, the police allegedly knew about the conspiracy to orchestrate violence as early as May 7, why did they not take any action to prevent the attacks, the petition questioned.
This was “highly illogical” and further exposed the “malafide and politically motivated nature of the proceedings”.
The appeal alleged Mr Khan had been “maliciously implicated” in these cases as part of a “calculated and politically motivated design to prolong his incarceration”, harass him and tarnish his public image.
Mr Khan’s arrest was “never genuinely required” in cases pertaining to May 9 violence, the petition pleaded.
It added the police took no action to arrest Mr Khan for over five months after his bail applications were dismissed by an Anti-Terrorism Court in Lahore on Aug 11, 2023.
Despite knowing Mr Khan’s whereabouts — Adiala jail where he was confined — the police “made no meaningful attempt to effect his arrest”.
“This lack of urgency or interest on part of the investigating agency strongly supports the inference that the arrest was not necessitated by the merits of the case, but rather was a tool of oppression, thereby further justifying the grant of post-arrest bail,” the petition said.
LHC decision
The petition claimed the LHC declined Mr Khan’s request for post-arrest bail by relying on “engineered and fabricated evidence” which included “stale, discredited and delayed statements of police officials”.
The high court also failed to note the prosecution had been “consistently shifting its stance” by continually changing the case’s narrative.
“Each new version was introduced only after the preceding one failed to withstand before the courts of law, thereby rendering the prosecution’s case doubtful and entitling the petitioner to the benefit of further inquiry.”
These contradictions clearly make a case for Mr Khan to be granted bail under Section 497(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The said section, which allows bail in non-bailable offences, states: “If it appears to such officer or Court … that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed [a non-bailable offence], but that there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into his guilt, the accused shall, pending such inquiry, be released on bail…”.
Legal team denied entry
Also on Saturday, Ms Aleema, the PTI founder’s sister, claimed his legal team was not allowed inside the Adiala Jail to attend the proceedings of the Toshakhana 2 case.
While talking to reporters outside the prison, Ms Aleema said she and the lawyers were waiting but neither was allowed to enter the prison.
“We were told that only one lawyer can go inside the jail but the lawyer asked how he would [plead the case] without his legal team,” Ms Aleema said.
She claimed the jail authorities violated the judge’s orders, who “time and again said the lawyers of Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi be allowed to enter”.
Ms Aleema said no one was listening to judges “because of the 26th Constitutional Amendment”.
She added her brother has already given a call to launch a protest campaign and raise a voice against the amendment.

According to Swat police, the operation was launched following credible intelligence regarding the presence of high-profile militants in the area. When law enforcement personnel moved in, the suspects opened fire, prompting a retaliatory response. All three militants were killed in the ensuing exchange.
Among the deceased was Ajmal alias Waqas, a resident of Malook Abad, wanted in at least nine terrorism-related cases. The second was identified as Matiullah alias Ishaq and Junaid, son of Ibrat Shah from Dabb Sar Martung in Shangla district, wanted in two cases.
The third, Rahimullah Rehmani alias Rohullah, son of Amanullah and a resident of Sheray, Nuristan, in Afghanistan, was also wanted in two separate terrorism cases.
Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan told reporters that search and strike operations would continue across the district.
He added that security had been intensified at all entry and exit points to prevent the infiltration of miscreants. “We will not allow the peace and stability of Swat to be disturbed at any cost,” he said.
Militant killed by own accomplices
In a separate incident in Kohat district, an alleged militant involved in an earlier attack on the Hangu DPO was killed on Friday night, reportedly by fire from his own group during a police operation.
 
 

The militant, identified as Shahzeb, had previously escaped after being injured during an attack on the Hangu DPO’s convoy last Saturday. DPO Khalid Khan and SHO Nabi Khan were injured in the attack. Shahzeb was later arrested near Naryab Dam within the Doaba police jurisdiction.
During interrogation, he revealed the presence of militant commander Umer alias Abu Bakr in the area. Acting on this intelligence, police from Doaba and Thall tehsils launched an operation towards Tora Warai, where they were again ambushed.
SHO Doaba Imranud Din, who was transferred from Kohat a few days ago, and his team engaged the militants in a two-hour gun battle. During the exchange, Shahzeb was fatally struck by a bullet allegedly fired by his accomplices.
Karak operation
In Karak, an alleged militant was killed during an exchange of fire with police in the Shah Slaim area on Saturday.
A police official said a team assisted by CTD commandos was dispatched after intelligence reports indicated that a group of militants was heading towards the Abbas Khattak area in Lakki Marwat district.
During a search operation in Shah Slaim, security forces encountered the group, resulting in a fierce gun battle.
“The gunfight continued for some time before the terrorists fled into difficult mountainous terrain,” he claimed.
During the subsequent search, police recovered the body of a militant identified as Fidaullah, a resident of Nagri.
“The cops also seized an assault rifle, two hand grenades, magazines and ammunition from the place and shifted the terrorist’s body to a nearby hospital,” the police official added.
The official said that the killed militant was involved in various sabotage activities, including the Friday’s militant attack in the Koh-i-Maidan area in which a police constable Saeed Nawaz was martyred.
He said that police also destroyed the hideouts of militants in a separate action.
“The police, with the help of CTD personnel, launched a search and strike operation against the gang of terrorists led by Sanaullah Jalali and Attaullah,” he maintained, claiming that the group has been involved in launching attacks on law enforcement personnel in the Karak district.
He said that, along with destroying safe havens in the mountains, the law enforcers also cut off the supply line of the militants.

The trial, held from July 7 to 9, resulted in the judgment by Justice Heather Williams DBE, who convicted Abrar Qureshi of libel over two defamatory videos of his popular ‘Gorakh Dhanda’ programme published online on November 1, 2021 via different social media platforms. 
PPP regional president and MLA Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin and his son Chaudhry Amar Yasin, an AJK cabinet member, had brought the case in the King’s Bench Division of the High Court, citing severe harm to their political and personal reputations. 
The videos featured Mr Qureshi’s interview with Chaudhry Muhammad Sabeel, a former employee of the elder Yasin, who levelled accusations of criminal misconduct, including blackmail, sexual abuse, torture, corruption, and abuse of public office. 

Abrar Qureshi ordered not to publish defamatory videos again, share court order on his social media accounts

The court concluded that Mr Qureshi had made no reasonable attempt to verify the allegations before broadcasting them to a large audience. 
In her 62-page ruling, a copy of which was seen by Dawn, Justice Williams noted that Mr Qureshi had abandoned his defences of truth and honest opinion on the first day of trial, leaving him unable to justify the defamatory publications under public interest protections 
She found that Mr Qureshi had “fallen well short of the standards expected of a responsible journalist,” particularly given the size and influence of his platform, which includes over 190,000 YouTube subscribers and 700,000 Facebook followers. 
The judge said his failure to present Yasin family’s version of events or conduct basic checks made the publication grossly irresponsible.
The judge observed that the allegations had caused “serious harm” to the claimants’ personal and professional standing, especially considering their public roles within Pakistan and the Kashmiri diaspora in the UK. The tone of authority, repetition, and lack of challenge in the videos had led many viewers to believe the accusations were true, she added. 
While acknowledging that the claimants may have overstated the extent of reputational harm during parts of their testimony, the court was satisfied that the legal threshold of serious harm had been crossed by a wide margin. 
“As a remedy, each claimant was awarded £130,000 in libel damages, including aggravated damages to reflect the distress and reputational damage caused. Additionally, the defendant was ordered to pay interest of £21,829 to each claimant and an interim payment of £65,000 towards legal costs by August 8.”
The court issued a permanent injunction restraining Mr Qureshi from republishing the defamatory material or anything similar and directed him to post a court-approved summary of the judgment across all his social media platforms within seven days, as per Section 12 of the UK Defamation Act 2013.
Legal experts say the ruling underscored the limits of free expression on digital platforms, particularly where reputations are damaged in foreign nations. It also highlighted the strength of UK libel law, even in a cross-jurisdictional and digital media context.
Speaking briefly in Muzaffarabad after the verdict, Mr Yasin said: “We welcome the judgment as a vindication of truth and accountability.”

Police had initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of honour in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated. As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered a case with the police under Section 496A. Police sources had said that the case was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow.
According to sources close to the investigation, as many as eight people, including the gravedigger, the graveyard secretary, the rickshaw driver who transported her body to the graveyard, her husband and family members including her brother, have been detained by police in connection with the case.
Three of the total suspects were present in the court of Magistrate Qamar Abbas Tarar today, according to a court order seen by Dawn.com.
The judge approved the investigation officer’s (IO) request for custody, stating: “… Three-day physical remand of the accused for said purpose is hereby granted. Accused persons be produced before the court on July 29.”
In another order from today, the judge approved the application to conduct the exhumation of the victim’s body and scheduled it for July 28 at 10am. The judge directed the Holy Family Hospital’s medical superintendent to depute a medical officer who would arrive at the graveyard for the exhumation and also order the Pirwadhai Police station house officer to designate a guard at the victim’s grave until the exhumation.
The Rawalpindi tehsil medical officer was also instructed to provide sanitary workers for the process.
Separately, the police added Sections 109 (abetment), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 302 (murder) and 311  (Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code to the FIR on Friday.
City Police Officer Syed Khalid Hamdani also told Dawn.com that a 10-member team was formed to assist in the investigation.
He said the team included various senior police officials further and IT experts of Rawalpindi Police, who would ensure timely support and the provision of technical evidence to the investigation officer from various institutions.
Hamdani said that the team would also conduct raids to ensure the timely arrest of more suspects in the light of information obtained from those detained during the investigation.
The incident comes a few days after  police arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Degari area of Balochistan’s Quetta, who were shot dead on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’.
The arrests were made after a video of the killing went viral on social media, in which a group of people could be seen shooting the couple.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p><small>2025-07-26 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26183805bdcf04b.jpg?r=184217' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926741/pakistan-fully-committed-to-building-secure-prosperous-regional-environment-with-allies-coas' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan fully committed to building secure, prosperous regional environment with allies: COAS</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday said Pakistan was committed to building a secure and prosperous environment in the region with the help of partner nations.
Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia’s naval chief met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi on Thursday, while COAS Munir met Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.
A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Islamabad hosted the Regional Chiefs of Defence Staff Conference under the theme of ‘Strengthening Bonds, Securing Peace’ today, attended by senior military officials from the United States, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
The ISPR said COAS Munir formally welcomed the distinguished defence delegations and reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to peace, stability and constructive engagement across the region.
“In an era defined by transnational threats and complex hybrid challenges, the imperative for deeper military-to-military cooperation, strategic dialogue and mutual trust is paramount. Pakistan remains fully committed to working with partner nations to build a secure and prosperous regional environment,” Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by the statement.
The ISPR said the session’s participants also discussed regional security dynamics, the evolving security environment in central and south Asia and the necessity of joint training initiatives, counter-terrorism cooperation and coordinated humanitarian responses.
“This landmark multilateral engagement marked a significant stride toward advancing regional security cooperation, military diplomacy and strategic dialogue among participating nations,” the statement said.
 






According to the ISPR, the conference sought to reinforce security collaborations, enhance training initiatives and exchange the best practices in counterterrorism and other defence and security programmes.
The military’s media wing added that the participants collectively reaffirmed their resolve to uphold peace, respect, national sovereignty and confront common security threats such as terrorism, cybersecurity and violent extremism.
“Participants commended Pakistan’s leadership, hospitality, and initiative in fostering such inclusive and forward-looking defence diplomacy,” the ISPR said.
It further added: “This strategic convergence reflects Pakistan’s enduring commitment to a secure, interconnected and cooperative region, anchored in shared security interests and regional solidarity.”
Pakistan’s role in regional peace was lauded by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a meeting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday.
“Pakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,” the Foreign Office had quoted the US secretary of state as saying while the US State Department said he expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran and its commitment to preserving regional stability.
