<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68df344a0412f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946252/pak-us-repair' target='_blank'><strong>Pak-US repair</strong></a><br><p>AMID the many geopolitical shifts underway, the turnaround in the Pak-US relationship has struck some observers as particularly surprising. It has also, understandably, prompted questions about the extent to which this turnaround signals a genuine reset.
For at least two decades, Washington had largely adhered to a familiar script on Pakistan. That script rested on two Western narratives: an alleged double game on Afghanistan, and the country’s unfavourable closeness to China. That script also became harder to rewrite as successive US administrations made a hard pivot to the Indo-Pacific and advanced a case for India as a net security provider in the belief that it could eventually erode New Delhi’s incentives for strategic autonomy.
 
 

But in recent months, a lot has changed. After years, Islamabad seems to have some equity with a US administration. The US has shown a growing willingness to re-hyphenate Pakistan with India. And the overarching US attitude towards the latter, borne, at least on paper, over frustration over trade and immigration, but also over a lack of acknowledgment of President Donald Trump’s role in ending the four-day May conflict, has been much cooler.
To what extent then has Washington’s script on Pakistan undergone a genuine rewrite?

Has there been a genuine reset in ties?

Examination of sentiment both up and down Washington suggests some caution on this front might be wise. A generation of US diplomats and officials, many of whom rose through the ranks in the Obama years and had a front row seat to unattained US objectives in Afghanistan, remain broadly pro-India. And years of close engagement with India’s strategic community have also made American policymakers more attuned to understanding India’s grievances vis-à-vis Pakistan, rather than Pakistan’s vis-à-vis India.
This is worth bearing in mind for two reasons:
One, given that the default setting in Washington below the level of the executive is what it is, it may be prudent to prepare for the contingency that, when the pendulum swings back, there may be a scramble to overcompensate and placate New Delhi for what will likely be viewed as the undue excesses of Trump-era policy on South Asia.
Two, despite its newfound closeness with the Trump administration, Pakistan’s own constraints make it unlikely for Islamabad to ever exclusively be in a US camp. If the Trump administration presses Pakistan to distance itself from China, Pakistan may likely experience friction of the sort that India is currently experiencing over its ties with Russia. For these reasons, Pakistan has an enormously high stake in continued Sino-US cooperation.
That said, recent events still present three consequential openings that policymakers in Islamabad could do well to take advantage of.
First, events in the Middle East have diverted much of Washington’s attention away from the Indo-Pacific and back towards West Asia. This, together with Pakistan’s recent agreement with Saudi Arabia and regional efforts to end the war in Gaza, make Pakistan, more than India, the more consequential regional protagonist in the quieter work of anchoring geopolitical stability. That by default enhances America’s stakes in reaffirming the Pak-US relationship and should strengthen Pakistan’s imperative to remain an important interlocutor in the Middle East.
Second, there is no denying that India’s confidence in its relationship with the US has been shaken. Even when a trade agreement between the two countries is reached, Indian str­ategists may be far more hesitant abo­ut attaching weight to future overtures out of Washington. This presents a somewhat rare window for Islamabad to strengthen its bid for a more balanced US strategic posture in South Asia.
Third, if Pakistan can concertedly follow through on its proposed joint investments in critical minerals, trade and energy during the remainder of Trump’s time in office, the visibility and dividends of those enterprises might incentivise political support for bilateral collaboration into the next American administration. It is also likely that the longer the US rift with New Delhi persists, the less likely it is that such collaborations with Pakistan will be seen as cost prohibitive.
Finally, it is worth remembering for any truly meaningful reset with the US to be sustainable and not linked to short-term gain, Pakistan must first be able to credibly guarantee returns on democratic, social and economic governance at home. If it can, everything else will follow much more naturally.

It is a complex conflict shaped by the tortured history of South Asia. Sports, in essence, are a form of make-believe in which the visceral human urge to compete and clash is channelled into a set of mutually agreed rules within acceptable norms of safety and civility. When sporting encounters are surrounded by outright hostility in virtually every other sphere of life, the bounds of civility are likely to get breached. This is what happened over the course of three India-Pakistan games during last week’s Asia Cup tournament.
At one level, petulant Indian antics, such as refusing to shake hands or declining to accept their hard-won trophy from a Pakistani official, can be seen as simply bad manners. The deeper truth, however, is that these misbehaviours were knowingly orchestrated for the domestic consumption of a ravenous Indian audience. In fact, India’s ruling political class is left with no other choice, having painted itself into a corner after the reckless adventurism of Operation Sindoor. Their survival now depends on demonising Pakistan and Pakistanis at every step.
In Pakistan, the mood is a tangled mix of annoyance, disappointment and incredulity. We feel disrespected by India’s cricketers and disempowered by the ICC, world cricket’s governing body. We find it hard to believe that an evidently thriving neighbour with superpower aspirations would stoop to such misconduct.
 
 

We are also sick and tired of losing to India. Although the overall tally of matches is still tilted towards Pakistan (across all international formats, Pakistan has been victorious 88 times compared to India’s 79), the record in ICC’s flagship tournaments has been abysmal. India leads 8-0 in ODI World Cup matches and 6-1 in T20 World Cup matches, while the record in Champions Trophy matches stands tied at 3-3. The winless record over 13 iterations of the ODI World Cup, cricket’s premier extravaganza, rankles the most.

Ultimately, there is no better strategy than to play the game well.

As debate swirls around Pakistan’s latest defeats, three key questions emerge. The most fundamental, of course, is how to become a better and more victorious team. The second is how to manage our cricketing relationship with India. And the third is about what can or should be done at the level of the ICC to ensure that all matches — including specifically India-Pakistan encounters — are played in a spirit of cordiality and dignity.
The recipe for cricketing success is no secret. You start with a cricket chief who is duly elected by regional bodies and is accountable to multiple stakeholders including players, administrators and the public. This is not the case at present, because the head of the Pakistan Cricket Board is invariably a handpicked political appointee, often with dubious credentials and unclear motives. The overall result is a hodge-podge national cricketing set-up with a domestic configuration that gets tweaked every season, coaches and support staff that are rotated like musical chairs, and grounds and facilities that remain mediocre if not dismal. We have no confidence in this system’s ability to identify and nurture the best talent that the country has to offer, and to keep their skills at par with the top teams.
As for India, it is important to recognise that on account of an astronomical market they are the most dominant force in world cricket today. They are hell-bent on sidelining Pakistan, and we have little leverage in the matter. But their hysterics and theatrics are not going unnoticed. Our best option is to bide time while India comes to terms with its Pakistani demons — some real, some imagined — both on and off the field. Yes, we should take a principled stand to preserve our rightful place in the international game, but we should do it without getting too emotional or reactive. India is an ambitious country with a vigorous and capable intelligentsia; they are bound to come to their senses before too long.
Meanwhile, India’s current stranglehold also limits Pakistan’s manoeuvrability within the infrastructure of international cricket. ICC’s website hosts a 44-page document prescribing a code of conduct for players and officials, including a laudatory preamble on the “spirit of cricket” in which respect is paramount. The document itself is appropriate and admirable. But recent India-Pakistan contests have witnessed serial violations of this prescription. The question comes back to who will bell the cat.
Ultimately, there is no better strategy than to play the game well. In Dubai last Sunday, Pakistan had worked their way to 113 for 1 at nearly 10 runs per over, and the Indians were starting to look nervous. Then a wicket fell, and another. With no Inzamam or Miandad to stem the tide, Pakistan’s innings collapsed in a heap. Still, when India came out to reply, Pakistan’s opening attack dismissed their top three batters for only 20 on the board. After that a missed run out here, a dropped catch there, and some loose bowling at the death, saw India edge ahead – albeit with only two balls to spare. To have come this close in such a pressure-cooker match against a superior opponent despite the omnipresent chaos and disarray of Pakistan cricket represents a silver lining from which we can take heart.
Our raw talent pool faces multiple headwinds in the form of poor governance, the misfortune of a hostile cricketing behemoth in the neighborhood, and an impatient and unforgiving fan base. Nevertheless, there is reason to be optimistic. The need of the hour is to empower regional cricket associations; instill a culture of integrity and merit; pour money into infrastructure and facilities; and develop a comprehensive grassroots programme to identify future stars and popularise the game. Pakistan casts a long and imposing shadow on the game, with a pantheon of heroes and legends achieving much greatness and glory. It’s been done before; there is no reason why it cannot be done again.

Sadly, what happened at the National Press Club in Islamabad yesterday is just another example of the speed at which the government is divesting itself of whatever democratic standards it claims to uphold.
It hardly matters that the minister of state for interior rushed to the premises to apologise ‘unconditionally’ or that the interior minister ordered an ‘inquiry’ into the police intrusion and subsequent violence against journalists at the club. It does not matter that the authorities tried to explain that the police action was initially targeted at a protest called by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee and that the situation had spiralled out of control.
 
 

What is of concern is that the brazen-faced barbarity at work — captured by phones and cameras, and circulated on social media for all to see — is not about to disappear in an environment where there is an active campaign to crack down on free expression.
The images and reports were traumatising: journalists were beaten, dragged and pushed around, their shirts torn, their equipment smashed. No damage control by the government is going to wipe out that memory.
Expectedly, condemnation has poured in from all sides. “We demand an immediate inquiry and those responsible brought to book,” said the HRCP. The president of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists has said it was “one of the darkest days” in the country’s history. Significantly, the PFUJ, Aemend and CPNE have together asserted that over the past few days, government-sponsored advertisements have appeared in the media labelling reporters, freelancers and others as anti-state.
Media watchdog Freedom Network has indicated the potential fallout of such dangerous advertisements: “Instead of ensuring their safety and a supportive work environment, this campaign further endangers media practitioners who already face threats, harassment, and physical violence.” It is chilling to imagine the greater horrors that lie beyond.
There is no doubt that years of state overreach have contributed to this fast-deteriorating situation. Politicians in opposition have talked loudly of the importance of press freedom; once in power, they have kept up the rhetoric but instituted draconian laws like Peca to silence all dissenters.
Media personnel have been picked up, disappeared and killed. Some have turned up later, shaken and unable to proceed. But accountability has eluded the mostly nameless perpetrators. In such conditions, one would have expected a united and robust media pushback — not unknown in the annals of Pakistani journalism.
Instead, there is a divided community today, unable to counter the silence thrust upon it. The need for independent journalism, fiercely defended by its practitioners, has never been greater. It is one of the last hopes for restoring democracy.

The proposal was shared by Senator Ali Zafar after his meeting with the incarcerated former prime minister. He was speaking to the media the other day, after attending the hearing of Toshakhana-2 case against Mr Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi.
It is worth mentioning that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in August disqualified Omar Ayub Khan as the opposition leader in the National Assembly, following his conviction in the May 9 cases. After the disqualification of Omer Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the PTI chief on August 20 nominated Mr Achakzai and party veteran Azam Swati as opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate, respectively. The decision was announced by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja.
The move sparked a debate as to why an outsider was being considered for the slot of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, due to which the idea was dropped. Mr Achakzai is a veteran political figure from Balochistan, particularly known for his outspoken stance against the establishment.

However, Senator Ali Zafar revealed that Mr Khan was still interested in nominating Mr Achakzai as leader of the opposition.
He also said that Mr Khan expressed annoyance over the recent public allegations exchanged between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and his sister Aleema Khan, directing them to refrain from making statements against each other.
CM Gandapur had alleged that Aleema Khan was working for the Military Intelligence (MI) and establishment, and that she aspired to become party chairperson.

The ECP had issued a notification for disqualification of Shibli Faraz on Aug 5, following his conviction by an anti-terrorism court in relation to his alleged role in May 9 incidents. The Peshawar High Court had given interim relief, which was vacated on Oct 1.

• Calls for peace, orders restraint by LEAs, seeks probe into deaths
• AJK paralysed by fourth day of strike, communications blackout
• Funerals in Muzaffarabad galvanise crowds; locals demand justice over alleged police firing
MUZAFFARABAD: A high-level government delegation held negotiations with a civil society alliance in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Thursday after days of fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers that have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured.
The eight-member committee, dispatched by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, comprises federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Amir Muq­am, Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Rana Sanaullah and Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, along with PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf and Qamar Zaman Kaira, and former AJK president Sardar Masood Khan.
They were accompanied by AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, who had been staying at Kashmir House in Islamabad for the past several days.
Negotiations began in the committee room of the Chief Secretary’s office in the afternoon, with Shaukat Nawaz Mir, Raja Amjad Ali Khan and Anjum Zaman Awan from the Muzaffarabad division representing the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), which has been spearheading the rights movement in the territory.
 






However, core members from the other two divisions — Poonch and Mirpur — could not immediately join the negotiations as they were away from the capital.
Sources said the Muzaffarabad trio, along with other core members, later left for Dhirkot, where their colleagues from Poonch and Mirpur had already gathered for consultations. The meeting continued until late in the night on Thursday and talks with the government’s high-level committee were expected to resume on Friday morning.
A strike has paralysed Azad Jammu and Kashmir under a communications blackout after talks over elite privileges and reserved refugee seats collapsed between the JKJAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers, sparking protests and violence. On Wed­nesday, the AJK prime minister and Parliamentary Affairs Mini­ster Tariq Fazal Chaudhry invited the alliance for fresh dialogue.
On Thursday, the entire region observed a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike for the fourth consecutive day, under a ceaseless communications blackout imposed since Monday. No fresh incidents of violence were reported.
Though government offices and banks technically remained open, attendance was negligible. Interestingly, many government officials avoided using official vehicles for commuting and instead preferred to walk or use rented motorcycles.
‘Enemies of Pakistan’
Before the delegation left for AJK capital Muzaffarabad, members of the government negotiating committee spoke to the media in Islamabad and stressed the need for dialogue to end the unrest that has gripped AJK for the past three days, Dawn.com reported.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the government should play its role to address the issues in AJK. However, he added that given the present situation in the region and the world, some “elements would want to disturb peace and stability in Pakistan to push forward their agendas”.
He said the government remained committed to resolving the issues of the people of AJK, but they should also be mindful that no such situation was being created, which “Pakistan’s enemies” could take advantage of.
AJK PM Haq thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz for issuing directives for sending a “high-level delegation” for restarting talks in the region and expressed the hope that members of the JKJAAC would also work towards ending the impasse in negotiations between the two sides.
Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said, “We are all saddened and concerned over the situation. We will try our best to fulfil the just demands of the people of Kashmir and steer them out of the current situation at the earliest as the enemies of Pakistan and Kashmir would have their own objectives.”
Rana Sanaullah also emphasised that “violence is not the solution” to any problem. He said they aimed to resolve the matters in accordance with the law and Constitution, ensuring the restoration and maintenance of peace.
Amir Muqam also thanked PM Shehbaz for addressing the issue. “We want the protest and the difficulties of the people of Kashmir to end. We hope that [JKJAAC] members would consider this … and engage with us for talks.”
Sardar Muhammad Yousuf, Qamar Zaman Kaira and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also shared similar views. The Ministry of Interior also convened an important meeting in Islamabad on Thursday to consider steps to defuse the situation.
PM calls for peace
According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on X earlier on Thursday, PM Shehbaz had directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad.
According to the statement, the prime minister voiced deep concern over the law and order situation in AJK as Wednesday’s violent protests left three policemen dead. He urged citizens to remain peaceful and instructed law enforcement agencies to show restraint.
 






“The prime minister has made a strong appeal to citizens to remain peaceful. He has urged that peaceful protest is the constitutional and democratic right of every citizen, but protesters should refrain from causing harm to public order.”
The premier also directed that law enforcement agencies exercise restraint and patience with the protesters.
“The prime minister has said that respect for public sentiments must be ensured, and any unnecessary harshness should be avoided,” the statement said, adding that the government was always ready to address the issues of its Kashmiri brothers.
Expressing “deep concern over the unfortunate incidents during the protests”, the premier ordered a transparent investigation into the matter.
Funerals in Muzaffarabad
Earlier in the day, hundreds of people gathered at Khurshid Football Stadium and the AJK capital’s famous Lala Chowk to attend the funerals of two people killed in an alleged police firing in Muzaffarabad.
Addressing the mourners, Mr Mir of JKJAAC updated the crowd on the latest developments, vowing that the struggle would continue until the acceptance of key demands.
These include the abolition of 12 refugee seats, withdrawal of elite privileges, implementation of a June 2019 High Court decision regarding agreements on power projects in AJK, and provision of health cards.
He stressed that before discussing these issues, the alliance would demand the immediate arrest and exemplary punishment of those responsible for killing “unarmed protesters” in Muzaffarabad, Dhirkot and other areas of AJK.
He also sought a public mandate to engage in negotiations with the official committee, pledging that there would be no compromise on people’s rights.
Reports from Kohala, a border town about 35km away, said that thousands of people from AJK’s southern districts had reached there by evening.
A source told Dawn that JKJAAC leaders had directed the crowd to wait in Kohala until further instructions after the conclusion of their consultations.

“The judiciary will not tolerate fissures within its ranks,” Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani said while hearing a contempt of court petition.
The petition was filed by Hafiz Ehtesham against lawyer Imaan Mazari. The petitioner, who is known for frequent litigation, objected to remarks attributed to Imaan Mazari in a speech about judges.
Hafiz Ehtesham alleged that she implied “five judges” were “victims of division” and “working under pressure”.
Justice Kayani put a question to the petitioner: “Which five judges do you mean?” After Ehtesham named five judges — including Justice Kayani himself — the bench intervened immediately, warning him not to continue.
“There is no division in this court, and neither shall we allow any division,” Justice Kayani asserted.
The five judges are: Justices Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Raffat Imtiaz.
 
 

He emphasised that if any judge believed their dignity had been undermined, they could choose to respond personally, but allowing others to speak on their behalf would create a misleading impression.
The judge said “there are good judges and incompetent judges”, but at the same time stressed that remarks like those made by Imaan Mazari fell within the domain of freedom of expression and should not be conflated with allegations of institutional discord.
The petitioner read aloud excerpts from Mazari’s speech delivered outside the National Press Club in an effort to substantiate his plea for contempt proceedings.
The bench, however, repeatedly questioned whether her comments crossed the legal threshold for contempt.
Justice Kayani observed that these days people consume information from multiple platforms ranging from traditional news outlets to YouTube vlogs and social media.
After hearing preliminary arguments, the court reserved its ruling on maintainability of the petition.
Pleasant change
Justice Kayani’s observations coincided with a notable change in atmosphere at the IHC. For the last few months, the five judges had refrained from attending official tea breaks hosted by Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar as they had challenged his transfer and subsequent elevation as IHC chief justice.
In the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision on Sept 30 to overturn the chief justice’s interim order (Sept 16) barring Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri from performing judicial functions, the five judges rejoined Justice Dogar and other colleagues at a tea break on Wednesday for the first time in months.
According to sources privy to the development, the five judges maintained a reserved demeanour during Wednesday’s interaction, but appeared noticeably more relaxed during Thursday’s gathering.

Speaking at the Pakistan Business Summit, he noted that issues such as child stunting, poverty, and climate change were directly affecting the country’s long-term productivity and global standing.
The summit, held under the patronage of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, brought together policymakers, business leaders, and corporate executives to discuss Pakistan’s economic outlook, innovation, and global competitiveness. It was co-hosted by Nutshell Group and Al Baraka Bank, with the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) as a strategic partner.
The finance minister emphasised the government’s commitment to fostering an environment where the private sector could drive economic growth. He stated that the government’s role is to ensure macroeconomic stability, implement structural reforms, and create the right conditions for business and investment.

Outlines steps to foster private sector growth, boost remittances

Reviewing recent economic developments, Senator Aurangzeb highlighted a significant drop in financing costs following a reduction in the policy rate, an improvement in foreign exchange reserves, and stability in the exchange rate. These factors, he said, had bolstered investor confidence and facilitated the repatriation of dividends and profits.
The minister also reported a notable increase in remittances, which reached $38 billion last year and were projected to rise to between $41bn and $43bn in the current fiscal year. He pointed out that Pakistan had successfully repaid $500 million in Eurobond obligations in September, without causing market disruption, and was well-positioned to meet the upcoming $1.3bn repayment in April 2026.
 
 

Aurangzeb reaffirmed the government’s commitment to comprehensive tax reforms, aiming to separate tax policy from tax administration in order to restore credibility and consistency for investors. He also stressed that reforms in state-owned enterprises, privatisation efforts, and energy pricing were critical elements of the country’s economic agenda.
The minister further discussed Pakistan’s export-led growth strategy, tariff reforms to reduce duties on raw materials and intermediate goods, and measures to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). He cited recent engagements in Beijing, Riyadh, Washington, and New York as signs of renewed investor confidence, which included the signing of 24 joint venture agreements with Chinese companies.
He concluded by stressing that Pakistan’s path to sustainable growth hinges on increased competitiveness, private sector dynamism, and stronger coordination between the federal and provincial governments.
He also highlighted the importance of effectively utilising the Rs4.3tr national development budget, particularly for infrastructure, health, and education.
Minister Aurangzeb affirmed the government’s resolve to guide Pakistan toward sustainable economic recovery, global competitiveness, and resilience.

Peshawar police said an improvised explosive device went off near a police patrolling party in the Garhi Qamardin area. They added the blast injured four policemen, including Sub-Inspector Shah Faisal, constables Sajjad and Noorul­lah, and the van’s driver Zia, along with five civilians.
Separately, a civilian was killed and two policemen were injured in militant attacks in Lakki Marwat district.
Unidentified armed motorcyclists ambushed Shahbazkhel police station SHO Zahid Khan, who was travelling with police constable, Afsar Khan, and his friend Farhad, near a hotel on the Indus Highway late on Wednesday night. The attack left Farhad dead on the spot, while constable Afsar Khan was seriously wounded.
Another cop was injured in a fierce gunfight with militants in the Paharkhel Pacca area of the district.

• Barter trade rules with Afghanistan, Iran, Russia overhauled to ease B2B flows              
ISLAMABAD: The Economic Co­­or­dination Committee (ECC) on Thursday approved about Rs24 billion in supplementary grants for security-related exp­enditures and ordered a rationalised plan for immediate costs linked to reopening the Roosevelt Hotel in New York.
The ECC meeting, presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb, also approved a barter trade mechanism for business-to-business (B2B) operations with Afghanistan, Iran and Russia — the latter two facing US sanctions.
Sources said the Ministry of Defence sought around $17.5 million to meet urgent liabilities at the historic Manhattan property, which could require up to $20m to restart operations pending a joint-venture arrangement through the Privatisation Commission. The hotel’s $200m lease with New York City, under which it housed migrants, was terminated earlier this year.
The ECC directed Pakistan International Airlines Investment Limited (PIA-IL) to hold separate deliberations with the Ministry of Finance to rationalise their demand, which appeared exaggerated to the committee members. It considered a summary submitted by the Ministry of Defence regarding financial support in the form of a Technical Supplementary Grant (TSG) to the Roosevelt Hotel. It expressed support for addressing the most urgent financial requirements of the hotel and directed the ministry to revisit and reconfirm its estimates and resubmit the matter, an official statement said.
Separately, the Privatisation Commis­sion is advancing a long-term joint venture for multi-purpose redevelopment and has received seven requests for proposals. The process was delayed after transaction adviser Jones Lang LaSalle exited in July over a potential conflict of interest; a new adviser is expected to be appointed within two weeks, with the transaction targeted within six months.
Among other decisions, the ECC approved Rs4bn for cash compensation to residents whose land was acquired for the Defence Complex Islamabad, to be arranged by the Finance Division, with the balance to come from the Capital Development Authority.
It also allocated Rs20bn to the Inte­rior Ministry for “maintenance of law and order”, to be released in tranches on demand, and Rs174.8m for law-enforcement requirements of Frontier Corps KP (North), Peshawar.
The ECC also approved a draft SRO at the req­u­­est of the Ministry of Commerce, aimed at amending the B2B Barter Trade Mechanism. Since the introduction of the mechanism in June 2023 for trade with Afghanistan, Iran and Russia, a number of problems have emerged in its implementation.
Sources said the business groups and stakeholders have been complaining about difficulties such as restrictions on sanctioned or non-sanctioned products, the condition of completing imports before exports could take place, etc. These issues slowed down trade and created obstacles for businesses.
To address these concerns, the Ministry of Commerce held detailed consultations with both public and private sector stakeholders, concluding that the list of specific products should be omitted and instead aligned with the general Export and Import Policy Orders.

The ad, issued by the Ministry of Information on Oct 1 and 2, appeared to warn social media users of an “enemy hiding behind the veil of technology and the internet”.
According to the ad, “Sometimes disguised as a reporter, sometimes as an NGO worker or freelancer, he extracts sensitive information from you that brings unrest, fear, and chaos to our streets.”
“Whoever wrote, designed and approved this ad has endangered the lives of journalists and civil society workers by depicting them as threats to national security. At a time when the media is already under intense pressure, this narrative is reckless and dangerous,” Freedom Network said in a statement released on Thursday.
The organisation expressed serious concern over the ad’s reference to reporters, freelancers, and civil society organisations, calling it “deeply troubling”.
The statement said it stigmatises journalists, undermines independent media, and amounts to a direct attack on press freedom guaranteed under Article 19.
Freedom Network further warned that the ad fuels hostility against individuals who deliver reliable information to the public.
The statement warned the campaign further endangers journalists already facing threats, harassment, and violence.
The half-page advertisement carried the headline: “Have you ever wondered what war looks like today?” It went on to declare: “Today, war is no longer fought on the battlefield. It is fought in our minds. The enemy’s bullets are no longer gunpowder … it’s information.”
The statement said the ad comes amid growing government pressure on social media, especially after an opposition leader’s jailing, adding that the crackdown on dissent has intensified nationwide.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the Women’s Action Forum (Lahore), Shirkat Gah-Women’s Resource Centre, South Asia Partnership-Pakistan, Simorgh, and the Centre for Legal Aid, Assistance and Settlement (CLAAS) have also strongly condemned the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s advertisement.

Visuals aired on DawnNewsTV showed policemen armed with batons attacking journalists on the press club premises. Visuals shared on social media also showed police dragging journalists out of what appeared to be the cafeteria.

Another video shared by a Dawn.com correspondent showed a journalist holding his broken Nikon camera and his shirt ripped across the back.
A statement issued by Naqvi stated that he had taken notice of the “unfortunate” incident and demanded a report from the Islamabad inspector general of police.
“Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” he was quoted as saying. “Disciplinary action must be taken against officials involved in the incident,” he said.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) President Afzal Butt held a press conference alongside Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry at the National Press Club.
He said that during the police raid, when the press club’s office-bearers tried to intervene and resolve the matter, they were “beaten and tortured”.
“They even arrested two people, who were later released,” Butt added.
He added that multiple people at the scene pointed out that they had to get the police to release them. “Today’s incident is a matter of now or never for us,” Butt said.
He announced that the PFUJ had called an “emergency session”, where “we will consult and chalk out our demands about what the government needs to do to prevent what the police did today.
“We will also decide our course of action and announce it after the meeting.”
Butt said, “We always avoid confrontation with political parties. Our friends were very angry … but I controlled them … Something like this has never happened before.
“That you enter a photographer’s house — the press club is their second home […] that you enter his home without permission, beat him and break his camera and mobile phone. This has never happened before.”
 


Butt alleged that even the members of the press club’s management and its office-bearers were “beaten”.
“This is not only the Islamabad press club’s issue. Press clubs across Pakistan are of the view that if they turn a blind eye to this worst of the worst incident, similar incidents could happen in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta.
“That is why we will first consult our friends here and then across Pakistan. We will then decide our plan of action and put forward our demands.”
For his part, Chaudhry said he condemned the incident and apologised for it. “Please consider this when you hold your meeting,” he said, assuring that he was also ready to meet them again after their meeting.
Chaudhry’s office also issued a statement unconditionally apologising for the incident, adding that it happened “suddenly”.
“Some people from the [JAAC] were protesting [and] some of their people had manhandled police personnel,” the statement read. “When they tried to arrest these people, the police chased them. The police came to the Press Club to arrest the protesters who misbehaved with [officers].”
The statement added that Chaudhry had ordered an internal inquiry into the incident.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar called the incident “regrettable” in a statement, vowing that a comprehensive investigation would be carried out.
“Interior Minister Naqvi did not order police to enter the press club,” he was quoted as saying. “The National Press Club is my home and I stand with it,” he said.
Journalist bodies held another press conference at the NPC later, where Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists President Tariq Virk said journalists across the country stood united after the police raid at NPC.
He alleged that “Islamabad police personnel had not come to the press club on their own accord but were sent here”.
“They inflicted violence on journalists inside the press club. They even tortured and arrested an ailing employee of the club,” he alleged, vowing to “adopt such a plan of action” that nobody would resort to this “rogue behaviour” in future.
PFUJ President Butt said today was one of the “darkest days in Pakistan’s history”.
“The attack on the National Press Club was an attack on media freedom,” he said, adding that members of journalist bodies had participated in the meeting held after the police raid. “We will prepare a strategy after consulting all journalist bodies.”
Butt further stated that journalists in other cities had also protested the raid at NPC and that “if the National Press Club was not safe from police, then no other press club was”. Butt reiterated his allegation that cameras and mobile phones were snatched and broken during the incident.
He announced that a “black day” would be observed across the country tomorrow, and black flags would be hoisted at the press clubs all across Pakistan.
“The journalists are very angry at the moment. It has been suggested that we get first information reports registered in which some bigwigs are nominated,” he said.
Journalist’s account of raid
Journalist Shiraz Gardezi, who is associated with Geo News and also the senior joint secretary of the NPC, shared an account of the raid with Dawn.com.
Gardezi said the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) — which has also been holding demonstrations in Azad Kashmir — had issued a call for a protest at the press club. “As soon as the demonstration began, they (police) surrounded the protesters,” he narrated.
Gardezi, who was at the NPC to cover the protest, said police stopped them from doing so. “Because they were torturing, beating and dragging people,” he alleged, adding that they even tried to snatch mobile phones and cameras from some of the journalists.
According to him, they even dragged and tried to take away some of the journalists with them, but they were let go after some other journalists intervened.
“We then asked the journalists to stay on the back foot and keep themselves safe,” he said.
Later, he continued, “We heard loud bangs while sitting inside the press club. They (police) kicked the doors open and stormed inside”.
Shirazi narrated that the police broke various things in the cafeteria and “beat and tortured” people. This time, too, the police tried to take away some journalists, but they were “rescued”.
Police raid termed ‘terrorism’
In a joint statement, the PFUJ, Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors and Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors termed the police raid at the NPC “terrorism”.
They also demanded immediate action against those “involved in the incident”.
The statement said journalist organisations saw this incident as a continuation of a series of actions ongoing against journalists.
It highlighted that for the past few days, advertisements were being run under the title of ‘Have you ever thought what the state of war is?’ They alleged that “government” was behind these advertisements. “Threatening tone is used in these advertisements, and reporters, freelancers and social organisations related to the media are listed as anti-state. Its objective is to tarnish the character of journalists, pressurise them and curb the freedom of expression.”
The journalists’ bodies demanded that the publication of these advertisements should immediately stop.
They also expressed the view that the “excessive use” of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act had proved the concerns of multiple journalists to be true. “The act is being used to employ all tactics for suppressing government critics and curbing the freedom of expression,” they alleged.
The Lahore Press Club also issued a condemnatory statement, demanding from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that police personnel involved in the raid be immediately suspended and arrested. The statement said strict legal action should be taken against them, otherwise journalists across Pakistan would stage protests.
‘Shameful and condemnable’
The incident also sparked outrage on social media as journalists decried the assault. In a post on X, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) condemned the “assault on journalists by Islamabad police” at the National Press Club.
“HRCP strongly condemns the raid on the National Press Club and [the] assault on journalists by the Islamabad police,” the rights group wrote in a post on X. “We demand an immediate inquiry and those responsible brought to book.”
 






Journalist Hamid Mir stated that police were trying to arrest members of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) and that they had “targeted journalists present in the cafeteria”.
 






“This is totally uncalled for and condemnable,” said journalist Syed Talat Hussain.
“As if there aren’t enough fronts open. To treat the National Press Club as a criminal hideout and then use violence on its premises is madness without any method,” he said.
 






Journalist Matiullah Jan condemned the incident in a post on X, calling it “extremely shameful and condemnable”.
“This incident is [a product] of the incompetence and cowardice of the club administration,” Jan wrote. “The press club is the home of journalists, where it is disgraceful for the police to barge into the cafeteria with batons and attack people,” he said.
 






Journalist Anas Mallick, who works with TV channel Asia One, alleged that police had raided the club to arrest Kashmiri journalists covering a “call to protest” by the JAAC, adding that the police were “acting like thugs”.
 






Journalist Zebunnisa Burki called visuals emerging from the raid “insane” and added that journalists were being attacked by police inside the press club itself.
 






PTI MNA from Malakand, Junaid Akbar, also condemned the raid.
“Islamabad police storming the National Press Club and their violence against Kashmiri protesters and journalists is shameful and condemnable. An attack on the press club is an attack on the freedom of expression,” he said in a post on X.
 






Veteran journalist Mazhar Abbas said the police action at the NPC reminded him of the days of military dictators Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf.
“This act, rather an attack, on the Press Club, baton-charge and arrest, including some employees of the club, is simply unacceptable,” he wrote on X.
 






Human rights defender Tahira Abdullah called the incident “shocking,” stressing that a mere verbal apology from federal government representatives was unacceptable, especially when paired with the routine promises of an “inquiry.”
She demanded concrete measures, including the arrest and prosecution of all police personnel involved, along with their superiors who ordered the action; a written apology from the federal interior minister with a guarantee that such violations of press clubs and journalists would never be repeated; and compensation to cover the replacement of damaged cameras, equipment, and furnishings at the NPC.
Prominent human rights lawyer Muhammad Jibran Nasir said that the “government apologised because it was journalists in general who got assaulted in the presence of cameras”.
 






“But they came hunting for activists supporting the protest in AJK. Imagine the barbarity inflicted upon them in the clashes in the past four days. You being a citizen does not matter. You being essential to the State’s cause matters. The State has never apologised for abducting, assaulting and arresting journalists who oppose State policies,” he wrote on X.

Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the CB through a short order on June 26 had overturned the July 12, 2024, majority judgment by declaring the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and the provincial assemblies.
In its detailed verdict issued on Thursday, 10 judges of the 12-judge CB held that there was no justification in giving relief to the PTI under Article 187, especially when appeals were filed and pursued by the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) under Article 185 (3) of the Constitution.
The facts and circumstances of this case did not require application of Article 187, the detailed judgment said, adding that the exercise of authority purportedly under Article 187 to grant relief to a party that was not before the court, to remove from office MNAs and MPAs who had been declared elected and who were not before the court, and to issue declarations and directives that were outside the scope of the statutory or constitutional authority of this court, was not warranted.
The July 12 judgment, being in excess of the jurisdiction vested in the Supreme Court and being contrary to the statutory and constitutional provisions, suffers from errors apparent on the face of the record which float on the surface, the CB observed in its detailed verdict, adding that it therefore had to be set aside.
Apex court must stay within its limits
The apex court, the Constitutional Bench explained, enjoys the jurisdiction to interpret the statutes and the Constitution and its authority remains absolute insofar it remains within limits.
It cannot be called into question by any other department of government or even by another constitutional institution, be it the legislature or the executive, it said, while stressing that the authority to interpret the law and the Constitution does not confer the authority to the top court to rewrite the Constitution or the law.
The CB emphasised that the will of the legislature and the Constitution-makers has to be respected and given effect to. It cannot be negated or usurped by the judiciary by scribing artificial meanings to the clear language of the Constitution or by derogating from the plain meaning of its words.
Any court or judge, including the Supreme Court judges, has no jurisdiction to read their personal likes and dislikes into the Constitution or to ignore or circumvent its commands, the detailed judgement said. The power to interpret is a very wide and formidable power indeed but that power is negated, not enhanced, when the court proceeds, under its guise, to rewrite the Constitution, the CB ruled.
Explaining its stance further, the CB said the July 12 judgment ignored the rights of the returned candidates who were elected on reserved seats in the National Assembly and later took oath. Thus, they enjoy a number of protections as returned candidates under the Constitution and the Elections Act, 2017, but were disregarded, the CB regretted.
These rights ensure that their election could not have been declared void, except through an election petition. Moreover, the review petitioners and several other returned candidates on reserved seats were not a party to the proceedings before the apex court; besides, no one had challenged the election of the petitioners before the court.
The premise for this exercise of authority without any constitutional mooring was that election disputes are not between candidates but are matters that concern the constituency and the nation, the CB explained, adding this was clearly contrary to the explicit language of Article 225 of the Constitution.
It had been observed in the July 12 judgment, the CB observed, that an election case could not be equated to “an ordinary civil case” and “the proceedings therein are inquisitorial in nature.”
The proceedings before the court were two civil appeals under Article 185 of the Constitution, the CB stated in the detailed order. These were adversarial proceedings and were being litigated between parties. No Supreme Court judgment supported the proposition and none was cited in support of the novel proposition that election disputes were inquisitorial not adversarial and were adjudicated and decided as civil disputes, the CB observed.
The CB also held that the order of quashing the notification of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of May 13, 2024, and undoing the election of the notified persons cannot be sustained in law and under the Constitution and is accordingly set aside.
The dissenting note
Meanwhile, Justice Ayesha A Malik and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, who had earlier dismissed the review petitions in liminie, in a six-page note expressed reservations to the constitution of the CB hearing the review petitions.
Originally, the review petition was heard by a 13-judge bench, of which five judges including Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, were available yet they were not included in the bench.
This exclusion is based on Article 191A of the Constitution inserted through the 26th Amendment, which requires the formation of CBs, the note said, adding that the excluded judges were not nominated for CB by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
The note stressed that the JCP, which was established under the Constitution must uphold and safeguard the basic principles and values of the Constitution which include the independence of the judiciary.
The JCP functions within a constitutional scheme predicated upon the rule of law, separation of powers and supremacy of the Constitution, the note said, adding that it was incumbent upon members of the JCP to discharge their functions with integrity and in a manner that exemplifies constitutional propriety ensuring that the independence and integrity of the judiciary is always protected and maintained.
A corresponding constitutional duty is also placed on three-judge committee formed under Article 191A that fixes cases before the CB. When the Constitution of the bench give rise to doubts about fairness, the legitimacy of the entire process is called into question, the note said.</p><small>2025-10-02 18:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0214275745128e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946085/pampg-says-it-is-winding-down-operations-in-pakistan-will-rely-on-third-party-distributors' target='_blank'><strong>P&G says it is winding down operations in Pakistan, will rely on ‘third-party distributors’</strong></a><br><p>American multinational corporation Procter & Gamble said on Thursday that the company would wind down its manufacturing and commercial activities in Pakistan and rely on third-party distributors to continue to serve customers in the country as part of the consumer product group’s global restructuring programme.
“We will continue to operate the business in the ordinary course until the process is complete, which may take several months,” said a statement by P&G.
“Supporting this company decision, P&G Pakistan and the supporting regional teams will begin transition planning immediately, with a focus first on P&G people,” it added.
 
 

According to the statement, employees whose roles are impacted by this decision will be “considered for opportunities in other P&G operations outside Pakistan or will be offered separation packages” in accordance with local laws, company policies, and P&G’s values and principles.
In Pakistan, a number of brands are under the P&G umbrella, including Pampers, Ariel, Always, Safeguard, Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Olay, and Vicks.
Meanwhile, Gillette Pakistan, a subsidiary of P&G, said it would evaluate a potential delisting following a decision by its parent to discontinue its business in Pakistan.
It plans to convene a board meeting shortly to evaluate the actions required for this business discontinuation, including the potential delisting from the Pakistan Stock Exchange, the company said in a filing.
Reacting to the news, former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants Pakistan (ICAP) Asad Ali Shah termed P&G’s exit as “another red flag for investment climate”.
“Procter & Gamble’s decision to leave Pakistan underscores a deeper truth: doing business here has become increasingly unviable — not just for multinationals, but for investors of all kinds,” he posted on X.
“When global giants pack up, it signals that our policy unpredictability, currency risks, and regulatory chaos have outweighed market potential,” he said, adding that this was not about one company but about the growing perception that “Pakistan punishes investment instead of protecting it”.

In 2015, the Economic Coordination Council (ECC) banned the export of donkey hides in the country in view of the sale of donkey meat under the guise of beef and mutton in different cities.
According to the commerce ministry notification, the export of donkey hides shall be allowed only to those “firms [and] companies manufacturing in designated, approved [or] registered donkey slaughterhouses located in [the] Gwadar Free Zone only”.
The notification also stated that the ban on exporting donkey hides would be “omitted” from the Export Policy Order.
Last July, the Senate Standing Committee on Commerce was informed that protocols to export donkey skins and meat to China had been finalised, along with the export of onions, potatoes and chillies.
However, in August this year, a consultative workshop on the role of working equines in supporting livelihoods and addressing emerging threats to donkeys, horses and mules found that of the 55.5 million donkeys in the world, 6 million are killed annually across the globe.
Besides recognising the role of working equines in sustaining the livelihoods of poor and marginalised communities, the workshop also aimed to raise awareness of the ongoing welfare challenges and the emerging threat of the donkey skin trade in Pakistan.</p><small>2025-10-02 18:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/02142812ccc9cdf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946116/indias-siraj-bumrah-strike-as-west-indies-dismissed-for-162-in-ahmedabad-test' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Siraj, Bumrah strike as West Indies dismissed for 162 in Ahmedabad Test</strong></a><br><p>Red-hot Mohammed Siraj returned figures of 4-40 as India dismissed the West Indies for 162 and then turned the screw with the bat on day one of the first Test on Thursday.
The hosts were 121-2 at stumps with KL Rahul unbeaten on 53 in front of a sparse crowd at the world’s biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.
Rahul reached his 20th Test fifty and stood firm along with skipper Shubman Gill, on 18, at close of play.
A depleted West Indies won the toss but the Indian attack struck regular blows to bowl out the visitors in 44.1 overs in the second session.
 






Siraj drew first blood with the wicket of Tagenarine Chanderpaul for a duck and extended his tally of Test wickets to 27 this year, having played a key role in India’s 2-2 draw in England.
“The England series gave me a lot of confidence,” Siraj said. “It was a competitive cricket series in England against a strong side, so to perform there gives you added confidence.”
On the comparatively inexperienced West Indies batting line-up, Siraj said: “I had to work hard for my wickets just like I did in England. I was denied a five-wicket haul,” he said with a chuckle.
After an initial first spell of 3-19 in seven overs, Siraj returned in the second session to get one more wicket and was ably supported by fellow quick Jasprit Bumrah.
Number seven Justin Greaves top-scored for the West Indies with 32 before being bowled by Bumrah, who took three wickets.
Skipper Roston Chase (24) and Shai Hope attempted to revive the innings after the West Indies slipped to 42-4 in the first hour of play.
‘We have to improve’
Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav bowled Hope for 26 to end the 48-run fifth-wicket stand at the stroke of lunch. He got his second to send back Jomel Warrican for eight and wrap up the innings. Early tea was called.
“Obviously, we have to improve,” vice-captain Warrican said of his team’s batting. “We, as a batting unit, have to come together to score more runs on the board.”
 






West Indies were swept 3-0 at home by Australia this year and were bowled out for 27 in the third match, the second-lowest score in Test history.
They have been forced into late changes after injuries to pace bowlers Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph, and are a pale shadow of the team that once dominated cricket.
India are strongly tipped to sweep the two-match series.
The Indian openers started the reply cautiously before Rahul and the left-handed Yashasvi Jaiswal got going in a session interrupted by a brief spell of rain.
West Indies pace spearhead Jayden Seales had Jaiswal caught behind for 36 and Chase trapped Sai Sudharsan lbw for seven with his off-spin.</p><small>2025-10-02 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/02200910e66d5bf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946141/in-letter-to-commonwealth-lawyers-activists-express-concern-over-delayed-election-report' target='_blank'><strong>In letter to Commonwealth, lawyers, activists express concern over delayed election report</strong></a><br><p>A letter signed by 130 activists, lawyers, and journalists was submitted to the Commonwealth Secretariat on Thursday, expressing concern over the release of a Commonwealth Observer Group’s (COG) report on the 2024 General Elections after a 19-month delay.
The COG report, released earlier this week, cited “restrictions that curtailed fundamental political rights and hindered one party’s ability to contest fairly”. It also flagged the election-night suspension of cellular services, which undermined transparency and delayed results.
The letter, which has been shared by some of the signatories on social media, expressed grave concern over the “extraordinary” delay in the report’s publication, noting that election reports are published routinely without any delay.
 






“We are not aware that any other COG report has been published 10 months after transmittal of the final report to the Secretariat by the relevant observer group,” the letter read.
The letter noted that in 2013, the general election report was published on June 19 — only 39 days after polling — while in 2018, the report was published within the same year.
“More recent reports for other countries were all published earlier, despite Pakistan’s election having taken place prior,” the letter added. “These include Sri Lanka (published December 2024), Ghana (published March 2025), and Trinidad and Tobago (published July 2025).
“We note that the official report has only now been published by the Commonwealth Secretariat on September 30, following the publication of a leaked copy of the report by an independent news platform, Dropsite News on September 13.”
The reports were both submitted to the secretariat on November 20, 2024, and were signed by all fifteen members of the COG, indicating that the report was finalised and transmitted but was “withheld from the public for 10 months for reasons that require explanation”.
 
 

The letter further noted that withholding the report violated Section 6.3 (the Chair will issue a preliminary statement within 48 hours after polling) of the Revised Commonwealth Guidelines and Section 6.7 (final report) of the Commonwealth Handbook on Election Observation. According to these regulations, election reports “shall be issued in a timely manner … and then made public”.
Moreover, on September 14, the Commonwealth issued a statement acknowledging that the letter had been shared with the federal government and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
“This damning admission that the report was shared with the perpetrators of election fraud but withheld from the victims of that fraud — Pakistani voters, opposition parties and civil society — constitutes a betrayal of the Commonwealth Charter’s commitments to democracy and human rights, and undermines the credibility of election observation itself,” the letter stated.
“The report confirmed that ‘decisions by key institutions consistently limited the ability of one particular party to contest the elections. Ultimately, these decisions impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process,’” the letter read.
Other “worrying observations” made by the signatories included restrictions on fundamental political rights, such as freedom of association; reduced transparency in the electoral process due to telecommunications blackouts; discrepancies in polling results; limiting journalistic freedoms; and the mass arrests of PTI members.
Additionally, the report noted the COG was “immensely concerned by allegations [of judicial interference] and by the possibility that such interference may have occurred in relation to election-related court cases”.
“The foremost duty of the Commonwealth Secretariat in this matter is to uphold the democratic rights of the people of its member state the people of Pakistan,” the letter read.
“Instead, the secretariat has harmed democratic accountability and denied millions of Pakistani citizens the opportunity to seek redress for violations of their democratic rights by withholding the election report for 19 months.”
The letter urged the Commonwealth Secretariat to take the following measures:

Commission an independent inquiry into the 19-month delay in publishing the report
Adopt a policy to automatically publish observer reports within a fixed timeframe
Refer this issue to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group and place it on the agenda at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting
Issue an unequivocal apology to the people of Pakistan for “failing them at a critical moment in their history”

In September, the PTI had called on the COG to release this report, claiming that it laid bare “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting of PTI and its founder, Imran Khan”.
However, in a statement issued on September 14, the COG said it was aware that a version of its report on the 2024 Pakistan general elections was circulating online, but that they did not comment on leaked documents as a matter of policy.
“The government and the Election Commission of Pakis­tan have already received the report. The full report, as we had communicated earlier, will be released later this month, along with a number of COG reports currently in the publication pipeline,” the COG statement said.</p><small>2025-10-02 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/022038316e9287b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946146/karachi-civil-society-protests-detention-of-pakistani-activists-onboard-gaza-flotilla-demands-release' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi civil society protests detention of Pakistani activists onboard Gaza flotilla, demands release</strong></a><br><p>Civil society and advocacy groups gathered on Thursday outside the Karachi Press Club to protest against the detention of activists aboard the Gaza Sumud Flotilla (GSF), calling on the government to demand the release of the Pakistani delegation, led by former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan.
On Wednesday, the GSF, carrying aid to Gaza in its attempt to break Israel’s blockade, was intercepted by Israeli military forces. On board the GSF were over 400 activists from 40 countries, among them a five-member delegation from Pakistan.
Thursday’s demonstration, organised by the Pakistan Palestine Forum (PFF) in collaboration with the Palestine Action Coalition (PAC) and the non-profit organisation Human Rights Council of Pakistan, aimed to mobilise the public against the state’s inaction.
People of all ages gathered, chanting slogans for a free Palestine. The demonstrators demanded the immediate release of the detained Pakistanis and called on the government to take concrete action against Israel.
“It is the responsibility of the government to ensure the safe return of the Pakistani delegation on board the GSF,” said Jamshed Hussain of the Human Rights Council of Pakistan while addressing the crowd.
Hussain recalled that his group, along with PPF, had initially urged the government to facilitate the flotilla, anticipating Israel’s attack; however, “our concerns were ignored,” he said.
“The five Pakistanis on board are our national heroes,” Hussain said, lamenting that “while governments of Italy and France sent fleets to ensure the safe passage of the flotilla, Pakistan — despite being a muslim country — failed to follow suit”.

Anosha Kausar of the PFF echoed similar concerns, telling Dawn.com that “It was particularly distressing for Pakistanis to embark on such missions since there was very little likelihood of governmental support.” Yet, she remained hopeful that “momentum for the movement is building up”.

Speaking to Dawn.com, Hussain called on the people to “stand united in their demand for the Pakistanis on the GSF to be released and brought back home safely,” vowing to continue the protest “lest they suffer any harm.”
Hussain warned that “by ignoring the plight of the Palestinian people, we are setting a dangerous precedent”.
“We must decide which side of history we will choose to stand on,” he said, expressing disappointment at Pakistan’s endorsement of Trump’s Gaza peace plan.
On Monday, Pakistan hailed Trump’s 20-point plan, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcoming it, drawing ire from the political sphere.

Among the many participants was Noureen, a housewife and a caterer, who felt the government’s inaction had forced “ordinary citizens like her to come out on the streets”.
However, speaking to Dawn.com, Naureen remarked, “As a mother, I can not turn away from the suffering of the Palestinian children, just as I can not see my own children harmed.” While another demonstrator, Ehtaram, who had come to attend with his wife and two children, thought that “we must pressurise our government to take stern action against Israel, the way Colombia did”.
Earlier today, Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered the expulsion of the entire Israeli diplomatic delegation from Colombia, a move triggered by the detention of two Colombian nationals aboard the Gaza aid flotilla.
The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, departed in late August to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza.</p><small>2025-10-02 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0221281129c3bdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946147/bangladesh-cruise-to-win-over-pakistan-in-womens-cricket-world-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh cruise to win over Pakistan in Women’s Cricket World Cup clash</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh kicked off their 2025 Women’s Cricket World Cup campaign in style, cantering past Pakistan’s modest 129 with seven wickets and 18.5 overs to spare in Colombo on Thursday.
Debuting opener Rubya Haider announced herself with an unbeaten half-century, steering the chase with the composure of a seasoned pro as Bangladesh barely broke sweat in pursuit of the below-par target.
But it was their bowlers who set the tone.
Lone seamer Marufa Akter struck with a double blow in her very first over — two wickets in successive balls — before a spin web tightened the screws on a hesitant Pakistan line-up.
“We are thrilled to get a win under our belt in our first outing,” said Marufa.
“There was a lot of support from my teammates. Special credit to our team analyst who fed me with some valuable input leading into the game.
“We showed lot of energy on the field and we take lot of positives from this game.”
With a rich spin arsenal at their disposal, Bangladesh never let Pakistan off the hook.
Left-arm spinner Nahida Akter snared two quick wickets to leave the opposition tottering at 47-4 inside 14 overs, before leg-spinner Shorna Akter came on to deliver the final nails on the coffin.
Bowling with metronomic accuracy, she cleaned up the tail, returning remarkable figures of 3-5 in 3.3 overs without conceding a run in her first three overs.
Then, Rubya anchored the chase, her half-century carved through cut shots that threaded the gap between point and cover. She looked particularly strong square of the wicket, never needing to go aerial.
Pakistan, by contrast, produced a limp batting display with only two players crossing 20. They must quickly come to grips with the sluggish Colombo surface, where all their matches will be staged.
One silver lining was the spell of seamer Diana Baig, a double international who has also donned Pakistan colours in football.
Her late inswingers kept Bangladesh’s batters guessing, but with no scoreboard pressure to defend, her efforts weren’t enough.
“We just lost too many wickets early on and never recovered,” Pakistan captain Fatima Sana said. “We need to put this defeat behind us now and bounce back stronger. We have a lot of young players in our ranks and the World Cup is their first big tournament and hopefully they will learn from the mistakes.“</p><small>2025-10-02 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/02141141bd3aa04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946087/israels-interception-of-gaza-flotilla-draws-global-ire-as-pakistan-demands-release-of-detained-activists' target='_blank'><strong>Israel’s interception of Gaza flotilla draws global ire as Pakistan demands release of detained activists</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and several other countries on Thursday condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) after its forces intercepted the flotilla heading to break Israel’s siege of Gaza and deliver aid.
Hours after Tel Aviv’s move drew global condemnation, the Israeli foreign ministry posted on X that all on board the flotilla were safe would be “deported to Europe”.
The statement said: “The Hamas-Sumud provocation is over. None of the Hamas-Sumud provocation yachts has succeeded in its attempt to enter an active combat zone or breach the lawful naval blockade.
“All the passengers are safe and in good health. They are making their way safely to Israel, from where they will be deported to Europe.”
It added that one last vessel of “this provocation remains at a distance. If it approaches, its attempt to enter an active combat zone and breach the blockade will also be prevented”.
 






Earlier, the flotilla said that Israeli forces began intercepting the flotilla’s latest bid to reach Gaza late last night. Israel intercepted 39 boats with foreign activists on board to Gaza, leaving only one vessel still sailing towards the Palestinian enclave, the flotilla organisers said.
The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. Former Pakistani senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was also on board.
‘Dastardly attack’
In a post on X during the early hours of Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said: “Pakistan strongly condemns the dastardly attack by Israeli forces on the 40 vessel Samud Gaza flotilla, carrying over 450 humanitarian workers from 44 countries. We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release.“
“Their crime was to carry aid for the hapless Palestinian people,” he said. “This barbarity must end. Peace must be given a chance, and humanitarian aid must reach those in need,” the premier asserted.
 






In another post later in the day, he commended the presence of Pakistanis, including former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, on the Global Sumud Flotilla.
They participated in this “great aid mission in line with the principles of humanity”, he said, adding that their initiative reflected Pakistanis’ “peace-loving aspirations, struggle for justice, spirit of helping those in need”, he said.
The PM added that the Pakistan government supported the “principles of respect for human life … and uninterrupted aid. It demands the return of its citizens. It is trying and prays for their safety, dignity, and earliest possible return to the country”.
 






Strong-worded condemnations also poured in from other countries — including the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Turkiye, Spain, Colombia, Brazil and South Africa — with some voicing concern for their citizens part of the mission and held by Israel.
Malaysia’s PM Anwar Ibrahim said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister, as well as the Turkish and Egyptian presidents, to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained“.
Turkiye announced that it had opened an investigation concerning “24 Turkish citizens arrested following the attack carried out by elements of the Israeli navy in international waters“.
South Africa called on Israel to release all activists, including Nelson Mandela’s grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile “Mandla” Mandela.
Cameras broadcasting live feeds from the boats, verified by Reuters, showed Israeli soldiers sporting helmets and night vision goggles boarding the ships, while passengers huddled together in life vests with their hands up.
 


A video from the Israeli foreign ministry showed Thunberg, the most prominent of the flotilla’s passengers, sitting on a deck surrounded by soldiers.
According to a tracker on the Global Sumud Flotilla’s website, one of its boats, named Mikeno, had entered Gaza’s territorial waters and was still sailing.
The Palestinian foreign ministry spokesperson condemned the interception of the flotilla as a violation of international law, asserting that Israel had neither authority nor sovereignty over Palestinian “territorial waters”, including those off the coast of the Gaza Strip.
 






Israel’s interception of the flotilla sparked protests in Italy and Colombia, while protests were also called in Greece, Ireland and Turkiye. Italian unions called a general strike for Friday.
At 10:55am PKT, the Israeli foreign ministry said that the detained individuals “were making their way safely and peacefully to Israel, where their deportation procedures to Europe will begin”.
“The passengers are safe and in good health,” it insisted.

The flotilla had earlier vowed to press on with its bid to deliver aid to the devastated coastal territory despite intimidation tactics by the Israeli military.
It said on X that it remained “vigilant as we enter the area where the previous flotillas were intercepted and/or attacked”.
Israel has blocked similar attempts previously as well. In June, aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces.
Deliberate obstruction of humanitarian relief: FO
Separately, the Foreign Office (FO) also strongly condemned the attack, stating: “The unlawful detention of international activists onboard the flotilla constitutes yet another flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law by Israel, and endangers the lives of innocent civilians.”
Calling it a deliberate attempt to obstruct humanitarian relief in the Palestinian enclave, the FO said: “This reprehensible act is part of Israel’s ongoing pattern of aggression and its illegal blockade of Gaza, which has caused immense human suffering and deprivation for over two million Palestinians.”
 
 

It demanded the “immediate release of all humanitarian workers and activists on board the flotilla”, urging Israel to respect international law. The FO also called on the international community to hold Israel accountable for its “repeated violations of international law”.
“Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support and solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination and for the establishment of a viable, independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” it added.
 






Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called Israel’s actions against the flotilla “a flagrant violation of international law”, demanding the release of the detained activists.
“Pakistan strongly condemns Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla and detention of international activists in flagrant violation of international law. We demand an immediate ceasefire, lifting of the blockade, swift release of activists and unhindered aid to Gaza,“ he wrote on X.
 






Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also condemned the attack, praying for the “safe return of all those aboard the [Sumud] Gaza Flotilla”.
“We strongly condemn the Israeli attack on these peaceful people carrying humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza. Israeli barbarity must end,” the minister said in a post on X.
 






Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani called Israel’s move an act of “state terrorism and barbaric savagery”, urging the international community to take notice.
In a statement issued by his office, Gilani described the assault as “a blatant violation of international law, humanitarian principles, and the dignity of mankind,” adding that the attack has left a “permanent stain on the conscience of the international community”.
“The only ‘crime’ of these innocent and selfless individuals was that they sought to stand by the oppressed Palestinians in the spirit of human compassion,” the Senate chairman said.
“Urgent steps must be taken to ensure uninterrupted delivery of food, water, medicines, and other essentials to the people of Gaza, who are enduring immense hardship under siege,” the statement added.
Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad detained
Former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla, was also among those taken by Israeli forces, according to advocacy group Pak-Palestine Forum.
 
 

In a post on X, the group said, “Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan arrested by Israel.”
The advocacy group further wrote: “Only one ship has managed to escape, i.e., [the] observer boat, whose duty was to collect information and escape. Our second delegate, Syed Uzair Nizami, was sailing on the observer boat and shared the information regarding the interception of Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan’s ship.”
 






JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman paid tribute to the activists on board the flotilla, announcing a nationwide protest in a show of solidarity with Gaza.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore, the JI chief said, “We will observe a nationwide protest tomorrow against the attack on the Sumud Gaza Flotilla.”
“We call on our leaders to play their part,” he added.
Former PTI senator Faisal Javed Khan took to X to pray for Khan’s safety, saying, “Let us all condemn the aggression by Israel that has been unleashed upon these peaceful humanitarians, who sought only to deliver aid and amplify the cry for justice.”
 






Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir took to X to laud the “courage” of the activists on board the flotilla.
“They are carrying nothing but courage in their hearts and aid in their ships,” he said, noting that the Israel Defence Force (IDF) has become “emboldened by the failure and cowardice of the global community.”
“Our only hope is ordinary citizens of the world,” he added.
 






Israel faces international backlash
Malaysia
PM Ibrahim also condemned Israel’s interception of the flotilla, saying that Israeli forces had detained eight Malaysians.
“By blocking a humanitarian mission, Israel has shown utter contempt not only for the rights of the Palestinian people but also for the conscience of the world,” Anwar said in a statement.
 






In a later post on X, the Malaysian premier said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister as well as the presidents of Turkiye and Egypt to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained”.
“My team and I have also remained in close contact with other key partners, including the United States Secretary of State [Marco Rubio], to press for urgent intervention without delay.
“I reiterate, in the strongest possible terms, that the atrocities and acts of aggression committed by the Israeli regime must cease immediately,” Anwar added.
He reiterated his demand for the “immediate and unconditional release of all detainees, and for humanitarian aid to be allowed to reach our brothers and sisters in Gaza swiftly and without obstruction”.
 






Turkiye
Turkiye’s foreign ministry called Israel’s “attack” on the flotilla “an act of terror” that endangered the lives of innocent civilians.
The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office said it had launched an investigation into the detention of 24 Turkish citizens on board vessels in the flotilla on charges including deprivation of liberty, seizure of transport vehicles and damage to property, as per Turkiye’s Anadolu Agency.
 






Colombia
Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered the expulsion of Israel’s entire diplomatic delegation on Wednesday following the detention of two Colombians in the flotilla. Israel has not had an ambassador in Colombia since last year.
Petro called the detentions a potential “new international crime” by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and demanded the release of the Colombians. He also terminated Colombia’s free trade agreement with Israel.
 






Britain
The British government remained “very concerned” about Israel’s interception of the aid flotilla, its foreign office said today, adding that it had made clear to Israel that the situation should be resolved safely.
“We are very concerned about the situation with the Sumud flotilla, we are in touch with the families of a number of British nationals involved,” the British foreign office said in a statement.
“The aid carried by the flotilla should be turned over to humanitarian organisations on the ground to be delivered safely into Gaza,” it added.
Spain
Spain summoned Israel’s top representative in Madrid after Israeli forces intercepted a Gaza-bound flotilla carrying activists and humanitarian aid to the devastated Palestinian territory, Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said.
“Today I summoned the charge d’affaires here in Madrid,” Albares told public broadcaster TVE, saying 65 Spaniards were travelling with the flotilla.
 






Brazil
Brazil also issued a condemnation on the Israeli navy’s interception of the flotilla, with several Brazilian nationals on board, including a lawmaker.
The Brazilian foreign ministry said, “[Brazil] deplores the Israeli government’s military action, which violates rights and endangers the physical well-being of peaceful protesters.”
“The responsibility for the safety of those detained now rests with Israel,” it added.</p><small>2025-10-02 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/021617541b5e2c8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946135/mustafa-khokhar-files-appeal-after-sc-registrar-returns-plea-seeking-full-court-hearing-against-26th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Mustafa Khokhar files appeal after SC registrar returns plea seeking full court hearing against 26th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar on Thursday filed an appeal against the Supreme Court (SC) registrar’s decision to return his petition seeking a full court hearing of challe­n­ges against the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
The 26th Amendment, passed on Oct 21, 2024, took away the SC’s suo motu powers and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee to nominate the next chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) from among the three most senior SC judges instead of the senior-most one.
The SC is currently seized with multiple petitions urging the constitution of a full court to hear the matter rather than the Constitutional Bench (CB) formed under the 26th Amendment. The CB is set to resume proceedings on the original appeals on October 7 (Tuesday).
“I’ve filed an appeal against the registrar’s decision to return my petition, seeking justice once again. My petition argues that the majority decision of the Practice & Procedure Committee remains valid in law and cases related to the 26th should only be heard by a full court,” Khokhar said on X.
 






The appeal, filed through Advocate Shahid Jamil Khan, requested the SC to set aside the September 19 decision and “register and entertain the said petition in accordance with law”.
The plea was filed under Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules and named the apex court’s registrar office as a respondent.
The appeal contended that the registrar had “no jurisdiction to determine the maintainability or entertainability of a petition under Article 184(3), as such questions can only be decided by this Hon’ble Court in exercise of its judicial authority”.
It argued that even if a petition appeared non-maintainable under the Constitution, law or the SC Rules, the “issue must be placed before the court for adjudication on the judicial side”.
“The registrar, acting on the administrative side, cannot assume or exercise judicial powers, nor can he refuse to receive or register a petition or appeal on the ground of perceived non-maintainability,” the former senator contended.
 
 

CJP Yahya Afridi had ignored a decision made in October 2024 by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full court, according to minutes of the communication exchange between CJP and two senior SC judges.
The committee, which met on Oct 31, 2024 under the Practice and Procedure Act (PPA) 2023, was convened by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. In response, CJP Afridi, who chairs the committee, said he did not find it appropriate to call for a full court hearing.
In separate minutes dated May 20, 2025, Justice Shah stressed the need for meaningful consultation, which he stated was the core purpose of the PPA. Justice Shah noted that delegating powers to the SC’s registrar was not covered by the act.
Since October 2024, multiple petitions have been filed with the SC challenging the amendment, contending that it “abrogates, repeals, alters and destroys the basic features of the Constitution” and “violates” fundamental rights.
An eight-member CB, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, will resume hearing a set of petitions against the 26th Amendment on Tuesday.
The bench also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.</p><small>2025-10-02 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/021814309970e15.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946124/at-least-2-dead-3-wounded-in-uk-synagogue-attack' target='_blank'><strong>At least 2 dead, 3 wounded in UK synagogue attack</strong></a><br><p>At least two people were killed on Thursday and three badly wounded outside a packed synagogue in Manchester in a car and stabbing attack, with the suspect believed to have been shot dead by UK police.
As the Jewish community marked the holiday of Yom Kippur in the northwestern city, police were called to the incident, activating a national terrorism-response protocol.
The attack struck days ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked a fierce offensive in Gaza, inflaming passions in Britain.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer swiftly condemned the attack as “horrific”, and announced security was being boosted at UK synagogues. He left a European political summit in Denmark early to chair an emergency security meeting in London.
King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla were “deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the horrific attack in Manchester, especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community”.
Greater Manchester Police declared a “major incident” shortly after 9:30 am (1:30pm PKT) after officers were called to the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in the Crumpsall neighbourhood.
 






The force initially said paramedics were treating four people for “injuries caused by both the vehicle and stab wounds” while confirming firearms officers had shot one man “believed to be the offender”.
Within hours, it announced two people had died and the suspected offender shot by officers was “also believed to be deceased”.
Police said the death could not be confirmed due to “suspicious items on his person”, noting a bomb disposal unit was at the scene.
Three people were also in a “serious condition”, police added.
‘Appalled’
Starmer said he was appalled and pledged to “do everything to keep our Jewish community safe”.
“The fact that this has taken place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, makes it all the more horrific,” he added.
Israel’s embassy in the UK said it was “abhorrent and deeply distressing” that “such an act of violence should be perpetrated on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar”.
“The safety and security of Jewish communities in the United Kingdom must be guaranteed,” it added on X.
Police said officers first responded to calls from the public about a car driving into people outside the synagogue, as well as reports that a security guard had been attacked with a knife.
A witness told BBC Radio he saw police shooting a man after a car crash.
“They gave him a couple of warnings, he didn’t listen until they opened fire,” he said. “He went down on the floor, and then he started getting back up, and then they shot him again.”
Police said “a large number of people worshipping at the synagogue … were held inside while the immediate area was made safe” but then evacuated.

‘Holiest Jewish day’
Manchester mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC police had “dealt with it very quickly with some amazing support from members of the public”.
He urged people “not to speculate on social media”, while noting the Jewish community “will be very worried by the news”.
The city, famous around the world for its two Premier League football clubs and industrial history, is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the UK. It totalled more than 28,000 in 2021, according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research.

MP Graham Stringer said the area was home to both large Jewish and Muslim communities.
“By and large community relations are excellent between all the different ethnic groups and religious groups,” he told BBC Radio Manchester.
The Community Security Trust (CST), a Jewish charity that records antisemitic incidents, said it was “working with police and the local Jewish community”.
“This appears to be an appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year,” CST added.
The city has witnessed several deadly terror attacks, notably in 2017 when Salman Abedi detonated a homemade suicide bomb outside an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena. It killed 22 people, some of them children, and injured hundreds more.</p><small>2025-10-02 13:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/02160025752d80a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946126/justice-jahangiri-moves-apex-court-against-shcs-decision-in-degree-case' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Jahangiri moves apex court against SHC’s decision in degree case</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad High Court (IHC) judge Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri on Thursday moved the Supreme Court, challenging the Sindh High Court’s ruling on his degree and seeking to have the verdict declared “null and void”.
In his petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Justice Jahangiri contended that the SHC “dismissed my application to become a party to the case”, adding that passing a “one-sided order without hearing the affected party is contrary to law”.
On September 16, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri then challenged the decision in the SC, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside.
The judge further argued that the SHC “ignored the question of maintainability of the petition”.
According to the petition, the IHC judge urged the apex court that his appeal “may graciously be granted and after granting leave to appeal, this Honourable Court, may graciously set aside the Impugned Order”.
The petition, filed under Article 185(3) of the Constitution, names the province of Sindh and others as respondents. Dr Mohammad Usman Mirza has been appointed as defence counsel by the petitioner.
Fake degree controversy
The controversy began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the KU’s examinations, regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC.
The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016.
It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri.
Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme.
On July 10, 2024, IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.”
As the degree accusations came to light, Daud filed a writ petition, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer.
At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that Daud was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC.
On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its UFM Committee, varsity officials said.
The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree.
Then, on Sept 5 2024, the SHC suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself.
To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person.
On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the SC.
Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.

He made the remarks during an interview with Chinese state-owned broadcaster CGTN that was aired on Thursday. During the interview, the president, who visited China earlier this month, said that all his visits to the neighbouring country were “goodwill visits”.
“My visits are always goodwill visits because China is the future and all of the East will work with China,” he said. Talking about China’s Global Governance Initiative, he said: “Global governance means that I cannot walk into any other country nor any other country [can] walk into me. They have to be respectful about my territory, I shall be respectful of their territory.”
He said that he was bringing international goodwill and the Pakistani people’s goodwill, as well as the assurance that “we stand with China in good times and bad times”.
“Not that I see China going through a bad time, but even then, we are there, in case [we are] needed,” he asserted.
 






Asked whether China and Pakistan could work together to promote the Global Governance Initiative, the president said: “We don’t need a marshal mindset, we need an economical mindset. We need to let the people live and let live.”
Talking about the relationship between the two countries, the president termed Pakistan and China: “All-weather, iron-clad brothers, but […] that we are joined on the hip also.
“That’s how close we are. And that is an opportunity,” he said.
President Zardari further stated that Pakistan has always tried to “help Chinese positions”.
“Wherever I go in the world, my first position is respect China […] for its people, for its technology, for everything,” he said.
Commenting on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) 2.0, President Zardari said: “We are the closest port to China […]. One day, the generations to come will thank Chinese people and Pakistani people [for thinking] about that port.
“That port will be the closest link you have to China,” he said, calling it a “great futuristic project”. He said that once the port would become operational, it would enhance employment opportunities and trade in the area.
“So there is great importance for me to make sure Balochistan is safer,” he said, adding that “economic growth kept nations together”.</p><small>2025-10-02 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/021355201bf6aa2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946109/trump-administration-cuts-energy-projects-freezes-new-york-funding' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration cuts energy projects, freezes New York funding</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration has announced plans to terminate dozens of clean energy projects and freeze billions of dollars for major projects in New York, intensifying a stand-off with Democrats over a United States government shutdown.
US media outlets described the moves announced by the energy and transportation departments as part of the administration’s efforts to pressure Democrats in Congress to agree on a deal to end the shutdown.
US President Donald Trump had raced to enact hard-right policies even before the shutdown began after midnight on Tuesday, threatening mass firings and to slash government departments, and blaming Democrats for Congress’ failure to resolve a funding stand-off.
The Department of Energy announced on Thursday “the termination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects, resulting in a savings of approximately $7.56 billion for American taxpayers”. It said in a statement that those projects — overseen by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and other bodies — “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs … and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars”.
However, recipients of federal funding have 30 days to appeal against a termination decision, and some have already begun the process, the statement said.
It did not list the projects in question.
In a post on social media platform X, Russell Vought, who heads the powerful Office of Management and Budget, called the slashed projects “Green New Scam funding” that was used to advance “the Left’s climate agenda”.
He listed the states affected by the decision. They include California, New York and 14 others — all blue states where Trump failed to win in the 2024 presidential elections.
 






California Governor Gavin Newsom said the Trump administration had decided to cancel “up to $1.2bn” slated for a major hydrogen energy project, threatening tens of thousands of jobs.
“In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned,” Newsom said in a statement, vowing to keep pursuing a “clean energy strategy… no matter what DC tries to dictate.”
In New York — the home state of top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — the Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced on Wednesday it was freezing nearly $18bn in federal funding for two major infrastructure projects, the Second Avenue subway and Hudson Tunnel.
The move takes aim at diversity, equity and inclusion policies, according to the department’s statement, saying that subsidising projects with “race- and sex-based contracting requirements … is unconstitutional, counter to civil rights laws, and a waste of taxpayer resources”.
The funds would be frozen until a “quick administrative review is complete”, it said.
“Thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries shutdown, however, USDOT’s review of New York’s unconstitutional practices will take more time,” it added, saying that the department “has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review”.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement that halting funding for “critical infrastructure projects” was “political payback and an attack on New York”.
“Donald Trump has been clear: he is intent on using his reckless government shutdown to hurt the American people,” she said.</p><small>2025-10-02 09:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0209491317ccb6e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945920/new-force-blood-testing-planned-to-tackle-drug-menace-among-karachi-students' target='_blank'><strong>New force, blood testing planned to tackle drug menace among Karachi students</strong></a><br><p>• ‘Coalition Against Drugs’ to monitor children’s behaviour, attendance, academic performance and social interactions
• Those doing drugs should be treated as victims, not criminals, says Shehzad Roy
KARACHI: The Campus Security and Substance Abuse Watch Force comprising 50 police personnel was established on Wednesday to curb the menace of drugs in educational institutions within the jurisdiction of the South Zone of Karachi police.
A decision to this effect was taken in a consultative meeting of the ‘Coalition Against Drugs’ here. The coalition comprises heads of over 50 academic institutes in Clifton, DHA, Saddar, and other areas, as well as police officials.
It was also decided in the meeting that random blood tests to check for drug abuse among students would be carried out with the consent of their parents.
Speaking to journalists after the meeting, South DIG Syed Asad Raza said that the Campus Security and Substance Abuse Watch Force had been established with 50 personnel including women officers, who would be deployed at different institutes.
He said their uniforms were designed in consultation with the institutes so that their presence would not be domineering, but rather cooperative.
He said the police had consulted with around 150 schools, colleges and universities located in South-Zone to grasp the issue of drug abuse, share responsibilities and devise strategies to tackle the problem.
He said as part of a larger strategy against narcotics, the police were focusing on shisha bars, social media platforms, and courier services, which were allegedly involved in the supply of drugs.
Earlier, during the consultative meeting, singer-turned-activist Shehzad Roy suggested that students involved in drug abuse should be treated as victims, not as criminals.
Sadia Faisal of Karachi Grammar School proposed that an age-appropriate curriculum should be devised at the institutes.
Meanwhile, a statement issued after the meeting said that presence of the new campus force could deter substance abuse. “Collaborative working between police and institution administrators will help in developing strategies for addressing substance misuse.”
The participants of the meeting also decided to develop a curriculum that educates students about the risks and consequences of substance abuse, including its physical and mental health effects.
The special curriculum would also incorporate life skills training to help students resist peer pressure, make informed decisions, and manage stress, it was stated. Awareness campaigns, workshops, and seminars would be organised to educate students, teachers, and parents about substance misuse.
Regarding parents’ awareness and consent for testing, it was decided that parents would be educated about the risks of substance misuse and the importance of regular testing.
The parents’ consent would be obtained for random drug testing, ensuring that the parents were involved in the process. “Support and resources would be provided to parents to address substance misuse issues with their children.”
About random blood testing for drug abuse on the campus, the participants agreed that random drug testing could deter students from substance misuse. “The students would be identified who may be struggling with substance misuse and will be provided with support and resources.”
Besides, it was also decided that teachers would be trained to identify signs of substance misuse among students.
The signs include changes in behaviour and physical symptoms.
They would be equipped with skills to support students who may be struggling with drug abuse and refer them to appropriate resources. The teachers would also be provided with strategies to manage classrooms effectively and promote a positive learning environment.
Moreover, the heads of academic institutes and the police officers agreed that “behavioural changes in students would be monitored”.
“Students should be considered victims, rather than perpetrators,” the participants said.
Students’ behaviour, attendance, academic performance, and social interactions would be monitored. “Frequent collaboration between law enforcement, educators, and administrators would be ensured to develop effective strategies and action plan for addressing substance misuse,” declared the participants.

The development comes days after tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad spilled over onto the cricketing field during the Sept 9-28 Men’s Asia Cup staged in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), when Indian cricketers refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during all three clashes in the tournament. The tensions had culminated in India not accepting the trophy from Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief.
The tournament had seen the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May after India had launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan had denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention.
 
 

Against this backdrop, Pakistan is kicking off its Women’s World Cup campaign today by playing Bangladesh in Colombo. Pakistan will face India in the tournament on Sunday.
According to a report published by BBC Sport on Wednesday, BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia told BBC Stumped — a weekly cricket show — the following: “I cannot forecast anything, but our relationship with that particular hostile country is the same, there is no change in the last week.”
He added, “India will play that match against Pakistan in Colombo, and all cricket protocols will be followed. I can only assure that whatever is in the Marylebone Cricket Club regulations of cricket, that will be done.
“Whether there will be handshakes, whether there will be hugging, I cannot assure you of anything at this moment,” he said.
 
 

Meanwhile, The Indian Express reported while citing BCCI sources that the Indian team had been advised by the board to avoid handshakes with Pakistan’s players before they departed for Sri Lanka.
The sources noted, “The team won’t be shaking hands with the Pakistan team during the World Cup. The team has been informed by the BCCI bosses about this. The Indian board will stand by its players.”
A day earlier, PCB chief Naqvi had refuted claims by Indian media that he had apologised to the BCCI over the trophy handover issue at Sunday’s Asia Cup final.
The closing ceremony of the Asia Cup had descended into farce as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from the ACC chief, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. Indian skipper Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup. Later, Indian media alleged that Naqvi had himself refused to hand the trophy over to the Indian team.
Subsequently, several Indian outlets, including IndiaToday, Financial Express and Hindustan Times, reported that Naqvi had apologised to the BCCI, but that he still refused to hand them the trophy.
Responding to the media reports, Naqvi had stated, “Indian media thrives on lies, not facts. Let me make it absolutely clear: I have done nothing wrong and I have never apologised to the BCCI nor will I ever do so.”
The PCB chairman called the claims “fabricated nonsense” and “cheap propaganda”, saying it was aimed at misleading Indian people. He slammed India for continuing to “drag politics into cricket, damaging the very spirit of the game”.
“As ACC chairman, I was ready to hand over the trophy that very day and I am still ready now,” he said. “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.”</p><small>2025-10-02 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68ddb3b8dfc22.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946001/ppp-calls-on-maryam-to-rethink-her-attitude' target='_blank'><strong>PPP calls on Maryam to ‘rethink her attitude’</strong></a><br><p>• Meeting to end acrimony decides to take up the matter with Punjab CM, her father Nawaz
• Kaira calls BISP ‘transparent aid method’, asks CM not to peddle ‘narrow nationalism’
• Azma hits back, says PPP cannot ‘steady itself’ by targeting PML-N
LAHORE: As PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row sparked by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s recent outburst against the coalition partner, the former has asked the Punjab CM to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights and Sindh’s ruling party.
During the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Law Minister Azam Nazir, Senator Rana Sanaullah and PPP’s Navid Qamar and Ijaz Jakhrani at the NA speaker’s office, it was agreed that the matter would be taken up with PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam Nawaz.
The war of words, which began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River, as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe.
Addressing a press conference, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira urged the CM not to fan ‘narrow nationalism’.
“Differences should be kept within limits. You (Maryam Nawaz) are a woman and our sister, and our leader (Benazir Bhutto) too was a woman. Reconsider your tone.  What do you want to achieve by playing narrow nationalism… Do you want the rest to leave Punjab, and their rights to be ended?”
Flanked by Usman Malik, Chaudhry Aslam Gill, and Faisal Mir, Mr Kaira said the country could not be run by a “single leader or institution”. “This country does not belong to any one person; it belongs to all of us. You (Maryam Nawaz) are not just a CM, you are also the daughter of Nawaz Sharif and the niece of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. If you say that you will not allow anyone to speak, this approach is not appropriate in any way. Reconsider this attitude,” he said.
He further said the floods had caused immense damage, and the entire nation spoke with one voice on this. “Where something is wrong, we will point it out and we will protest. But when we give opinions or criticism, you start threatening. The question concerns flood management, but the response is to target the Sindh government,” he said.
The PPP leader said BISP was even endorsed by the IMF. “It…provides immediate relief, and this was done before as well. If you don’t want to use BISP, fine; but in terms of transparency, BISP stands first, which is why the IMF itself directed that Rs200bn be added to it in this year’s budget. Our objections concern the relief mechanism,” he added.
 
 

In response to the CM’s remarks about the canal project, he said there already existed a formula for water distribution, and the matter must be decided in the Council of Common Interests by the federal and provincial governments together. “The PPP has been unfairly blamed regarding canals.”
PPP South Punjab President Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood said if the Punjab government was criticised, it was because of its failed policies that left the Seraiki belt submerged after floods. “Even in the past, there have been worse floods, yet never before were the people abandoned in such a helpless state,” he said, calling out the government for its ‘choreographed’ response.
Azma’s presser
On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said the PPP leaders were competing to hold press conferences against the Punjab government while claiming they were not politicising the plight of flood victims.
Azma Bokhari further said that the PML-N took pride in “its popularity and public service”, and the PPP should focus on building its own support instead of such rhetoric. “Such statements make no difference, and PPP cannot stand on its own feet this way,” she added.
She said this was not merely political differences but a deliberate attempt to target Punjab collectively. “Personal attacks will naturally invite a response. “You may use BISP in Sindh; we have no objection,” she said.
