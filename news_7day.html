<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10232437947b55d.jpg?r=232443' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923342/passengers-kidnapped-in-sardhaka-rescue-operation-underway-balochistan-govt' target='_blank'><strong>Passengers kidnapped in Sardhaka, rescue operation underway: Balochistan govt</strong></a><br><p>The Balochistan government on Thursday said that it has received information about the kidnapping of some passengers near Sardhaka and a search operation is underway to recover them.
A statement from Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said terrorists belonging to the Fitna-al-Hindustan had carried out attacks in Quetta, Kalat, Mastung and Sardhaka.
“Information has been received about the kidnapping of some passengers near Sardhaka. A search operation has been launched in the area to safely recover the passengers,” he said.
Rind added that the security forces responded “immediately and vigorously” at all three locations, saying they were fully alert to protect the lives, property and belongings of the people.
The police and security forces have not provided details at the moment of the other incidents.
In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna-al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
In March, five people were killed by armed men who blocked the highway in the Kalmat area of Gwadar district, while three long-body trailers carrying urea from Gwadar port were set on fire in the Tajaban area.
In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and shot dead in Barkhan district. The incident came days after 12 were killed in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.
Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, nine people were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while two labourers from Punjab were shot in Kech.
In May last year, seven barbers from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw 23 travellers offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.
The Musakhail incident was part of a flare-up of violence, where dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army — a separatist outfit — launched numerous attacks across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians.
Earlier today, Field Marshal Asim Munir said India was “doubling down to further its nefarious agenda through its proxies of Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan”.</p><small>2025-07-10 18:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/101425293d0432b.jpg?r=142723' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923287/fact-check-supreme-court-has-not-declared-ban-on-27-youtube-channels-unconstitutional' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Supreme Court has not declared ban on 27 YouTube channels unconstitutional</strong></a><br><p>Posts from users on social media platforms X and Facebook on Wednesday claimed that the Supreme Court had declared an Islamabad court’s ban on 27 YouTube channels unconstitutional. However, no such development has occurred.
It emerged on Tuesday that an Islamabad court last month ordered YouTube to block 27 channels for disseminating “fake, misleading, and defamatory” content against the government and armed forces.
Among the 27 sanctioned accounts — run by journalists, political commentators and social media in­­fluencers in Pakistan and overseas — are those of the PTI, Matiuallah Jan, Wajahat Khan, Ahmad Noorani and Asad Ali Toor, Imran Riaz, Orya Maqbool, Sabir Shakir, and Moeed Pirzada.
On Wednesday, former anchorperson Sabir Shakir said in a post on X: “Supreme Court declares ban on 27 YouTube channels unconstitutional.”
The post was seen by more than 39,000 people.
The same claim was shared by several other X users as can be seen here, here, here and here.
The claim also circulated on Facebook, as can be seen here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to keen public interest in the matter related to the ban on 27 YouTube channels.
 
 

Observing the press statement in Shakir’s post showed that it was of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) of Pakistan, not the Supreme Court itself.
Further investigation through a keyword search led to a post on X dated July 9 by journalist Hasnaat Malik, a senior reporter covering Supreme Court affairs. He shared the press statement, with the caption: “Supreme Court Bar Association President Mian Rauf Atta has said that the judicial magistrate’s order regarding the closure of 27 YouTube channels is a violation of several constitutional provisions.”
 






The same SCBA statement was also shared by Toor on X.
 






The SCBA is an independent body established in 1989, comprising lawyers who practice before the Supreme Court. Formed under the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973, and operating under the Pakistan Bar Council, the SCBA works to uphold the rule of law and protect the interests of the legal profession and the public. It is important to note that SCBA is not part of the Supreme Court and functions independently.
A keyword search to corroborate the alleged development yielded no news reports confirming that the Supreme Court declared the ban unconstitutional or took any action in the matter.
The same was confirmed by Dawn correspondent Umer Mehtab, who covers Supreme Court reporting, that the apex court was not involved in the matter.
He further said that any appeal against the Islamabad court’s order would first have to go and be processed in the high court. Any appeal against a lower court’s order cannot bypass the high court to go directly to the Supreme Court.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that the Supreme Court has declared the ban on 27 YouTube channels unconstitutional is false. No such development has occurred and so far only the SCBA, an independent body from the Supreme Court, has criticised the blocking order.

Lahore’s JFK Animal Rescue and Shelter said it received reports about an “extremely horrific situation after an Instagram influencer was seen posting torturing and killing animals, including bunnies and cats”.
The organisation said it immediately contacted the police, who reached the location to find dead bodies of animals and blood, with the suspect found “laughing” when approached.  The shelter said it would register a case against her and the animals were moved to shelters by the Police Animal Rescue Centre (PARC).
Visuals shared by the shelter showed cats, rabbits and birds of prey in captivity at the site.
Lahore Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi addressed the incident in a video, saying: “We just came back from a case where a girl … was torturing animals and she had rabbits, some exotic animals, cats and a lot of other stuff.”
She said the suspect had been posting graphic imagery of animal cruelty and violence on social media. The policewoman urged the public not to gift pets to someone suffering from mental issues.
“Please, start talking about animal cruelty because animal cruelty leads to us being cruel towards children [and] us being cruel towards vulnerable communities.”

She told Dawn.com the suspect was arrested and admitted to a mental healthcare facility. “She had run away several times from rehabilitation in the past as well,” the officer added.
ASP Naqvi said a case was registered on PARC’s complaint at Defence B Police Station under Pakistan Penal Code Section 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animal), Section 3 (penalty for cruelty to animals and for sale of animals killed with unnecessary cruelty) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1890, and Sections 10A (cruelty to animal prohibited), 12 (certificate of lawful possession) and 15 (restriction on dealings in animals, trophies or meat) of the Punjab Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation, and Management) Act, 1974.
The reason given by the ASP for the FIR was “cruelty towards animals after caging them and then killing animals and posting videos/pictures of the graphic content on Instagram and other social media platforms.”
PARC was established as a pioneering institution in Lahore in 2023, making significant strides over the past year in rescuing and protecting animals from abuse, neglect and abandonment.
Since its inception, PARC has safely relocated 1,130 animals to protection centres where they received proper care and treatment. These efforts have played a vital role in reducing animal suffering in urban settings. It generated a detailed report on animal abuse and the protection of animal rights in May, saying it had rescued 1,379 animals, 50 of them from extreme cruelty, in two years.
 
 

Pakistan has almost no animal welfare policy or service in place. The most prominent law for animal protection, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1890) — which dates back to the colonial era — is limited in scope and lacks understanding of animal welfare in today’s context.
The federal government did pass a law in 2018, increasing the fines for animal cruelty. It increased the maximum fine to Rs100,000 for animal cruelty, which had remained at the Rs50 level since the law was first passed in 1890, for first-time offenders. The minimum fine was raised to Rs10,000. There was a similar increase in fines for other offences against animals.
However, the law is only applicable in the federal capital, and does not extend to the rest of Pakistan. This is because animal welfare became a provincial subject after the 18th Amendment, and provinces are required to enact their own laws.
That is yet to happen, resulting in punishment for offences against animals in the rest of Pakistan staying the same as they were under the 1890 law.</p><small>2025-07-10 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/102214329c58cf6.jpg?r=221802' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923338/iran-threats-in-uk-significantly-increased-intelligence-watchdog' target='_blank'><strong>Iran threats in UK ‘significantly increased’: intelligence watchdog</strong></a><br><p>A United Kingdom parliamentary committee on Thursday blamed Iran for at least 15 attempts to kill or kidnap British-based individuals since 2022, saying the threat from Iran had “significantly increased”.
London’s response has been too focused on “crisis management”, said parliament’s intelligence and security committee, with concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme dominating their attention too much.
Tehran swiftly issued a “categorical rejection of the unfounded, politically motivated and hostile allegations”.
The committee’s claims were “baseless, irresponsible, and reflective of a broader pattern of distortion intended to malign Iran’s legitimate regional and national interests”, said its London embassy.
The report comes after growing alarm in Britain at alleged Iranian targeting of dissidents, media organisations and journalists in the UK, including accusations of physical attacks.
Iran in March became the first country to be placed on an enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme, which aims to boost Britain’s national security against covert foreign influences.
It requires all persons working inside the country for Iran, its intelligence services or the Revolutionary Guard to register on a new list or face jail.
“Iran poses a wide-ranging, persistent and unpredictable threat to the UK, UK nationals, and UK interests,” Kevan Jones, chairman of the watchdog committee, said in the report’s conclusions.
“Iran has a high appetite for risk when conducting offensive activity and its intelligence services are ferociously well-resourced with significant areas of asymmetric strength.”
Jones said it bolstered this through proxy groups, “including criminal networks, militant and terrorist organisations, and private cyber actors” to allow for deniability.
‘Willing and able’
His committee’s report said that while Iran’s UK activity “appears to be less strategic and on a smaller scale than Russia and China”, it “should not be underestimated”.
The physical threat posed had “significantly increased” in pace and volume, and was “focused acutely on dissidents and other opponents of the regime” as well as Jewish and Israeli interests in the UK, it said.
“The Iranian Intelligence Services have shown that they are willing and able — often through third-party agents — to attempt assassination within the UK and kidnap from the UK,” the report said.
“There have been at least 15 attempts at murder or kidnap against British nationals or UK-based individuals since the beginning of 2022.”
Similarly, security minister Dan Jarvis said in March that Britain’s MI5 domestic intelligence service had tallied 20 Iran-backed plots “presenting potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents”.
The watchdog committee took evidence for two years from August 2021 for its report, a period which saw Tehran implicated in a plot to kill two London-based Iran International television anchors.
In March last year, one of the Persian-language outlet’s journalists was stabbed outside his London home. Two Romanian men have been charged in relation to the attack and face extradition to the UK to stand trial.
The counter-terrorism unit of London’s Metropolitan Police led the investigation. Iran’s charge d’affaires in the UK has said that the Tehran authorities “deny any link” to the incident.</p><small>2025-07-10 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10171556d1ea756.jpg?r=174542' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923308/anp-leader-maulana-khan-zeb-cop-gunned-down-in-kps-bajaur-police' target='_blank'><strong>ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb, cop gunned down in KP’s Bajaur: police</strong></a><br><p>Awami National Party (ANP) politician Maulana Khan Zeb and a policeman were shot dead on Thursday by unidentified suspects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, according to the police.
Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told Dawn.com that the politician was shot dead in Shindai Mor while campaigning for the July 13 peace parade, adding that a policeman was also killed in the attack.
“Three other people were injured in the shooting,” DPO Rafiq said. “This was a targeted killing carried out by unidentified shooters on motorcycles.”
DPO Rafiq added that evidence had been collected from the crime scene.
Khan Zeb was a member of the ANP’s central cabinet and held the office of secretary of ulema affairs, according to the party website.
ANP President Senator Aimal Wali Khan issued a statement condemning the killing, stating that the party would file a first information report against the state.
“State institutions are complicit in this incident because they have maintained criminal silence,” the ANP chief was quoted as saying. “After consulting with Khan Zeb’s elder brother, Sheikh Jahanzada, an FIR for the killing will be registered against the state.”
In a post on X, Wali Khan posted photos of himself and Khan Zeb with the caption “devastated”.
Meanwhile, ANP KP President Mian Ifitkhar Hussain strongly condemned the incident and declared three days of mourning in a statement shared on X.
“This attack is not only an attack on the Awami National Party but also on the Pashtun consciousness and peace,” Hussain was quoted as saying.
According to the statement, Hussain announced that the ANP’s KP chapter would observe three days of mourning, suspend all activities, and hoist black flags alongside party flags.
The statement added that Hussain was leaving for Bajaur and urged the party to maintain “morale, unity, and organisational discipline”.
Similarly, the office of KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur issued a statement condemning the incident and vowed to bring the suspects to justice.
According to the statement, the CM condemned the shooting and ordered the relevant authorities to investigate the incident and promptly arrest the shooters.
“Those involved in the incident will not be able to escape the grip of the law,” Gandapur was quoted as saying.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) issued a statement condemning the killing, hailing Khan Zeb as “a leading peace campaigner and political leader of the ANP”.
“We demand a swift and impartial inquiry into this tragic incident,” the rights body wrote in a statement on X.
“The federal and provincial governments must ensure that normalcy returns to the terror-stricken districts of the province and that people who have suffered for decades can lead their lives peacefully and without fear.”
 






Politicians in KP have been targeted in attacks in the past.
This year, the home of Bajaur MNA Mubarak Zeb Khan was attacked twice, with an improvised explosive device exploding outside his house in May and suspects launching a rocket at the residence in June.
He was not home during the IED attack and was unharmed in the second incident.
Meanwhile, in March, the brother of former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was shot dead in KP’s Swabi.
The former senator confirmed on social media that his elder brother, Shakeel Ahmad Khan, was shot dead in front of his house by unidentified gunmen in the village of Ahad Khan in Swabi.
“He was brutally killed in front of his home in an innocent village,” Mushtaq wrote. “My brother was very dear to me, he was my greatest help. It (his murder) is the greatest atrocity.”

The Royal Navy aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport on June 14 in the state capital and has been grounded ever since, despite efforts to repair it. The Indian Air Force said last month it would help in the repair and return of the jet, which made an emergency landing when it was flying over the Arabian Sea off Kerala’s coast.
A British High Commission spokesperson had told Reuters the United Kingdom had accepted an offer to move the aircraft to the maintenance, repair and overhaul facility at the airport.
AP reported today that officials said engineers hoped to repair the plane in the next few days before it could fly back to the UK “sometime next week”.
The British High Commission confirmed to the outlet that a British engineering team was deployed to “assess and repair” the aircraft.
“There has been speculation in India that if the engineers fail to rectify the aircraft, it could be partially dismantled and transported in a cargo plane,” the report said, adding, however, that the UK’s Ministry of Defence “dismissed the speculation” in an emailed statement.
Earlier this month, the UK’s Minister for the Armed Forces Luke Pollard said in parliament that a Royal Air Force crew were in Thiruvananthapuram and working with Indian counterparts.
Meanwhile, Kerala’s tourism board had taken advantage of the aircraft’s presence, posting an AI-generated image of the plane with coconut trees in the background on July 2. The post was captioned “Kerala, the destination you’ll never want to leave.”
 






“This was part of our tourism campaign. It has been one of the most innovative and eye-catching ones … It’s all in good humour and creativity,” Biju K, Kerala’s tourism secretary, had told Reuters.
In the viral social media post, originally created by entertainment website The Fauxy, the jet can be seen giving the state of Kerala five golden stars, calling it “an amazing place”.
“I don’t want to leave. Definitely recommend,” the image quotes the jet as saying.
“Though tourism is under the government, it has moved out of government space in promoting the destination,” said Roy Mathew, director of Stark Communications, the tourism department’s brand promotion agency.</p><small>2025-07-10 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10195044291465c.jpg?r=195049' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923330/police-arrest-8-sbca-officials-owner-in-lyari-building-collapse-case' target='_blank'><strong>Police arrest 8 SBCA officials, owner in Lyari building collapse case</strong></a><br><p>At least eight officials of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) were arrested on Thursday along with the owner of a building that recently collapsed in Karachi’s Lyari, claiming 27 lives.
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the SBCA saying it had issued multiple prior notices to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that the arrests were made today after a first information report (FIR) was registered a day ago.
“Nine officials and the present owner of the building were nominated in the FIR registered on a complaint of an official of the local government department. However, eight directors and deputy directors were arrested but one official was not arrested as he was sick,” he said. adding that the owner was arrested as well.
The provincial government had suspended SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro and announced strict action against all those responsible for the incident on Monday. Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said a fact-finding committee had been formed to present a report on the incident, adding that the Sindh chief minister ordered the home minister to immediately register an FIR.
The FIR was registered at the Baghdadi Police Station on the complaint of Hamadullah, a section officer of the Sindh Local Government and Housing Town Planning Department, under Sections 34 (common intention), 217 (public servant disobeying direction of law with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture), 218 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture), 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings), 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab), 337-Ai (whoever, by doing any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person causes shajjah-i-khafifah) and 427 (mischief causing damage amounting to Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The FIR said the building, spread over 527.3 square yards, was constructed in 1986. Its owner constructed the five-storey plus ground floor building in two portions, and for a considerable period, both portions (buildings) were in dilapidated condition and were unlivable. It added that one building with 20 apartments collapsed on July 4 due to the “criminal negligence” of the SBCA officials and the owner.
The FIR said the SBCA officials were aware of the dilapidated condition of the building over the years till the collapse.  It added that the officials “completely failed” to perform their official duty and “committed negligence and carelessness”.
The FIR further said that the officials “deliberately” did not mention in the official record that the building was dilapidated. It also added that the present owner of the building and other unknown owners also knew that it was not livable for humans. Despite this, the owners gave several flats on rent to members of the Hindu community and committed negligence.
The complainant said he wanted legal proceedings against the SBCA officials and owners of the building.</p><small>2025-07-10 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/102042139a609e9.jpg?r=205240' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923332/us-federal-judge-blocks-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-despite-supreme-court-ruling' target='_blank'><strong>US federal judge blocks Trump’s birthright citizenship order despite Supreme Court ruling</strong></a><br><p>A federal judge on Thursday again barred President Donald Trump’s administration from enforcing his executive order limiting birthright citizenship nationwide after the United States Supreme Court restricted the ability of judges to block his policies using nationwide injunctions.
US District Judge Joseph Laplante in Concord, New Hampshire, made the ruling after immigrant rights advocates implored him to grant class action status to a lawsuit they filed seeking to represent any babies whose citizenship status would be threatened by the implementation of Trump’s directive.
Laplante agreed the plaintiffs could proceed as a class, allowing him to issue a fresh judicial order blocking implementation of the Republican president’s policy nationally.
The question of whether to issue an injunction was “not a close call”, he said, noting children could be deprived of US citizenship if Trump’s order took effect.
“That’s irreparable harm, citizenship alone,” he said. “It is the greatest privilege that exists in the world.”
The judge said he would stay his ruling for a few days to allow the Trump administration to appeal and would issue a written decision by the end of the day.
The ACLU and others filed the suit just hours after the Supreme Court on June 27 issued a 6-3 ruling, powered by its conservative majority, that narrowed three nationwide injunctions issued by judges in separate challenges to Trump’s directive.
The suit was filed on behalf of non-US citizens living in the country whose babies might be affected. Under the Supreme Court’s decision, Trump’s executive order would take effect on July 27.
Looking to seize upon an exception in the Supreme Court’s ruling, the lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the decision allows judges to continue to block Trump policies on a nationwide basis in class action lawsuits.
The three judges who issued nationwide injunctions found that Trump’s directive likely violates the citizenship language in the US constitution’s 14th amendment.
The amendment states that all “persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside”.
The Justice Department has argued that Trump’s order conforms with the constitution and has asked Laplante to find that the plaintiffs cannot sue as a class.
The Supreme Court’s ruling did not address the legal merits of Trump’s order, which the Republican president issued as part of his hardline immigration agenda on his first day back in office in January.
Trump’s order directs federal agencies to refuse to recognise the citizenship of US-born children who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or a lawful permanent resident, also known as a “green card” holder.
More than 150,000 newborns would be denied citizenship annually if it takes effect nationally, according to Democratic-led states and immigrant rights advocates who have challenged it.</p><small>2025-07-10 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1019193032c4e23.jpg?r=192647' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923328/fatigued-afghan-taxi-drivers-take-novel-approach-to-staying-cool' target='_blank'><strong>Fatigued Afghan taxi drivers take novel approach to staying cool</strong></a><br><p>Afghan taxi drivers have cobbled together a creative solution to spare them and their passengers from the sweltering heat.
In southern Afghanistan’s Kandahar city, where temperatures easily exceed 40 degrees Celsius, blue taxis can be spotted with an air conditioning (AC) unit strapped to the roof with an exhaust hose delivering the cool air through the passenger window.
“It started getting extremely hot three or four years ago. These cars’ AC systems didn’t work and repairs were too expensive. So I went to a technician, [and] had a custom cooler made,” said driver Gul Mohammad.
The 32-year-old spent 3,000 Afghanis ($43) for the system, which he connects to his taxi’s battery and regularly refills with water.
“This works better than [built-in] AC. ACs only cool the front — this cooler spreads air throughout,” said fellow driver Abdul Bari.
Other devices are connected to solar panels, also mounted on the taxi’s roof.

Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries in the world, is also one of the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is particularly affected by heat waves and is suffering from increased drought.
Murtaza, a 21-year-old technician, said that demand from taxi drivers has been growing over the past two or three years.
“Many cars weren’t equipped with air conditioning anyway, which is why we’re installing these,” he told AFP in his small shop in central Kandahar.
Afghan cities are often saturated with ageing vehicles, which are enjoying a last-ditch life after being transferred from neighbouring countries.
“When there’s no cooler, it becomes very difficult,” said Norullah, a 19-year-old passenger who did not provide a last name, his face inches from the blast of cold air. “These drivers are helping solve the problem, and that’s great.”</p><small>2025-07-10 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10184446ffc125f.jpg?r=185125' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923322/turkish-ice-cream-seller-arrested-shop-sealed-for-sexually-harassing-tourist-local-media' target='_blank'><strong>Turkish ice cream seller arrested, shop sealed for ‘sexually harassing’ tourist: local media</strong></a><br><p>An ice-cream seller in Turkiye was arrested and his shop was sealed earlier this week for allegedly sexually harassing a woman tourist, Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported.

The students were then asked to reveal who was on their periods. The teachers took down details, including thumb impressions, of the girls who raised their hands, and took the rest of the girls to washrooms where they were stripped and checked by attendants, the statement added.
According to Thane rural police personnel, the accused principal asked the daughter of one of the complainant parents why she was using a sanitary pad when she was not menstruating, accusing the girl of lying and forcefully taking her thumb impression.
 
 

The police said that action was taken against the school management and administration after several parents protested at the school on Wednesday, seeking “stringent action” against the management and teachers after the girls came home crying and told them about the experience.
“The act by the accused amounts to mental harassment to the girls,” one of the mothers was quoted as saying in her complaint.
According to Indian Express, the police said that one of the parents registered a case against the school principal, four teachers, the attendant and two trustees.
All the accused were booked under sections 74 (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 76 (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) of India’s criminal code, as well as relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has issued directives for strict action against those responsible, Water Minister Girish Mahajan told the state’s legislative assembly, according to Hindustan Times.
A senior police officer said that the arrested — both women — will be produced before the court on Thursday, the report added.
Police were identifying witnesses and gathering more evidence from the students.</p><small>2025-07-10 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10173503c8ce7e2.jpg?r=174622' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923309/india-doubling-down-on-proxy-war-after-clear-defeat-by-pakistan-says-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>India doubling down on proxy war after clear defeat by Pakistan, says COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir said on Thursday that India was doubling down on its “nefarious agenda” against Pakistan through the use of proxies after facing a “manifest defeat” in the recent military conflict between the two countries.
India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
A day earlier, Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of masterminding terrorism in Pakistan, alleging Indian support for terrorist groups.
Echoing similar sentiments, Field Marshal Munir said, while chairing the 271st Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ), said today: “Following its manifest defeat in direct aggression against Pakistan, post-Pahalgam incident, India is now doubling down to further its nefarious agenda through its proxies of Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan.”
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna-al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
A statement from the ISPR said the CCC participants offered prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks by “Indian-sponsored proxies”.
“Taking stock of recent successes against terrorist proxies, forum resolved that blood of our martyrs will not go waste and the safety and security of people of Pakistan remain topmost priority for the armed forces of Pakistan. Forum strongly asserted that it is imperative to take decisive and holistic actions at all levels against the Indian-backed and sponsored proxies.”
 






The ISPR said the forum also noted the Indian military’s “baseless insinuations to offset its comprehensive defeat”, in an apparent reference to the deputy Indian army chief alleging last week that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict.
“Invoking third parties in what is unmistakably a bilateral military confrontation reflects a disingenuous attempt at bloc politics aimed at falsely projecting India’s self-assigned role as a net security provider to accrue benefits in a region that is visibly growing disillusioned with Indian hegemonic ambitions and Hindutva-driven extremism,” the ISPR quoted Field Marshal Munir as saying on the matter.
 
 

The army brass also conducted a holistic review of the prevailing internal and external security dynamics, with particular emphasis on the recent developments in the Middle East and Iran, noting the “growing propensity for ‘use of force’ as a preferred policy tool”, saying it warranted “persistent development of self-reliant capabilities as well as national unity and resolve”.
The forum’s members were further briefed on the military’s ongoing drive with quick adaptation towards the “evolving threat spectrum and changing character of war”. The army chief also appreciated the leadership of the Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Air Force for “further strengthening tri-services synergy”.
Field Marshal Munir also shared details of the country’s “proactive and successful” diplomatic manoeuvres, including recent visits to Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where he had accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
 
 

“Forum was also briefed on the historic and unique visit of the COAS to US, where meetings with top-tier leadership afforded an opportunity to share first hand Pakistan’s objective perspective on bilateral, regional and extra-regional developments.”
The ISPR said that in his concluding remarks, the army chief expressed “full confidence in the operational readiness of Pakistan Army against complete threat spectrum”.</p><small>2025-07-10 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1016423617e36ca.jpg?r=164242' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N leaders issue conflicting statements on allowing Imran’s sons to enter Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>PML-N leaders have issued differing statements on whether PTI founder Imran Khan’s sons would be allowed entry into Pakistan to run a political movement for their father’s release, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they “can stage protests but within legal limitations”.
Imran’s sons — Suleman Khan (28) and Kasim Khan (26) — had called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this week, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan said the two brothers would come to Pakistan as part of an upcoming PTI protest movement.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023 in a case related to state gifts, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million graft case and and faces pending trials related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
Speaking on Geo News’ programme ‘Geo Pakistan’ today, Irfan Siddiqui said: “In my personal opinion — as the government has so far not taken any official stance — they should be allowed to come. They should come and carry out their activities.”
He noted that the sons have spent their entire lives abroad, so they would be “well-aware of what a protest is, how it is staged, and what the boundaries are that we cannot cross”.
“In my opinion, they should not be deprived of this right. If they want to run a movement for their father, then they should,” Siddiqui reiterated.
However, he also hinted at their potential arrests: “If they come here and cross the limitations of laws […] They will also come prepared for that, knowing that ‘if we are fighting the laws, then the law will take its course’.”
 


While Kasim recently posted on X about his father being “fully cut off” from the sons, he has not addressed the matter of joining Pakistan’s politics.
Although the government has not officially commented on the matter, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik told Dawn.com that Article 16 was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.
Article 16 of the Constitution says that “every citizen shall have the right to assemble peacefully and without arms, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of public order.”
“Every country has visa conditions, including visit visas. If the visa conditions are violated, the visa can be cancelled,” he said.
To a question on whether they would be allowed to come to Pakistan, he said the interior ministry would have to look at whether the two had applied for a visa or not or possessed a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis.
He added that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.
Last night, he said that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals.
Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said the sons could face arrest if they led a violent movement, while Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said they “should come” to Pakistan.
Siddiqui downplayed the matter altogether, saying that the government was not considering it a “serious issue”. “This will not cause any political upheaval […] there will be no storm if his children come to Pakistan,” he said.
“Why these kids now?” he asked, giving an allegory of taking out two cards that were lying in a pocket deep inside.
He listed that neither Ali Amin Gandapur — the PTI’s only chief minister currently — could do anything for the PTI, nor their protests, or “revolt”, or the call to overseas Pakistanis to halt remittances.
“This card that they are playing will not succeed either. It will aggravate their difficulties because, in the end, politics is to be discussed at the table,” the PML-N senator asserted, referring to the PTI’s demand for Imran’s release.
Regarding talks, the PML-N leader said the only obstacle was Imran himself.
Siddiqui also highlighted various skill challenges that Imran’s sons would face in Pakistan’s political arena.
“Those children have not grown up in Pakistan’s environment at all. They might even melt if you leave them in Karachi’s heat on I.I. Chundrigar Road; those poor kids’ nature is such,” he quipped.
The lawmaker added: “They are maybe not able to speak in Urdu either, so they do not have a language to address this nation.”
However, he acknowledged that their faces were recognisable as they were Imran’s sons. “They are sensible, educated and must be politically well-aware as well.”
Siddiqui termed the potential entry of Imran’s sons into politics as a move to employ emotional appeal.
“They (the sons) are being called because [PTI’s] options within the land of Pakistan have been exhausted,” the lawmaker said, recalling the 2022 mass resignations and the May 9, 2023 riots.
He also pointed out that such a move would go against Imran’s “philosophy that has been against family politics very clearly”.
 
 

Asked by the show hosts whether he was underestimating the sons, given that the PPP’s Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari and his sisters entered politics despite having stayed abroad, Siddiqui replied that the latter had still not “gotten a chance to run a movement as the scenario had changed entirely” compared to the dictatorships in the 1900s.
The PML-N leader noted that ex-president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s wife Nusrat and daughter Benazir used to speak in Urdu and participated in a movement.
Jemima slams govt’s ‘plan’ to arrest sons
Meanwhile, Imran’s former spouse, Jemima Goldsmith, assailed the government for potential plans to arrest her sons if they visited Pakistan.
“My children are not allowed to speak on the phone to their father. He has been in solitary confinement in prison for nearly two years,” she wrote on X.
“Pakistan’s government has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she noted.
“This doesn’t happen in a democracy or a functioning state. This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta,” Goldsmith lamented.

Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore, the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
At least nine people lost their lives and many others sustained injuries as heavy monsoon rains lashed Lahore on Wednesday. The downpours caused widespread flooding and disrupted daily life in several areas.
“Over the last 24 hours, four people died and 40 were injured due to rain and winds across the province,” Rescue 1122 Punjab Spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said in a statement.
Those who sustained serious injuries were immediately transported to a hospital, the spokesperson said.
 


In Sheikhpura’s Mirza Virkaan village, a two-year-old and a five-year-old were killed and two others were injured when a roof collapsed, per the statement.
In Lahore’s Nishtar Colony, a 50-year-old man was killed when a roof collapsed, while two others were injured. A similar incident at a railway station in the city left a two-year-old child dead and hurt two others.
A child was also injured in the Sheikhpura district when a wall collapsed on Jandiala Road. Two people were wounded when a bamboo roof crumbled down in Jhamke village, while one person was hurt in a similar incident in Narang Mandi.
Four people were injured when walls and roofs collapsed in Vehari, while one person was injured in the district’s Chak No. 59WB when solar panels fell on them.
Three people were injured when a roof collapsed in Dera Ghazi Khan, while one person was wounded when a wall caved in in Mankera, a town in Sargodha’s Bhakkar District.
In Attock, a family of six was trapped in their house due to heavy rainfall and urban flooding, and was subsequently injured. Rescue personnel reached the site of the incident and moved everyone to a safe place after providing medical assistance, according to the statement.
Two people were injured in separate incidents when their motorcycle slipped in different localities of Lahore. In the city’s Ashiana Road, one person was killed when a TR girder fell, while two people were wounded in Ichhra’s Ganj Bakhsh when a roof collapsed.
Three people sustained injuries in roof-collapse incidents in Chak 5/4L’s Muzaffar Colony and Chak 6/4L in Okara. One person each was injured in Sahiwal’s Aurangabad and Al-Aman Garden neighbourhoods.
One individual was wounded when a roof collapsed in Sialkot’s Chak Gul Daska, while another was injured in Rajanpur district’s Kotla Malam.
Lahore experiences 7 hours of continuous rainfall: PDMA
Separately, in its daily report, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said Lahore experienced seven hours of continuous downpour on Thursday morning, recording the highest provincial tally with 140mm of rainfall.
Heavy monsoon rainfall is expected in most parts of Punjab over the next 24 hours, the daily report quoted PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia as saying.
The second spell of monsoon rainfall is likely to continue till July 13, it added.
Sialkot recorded 77mm of rainfall, Gujranwala 67mm, Chakwal 65mm, Jhelum 64mm, Hafizabad 60mm, Gujrat 52mm, Mandi Bahauddin 47mm, and Attock 45mm of rainfall.
Faisalabad recorded 51mm of rainfall, Narowal 44mm, Okara 33mm, while Toba Tek Singh and Sheikhupura recorded 25mm each. Rawalpindi and Kasur each recorded 23mm of rainfall, Mangla 19mm, Sargodha 18mm, DG Khan 16mm, Jhang 11mm, Mianwali 10mm, Sahiwal 8mm and Murree 1mm of rainfall.
Heavy rainfall is predicted in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Dera Ghazi Khan, Sahiwal and Mianwali divisions, the report said.
Kathia instructed citizens to take precautionary measures and stay in safe places during thunderstorms.</p><small>2025-07-10 11:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10122033a01d633.jpg?r=163359' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923264/electoral-roll-revision-in-indias-bihar-sparks-fear-and-fury' target='_blank'><strong>Electoral roll revision in India’s Bihar sparks fear and fury</strong></a><br><p>Indian election officials have given voters in Bihar state just weeks to prove their citizenship, requiring documents that few possess in a registration revamp set to be applied nationwide, triggering disenfranchisement fears.
The Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the revision of the voter rolls in June ahead of upcoming polls in the eastern state.
It said the exercise will later be replicated across the nation of 1.4 billion people.
According to the ECI, the “intensive revision” was needed in part to avoid the “inclusion of the names of foreign illegal immigrants”.
Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have long claimed that large numbers of undocumented Muslim migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh have fraudulently entered India’s electoral rolls.
Critics say the overhaul could render vast numbers of Indian citizens unable to vote.
“You are being asked to produce documents that very few people have,” said Asaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim lawmaker.
 
 

“It will lead to mass disenfranchisement.”
Opposition lawmakers say it will impact minorities the hardest, including Muslims and Dalit communities, those on the bottom rung of India’s rigid caste hierarchy.
‘Engineered exclusions’
All potential voters in Bihar will have to provide proof of citizenship by July 25.
Those registered in 2003, the last time scrutiny of the voter list took place in Bihar, can submit a copy of that.
The rest — around 30 million people, according to the ECI’s estimates — have to provide evidence of their place and date of birth.
And those born after 1987 must also furnish proof of their parents’ Indian citizenship.
The requirement affects more than a third of potential voters in Bihar, India’s third most populous state and its poorest.
It is also a crucial election battleground as the only state in India’s northern Hindi-speaking belt where Modi’s BJP has only ever governed in a coalition.
Bihar’s main opposition party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, has challenged the election commission in the Supreme Court, along with other parties and activists.
“It is being used to justify aggressive and opaque revisions of electoral rolls that disproportionately target Muslim, Dalit and poor (Indian) migrant communities,” the court petition read.
“They are not random patterns but… engineered exclusions.” Unlike many other countries, India does not have a unique national identity card.
The widely used biometric-linked “Aadhaar” identity card is not among the documents listed by the ECI as acceptable proof.
Documents that can be used include birth certificates, passports and matriculation records.
Of these, most people are likely to rely on their matriculation certificates.
But even those are in short supply in Bihar, where literacy rates are among the lowest in India.
According to an analysis published in The Indian Express newspaper, only 35 per cent of people in the state hold such a document.
“In Bihar, where literacy is not very high, many people are not likely to have the kind of documents the ECI has demanded,” said Jagdeep Chhokar from the
New Delhi-based Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).
“The poor, poorly educated, uneducated, and minorities will be the most impacted.”
‘Foreign infiltrators’
Detractors say the drive is unprecedented because “documentary proof has never been demanded” of people to vote in India.
“Only those who especially wanted their name inserted needed to fill a form,” said political activist and academic Yogendra Yadav. “For the rest, someone would come to their house and get their names registered.”
“The onus in India was never on the voter but on the ECI officials,” he added.
In previous verification drives, modifications were made to the existing rolls, Yadav said.
Now, a list is being drawn from scratch.
Yadav said the drive was a “de facto” implementation of an earlier plan to put together a list of Indian citizens.
The National Register of Citizens (NRC), which was compiled in the eastern state of Assam in 2019, left out almost two million people. Many of them were Muslims.
The BJP had said the NRC would be replicated nationwide as it was necessary to detect “foreign infiltrators”, but was forced to backtrack after furious protests.
“Everyone has to now prove that they are citizens of India,” said Yadav.
“That is exactly what the NRC is… this is NRC by the backdoor. “</p><small>2025-07-10 11:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1015424819c7422.jpg?r=154746' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923282/russian-minister-terms-islamabad-and-moscow-natural-allies-reaffirms-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Russian minister terms Islamabad and Moscow ‘natural allies’, reaffirms bilateral cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk on Thursday said Pakistan and Russia were “natural allies”, stressing that Russian President Vladimir Putin views Islamabad as an important strategic partner in the areas of economy and energy, the Foreign Office said in a statement.
In recent years, Russia and Pakistan have engaged in strengthening bilateral ties with each other. On June 3, Russian Foreign Min­ister Sergey Lavrov, in a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Syed Tariq Fatemi, reaffirmed Russia’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan.
Moscow’s growing engagement with Islamabad — including defe­nce deals, energy cooperation and regular joint military exercises — reflects a strategic shift to diversify partnerships across the region.
In a high-level meeting with Ambassador Fatemi and the prime minister’s aide on Industries and Production, Haroon Akhtar Khan, in Moscow, the Russian DPM reaffirmed his country’s commitment towards deepening bilateral cooperation with Pakistan.
“Characterising Pakistan and Russia as natural allies, [Overchuck] stressed that President Putin considered Pakistan as an important partner in the growth and development of the economy and energy in the region,” the statement said.
“He also highlighted the significance of important connectivity projects between two countries, such as the railway connectivity between Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Russia, and the launching of a pilot cargo train between Pakistan and Russia in August 2025.”
During the meeting, Fatemi reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening relations with Russia, stressing that strong links with the country were a top priority.
“Pakistan views Russia as a stabilising factor in the international arena,” he added, according to the statement.
Speaking about the New Steel Mills project in Karachi, SAPM Haroon Akhtar — focal point for the project — said the project carries the legacy of Pakistan’s relations with Russia, hailing it as a “leap forward” for future cooperation and partnership.
On May 13, Pakistan and Russia signed an agreement to establish a new steel plant in Karachi, according to a press release from the Press Information Department (PID).
The two sides reviewed engagement across all areas of mutual interest, including political, trade and economic cooperation, as well as energy, connectivity, industrial and agricultural cooperation.
They also discussed recent geopolitical and regional issues such as the situation in South Asia, Afghanistan, and the Middle East. During the recent Indian aggression against Pakistan in May, Russia had offered to mediate between the two countries.
DPM Overchuk shared that President Putin was in favour of strengthening cooperation with Pakistan across all relevant sectors.
He added that President Putin was looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in August in the upcoming SCO-Council of Heads of State in Tainjin, China.
In September 2024, Overchuk visited Pakistan, where he met with his Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq Dar. The two signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) formalising Pakistan and Russia’s commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.</p><small>2025-07-10 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10150214ac2d153.jpg?r=161217' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923293/pakistan-eyes-1-billion-valuation-in-roosevelt-hotel-redevelopment-plan-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan eyes $1 billion valuation in Roosevelt Hotel redevelopment plan, source says</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is seeking a valuation of at least $1 billion for the Roosevelt Hotel it owns in New York and is ready to part with a minority stake in the prime Manhattan property as it scouts for a redevelopment partner, a senior government official said.
Named after former US President Theodore Roosevelt, the century-old property in midtown Manhattan is seen as one of Pakistan’s most valuable foreign assets, which it acquired in 2000. Faced with mounting losses, the over 1,000-room hotel was shut in 2020, and has also operated briefly as a migrant shelter.
As part of its $7bn IMF-backed privatisation push, the government approved a “transaction structure for the Roosevelt Hotel” on Tuesday, saying it won’t do an outright sale but has decided to adopt a joint venture model to maximise long-term value. It gave no further details.
The senior official said the government will retain ownership in the project through an equity partnership, but declined to disclose the size of the stake being offered to any potential JV partner.
The official declined to be named since the process is confidential. JLL, or Jones Lang LaSalle, will run the process and the government is eyeing a valuation of over $1bn for the 42,000 square feet property it hopes could be redeveloped for residential-cum-office use, the official said.
“It is among the best pieces of land in NY real estate … The process begins immediately and is expected to be completed in the next six to nine months,” said the official.
The Privatisation Ministry and state-owned Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which owns the hotel through its investment arm, did not respond to requests for comments, and neither did JLL.
Pakistan this week also approved four parties to bid for a stake in debt-ridden PIA.
 
 

The hotel is located near marquee New York destinations such as Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and Fifth Avenue, placing it in one of Manhattan’s most valuable commercial zones.
The government is estimating the redevelopment will take 4–5 years, the official said, adding the “interest level is extremely high”.
In June, the government said it expects $100 million in the initial payment from the joint-venture partnership by June 2026.</p><small>2025-07-10 11:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/101310024ebd2da.gif?r=131141' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923280/interior-minister-rebuts-rumours-about-president-zardari-resigning-from-office' target='_blank'><strong>Interior minister rebuts rumours about President Zardari ‘resigning’ from office</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday rebutted rumours of President Asif Ali Zardari being asked to resign, terming it a “malicious campaign”.
“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the chief of army staff,” Naqvi wrote on X.
“I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion, nor does any such idea exist about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” he asserted.
 






“The president of Pakistan enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces,” the minister said.
He quoted President Zardari as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”
Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.
“To those involved in this narrative, do whatever you wish in collaboration with hostile foreign agencies. As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah,” Naqvi added.
Earlier today, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui also denied reports of Zardari’s resignation.
Speaking on Geo News’ programme “Geo Pakistan”, he said: “Reports that Zardari is resigning, Imran’s sons are coming, Nawaz Sharif is going to Adiala … these are not news. They are bogus, table stories.”
He further said, “Zardari has not created any difficulties for the government, and understands his constitutional responsibilities as head of state”.
The PML-N leader said his party had “no trouble” working with the president, who leads the PPP, and there was no credible reason to remove him from office.
“We have a coalition with the PPP. Why would we bring down this system?” he questioned.
Over the past couple of years, social media campaigns against the army have escalated, reflecting broader tensions within the country’s political and social fabric.
The government, as well as the military, have repeatedly warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the laws.
In May, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz formally decorated Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir with the rank of field marshal for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.
In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during Marka-i-Haq against India.
 
 

The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, hailed the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.
In May 2024, the army chief and President Zardari had expressed their concern over “baseless and unsubstantiated allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals” against the army for their political interests.</p><small>2025-07-10 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/101341431ba4a52.jpg?r=134152' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923274/4-killed-in-kps-mardan-as-two-groups-clash-over-personal-dispute-police' target='_blank'><strong>4 killed in KP’s Mardan as two groups clash over personal dispute: police</strong></a><br><p>Four people from two different groups were killed while two others were injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan district over a personal dispute, police said on Thursday.
Mardan police spokesperson Muhammad Faheem Khan told Dawn.com, “There was a clash between two groups over a personal dispute, resulting in the killing of four people — three from one group and one from the other group — while two people sustained injuries.”
“The motive behind the clash was a personal dispute between them,” he added.
One of the injured filed a first information report (FIR) at the Garhi Kapura police station on Wednesday night.
According to the FIR, seen by Dawn.com, the complainant said that the incident occurred around 10pm when he was returning home with his brothers and cousins, saying that they were attacked by armed assailants who were already present there.
The FIR was registered under Sections  148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 302 (intentional murder) and 324  (attempted mu­r­der) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
“Five armed men opened fire on us, resulting in the instant death of three people, while my cousin and I got injured,” the complainant wrote in the FIR.
A relative of the deceased from the second group also filed a police case at the Garhi Kapura police station under Sections 302 (intentional murder), 324  (attempted mu­r­der) and 34 (common intention) of the PPC.
Police spokesperson Faheem added that the dead bodies and the injured were taken to the Bala Garhi Hospital for autopsy and medical assistance.
“An FIR had been lodged and raids are being conducted to arrest the suspects,” he added.

Rescue 1122 Spokesperson for DI Khan Aizaz Mehmood told Dawn.com, “The collision took place near the Jholy Hotel within the limits of the Khari Khaisoor police station.
“A family was heading towards DI Khan when their car collided with a truck that was on its way to Punjab.”
He said the Rescue 1122 team had “reached the scene soon after the incident, where it found all five people in the car dead”.
“The bodies have been taken to the Paharpur Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, while the heirs of the deceased are being contacted to claim the bodies,” Mehmood said.
The deceased were identified as Rawda Munir, Muhammad Mutasim, Muhammad Talha, Muhammad Tufail and the driver Wasimullah. All were residents of DI Khan’s Zafar Abad Colony, he said.
Meanwhile, DI Khan police spokesperson Yaqoob Khan said that an investigation into the incident is underway.
 


Rescue 1122 in June said that as many as 55 people were killed in a range of incidents over the Eid-ul-Azha holidays across KP. According to Rescue 1122 Director General Shah Fahad, 349 of the incidents reported were traffic accidents.
Two people were killed in separate traffic accidents in parts of DI Khan in June, both by speeding vehicles.
Also in DI Khan, five members of a family were killed and several others were injured in a road accident in May when a speeding dumper loaded with gas cylinders collided with a car on the Dera-Zhob highway near Sur Dagar.</p><small>2025-07-10 10:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/101429374df5323.png?r=143210' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923261/pakistan-china-agree-on-joint-media-cooperation-against-fake-news' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China agree on joint media cooperation against fake news</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and China on Thursday agreed to further enhance ties and joint broadcasting projects between their state broadcasters to tackle fake news and disinformation, Radio Pakistan reported.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and media collaboration, with initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.
The government, as well as the military, have previously warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the law.
The decision was made during a meeting in Beijing between Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar and Cao Shumin, Deputy Head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Minister and Party Secretary of the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA).
 






“Both leaders also agreed on a joint narrative against fake news and emphasised technical training and institutional collaboration,” the report said. “They described the ongoing partnership in the media as a reflection of mutual trust and longstanding friendship.”
The report added that the two sides also held talks related to a proposed agreement between China Central Television (CCTV) and PTV to promote the exchange of information and cooperation.
Tarar said Pakistan was ready to translate bilateral media cooperation into practical steps and that state-run media entities — PTV, Radio Pakistan and Associated Press of Pakistan — were playing a crucial role in communicating stories of China’s development, the Belt and Road Initiative, CPEC, cultural ties, and bilateral cooperation to the people of both countries.
Per the report, Tarar said PTV was building intellectual and cultural bridges between the two nations by broadcasting Chinese programmes, documentaries and news reports in Urdu.
He said APP’s “China News Service” had crossed a significant milestone in effectively conveying Pakistan’s narrative to Chinese readers.
Referring to the recent Pakistan-India tensions, the information minister noted that the youth of China and Pakistan expressed strong solidarity with each other, which went viral on social media.
The meeting also discussed exchange visits of digital influencers from both Pakistan and China. Tarar said in the digital age, exchanges between influencers and social media representatives of both countries can inject new energy into bilateral relations.
Shumin said China considered Pakistan a trustworthy partner. “Media organisations of Pakistan and China can come closer through the exchange of experiences,” she was quoted as saying in the report.
Both sides agreed that media, culture, and people-to-people relations can introduce new dimensions to the Pakistan-China friendship, and these efforts will be further strengthened under a joint strategy.
In February, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Jiang Zaidong said: “We are ready to expand cooperation with Pakistan in education, media, think tanks, youth exchanges, and the film and television industries, to foster mutual learning between civilisations and strengthen cultural and people-to-people ties.”</p><small>2025-07-10 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/101001453e86194.gif?r=114415' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923109/three-month-rent-assistance-announced-for-families-displaced-by-demolition-of-54-dilapidated-buildings-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Three-month rent assistance announced for families displaced by demolition of 54 dilapidated buildings in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani on Wednesday revealed that after the collapse of a building in Lyari, some 54 other dilapidated structures, mainly in the old city area, were being demolished to avert any tragedy.
“The process of evacuating buildings declared unsafe is also underway at a rapid pace,” said Mr Ghani while talking to reporters after a meeting with chairmen of different towns associated with the Jamaat-i-Islami.
“The government has decided to provide immediate rental assistance to those displaced by the demolition of dangerous structures. For all buildings being vacated and demolished due to structural risks, the Sindh government will pay three months’ rent to the affected residents as a temporary relief measure.”
The minister clarified that the support would not be limited to homeowners alone as the tenants living in these hazardous buildings would also receive three months of rent from the government.

In meeting with JI town chairmen, Saeed Ghani says dedicated committee to oversee rehabilitation of affected people

If needed, the financial support could be extended to six months or even a year, depending on each family’s situation and the progress of their rehabilitation, he said.
“We’ve established a dedicated committee to oversee the complete rehabilitation of the affected families and ensure that no one is left behind,” the minister said.
PTI files resolution in PA
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) legislators have demanded that a high-level probe body is formed, which should be comprised of members of the Sindh Assembly, to look into the “horrific” incident that claimed 27 innocent lives.
 
 

Parliamentary party leader of the PTI in the Sindh Assembly Muhammad Shabbir Qureshi submitted a resolution in the assembly addressing the alarming rise in building collapse incidents in Karachi.
Referring to the recent tragic Lyari incident, Mr Qureshi demanded that all negligent officials were identified and held accountable.
“The resolution further demanded that officers involved in corruption and criminal negligence face strict legal consequences,” said the statement.
“The resolution also urged the Sindh Assembly to approve the resolution and initiate a full debate on the issue of illegal constructions in Karachi, calling for policy reforms to prevent future tragedies.”
Governor sets up cell
A cell has been established in Governor House to assist affected families.
The cell will coordinate with relevant government agencies to ensure timely support and resolution of complaints from affected families, said a statement.
“Governor Kamran Tessori has also announced helplines — 1366 and 021-99204748 — for victims seeking help,” said the statement.

The outreach comes as Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) has successfully arranged a $1bn syndicated loan for Pakistan, partially backed by the Asian Development Bank — the first such guarantee-based facility for the country.
Khurram Schehzad, adviser to the finance minister, said in a post on X on Wednesday that the MoF team had engaged in technical discussions with prospective investors, underwriters, guarantors, a Chinese rating agency, and legal advisers. The meetings, which began on July 7, will continue until July 11 as part of a non-deal roadshow (NDR) ahead of Pakistan’s debut Panda Bond issue.
Mr Schehzad noted that the roadshow had attracted encouraging initial interest, reflecting investor confidence in Pakistan’s reform trajectory and its improving credibility in international markets. He added that the visit underscores the government’s commitment to proactive investor engagement and its strategy to broaden access to China’s deep and diversified onshore capital market.
 






In a separate development, Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) has finalised a $1bn syndicated loan for Pakistan in partnership with a consortium of regional and international financial institutions, according to an official statement on Wednesday.
The five-year facility is partially guaranteed by a Policy-Based Guarantee (PBG) from the Asian Development Bank, marking the first transaction of its kind undertaken by the ADB for Pakistan.

The 32-year-old actor was found dead when police, accompanied by a bailiff, broke open the door of her fourth-floor apartment in Ittehad Commercial, Phase VI.
DIG-South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that police surgeon Summaiya Syed along with SSP-South Mahzoor Ali visited her flat and they suspected that she might have died around six months ago.
Elaborating, he said that the date of expiry of the bread and packaged milk kept in the refrigerator was September 2024.
Similarly, two SIMs in her cell phone were dead /inactive since September 2024 as per the call data record obtained by investigators. Besides, he said that power supply to her flat was disconnected in October 2024 reportedly by the KE ostensibly over non-payment of dues.
The police said the adjacent flat was empty during the period in which she was believed to have died.
Family refuses to take body
The DIG said that her family lived in Lahore and when the police approached them they, particularly her father, refused to take the body for burial.
Later, he said, the deceased’s brother-in-law approached the police and he was expected to arrive here on Thursday (today) to meet with the police.
As people learned that her father refused to take the body, prominent showbiz personalities approached the police, expressing their willingness to perform the last rites and arrange the burial, the DIG said.
“We shall hand them the body in case the family refuses,” he added.
He said that the cause of the death could be ascertained only after receiving chemical examiner’s report.

• KKH reopens for traffic but heatwave persists in GB; glacial melting, floods cause severe damage
LAHORE / GILGIT: At least 11 people lost their lives and many others sustained injuries as heavy monsoon rains lashed Lahore, its surrounding districts and some parts of Balochistan on Wednesday. The downpours caused widespread flooding and disrupted daily life in several areas.
In Lahore, the heavy rainfall submerged low-lying areas and major roads, exposing the city’s inadequate drainage infrastructure.
According to data from the Water and Sanitation Agency’s (Wasa) Monsoon Control Room, Lahore received an average of 58.8mm of rain, with some areas like Nishtar Town recording the highest 84mm, followed by Lakshmi Chowk (78mm) and Paniwala Talab (74mm).
The first spell of rain lashed the city from 2:45am to 5:40am, with a second, more intense downpour hitting between 10:45am and 12:11pm.
The heavy showers exposed the weaknesses in Lahore’s drainage system, with key areas such as Jail Road (63mm), Qurtaba Chowk (68mm) and Wasa Head Office in Gulberg (69mm) experiencing severe water accumulation. The rainwater mixed with sewage, creating a public health crisis as residents struggled to navigate flooded streets.
 
 

At Yakki Gate, a child was electrocuted by exposed wiring, while multiple Lesco feeders tripped across the city, leaving thousands without electricity for hours.
“We’ve been without power since the morning and the stagnant water is making it impossible to leave our homes,” said Rukhsana Bibi, a resident of Mughalpura, which received 60mm of rain.
Residents of Barki Road also faced immense difficulties in travelling. They complained that no machinery was sent to clear the water from the roads and streets until evening, with the Wasa and district administration focusing efforts on draining water only from “elite” areas.
Despite claims from the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) about deploying cleaning teams and clearing over 6,000 waste containers, citizens reported minimal improvements on the ground.
“The main roads are still submerged, and no one from the administration is here to help,” said Asif Mahmood, a shopkeeper at Lakshmi Chowk.
The situation was particularly dire in low-lying areas like Farrukhabad (49mm) and Johar Town (39mm), where drainage systems were virtually non-existent.
Monsoon rains also affected several other districts across Punjab in the last 24 hours. Khanewal recorded 51mm, Rawalpindi 42mm, Sahiwal 44mm, Murree 41mm, Okara 30mm, Mandi Bahauddin 27mm, Mangla 24mm, and Toba Tek Singh 13mm.
Other regions like Gujranwala, Bahawalpur, Gujrat, Kasur, Bahawalnagar, Sargodha, Multan and Jhang also experienced downpours.
Deaths and injuries
According to Rescue 1122, nine people lost their lives and many others were injured in rain-related incidents across the province.
Two children died when the roof of their house collapsed due to the rain in Sheikhupura. Rescue teams also retrieved four people trapped under the rubble of a collapsed house in Pakpattan. In Jhelum valley, a cloudburst caused severe damage to houses and vehicles, while roads were destroyed.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast more intense rainfall over the next 24 hours in Lahore and much of Punjab.
Irfan Ali Kathia, director general of Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), said the rains are expected to continue until July 13. Thunderstorms are likely on Thursday in Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Sialkot, Narowal, Gujarat, Lahore and Hafizabad. The Punjab government has also imposed Section 144 around rivers and canals.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), water levels are expected to rise in the Kabul, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum rivers, with low-level flooding likely at Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma and Taunsa along the Indus.
Low-level flooding is also feared in Marala and Khanki on the Chenab River, and at Mangla on the Jhelum River. Tributaries of the Swat and Panjkora rivers may also experience flooding.
Heavy rainfall is expected to cause a significant rise in water flow in the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur, as well as in local streams in Jhal Magsi, Kachhi, Sibi, Qila Saifullah, Zhob and Musakhel districts in Balochistan.
Two people were killed and another injured in separate rain-related incidents in Balochistan’s Khuzdar and Mastung districts on Wednesday. Heavy rainfall and strong winds caused a wall to collapse in Khuzdar, resulting in the death of a man named Muhammad Arif and injuring Ehsanullah.
In Bolan Colony in the Kanak area of Mastung, a tanker carrying LPG overturned on a person due to slippery roads caused by the rain. The victim, identified as Muhammad Yaqoob, was killed on the spot.
Glacial melting intensifies in GB
The current heatwaves have accelerated glacial melting across Gilgit-Baltistan, leading to widespread flooding and soil erosion that have disconnected roads, damaged homes, agriculture and disrupted power and water supplies in various areas.
 
 

Rising water levels in rivers and streams have put downstream communities at significant risk. According to the local administration, river erosion has severed links to the Hoper, Hisper and Nagar Khas areas on Thursday, with access roads submerged or washed away.
Flooding from the Supultar Nallah has once again damaged the RCC bridge and agricultural land in Tokorkot, while water from the Hamari Nallah and Supultar Nallah has cut off drinking and irrigation water supplies to most residents in Nagar Khas and Hoper.
The surge of glacial water near the Hamorkhay area has led to continued erosion, endangering homes in nearby villages. In Upper Hunza, rising water levels in the Khunjerab River have caused the destruction of power infrastructure, with two electricity poles submerged, cutting off the electricity supply to several villages in Gojal.
The situation has also affected irrigation and drinking water systems, crops and bridges, leaving the residents of Nagar and Hunza districts without essential services like water, electricity and road access.
In Gilgit, the increasing water levels in the Shigar River have damaged the K2 Road, leaving hundreds of residents and foreign tourists stranded. Officials said the melting Baltoro Glacier had rapidly increased the volume of water in nearby rivers and streams, further exacerbating the situation.
Flash floods in Babusar Valley, Chilas, also caused significant damage, with 10 homes destroyed and crops damaged. The Karakoram Highway, which had been blocked in Chilas, was reopened for traffic on Thursday, allowing thousands of stranded passengers, including tourists, to continue their journeys.
Rising water levels in the Jutal area in Gilgit have damaged homes and farmland, with many people living near rivers facing the imminent threat of flooding. Local officials have warned that the situation remains precarious, with many areas still without power, water and proper access routes.
The Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) expressed fears of a major water crisis in the region due to climate change, which is causing a decrease in snowfall and rapid melting of glaciers.
Geo-fenced SMS alerts
Meanwhile, Jazz and the NDMA have partnered to deliver geo-fenced SMS alerts to millions of citizens in flood-risk areas. The alerts, part of the Disaster Early Warning System (DEW-3), are designed to enhance public awareness and enable timely evacuations or precautionary measures in flood-prone areas.
Under the agreement, more than 23 million Jazz users residing in regions identified as vulnerable by the NDMA will receive location-based alerts, ensuring that citizens are informed of impending flood risks.
