The FIDIC Asia-Pacific Awards honour excellence in consulting engineering across the region, spotlighting outstanding projects, emerging leaders, and industry strength, according to its website. Winners are announced at the Asia Pacific Infrastructure Conference in three categories: Powerhouse Awards, Outstanding Project Awards, and Emerging Leaders Awards.
The award to the Quetta International Airport Runway Reconstruction p[oject was conferred at the FIDIC Asia Pacific Conference 2025 held from July 15-17 in Islamabad.
“This distinguished accolade recognises the successful delivery of Pakistan’s longest and structurally largest rigid runway, executed in sectional phases on an operational joint-user airfield,” the PAA statement said.
“Remarkably, the project was delivered with zero claims, zero safety incidents, and no closure of operations, setting a new benchmark in aviation infrastructure development.”
The award was jointly conferred upon the PAA and the project consultants in “recognition of their effective collaboration, technical expertise, and commitment to safety and efficiency throughout the project lifecycle.”
The upgraded runway was completed at an estimated cost of Rs5 billion, and received its first flight PK-3250 from Islamabad on May 31, 2023.
Further underscoring the project’s significance, Palomino Elvira, a FIDIC-accredited international mediator and advisor on global construction contracts, extended an invitation to the PAA to present the project as a case study at upcoming FIDIC conferences in South Africa and France later this year, the PAA said.
This recognition marks a proud moment for Pakistan’s aviation and engineering sectors, placing PAA’s excellence on a global stage, the statement added.</p><small>2025-07-22 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/22114957145534c.jpg?r=115229' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/officials-say-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-amid-gb-floods-govt-issues-landslide-alert' target='_blank'><strong>Officials say over 200 stranded tourists rescued amid GB floods; govt issues landslide alert</strong></a><br><p>Over 200 trapped tourists have been rescued in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district after flash floods triggered by heavy rain swept through the district, the local government spokesperson said on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued a landslide alert amid floods triggered by heavy rains.
A day ago, at least four tourists were killed, two others injured, and 15 went missing due to the floods in GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district. The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region.
The provincial government spokesperson, Faizullah Faraq, said in a statement,  “More than 200 rescued tourists have been shifted to Chilas and provided shelter in hotels and guest houses.”
He added that the tourists were now able to contact their families after being stranded for hours.
Faraq detailed that rescue operations were still underway to look for missing tourists, while the deceased ones have been identified.
“The military is participating in the rescue operation and evacuating tourists to safer places,” he said, adding that helicopters will be brought in for rescue, if necessary,“ he said in the statement.
Speaking to Dawn.com, the GB govt spokesperson said, “Babusar road was still blocked due to heavy mud on the road, but authorities have been instructed to reach the area”.
On Monday, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed told Dawn that 20 to 30 tourists from different parts of the country might be missing.
According to rescue authorities in Skardu’s WhatsApp channel, three people were injured due to the flood in Sadpara, while the deluge has also hit the Kharmang district.
“The rescue operation was launched again at 6am today,” AFP reported the spokesperson as saying.
 
 

Meanwhile, spokesperson for the Baltistan Division Police Department Ghulam Muhammad said in a statement that “In Deosai, 413 tourist vehicles were stranded on the road connecting Sapara and Deosai, after it was closed at ten different points due to the floods.”
The spokesperson said, “Heavy rain in Skardu triggered flash floods in Barge Nullah, Dhagyol Nullah and Shagri Bala Nullah on the outskirts of the city.”
“The flood water entered homes and caused severe damage to public infrastructure and crops,” he added.
According to his statement, the stranded people have been rescued by the police and shifted to Skardu in the morning after the damaged roads were restored overnight.
Outlining the damage, the GB govt spokesperson said that “more than 50 houses have been damaged in the flood since yesterday.”
In Babusar, a wheat depot, a girls’ school, a police checkpoint, a tourism police shelter, and four bridges have been washed away, while two mosques and a windmill have also been damaged.“
A local social worker, Muhammad Ali, told Dawn.com that, “Thirty vehicles were swept away by the floods, and most people have been rescued by the locals.”
Faraq shared that construction has begun on the restoration of highways and connecting roads, after the floods damaged a portion of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), leaving thousands of tourists and passengers stranded on both sides.
NDMA issues landslide alert amid heavy rains
According to an NDMA advisory, the following areas in the country’s north may potentially face landsliding: Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Astore, Diamer, Ghanche in GB, Muzaffarabad, Neelum, Haveli, Bagh, Poonch in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Chitral, Dir, and Kohistan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In these areas, the following roads have been identified as prone to landsliding: Kohistan Road, Kolai Palas Road, Jaglot Road, Nagar Road, Hunza Road, Tatta Pani Road, Jaglot Skardu Road.
The NDMA advised citizens to avoid travelling to mountainous areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.
 






On June 26, the GB Disaster Management Authority issued a warning of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof) and flash floods. The public and tourists were advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.
Rain-related death toll rises to 221
According to the NDMA, 221 people have been killed and more than 500 others injured in incidents linked to nearly a month of heavy monsoon rains, AFP reported on Tuesday.
“Since June 26 up to July 21, 221 people have lost their lives, including 104 children and 40 women,” a spokesperson from the national disaster management agency told AFP.
In June, at least 13 tourists were swept to their deaths in Swat while sheltering from flash floods on a raised river bank.
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country.</p><small>2025-07-22 08:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/22131820fc34ebe.png?r=132055' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925842/visiting-the-us-will-soon-require-a-250-visa-integrity-fee-says-report' target='_blank'><strong>Visiting the US will soon require a $250 ‘visa integrity fee’, says report</strong></a><br><p>The United States will soon require international visitors to pay a “visa integrity fee” of at least $250, a new addition to existing visa application costs, according to a provision in the Trump administration’s recently enacted domestic policy bill, CNN reported on Tuesday.
In the fiscal year 2024, the US issued nearly 11 million non-immigrant visas according to the State Department. These encompass international students, many leisure and business travellers and other temporary visitors.
The new fee will apply to all visitors requiring non-immigrant visas to enter the US. This does not include tourists and business travellers from countries that are included in the Visa Waiver Programme — including Australia and many European countries — that do not need visas for stays of 90 days or less.
The fee is to be paid at the time visas are issued. Although there will be no fee waivers for the payment, the provision states that travellers who comply with the terms of their visa can have the fee reimbursed after their trip.
Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown PC law firm’s immigration attorney, Steven A. Brown, said in a post, “The intent behind this refund provision is to incentivise compliance with US immigration laws by treating the $250 as a refundable security deposit — essentially rewarding those who follow the rules.”
However, he added that the refund is not automatic and that “the burden will likely fall on the visa holder to prove compliance” in an as-yet-undefined refund application process.
“Until those procedures are announced, employers and foreign nationals should treat the $250 visa integrity fee as a non-refundable upfront cost and plan accordingly. If a refund becomes viable in the future, it may provide an added benefit — but for now, it remains a theoretical incentive awaiting implementation guidelines.”
In an email to CNN, Brown noted that the purpose of the fee was unclear, saying that in general, immigration fees were meant to cover adjudication or issuance expenses, but that theoretically, all visa integrity fees could be refunded in a “perfect world” with no overstays or violations.
No specific information has been provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding the refund process or other aspects of the policy, including when it will be rolled out.
“The visa integrity fee requires cross-agency coordination before implementation,” a DHS spokesperson told CNN.
A State Department spokesperson said that details of the change, implemented by DHS, would be posted on the State Department’s visa information page.
The spokesperson said that the purpose of the fee was to “support the administration’s priorities of strengthening immigration enforcement, deterring visa overstays, and funding border security.”
The initial fee for the 2025 fiscal year has been outlined as either $250 or “such amount as the Secretary of Homeland Security may establish, by rule”, whichever amount is greater. The fee is subject to annual adjustments for inflation.
The bill provision added that fees that were not reimbursed would be “deposited into the general fund of the treasury”.
The US Travel Association, a nonprofit organisation, called the new visa fee “a giant leap backwards” despite praising other aspects of the domestic policy bill.
The senior vice president of government relations for the association, Erik Hansen, said in a statement that the fee “adds an unnecessary financial barrier for international visitors”.
The association calculated that the fee would boost the upfront costs of visiting the US by 144pc.
“Even if it is technically reimbursable, the added complexity and cost will discourage visitors,” Hansen said.
Meanwhile, the CEO of the association, Geoff Freeman, called the fee a “foolish” move that undercut otherwise smart investments in travel infrastructure and security, according to a statement on US Travel SmartBrief.
He argued that imposing new costs on travellers “undermines efforts to attract international visitors and support the US economy”, the statement said.</p><small>2025-07-22 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/221253284813eff.jpg?r=125621' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925840/children-among-5-killed-in-swat-flash-floods-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>Children among 5 killed in Swat flash floods: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>At least five people, including children, lost their lives in rain-related incidents across in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district on Monday as torrential rains triggered flash floods and landslides in various parts of the region.
Monsoon rains continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities. Several people have been killed and injured amid heavy rains induces flash floods and landslides.
According to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Shafiqa Gul, a woman and her two sons drowned while attempting to cross a stream in Sur Dherai area of Malam Jabba.
“The mother, holding her 10-month-old baby in her lap, was trying to guide her 7-year-old son across the stream when a flash flood struck. In the chaos, she lost control, and the child in her lap was swept away,” Gul said.
Rescue teams, along with local residents, launched a search and rescue operation and recovered the bodies after hours of coordinated effort.
In a separate incident in Gujar Band Shanko area of Madyan, a house collapsed due to heavy rainfall, claiming the lives of three children and seriously injuring a woman.
Upon receiving the emergency call, Rescue 1122 teams rushed to the scene and retrieved the victims from the rubble with assistance from local volunteers. They were later taken to Civil Hospital Madyan, where the injured woman is under critical care.
Authorities have issued advisories urging residents, particularly those living in mountainous or low-lying areas, to exercise extreme caution during the ongoing monsoon season.
The district administration is closely monitoring weather patterns and has mobilised emergency services to respond to any further incidents caused by the relentless rains.
Damages as rain spell hits KP
A new spell of monsoon rains on Monday hit several parts of the province, damaging houses and crops and suspending traffic.
The high flood in Chitral River triggered by the fast melting of glaciers washed six houses and a large chunk of the farmlands of Junali Koch village near Booni town.
In Yarkhon Valley of Upper Chitral, heavy rains wreaked havoc in Arakhan village in Mirgram and severely damaged dozens of houses. According to residents of the affected villages, a large number of livestock were washed away by the flash floods.
Similarly, the Chitral River was flooded, leaving houses and infrastructure in Ayunand and other low-lying areas of Lower Chitral at risk of damage.
In Bajaur tribal district, authorities closed the Jar Bypass Road, which connects the district to the rest of the country via the main Bajaur-Munda Road, to traffic after heavy rains triggered flooding.
District authorities urged people to use Khar-Qazfi Bypass Road to avoid any potential incidents. Rescue 1122 stated that rescuers have been deployed to deal with any emergency eventuality.
The downpour damaged road infrastructure and bridges in some areas and caused suspension of traffic on Darra Tang Road. Goods and public transport vehicles travelling between KP and Punjab were stranded, adding to the troubles of transporters and commuters.</p><small>2025-07-22 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/22114000178714e.jpg?r=114057' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925832/iran-fm-says-tehran-will-not-abandon-nuclear-enrichment' target='_blank'><strong>Iran FM says Tehran will not abandon nuclear enrichment</strong></a><br><p>Iran has no plans to abandon its nuclear programme, including uranium enrichment, despite “severe” damage to its facilities after US strikes last month, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Monday.
For now, enrichment “is stopped because, yes, damages are serious and severe”, Araghchi told Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier”.
“But obviously we cannot give up enrichment because it is an achievement of our own scientists,” he continued, calling it a source of “national pride”.
He stressed that any future nuclear deal would have to contain the right to enrichment.
 


When asked whether any enriched uranium had been saved from the strikes, Araghchi said he had “no detailed information”, but that Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation is “trying to evaluate what has exactly happened to our nuclear material, to our enriched material”.
Washington bombed three nuclear facilities in Iran on June 22 to support Israel’s 12-day military offensive, including the Fordow underground uranium enrichment site located south of Tehran.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called the strikes a success that “completely destroyed” the sites, lashing out at media reports citing intelligence findings of more conservative assessments.
Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. A US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”.
Araghchi, while saying there was no military solution to the dispute over Iran’s programme, told Fox News that “yes, facilities have been destroyed. They are severely destroyed”.
“But the technology is there, our nuclear programme, our enrichment programme, is not something imported from outside that can be destroyed by bombings,” he said.
Trump welcomed Araghchi’s comments in a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday.
“Just like I said, and we will do it again, if necessary!” posted the US president.
Araghchi’s remarks come as Tehran is set to hold new talks on its nuclear programme with Germany, France and the United Kingdom on Friday in Istanbul.
Regarding negotiations with the United States to de-escalate regional tension, Araghchi said “we are open to talks” but “not direct for the time being”.
“We are ready to do any confidence-building measure needed to prove that Iran’s nuclear programme is peaceful” in exchange for lifted US sanctions, he added.
 
 

The foreign minister also confirmed that Iran would continue to develop and manufacture missiles.
Despite multiple barrages of missiles launched at Israel and waves of Israeli attacks on its bases and launchers, Araghchi said, “We still have a good number of missiles to defend ourselves”.
Baier also asked about the health of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has rarely been seen since the start of Israel’s attack.
“I met him today, he is in a very good shape and in a very good health,” Araghchi said.</p><small>2025-07-22 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/22110606b008037.png?r=110627' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925820/pakistan-signs-un-pact-to-conserve-marine-biodiversity-in-areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan signs UN pact to conserve marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Monday signed a United Nations (UN) agreement aimed at conserving marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
In 2015, Pakistan’s seabed territory grew by about 50,000 square kilometres after a UN body accepted Islamabad’s claim for extension of sea limits.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar signed the “Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction” (BBNJ Agreement) at the UN Headquarters in New York.
The BBNJ pact is the third implementing agreement under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), which was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994.
 






Pakistan signing the BBNJ agreement “reflects on its commitment to multilateral cooperation and protection and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction”, the FO noted in a statement.
The BBNJ agreement was adopted on 19 June 2023 by an intergovernmental conference.
“Pakistan played a leading role in the negotiations to finalise the treaty,” the FO highlighted in a post on X.
“As chair of the Group of 77 and China during the two main sessions, Pakistan, representing developing countries, endeavoured to promote equity, in line with the principle of the common heritage of humankind.”
 






The FO statement recalled that Pakistan “consistently advocated for fair benefit-sharing, capacity-building, and technology transfer”.
According to the UN, the BBNJ agreement addresses four main issues:

Marine genetic resources, including the fair and equitable sharing of benefits
Measures such as area-based management tools, including marine protected areas
Environmental impact assessments
Capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology.

The Unclos, under which the BBNJ pact falls, lays down a “comprehensive regime of law and order for the world’s oceans, establishing rules for the allocation of states’ rights and jurisdiction in maritime spaces, the peaceful use of the oceans and the management of their resources”.
 
 

Within Pakistan’s territory, Churna Island was last year designated as the country’s second-ever marine protected area in a bid to preserve its unique but eroding biodiversity.
In 2020, experts found “amazing wildlife”, well-diversified bird fauna, rich marine habitat and dozens of species of corals at Astola Island in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-07-22 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/22112155b6d5d8b.png?r=112215' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925824/at-least-27-dead-mostly-children-in-bangladesh-air-force-jet-crash' target='_blank'><strong>At least 27 dead, mostly children, in Bangladesh air force jet crash</strong></a><br><p>At least 25 children were among the 27 dead pulled from scorched buildings after a Bangladesh Air Force jet on a training mission crashed into a college and school campus in Dhaka, officials said on Tuesday, with 88 people being treated in hospital.
The F-7 BGI aircraft crashed soon after it took off at 1:06pm (12:06pm PKT) on Monday from the airbase in Kurmitola in the capital on a routine training mission. The military said the plane experienced a mechanical failure.
Visuals showed rescue workers scouring the charred buildings for debris as distressed family members surrounded the site.
Sayedur Rahman, special assistant to the chief adviser on health, told reporters that 27 people had died and 88 were admitted to hospital with burn injuries. Those dead included 25 children, a teacher and the pilot.
The government announced a day of mourning, with flags at half-mast and special prayers at all places of worship.
The F-7 BGI is the final and most advanced variant in China’s Chengdu J-7/F-7 aircraft family, according to Jane’s Information Group. Bangladesh signed a contract for 16 aircraft in 2011 and deliveries were completed by 2013.
The incident comes as neighbour India is still grappling with the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade after an Air India plane crashed into a medical college hostel in Ahmedabad last month, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 on the ground.</p><small>2025-07-22 06:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/221143300fc2f84.png?r=114520' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925738/newcastle-legend-solano-set-to-become-pakistan-head-coach' target='_blank'><strong>Newcastle legend Solano set to become Pakistan head coach</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Nolberto Solano’s last managerial job might have not gone too well but the Newcastle United legend will look to turn a page on that when he takes over as the head coach of Pakistan’s senior and under-23 teams next month.
Solano is the first major appointment by the freshly-elected Pakistan Football Federation leadership with president Mohsen Gilani telling Dawn on Monday that he expected the former Peru winger to help the national team reach new heights.
“He will bring more zest and energy to the national team … especially in our style of play,” Mohsen added, noting Solano’s experience as the assistant coach of the Peruvian national team.
During his seven-year stint as assistant to Ricardo Gareca, Solano helped his country qualify for their first FIFA World Cup appearance in 36 years as Peru made it to the 2018 tournament in Russia.
 






Solano, who also helmed the under-23 side, stayed till 2022, leaving after Peru fell to Australia in an intercontinental playoff for the World Cup that year in Qatar.
Since then he’s had unimpressive spells with Swedish second-tier side AFC Eskilstuna and Blyth Spartans in England’s seventh tier. In the latter, he was sacked after just six games.
The Pakistan job offers Solano, who was nicknamed ‘Maestrito’ [Little Master] by Argentine icon Diego Maradona during his playing days, a chance to rebuild his coaching career and his immediate assignment would be taking charge of the under-23 team.
Pakistan are due to face hosts Cambodia, Iraq and Oman in Group ‘G’ in the qualifiers for the 2026 AFC Under-23 Asian Cup in September.
With the senior team, Solano will take over from Stephen Constantine and oversee the remainder of Pakistan’s 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying campaign, starting with a double-header against Afghanistan in October.
Constantine, who famously led Pakistan to their first-ever victory in a World Cup qualifier in October 2023, had been on a game-to-game basis with the team after his one-year contract ended in November last year. The Englishman has applied for the vacant head-coach job in India.

The Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill 2024, introduced by PPP Senator Shahadat Awan, seeks to amend Sections 292 to 294 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The bill has defined obscenity as per Article 37(g) of the Constitution, which states: “[The State shall:] prevent prostitution, gambling and taking of injurious drugs, printing, publication, circulation and display of obscene literature and advertisements”.
Under the proposed changes, Section 292 would increase the penalty for publishing, producing, exhibiting, distributing, or selling obscene material from a three-month sentence and an unspecified fine to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of Rs200,000. A proviso clarifies the law does not apply to religious content or objects used for religious purposes.
Section 293 would raise the punishment for selling obscene material to individuals under 20 years from six months’ imprisonment or fine to two years and Rs100,000 in fines. Amendments to Section 294, which pertains to obscene acts and songs in public, would increase the penalty from three months to one year and introduce a Rs100,000 fine.

PTI leader wants parliamentary probe into sugar scandal, influence of sugar cartel in power corridors

The Senate also passed the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils (Amendment) Bill, moved by Senator Khalil Tahir. It raises the eligibility period for membership in provincial and Islamabad bar councils from five to ten years. Candidates must also have 15 years of advocacy experience and a minimum of 30 decided cases not involving government representation.
PTI’s Barrister Ali Zafar opposed the timing, saying changes should take effect after upcoming bar elections. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar noted the election schedule would be issued in October and said the amendment had backing from all six bar councils.
Another key bill passed was the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals (Amendment) Bill, tabled by PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwalla. It proposes establishing a commission to support journalists facing violence and threats. PTI supported the bill, with Barrister Zafar stating journalism had become one of the most dangerous professions in Pakistan.
The other bills passed by the House included “The State-Owned Enterprises (Governance and Operations) (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024”, “The Abandoned Properties (Management) (Amendment) Bill, 2024”, “The National Institute of Health (Re-organisation) (Amendment) Bill, 2024”, “The Islamabad Capital Ter­ritory Charities Registration, Regulation and Facilitation (Amendment) Bill, 2023”, and “The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2024”.
Social media age restriction
Also, various other bills, including the one seeking to regulate social media access for individuals aged less than 16, were introduced in the House. The bill seeks to reduce the risks of underage people of cyberbullying, harmful content, and online exploitation, besides providing for young users’ privacy, and preventing commercial exploitation and data breaches.
While speaking on a motion on Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP), PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Zafar demanded immediate action against all those involved in the sugar scandal and called for submission of a comprehensive report by a parliamentary body to the Senate within 14 days.
 
 

“Let us not delude ourselves: this mafia is not operating from the shadows. It sits within the ranks of this very government. The beneficiaries of this scandal are not hidden; they sit in power, and the people know it,” he alleged.
He said citizens could no longer afford to survive. “Why is this burden being dumped upon the people in the name of the IMF? Why is there no transparency in the working of Ogra and Nepra? Why is there no accountability? The answer is simple but shameful: the sugar mafia controls the government and the government serves them,” the PTI leader said.
He sought formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the sugar scandal and the extent of the sugar mafia’s influence within the corridors of power.
Senator Danesh Kumar of BAP echoed the concerns, calling CCP ineffective against such cartels.
In response, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the CCP’s Cartels and Trade Abuse Department had completed 20 inquiries across key sectors, while the Office of Fair Trade had conducted 13 probes into deceptive practices. Since October 2023, the CCP’s Market Intelligence Unit uncovered 170 potential cases of anti-competitive behaviour in 28 sectors, including real estate, telecom, and banking.
Mr Aurangzeb urged the Senate Finance Committee to summon the CCP chairman and request a full progress report for the past two years. “For CCP to be effective, it must act proactively —not just reactively,” he admitted.

The horrific video of the incident went viral on Sunday, prompting a countrywide outcry. Baloc­histan Police chief Moa­zzam Jah Ansari told Dawn the woman’s family and her tribe members were allegedly involved in the murder as they killed her and her partner for allegedly having a relationship out of wedlock. The man who shot and killed the woman was her brother, the IGP said.
On Sunday, it was reported that the woman and the man had contracted a love marriage, and they were invited by their families on the pretext of a feast, where they were informed about the decision of the jirga.
Separately, a court ordered the police to exh­ume the bodies and conduct an autopsy, while an anti-­t­errorism court granted physical remand of Sardar Sher­baz Satak­zai to police for two days.
Balochistan High Cou­rt Chief Justice Rozi Khan Bareech also took notice of the double murder in Quetta’s Digari area, summoning the province’s top security officials.
 
 

According to a statement, the CJ summoned the additional chief secretary for home and the police chief to appear before the court on Tuesday.
‘Justice to be served’
In a press conference at the Chief Minister’s House, CM Sarfraz Bugti said over a dozen people, including tribal elder Sherbaz, had been arrested over the past 24 hours in connection with the incident. “Over a dozen suspects were present at the site of the killing, and police are conducting raids for more arrests,” CM Bugti said, adding that all those involved in this barbaric act would be brought to justice.
“We will make sure that all of them are prosecuted,” CM Bugti said at the presser. The chief minister claimed the man and woman were not married to each other, adding that the woman had five children and the man had four or five children from separate marriages. The CM said “a wrong impression” had been created in other parts of the country that they were killed on the order of a tribal jirga for getting married of their own choice.
“No one has a right, no matter what, to kill someone in such a painful and disgusting way, and then film it on video,” he said, adding, “It is a crime and murder and the people involved in this act must be punished.”
The chief minister said the government had suspended the DSP of the Special Branch for not relaying information about the incident, which occurred three days before Eid. The victims’ families did not inform anyone about the incident, he said, adding that when police and law enforcement agencies went to the village to make arrests, the men fled while the women pelted the police with stones.
The CM said jirgas were part of the tribal society, but it was the job of the government to fulfil its responsibilities in such cases and discourage such decisions.

The men were convicted in 2015 of murder, conspiracy, and waging war against the country over the attacks during the evening rush hour of July 11, 2006 that also injured more than 800 people. Five were sentenced to death, while the other seven were given life imprisonment.
But, 10 years later, the Bombay High Court set aside a lower court’s verdict and acquitted the 12 men.
Justices Anil Kilor and Shyam Chandak said in their judgement, the prosecution had  “utterly failed to establish the offence beyond the reasonable doubt against the accused on each count”.
The men were ordered to be released from jail “if they are not required to be detained in any other case”. The prosecution can appeal against the order in the Supreme Court.
A total of seven blasts ripped through the trains after the bombs, packed into pressure cookers, were placed in bags and hidden under newspapers and umbrellas.
Prosecutors said the devices were assembled in Mumbai and deliberately placed in first-class coaches to target the city’s wealthy Gujarati community.
They said the bombings were intended as revenge for the riots in the western state of Gujarat in 2002, which left some 2,000 people dead, most of them Muslims.
Prosecutors accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being behind the attacks, although a little-known outfit called the Lashkar-e-Qahhar later claimed responsibility.

However, the video is from June 2025 and is not linked to the military.
There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. Last week, three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus came under fire in Kalat.
Security forces routinely conduct operations against militancy in the province.
On July 17, an anti-state account on X shared a video showing a convoy of buses moving along a road, with the word “Quetta” displayed in the top-right corner, implying the location.
The caption of the post read: “Breaking News: Big win for Republic of Balochistan. We told you Balochistan is too big to swallow. Over 500 Pakistani army and police personnel who refused to fight against Baloch freedom fighters are reportedly being transported back to Punjab in convoys of buses. These surrendered soldiers are now expected to face court-martial proceedings upon their return — a rare and significant development highlighting internal dissent within the security forces deployed in Balochistan.”
Notably, the post did not mention the source of the alleged development or provide any link to a credible news report about the matter. It also did not provide other specific contextual details such as which regions or regiments the alleged security personnel were posted in or when the video was from.
The post was viewed 132,000 times.
The clip with the same claim was also shared by other users, including Indian propaganda accounts, as can be seen here, here, here and here, gaining 207,000, 212,000, 245,000, and 97,000 views, respectively.
Other shares of the same claim can be found here, here, here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality, keen interest in Balochistan’s security issues and the potential to adversely influence public perception, impacting the province’s law and order situation.
While there was no possible way to conclusively determine the passengers in the buses, since the windows seemed to be covered up and the video did not show passengers getting on or off, the claim linked to the video raised more questions than it answered.
Notably, the video did not show any military or police presence or vehicles escorting the convoy of buses.
One of the buses also showed an electronic car for children among the luggage at the top of the vehicle.
 


A keyword search for the transport companies whose buses were shown in the video yielded two TikTok accounts for “Al Yasir Movers”, both of which said the business operated on the route from Quetta to Taftan, a border town with Iran.
Contacting the account owner on the number provided, he also said the service operated only on the above route.
Moreover, the video features a board of Chaghi LPG Pvt Ltd, a gas importer based in Balochistan. Contacting a company representative for comment, they said that it operated its services, including billboards and signage, only in and around Taftan.
 


The same was also corroborated by Dawn‘s Quetta correspondent, Saleem Shahid. He confirmed that the company’s boards were set up in Dalbandin and Noshki. Both towns are located along the Quetta-Taftan route.
A reverse image search led to the same clip posted by a TikTok account on June 22, almost a month before the current situation in Balochistan.
A frame-by-frame analysis confirmed that the viral clip and the originally shared video were the same.
The TikTok account frequently shares similar videos of buses and other vehicles travelling on deserted roads. The context of these videos remains unclear due to the lack of captions or accompanying explanations, as the account does not provide any context, but none of them feature army vehicles or personnel.
Additionally, a keyword search yielded no news reports from credible media outlets or source-based accounts regarding the return of 500 security personnel for insubordination and refusing to fight in Balochistan either during the current timeframe or from around when the video was originally shared on June 22.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows hundreds of Pakistan Army and police personnel being taken back to Punjab for disciplinary proceedings for refusing to fight in Balochistan is false.
The video does not show any military vehicles or any army presence and the account that originally shared it shares many similar videos of convoys and transport vehicles without any presence of security forces.

The proceedings, scheduled to continue until July 24, centre on a series of online allegations made by Mr Raja against the retired intelligence officer, which Brigadier Naseer claims are defamatory and untrue.
Mr Raja, who runs a YouTube channel and has positioned himself as a whistleblower, is accused of making multiple defamatory statements on social media, including allegations of corruption, electoral interference, judicial manipulation, and human rights abuse, all of which Brigadier Naseer strongly denies.
Brigadier Naseer appeared in person in the court, whereas Mr Raha appeared via video link. Mr Raja’s witness former accountability tsar Shehzad Akbar appeared in person, whereas Shaheen Sehbai and Syed Akbar Hussian appeared online from the US.
 
 

Naseer told the UK High Court that he and his family had faced threats to their lives, harassment, abuse, and serious breaches of privacy following online allegations made by Major (retd) Adil Farooq Raja.
Testifying on the opening day of the four-day trial in London, Brigadier Naseer described the personal and professional impact of nearly a dozen online publications made by Mr Raja.
He was cross-examined by Simon Harding, counsel for the defendant, while Mr Raja appeared remotely via Zoom. Among Mr Raja’s witnesses were former Assets Recovery Unit (ARU) head Shehzad Akbar, who attended in person, and journalist Shaheen Sehbai and Syed Akbar Hussain, who joined online from the United States.
Brigadier Naseer told the court: “False lies were spread about me, posing dangers to me and my family. My daughter had an offer from the King’s College London and so did my son from another UK university, but I was concerned after what Adil Raja did to me and decided to send them to the US for higher studies. I have family and friends in the UK, friends from the UK intelligence I have worked with. I was approached by all of them after the defendant started slandering me on social media.”
During cross-examination, Mr Harding pressed Brigadier Naseer on the issue of “serious harm” and asked why he had not produced evidence of the calls he claimed to have received from the UK in response to Mr Raja’s statements.
Mr Naseer responded that although the calls had occurred, he would not provide details to avoid exposing relatives and friends in the UK to what he said was further threats or online abuse.
He added that the harassment had escalated after Mr Raja allegedly published images of his son and family, leading him to change their academic plans. “One of the persons who attempted to assassinate me was a follower of Adil Raja,” he told the court.
“He was arrested and he confirmed he was inspired by Adil Raja’s publications about me and he wanted to kill me. One of the tweets wished death upon my son after his picture and the US university address were published.”
The trial began with the judge seeking clarity on the evidence supporting Mr Raja’s claims, including alleged interference in Pakistan’s 2024 general elections. The court is examining whether the statements qualify as factual claims, opinion, or potentially fake news, and whether they meet the UK legal standards for defences such as truth or public interest.
The case, filed in the King’s Bench Division of the UK High Court, began in August 2022. In 2024, the court ruled that nine out of ten statements made by Mr Raja were defamatory under English law. Mr Raja had attempted to have the case struck out, but this was rejected by the court.
 
 

In April this year, the court ordered Mr Raja to pay over £16,000 in security for costs and legal fees. An additional £6,100 was imposed in May for procedural delays. The trial will now proceed with both parties presenting their witnesses, some of whom will testify remotely.
In a recent pre-trial hearing, Mr Raja alleged that several of his witnesses were facing intimidation and harassment in Pakistan. The court acknowledged the concerns and granted certain protective measures, including permission for remote testimony from overseas locations.
Legal experts say the trial will hinge on whether Mr Raja can substantiate his claims with evidence and whether his statements fall under the UK’s defences of truth and public interest.
The trial continues.</p><small>2025-07-22 05:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/22075547ac1e89e.jpg?r=075701' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925713/iranian-president-to-visit-pakistan-on-july-26th' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian president to visit Pakistan on July 26th</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian will arrive here on July 26.

Khan administration bans night travel to Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>DERA GHAZI KHAN: The district administration of Dera Ghazi Khan on Monday imposed a new security measure under which all traffic is prohibited from entering Balochistan at night, with all public and private veh­icles halted at border che­ckpoints from 5pm ­­till next morning.
From now on, traffic will only be allowed to cross into Balochistan during daylight hours to prevent any untoward incidents, officials said.
The directive by Deputy Commissioner and Chair­man Regional Transport Authority Muhammad Us­­man Khalid’s applies to the major border crossings at Sakhi Sarwar and Bawata.
“The protection of citizens’ lives and property is the top priority, and security measures are being made more effective and comprehensive,” he said.
The move comes as part of a broader security enh­ancement in the region following the killing of ni­­ne bus passengers, all from Punjab, in Balochistan.
In addition to the nighttime travel ban, a formal notification outlined several other protocols.
Officials will conduct video recordings of drivers and passengers on all public transport vehicles at bus terminals before they depart.
Furthermore, vehicles will travel under strict se­­cu­rity in protected convoys.
The directive also mandates that all public transport vehicles be equipped with active CCTV cameras, GPS tracking, and emerge­ncy panic alarms to ensure a swift response in any crisis.
Mr Khalid said that officials have been instructed to provide all necessary facilities to passengers and transport operators who will have to wait overnight at the checkpoints.

The application said the Adiala Jail authorities, particularly the superintendent, have consistently violated IHC’s earlier orders to provide facilities to Mr Khan in accordance with the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978.
Filed through counsels Chaud­hry Zaheer Abbas and Muhammad Usman Riaz Gill, the petition stated despite IHC’s directives and the Punjab government’s notification, jail officials have failed to ensure better facilities based on Mr Khan’s social and political standing.
The petition detailed various grievances, including the denial of visits by family, friends and legal counsel, disconnection from electronic and print media, restriction of phone contact with his sons abroad, and hindrance in accessing personal medical care and clothing.

Local judge issues notice to Adiala SP for not allowing ex-PM’s calls with sons

It also alleged deliberate electricity cuts to Mr Khan’s jail cell and instances of solitary confinement, describing them as tactics to pressure him politically.
Mr Khan, 73, claimed he served Pakistan as an international cricketer, philanthropist and as the country’s 22nd prime minister. Therefore, the denial of his lawful entitlements was not only unconstitutional but also a violation of human dignity and natural justice.
The petition requested the high court to appoint a gazetted officer to oversee the implementation of better facilities and submit weekly reports to ensure transparency and accountability.
The Islamabad High Court is expected to take up the matter in the coming days.
Adiala SP put on notice
In a related development, Spe­cial Judge Shahrukh Arjumand has issued a notice to the Adiala Jail superintendent.
The notice was issued in a contempt of court case for allegedly defying orders regarding WhatsApp call facilities and medical examinations of detainees.
During the hearing, lawyers Zaheer Abbas, Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry and others appeared before the court on behalf of Mr Khan.
They claimed the jail authorities had “blatantly violated” the court’s directives.
The petition stated the court had earlier ordered medical check-ups and permission for WhatsApp calls between Mr Khan and his sons. But the jail administration didn’t comply with the orders.
The lawyers argued the jail authorities’ refusal to conduct Mr Khan’s medical examinations amounted to “deliberate disobedience of judicial orders”.
The counsel contended the actions of the jail superintendent amounted to contempt and fell under Sections 177 and 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which deal with disobedience to lawful orders of public servants and furnishing false information, respectively.
“The jail authorities did not merely delay the implementation of the court’s order, they refused it outright, thereby challenging the authority of the judiciary,” the counsel argued.
Taking notice of the alleged violation, the court ordered the jail superintendent to submit a written response and adjourned the hearing till July 24.

According to the PM Office, the Mr Sharif spoke to the Balochistan CM on Monday, stressing that no one was above the law and instructed that those responsible should be brought to justice.
Meanwhile, a number of PPP lawmakers have submitted an adjournment motion to the National Assembly Secretariat on Monday, seeking a debate on the brutal killing of a man and woman  in Balochistan, in the name of so-called ‘honour’.
The motion demanded that the regular business of the House be adjourned for the purpose of discussing the barbaric killing .

PM, National Party condemn double murder, seek action against those responsible

Such acts are deeply offensive to the cultural and moral values of our society, which emphasise compassion, justice and the sanctity of human life, it said.
The motion urged the House to condemn the crime in the strongest possible terms and urged the federal government to immediately engage with the provincial government to obtain a comprehensive and transparent report, and ensure that those responsible are identified, arrested and prosecuted without delay.
The adjournment motion carried the signatures of MNAs Shazia Marri, Raja Pervez Ashraf, Shahida Rehmani, Mehreen Razzaq Bhutto, Agha Rafiullah and others.
Meanwhile, the National Party has also condemned the killing  and demanded the government to take strict measures to prevent such incidents in future.
In a statement, Ayub Malik, president of the party’s Punjab, said it was very unfortunate that the incident happened weeks ago and authorities turned a blind eye to this.
“The way they were executed clearly indicates that there is the rule of jungle in parts of Balochistan, and it also shows that the culprits have a strong sense of impunity,” the statement said.
Mr Malik demanded that all those involved in these heinous killings should be arrested and punished in accordance with the law.
“In addition to that, the government should strictly implement the ruling of the Supreme Court that declared the Jirga system illegal in the past,” the NP leader said.
He said the government should also ensure that the culprits do not invoke the articles of law related to blood money to avoid punishment. In many such cases, blood money law is invoked, or culprits are simply pardoned.

Commencement of the hydropower project, China’s most ambitious since the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze, was seized by Chinese markets as proof of economic stimulus, sending stock prices and bond yields higher on Monday.
Made up of five cascade hydropower stations with the capacity to produce 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, equal to the amount of electricity consumed by Britain last year, the dam will be located in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo. A section of the river tumbles 2,000 metres in a span of 50km, offering huge hydropower potential.
India and Bangladesh have already raised concerns about its possible impact on the millions of people downstream, while NGOs warned of the risk to one of the richest and most diverse environments on the plateau.

India, Bangladesh raise concerns about dam’s possible impact on millions of people downstream

Beijing has said the dam will help meet power demand in Tibet and the rest of China without having a major effect on downstream water supplies or the environment. Operations are expected sometime in the 2030s.
Broader impact
The Chinese premier described the dam as a  “project of the century” and said special emphasis  “must be placed on ecological conservation to prevent environmental damage,” Xinhua said.
Government bond yields rose across the board, with the most-traded 30-year treasury futures falling to five-week lows, as investors interpreted the news as part of China’s economic stimulus. The project marks a major boost in public investment to help bolster economic growth as current drivers show signs of faltering.
“Assuming 10 years of construction, the investment/GDP boost could reach 120 billion yuan ($16.7 billion) for a single year,” said Citi in a note.  “The actual economic benefits could go beyond that.”  China has not given an estimate on the number of jobs the project could create.
The Three Gorges, which took alm­ost two decades to complete, generated nearly a million jobs, state media reported, though it displaced at least a similar number of people. Authorities have not indicated how many people would be displaced by the Yarlung Zangbo project.
The Yarlung Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra River as it leaves Tibet and flows south into India and finally into Bangladesh. NGOs say the dam will irreversibly harm the Tibetan Plateau and hit millions of people downstream.
The chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Pema Khandu, said earlier this year that such a colossal dam barely 50km from the border could dry out 80pc of the river passing through the Indian state while potentially inundating downstream areas in Arunachal and neighbouring Assam state. Some experts also express concerns for a project in a seismically active zone.

According to data released by the State Bank on Monday, the restrained profit repatriation came as a surprise to many in the financial sector, especially considering the more stable macroeconomic environment in FY25, which saw record remittances of $38.3bn, a current account surplus, a stable exchange rate, and support from the International Monetary Fund.
In contrast, FY23 saw a sharp decline in profit outflows amid a severe economic crisis, dwindling reserves, and tight restrictions on foreign exchange payments. Profit repatriation on foreign direct investment (FDI) in FY23 fell to $1.349bn — a drop of $331m from FY22 — as foreign firms faced challenges in repatriating earnings and managing operations.
While economic indicators improved in FY25, Pakistan still failed to meet its export targets or attract substantial foreign investment. FDI rose just 4.7pc year-on-year to $2.457bn, highlighting lingering investor concerns and a tepid investment climate.

Outflows stood at $2.219bn in FY25 despite improved external conditions and record remittances

The stagnant profit outflow reflects continued foreign investor caution, underscoring Pakistan’s struggle to rebuild investor confidence despite signs of economic recovery.
Sector-wise data showed the power sector posted the highest profit outflows, rising to $399m in FY25 from $246m a year earlier. The sector has faced criticism over its capacity payment model, and the government has recently held negotiations to address structural inefficiencies.
Profit repatriation in the financial sector totalled $383m — nearly half of the $638.6m recorded in FY24, when banks earned record profits by investing in high-yielding government securities offering returns of up to 22pc.The food sector also saw a notable increase, with profit outflows doubling to $306m in FY25 from $154m in FY24. In the oil and gas exploration sector, profit repatriation surged to $146.4m from just $13m in the preceding year, marking the most significant turnaround.

“We urge the parties and the international community to unite in a common effort to bring this terrible conflict to an end, through an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire,” the grouping added in a joint statement.
“Further bloodshed serves no purpose. We reaffirm our complete support to the efforts of the US, Qatar and Egypt to achieve this.” The signatories, which also included Japan, several EU countries, Switzerland and New Zealand, added they were “prepared to take further action to support an immediate ceasefire”.
The statement branded the controversial Israeli-supported aid in Gaza as “dangerous” and said it deprives people of ‘human dignity’. “We condemn the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food,” the statement said.

In a joint statement, 25 states say denial of essential assistance to people is ‘unacceptable’

“The Israeli government’s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable,” it added, urging Israel to “comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law”.
The statement called for the Israeli government “to immediately lift restrictions on the flow of aid and to urgently enable the UN and humanitarian NGOs to do their life saving work safely and effectively”.
The UN said last week that it had recorded 875 people who had been killed in Gaza while trying to get food via the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.
The 25-nation statement also condemned the continued detention of Israeli prisoners by Hamas, demanding “their immediate and unconditional release” and noting that a negotiated ceasefire “offers the best hope of bringing them home”.
Meanwhile, the signatories said they “strongly oppose any steps towards territorial or demographic change in the Occupied Palestinian Territories” and said an Israeli plan to shift Palestinians into a so-called “humanitarian city” was unacceptable.
 
 

“Permanent forced displacement is a violation of international humanitarian law,” they warned.
The statement was also signed by EU Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management Hadja Lahbib.
Israel sends tanks into Deir al-Balah
Israeli tanks pushed into southern and eastern districts of the Gazan city of Deir al-Balah for the first time on Monday, an area where Israeli military claimed Israeli prisoners may be held.
The area is packed with Palestinians displaced during more than 21 months of war in Gaza, hundreds of whom fled west or south after Israel issued an evacuation order, saying it sought to destroy infrastructure and capabilities of Hamas.
Tank shelling in the area hit houses and mosques, killing at least three Palestinians and wounding several others, local medics said.
To the south in Khan Younis, an Israeli airstrike killed at least five people, including a husband and wife and their two children in a tent, medics said.
In its daily update, Gaza’s health ministry said at least 130 Palestinians had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded by Israeli gunfire and military strikes.

“A trilateral consultation” with Russia and China would be held in the Iranian capital to discuss nuclear issues and the potential reimposition of sanctions, foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei told a news conference on Monday.
He accused the West of failing to respect the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. “The European parties have been at fault and negligent in implementing” the nuclear agreement, Mr Baqaei said.
The three European countries have warned that sanctions could be reimposed on Iran if it does return to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme.

Blames Western powers for not respecting 2015 deal

Iran confirmed fresh talks with European powers will be held on Friday in Istanbul.
Iranian diplomats will meet counterparts from Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3.
“In response to the request of European countries, Iran has agreed to hold a new round of talks,” said the foreign ministry spokesperson.
A German diplomatic source said on Sunday the E3 were in contact with Tehran.
“Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon. That is why Germany, France and the United Kingdom are continuing to work intensively in the E3 format to find a sustainable and verifiable diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear programme,” the source said.
Kremlin meeting
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a surprise meeting in the Kremlin with Ali Larijani, top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader on nuclear issues.
Larijani “conveyed assessments of the escalating situation in the Middle East and around the Iranian nuclear programme”, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of the meeting.
Putin had expressed Russia’s “well-known positions on how to stabilise the situation in the region and on the political settlement of the Iranian nuclear programme”, he added.

• ICC not a signatory to UN Sports for Climate Framework, but Cricket Australia and ECB implementing heat policy guidelines, sustainability strategies
KARACHI: The Pakistan Super League has overcome several barriers to become the country’s most lucrative cricket product. But it will not escape the effects of climate change.
Experts have warned that rising global temperatures will impact future editions of the PSL, at least if it is scheduled in the same time as the last one.
Findings from Hit for Six: The Danger Zone, a report compiled by the British Association for Sustainability in Sport (BASIS) and other organisations, show that 17 out of 34 matches of the last edition of the PSL were played in conditions that could, at the very least, result in heat-related fatigue.
The first nine of editions of the PSL were held between February and March, but with Pakistan hosting the Champions Trophy this year, the glitzy T20 event was moved to the summer months of April and May, making it clash with the Indian Premier League.
The brief India-Pakistan skirmishes in May halted the PSL, eventually forcing it deeper into the summer once it restarted.
Initially due to climax on May 18, the season eventually ended a week later on May 25, and next year’s edition is likely to be held in the same time period.
“Estimates show that out of the 34 PSL matches played in 2025, half were played in conditions classified as either meriting ‘Caution’ or ‘Extreme Caution’ on the Heat Index — a measure that combines air temperature and humidity to assess heat-related risk,” said the findings shared with Dawn.
There were 15 days of ‘Caution’ and two days of ‘Extreme Caution’ — including the playoff between eventual champions Lahore Qalandars and Islamabad United.
According to the Heat Index, conditions meriting ‘Caution’ can result in fatigue due to prolonged exposure, while the impact of playing in ‘Extreme Caution’ conditions can lead to sunstroke, muscle cramps or possibly heat exhaustion.
“From match 27 [on May 17] onwards, all matches (including the playoffs) were played under conditions that met the ‘Caution’ or ‘Extreme Caution’ parameters of the Heat Index,” the findings of the report add.
March ‘not an option’
However, the report says that going back to March won’t be an option as the global climate shifts.
“Whilst PSL matches avoided conditions that fell inside the ‘Danger’ categorisation, as the report outlines, rising global temperatures will continue to make weather events like last year’s 50 degree temperatures increasingly likely, with extremes of heat like the 2022 March heatwave over 30 times more likely because of climate change,” it says.
While cricket may not be the most physically intense game, it is among the longest, with 50-over matches lasting up to eight hours. The intense weather conditions mean direct exposure to the sun for long hours.
T20 is the game’s shortest format, but the report’s findings mean it will also have to be played while keeping the climate in mind.
“Like many aspects of our lives and communities, climate change may necessitate changes in cricket in the future as the planet warms,” Dr Kristina Dahl, the vice-president of Climate Central, one of the organisations involved with the study, told Dawn.
“It is dangerous to both players and fans to hold matches when it is extremely hot and humid, so the sport could consider options like holding matches during times of the day or times of the year when it tends to be cooler, or gameplay could be moved to indoor stadiums that can be air conditioned.
“The countries around the world where cricket is typically played tend to be hot places, so the PSL won’t be the only league facing these challenges.”
The proliferation of T20 leagues around the world, which have become financial drivers for their cricketing boards, means a balance has to be found. The carbon footprint of these leagues — emissions from travel, stadium operations, and other activities — remains unknown.
“Carbon pollution is carbon pollution no matter who emits it and where, so the more we can do to reduce personal, institutional, national, and international carbon pollution, the less warming we’ll experience in the future,” adds Dr Dahl. “And the less warming we see, the less disruption we’ll have to sports like cricket.”
Problems across the border
Across the border, the Indian Premier League faces even greater climate danger. Unlike the PSL, it has marked a permanent place in the calendar between March and May.
“More than 36pc of 2025 IPL games took place under ‘Extreme Caution’ conditions, where heat exhaustion becomes a serious threat, with a further 12pc reaching a ‘Danger’ classification where the risk of heatstroke becomes significant,” the report states.
While the International Cricket Council isn’t yet a signatory to the UN Sports for Climate Framework, Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board have been active in implementing new heat policy guidelines and planning sustainability strategies.
Dr Dahl believes more directions from world cricket’s governing body to its members on how to better deal with the impact of climate change. “Measures put in place for players and fans would help to protect them both now and in a warmer future,” she said.
“If, for example, there was a heat index threshold or an air quality threshold above which matches were postponed or cancelled, the number of events that were affected might be small today, but larger in the future as extreme heat conditions become more frequent. But having those measures in place now would prepare the sport for further warming in the years ahead.”

• KP lawmakers allege ‘vote-swapping’ by party leadership to keep members in line
• PML-N nominee bags Punjab seat in by-election
PESHAWAR: After more than 17 months, the Senate finally became whole on Monday as Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa Asse­mbly, following the oath-taking of lawmakers on reserved seats, elected 11 members to the upper house of parliament under a seat-sharing formula inked between the PTI government and the opposition alliance.
As per the arrangement which had been initially opposed by several PTI lawmakers, six seats went to the ruling party and five to the opposition parties, including two each to the PPP and the JUI-F and one to the PML-N.
The election witnessed a 17-month delay due to litigation over reserved seats, which was finally settled with the decision of the Constitutional Bench last month, followed by the ‘controversial’ oath-taking of members on Sunday. The final result was in line with the seat adjustment deal, agreed between the PTI government and the opposition parties.
For the election, six PTI nominees, five opposition picks, and one PTI dissident were in the running. Initially, five disgruntled PTI candidates were vying for the Senate seats, but Irfan Saleem, Mohammad Waqas Ora­kzai, Syed Irshad Hus­sain, and Aisha Bano withdrew after the party leadership convinced them that their candidacy would harm the party.
According to Form-58 released individually to the winning candidates by the returning officer, the ruling PTI won six seats: four general seats and one seat each for women and technocrats. Similarly, the opposition got five senate seats: three general and one each reserved for women and technocrats. PTI winners on the general seats included Murad Saeed with 26 votes, Mirza Afridi with 21 votes, Faisal Javed with 22 votes, and Noorul Haq Qadri with 21 votes. Azam Swati and Robina Naz won the reserved seats with 89 votes each.
PPP’s Talha Mehmood, Niaz Ahmed of the PML-N, and JUI-F nominee Attaul Haq received 18 votes each on general seats, while the technocrat and woman seat respectively went to PPP’s Robina Khalid and Dilawar Khan of the JUI-F. Ms Khalid got 52 votes and Mr Khan got 54 votes.
Vote-swapping allegations
The polling was scheduled to start at 11am; however, it started at 11:26am and ended at 5pm. All 145 members of the KP Assembly polled their votes in an exercise inside the assembly, which was restricted to media persons. Out of 145 polled votes for the general seats, two were declared invalid. Similarly, four and two votes were also declared invalid for seats of women and technocrats, respectively.
Several ruling and opposition members, on the condition of anonymity, told Dawn that their leadership allegedly relied on ‘vote-swapping’ to keep their members in check. This involves the party heads, or their nominees, marking the ballots for them in return for a blank ballot, to ensure that their members do not vote against party lines.
The MPAs, before they went in to cast their vote in the polling booth, received a ballot paper already marked, while leaving behind their own unmarked ballot paper, to be marked and polled by the next person. The practice was in blatant violation of the election rules and transparency, but not the first time such a procedure has been adopted. Both the treasury and opposition lawmakers followed the same process.
This is not the first time such a procedure has been adopted in the Senate election. During the tenure of Perviaz Khattak as the CM, the ruling PTI engaged in this practice, but not the opposition. Before that, the ANP would use covert tactics to keep its lawmakers in check. However, the way this practice had been deployed in Monday polls was unprecedented.
Punjab by-poll
In Punjab, PML-N leader Hafiz Abdul Kareem secured the vacant Senate seat in a by-election held to fill the seat left vacant after the death of Sajid Mir.
Out of 368 total votes, 345 were cast. Hafiz Abdul Kareem emerged victorious with 243 votes, while opposition candidate Mehr Abdul Sattar received 99 votes. Three votes were rejected.
Rana Muhammad Arshad, PML-N’s chief whip, highlighted the unity among government allied parties, stating that members fully adhered to their leadership’s directives.
Rana Arshad said that their 16 MPAs were abroad, so they could not use their right to franchise; otherwise, the ruling coalition’s vote tally would have been even better.

“Today, I discussed with [Ukrainian Security Council chief] Rustem Umerov the preparations for the exchange and another meeting in Turkey with the Russian side. Umerov reported that the meeting is scheduled for Wednesday,” Zelensky said in his daily address on Monday.
He added that more details would be released on Tuesday.
The rival sides met in Istanbul on May 16 and June 2 amid US pressure to agree on a ceasefire. Despite the urging of US President Donald Trump, no breakthrough was made.
Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have so far only agreed to hold prisoner exchanges. And Russia has since launched intense air attacks on Ukraine and seized more frontline territory.
Russia has demanded that Ukraine give up four regions, on top of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. The Kremlin also insists that Ukraine give up any idea of joining the Nato military alliance.
Ukraine has rejected the demands and expressed doubt that Russia wants a ceasefire.
After Trump last week gave Russia 50 days to negotiate a deal or face heavy sanctions — and also renewed arms supplies to Ukraine — the Kremlin said it was ready for more talks.
The two sides exchanged ideas at the earlier talks on what a peace deal could look like, but remain far apart.
“A lot of diplomatic work lies ahead,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier on Monday, commenting on the prospects for a breakthrough.</p><small>2025-07-21 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21162932330c05e.png?r=163020' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925645/at-least-20-killed-171-injured-as-bangladesh-air-force-plane-crashes-into-college-campus' target='_blank'><strong>At least 20 killed, 171 injured as Bangladesh air force plane crashes into college campus</strong></a><br><p>At least 20 people were killed and 171 injured as a Bangladesh air force training jet crashed into a college and school campus in the capital, Dhaka, on Monday after experiencing a technical problem shortly after take-off, according to a military statement.
The F-7 BGI jet took off at 1:06pm (0706 GMT) from the Bangladesh Air Force base in Kurmitola, Dhaka, as part of a routine training mission, but encountered a mechanical failure, said the spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Sami Ud Dowla Chowdhury.
“The pilot … made a valiant attempt to divert the aircraft away from densely populated areas. Despite his best efforts, the aircraft … crashed into a two-storey building belonging to Milestone School and College,” he said.
The pilot was among those killed in the incident, the military said, adding that a committee had been formed to investigate its cause.
The F-7 BGI is the final and most advanced variant in China’s Chengdu J-7/F-7 aircraft family, according to Janes Information Group. Bangladesh signed a contract for 16 aircraft in 2011 and deliveries were completed by 2013.
The Chengdu F-7 is the licence-built version of the Soviet MiG-21.
According to the Daily Star, an emergency hotline (01949-043697) was launched at the National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery following the crash.
The Daily Star further reported that three platoons of the Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB) were deployed to Uttara to assist in law enforcement and rescue operations, according to the BGB headquarters.
It added that the government has declared a one-day state mourning day tomorrow following the crash. The national flag will be flown at half-mast at all government, semi-government, autonomous institutions and educational establishments, as well as at Bangladeshi missions abroad.
“Special prayers will be held in all religious places of worship throughout the country for the injured and deceased,” it said.
Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh’s interim government, said that “necessary measures” would be taken to investigate the cause of the accident and “ensure all kinds of assistance”.
“The loss suffered by the air force […] students, parents, teachers and staff, and others in this accident is irreparable,” he said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his regret over the incident and said Pakistan stood in solidarity with Bangladesh.
 






Fire, despair at crash site
Videos of the aftermath of the crash showed a big fire near a lawn emitting a thick plume of smoke into the sky, as crowds watched from a distance.
Firefighters sprayed water on the mangled remains of the plane, which appeared to have rammed into the side of a building, damaging iron grills and creating a gaping hole in the structure, footage filmed by Reuters showed.
 


“A third-grade student was brought in dead, and three others, aged 12, 14 and 40, were admitted to the hospital,” said Bidhan Sarker, head of the burn unit at the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, where some victims were taken.
Images from the scene also showed people screaming and crying as others tried to comfort them.
“When I was picking [up] my kids and went to the gate, I realised something came from behind … I heard an explosion. When I looked back, I only saw fire and smoke,” said Masud Tarik, a teacher at the school.
The incident comes a little over a month after an Air India plane crashed on top of a medical college hostel in India’s Ahmedabad, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 on the ground, marking the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p><small>2025-07-21 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21221147aaffa1d.jpg?r=221250' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925622/dar-says-pakistan-targeting-60pc-renewable-energy-by-2030-in-line-with-sdgs' target='_blank'><strong>Dar says Pakistan ‘targeting 60pc renewable energy by 2030’ in line with SDGs</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday stated that Pakistan is targeting using 60 per cent renewable energy by 2030 during his address to the General Debate of the Ministerial Segment of the UN High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York, according to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO).
Pakistan assumed the UNSC Presidency for the month of July 2025, making it the country’s eighth term on the Security Council as a non-permanent member. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026. The presidency involves a focus on multilateralism, peaceful dispute resolution, and regional cooperation.
According to the FO, Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and outlined key policy measures driving growth, climate resilience and economic reform in his address.
“The compounding effects of the pandemic, the food, fuel, and finance crises, as well as intensifying climate impacts, have reversed hard-won development gains and deepened inequalities,” the FM said in his speech.
“Despite these challenges, Pakistan remains fully committed to achieving the 2030 Agenda. Our national development strategies, such as Uraan Pakistan, are aligned with the SDGs.”
 






The FM also highlighted initiatives such as the Benazir Income Support Programme and the ‘Living Indus’ and ‘Recharge Pakistan’ initiatives for climate adaptation and renewable energy, the FO’s statement read.
Dar also “emphasised the role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) in aligning foreign direct investment with Pakistan’s development priorities, particularly in sectors critical to sustainable growth”.
“While national efforts are essential, these cannot succeed in isolation. As the Secretary-General has rightly emphasised, deep reform of the international financial architecture is critical for implementing the SDGs,” the FM continued.
“Developing countries need scaled-up access to concessional and grant-based resources, meaningful debt relief, and scaled-up climate finance in order to bridge the SDG Financing Gap.”
Dar meets UN chief, affirms Pakistan’s commitment to multilateralism
During his visit, Dar met with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres at the UN headquarters, according to a statement from the FO.
During the meeting, the FM reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unwavering and resolute commitment to multilateralism and the central role of the UN in addressing the most pressing global challenges”, the statement read.
According to the FO, the secretary general appreciated Pakistan’s presence and initiatives at the UNSC.
Dar emphasised that Pakistan was fully committed to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, especially the need to advance peace through dialogue and diplomacy.
He further stated Pakistan’s commitment to peace was underscored by the high-level debate on multilateralism and peaceful settlement of disputes and the meeting on UN-OIC cooperation, under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UNSC.
 






“The deputy prime minister/foreign minister emphasised issues of critical national and regional importance to Pakistan, particularly the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, violation of the Indus Waters Treaty and externally sponsored terrorism in Pakistan,” the FO stated.
“He stressed the imperative of a just settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council. The DPM/FM lauded the secretary general’s leadership and sincere efforts for de-escalation of recent tensions between Pakistan and India.”
Dar also reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering support for Palestinian statehood, an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and firm opposition to Israeli plans for annexation in the occupied West Bank.
The two men also exchanged views on the need for promoting concessional financing to support development and climate goals, especially for developing countries and mobilising enhanced international support for debt relief and liquidity solutions for the Global South.
“The DPM/FM emphasised that the secretary general’s ‘UN80’ initiative offered a critical opportunity to strengthen the three pillars of the United Nations to promote international peace and security, sustainable development and human rights worldwide,” the statement read, referring to the UN marking its 80th anniversary this year.
According to the statement, Dar welcomed the appointment of a UN special envoy on Islamophobia and expressed readiness to support global efforts to combat religious intolerance.
Earlier, the FO reported that Dar arrived in New York to attend high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency, including a conference on Palestine.
“During the visit, he will lead high-level signature events under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UN Security Council, hold bilateral and multilateral meetings in New York and Washington, DC, and represent Pakistan at the International Conference on the two-state solution, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France,” the FO said.
“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar,
arrived in New York for an official visit from 21 to 28 July 2025,” the FO announced in a post on X.
“During the visit, he will lead high-level signature events under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UN Security Council, hold bilateral and multilateral meetings in New York and Washington, DC, and represent Pakistan at the International Conference on the two-state solution, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France.”
 






It added that upon his arrival, FM Dar was received by Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar, and the Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh.
According to a July 19 statement issued by the FO, Dar will attend a high-level conference on the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution”, to express Pakistan’s strong commitment and unwavering support for the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.
The conference was originally planned for June but was postponed due to the Iran-Israel war, which also led to the rescheduling of Dar’s visit. According to The Guardian, the moot will now be held on July 28 and 29.
Since October 8, Israeli strikes have killed more than 58,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Earlier this month, Pakistan urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Aside from the Palestine conference, Dar is also set to chair a high-level briefing of the UNSC, focused on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
“The meeting is being held as part of Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for maintenance of international peace and security,” the FO statement said.
Dar is expected to have several other bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials, during his stay. He will also meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on July 25.</p><small>2025-07-21 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/211652116dd7723.jpg?r=170942' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925648/aafia-siddiqui-case-ihc-issues-contempt-notice-to-pm-shehbaz-other-federal-cabinet-members' target='_blank'><strong>Aafia Siddiqui case: IHC issues contempt notice to PM Shehbaz, other federal cabinet members</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday issued contempt notices to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other members of the federal cabinet for failing to submit a response in the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui.
Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her sentence at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.
On July 12, the IHC expr­essed dissatisfaction over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report is not presented.
Justice Ishaq presided over a hearing for the case today. The judge said in his court order that he had warned the additional attorney general while passing his previous ruling that further inaction on the part of the government would lead to the issuance of a contempt notice.
“The government filed an appeal before the Supreme Court against my earlier decision permitting amendments to the petition for continuation of this case,” the order read. “For whatever reason, the government’s case had not been taken up by the Supreme Court.”
The judge said that since the government had not responded with the reasons despite being directed to do so, it was in contempt, leaving him with no option but to issue a notice of contempt to the federal government.
“Office is directed to initiate a contempt petition accordingly, in which all the members of the federal government will be respondents. The replies of all the ministers, including the prime minister, shall be filed within two weeks from today,” the order said.
At the outset of his order, the judge said: “Ever since the demolition squad was catapulted into this high court after the 26th Constitutional Amendment, we have seen one heresy after another hurled at the edifice of justice, maiming it repeatedly and bringing it almost to its last breaths. This is yet another instance. The heresy I speak of now is besieging the dispensation of justice by a judge of the high court by the device of the ‘weekly roster’ controlled by the office of the chief justice. It is both heart-rending and amusing at the same time, a blend of paradox that this high court has become.”
Criticising the government’s actions during the current case, he said, “The machinations of the executive appeared elsewhere, in the form of controlling the proceedings of this court through its roster.”
The judge noted that he was supposed to be on leave this week, but was informed that the cause list would not be issued without the leave of the chief justice, to which he submitted an application. He added that he was informed on Saturday that the chief justice did not sign it.
“I was informed on Saturday that the application was duly moved but the file remained on the table of the chief justice, who did not find even 30 seconds to sign it. Whether that was by design or oversight, I cannot say for sure, but given the manner in which the roster of judges has been used as a tool for the desired outcome in specific cases, and given the government’s stiff opposition to do what is right and to stand by the daughter of the nation at the critical juncture of the motion before a US court, I may be forgiven for thinking that it was the former. The correct legal position is that the office cannot use the shoulder of the chief justice in the exercise of administrative powers to obstruct judicial proceedings ordered by a judge in an ongoing case.”
Justice Ishaq called it “yet another instance of the reproachable use of the administrative power to shackle the exercise of independent judicial authority”, stating that the government’s response, with reasons as to why it would not sign the [amicus brief][4] in the case, would likely be delayed until his leave ended.
“However, the imperatives of justice shall not be defeated by such petty means. To the extent I can, I will exercise my judicial authority to the end of upholding the dignity of the high court and the justice it dispenses.”
The hearing
Lawyer Imran Shafiq appeared in court on behalf of the petitioner, Dr Fowzia Siddiqui. Former senator Mushtaq Ahmed was also present at the court.
Justice Ishaq echoed his discontent with how the hearing had been scheduled for today, despite his being on leave. “Even if a judge wants to, they cannot work during holidays,” he remarked.
“My holidays were supposed to start today. Once again, administrative power has been used for judicial power.”
The judge added that he still heard the case because of its nature and importance.
“The government has filed an appeal against my decision in the Supreme Court,” the judge said.
Shafiq noted that if the government had to take a stay, “they would have formed a new bench by now”.
“We know how the court functions. Your order is there, the case is being heard today,” he added, addressing the judge.
When asked why Shafiq had not filed his case with the Supreme Court, he replied, “Because Justice Mansoor Ali Shah is there.”
“The case will only be filed when the roster of judges changes,” Shafiq added.
“The court has no other option but to issue contempt notices to the federal government,” Justice Ishaq ruled.
He stated that the next hearing of the case would be held on the first working day after he returned from leave.</p><small>2025-07-21 13:38</small></div><hr>
