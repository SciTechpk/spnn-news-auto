<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1977310/khameneis-killing' target='_blank'><strong>Khamenei’s killing</strong></a><br><p>THERE is no question about it: with the brutal assassination of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and members of his family in Tehran on Saturday, the US and Israel have chosen the path followed by states gone rogue. They have established a dangerous precedent by killing the head of a sovereign country in cold blood. No consideration of international conventions stopped them and the broader fallout of this egregious crime is a new normal that many other states with similarly reprehensible tendencies may want to adopt.
The late Khamenei had led Iran for decades since the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989. Under him, post-Revolution Iran dealt with the aftermath of a devastating war with Iraq; it witnessed intensifying economic sanctions and unrest; and saw no let-up in tensions with the US and Israel. The ayatollah’s killing mirrors earlier ‘decapitation strikes’ carried out by Israel against Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. An interim governing council is already in place, indicating that Iran was ready for the worst.

 

The late Khamenei was the spiritual guide of millions of Muslims worldwide. The protests following his death, including in Pakistan, were only to be expected. Pakistan has deep cultural and religious links with Iran; millions here followed the religious edicts of the ayatollah who was a Shia marja. Sunday’s violence at the US consulate in Karachi was particularly of concern — at least 10 protesters were killed, with two more deaths in Islamabad.
Meanwhile, hostilities have continued, with targets hit in Iran, while several Gulf countries have reported retaliatory missile and drone strikes. If the US-Israeli aggression continues, it is difficult to see the situation winding down anytime soon.
While Iran’s anger is understandable, there is a need for it to show restraint and refrain from attacking targets in neighbouring countries. The Iranians say they are hitting US interests, but there is always collateral damage in conflict and Iran will find itself further isolated in the region — thus playing right into the hands of the US-Israel combine. There is wisdom, instead, in using diplomatic and political tools and protesting at international forums to put pressure on the guilty.
The Global South, including other Muslim states, should stand with Iran, and condemn both this gross violation of its sovereignty and the perpetrators in unambiguous terms. They should remember that they may be next as Israel and the Trump administration will target anyone who dares to disagree with them. Attempts at regime change have always backfired — it is up to the people of a country to decide the kind of government they want. All Washington and Tel Aviv have achieved is more chaos spreading across the Middle East. The two must be held to account for their bloodstained adventurism.

What began as isolated experiments by a few tech-forward companies has, over the last decade, evolved into a broad-based movement toward digital transformation. Today, backed by government policy and private sector investment, AI is shifting from a novelty to a necessity for businesses aiming to stay competitive.
The history of corporate AI in Pakistan is relatively young, with the pivotal moment arriving in 2017. In a landmark move, the Pakistan Telecommunications Company Limited (PTCL) partnered with the US-based applied AI company Afiniti and PTCL became the first company in Pakistan to “Go-Live” with Afiniti’s behavioural pairing technology at scale. This system used AI to pair callers with suitable agents, improving sales and customer service metrics. That Afiniti had development teams based in Karachi and Lahore highlighted the local talent pool available for high-tech deployments.
In the years following, the seeds of an ecosystem were planted. A 2022 report by CW Pakistan noted that while many local AI engineers were still being hired by foreign giants like Google and Microsoft, a domestic need was emerging.

Without a shift toward algorithmic originality and fundamental research, Pakistan risks remaining a “fast follower” rather than a leader

The report pointed to initiatives such as the Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence & Computing, launched in 2018, which began equipping students and professionals with the skills needed to meet the growing demand. At the university level, institutions like the National Centre of Artificial Intelligence, established in 2018, started funnelling research-driven talent into the pipeline.
But during this gestation period, adoption remained largely experimental. According to Sabih Sheikh, a data scientist quoted in the 2022 CW Pakistan report, numerous Pakistani businesses had implemented AI and machine learning, but the limited availability of clean, structured data remained a significant bottleneck for scaling these solutions.
The current landscape, however, tells a story of rapid acceleration. The year 2025 marked a clear tipping point, driven by a confluence of robust policy frameworks and tangible corporate uptake.
The government moved from rhetoric to action with the enactment of the Digital Nation Pakistan Act in January 2025, which established the Pakistan Digital Authority (PDA) to coordinate national digital initiatives. Building on this, the federal cabinet approved the National Artificial Intelligence Policy 2025 in July, which provides a comprehensive six-pillar framework with ambitious targets.
This policy momentum culminated in the Indus AI Week in February 2026, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced a $1 billion investment plan for AI development by 2030. This includes funding for 1,000 PhD scholarships and a mandate to train one million non-IT professionals in advanced tech skills.
The Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) welcomed the move, with Chairman Sajjad Syed stating that the private sector stands ready to translate the policy into “export-driven, practical realities”.
So, where does the corporate sector stand today? The data suggests a surge in confidence and adoption.
The most compelling evidence comes from the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI). According to the OICCI Business Confidence Index Wave 28, reported in December 2025, overall business confidence has rebounded sharply to over 22 per cent. Crucially, the survey revealed that 43pc of OICCI members, which represent over 200 multinationals, are already adopting generative AI.
Furthermore, a striking 81pc expect AI to manage key business operations soon. This indicates that the largest corporations are not just experimenting; they are integrating AI into their core strategies.
Market research firms are also projecting strong growth across verticals. A report from 6Wresearch titled ‘Pakistan AI and Machine Learning in Business Market (2025-2031)’ identifies financial services, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing as the key end-users fueling the market.
In fintech, for example, global digital operator VONE Group announced a $20m investment in Mobilink Bank in early 2026. Around the same time, Epic Angels, the world’s largest all-female investment collective, backed Karachi-based fintech Neem in a Pre-Series A round.
Meanwhile, Gobi Partners plans to launch Techxila Fund II, targeting $50m to invest in high-potential sectors, including fintech. This momentum is driven by platforms like Raast, which has now taken onboard 48m users and is integrated with 53 banks, as the government pushes to make digital transactions cheaper and easier.
Global tech giants are deepening their roots in Pakistan, validating the country’s potential. SAP, the German software powerhouse, is aggressively expanding its footprint. According to a TechJuice interview, SAP is promoting its cloud-based AI suites, such as RISE with SAP and GROW with SAP, to help local businesses build digital-first, AI-driven models. This focus on enterprise-grade infrastructure is distinct from consumer-focused tech investments and signals a maturation of the market.
Despite optimism, the path to fully-fledged AI integration is fraught with challenges, including a lack of dedicated AI infrastructure and funding beyond academic grants, and a significant skills gap in the workforce.
A critical perspective from TechJuice following the Indus AI Week 2026 noted that while the event was a “polished demo reel”, the country remains firmly in “adoption mode, not invention mode”.
Startups reportedly faced bottlenecks such as limited compute access, scarce proprietary datasets, and infrastructure gaps. It also noted that without a shift toward algorithmic originality and fundamental research, Pakistan risks remaining a “fast follower” rather than a leader.

The initiative is part of the relief package announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to ease cost pressures on the industry, especially exporters. He had also announced a slash in electricity tariffs for industry by Rs4.04 per unit.
Exporters have welcomed the decision to further cut the Export Refinance Facility (ERF) rate as a timely initiative to improve their cash flow and revive their idle production capacity to leverage export growth, while the banking industry described the move as a voluntary, national-interest intervention designed to ease financing costs and strengthen Pakistan’s external account.
“A thoughtful and timely initiative by the prime minister to support the export sector,” Musadaq Zulqarnain, the chairman of Interloop Limited, wrote on X.

Commercial banks, the government and SBP have coordinated to reduce financing costs

However, it is unlikely to translate into higher exports in the near term, nor should this single measure be expected to deliver the desired outcome on its own, without effectively tackling other issues affecting export competitiveness.
The Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA) announced last month that it would slash the ERF rate by 300 basis points to 4.5 per cent for new loans and rollovers. The cost impact of this concession, which is in addition to the existing subsidy being provided by the government, which currently stands at 3pc below the prevailing policy rate of 10.50pc, will be borne by banks in their balance sheets.
The initiative is currently subject to the existing ERF limit of Rs1.05 trillion, the PBA announced. This capacity is designed to be flexible and may increase as and when the State Bank or Exim Bank increases the limit through June 2027, the PBA said.
The reduction has been made possible through a coordinated policy mix in which the State Bank lowered the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) for commercial banks by one percentage point in its last monetary policy determination, releasing more than Rs300 billion in previously idle liquidity into the financial system. This freed-up liquidity allows banks to offset the hit to their bottom lines on account of lower returns on export lending by redeploying funds into other earning assets.
The CRR is essentially a percentage of a commercial bank’s liabilities (deposits) that it must hold with the central bank, without receiving interest. It is often used by central banks as a monetary policy tool by central banks to tighten or free up liquidity in the system instead of doing so by moving interest rates up or down. In its last monetary policy decision, the SBP held its policy interest rate unchanged at 10.5pc. However, it cut the CRR for banks to 5pc from 6pc on a fortnightly average basis while also lowering the daily minimum maintenance requirement to 3pc from 4pc to support the growth.
Analysts say the ERF rate cut reflects an unusual alignment between the government, central bank and commercial lenders to support the export sector at a time when external stability remains a central economic priority.
They note that although lower ERF rates may compress banks’ margins on export-linked lending, the CRR cut effectively offsets this impact by lowering funding costs and expanding lending capacity to absorb the ERF rate reduction without a disproportionate hit to profitability.
With ERF loans representing a relatively small share of total advances, the broader financial stability implications remain limited, while the potential upside for export growth and economic recovery could be significant if implementation remains smooth and targeted.
PBA chairman Zafar Masud acknowledges the role of the CRR cut on banks’ decision to slash ERF rates. “We got the leeway due to favourable CRR adjustment, which we have been asking for a while to boost the market liquidity. Long-term view is to promote exports, which will eventually benefit banks in the medium term.”
According to him, this initiative is not just about numbers. “It is about the banking sector answering the call of the nation. We recognise that export growth is critical for Pakistan’s economic stability. By providing export finance at a highly competitive rate, the sector is proving that it stands firmly behind our exporters.”
This step would certainly leverage export growth by providing much-needed relief to exporters and enabling them to compete more effectively through improved margins, Mr Masud says. “While this may impact banks’ profitability in the short term, taking such a hit on their balance sheets would serve the larger national interest by supporting economic stability and external account sustainability. At the end of the day, it is a win-win proposition for the industry and for the country, and that’s the reality.”
At its core, the ERF rate cut reduces borrowing costs for value-added exporters, strengthening their cash flow and enhancing competitiveness in global markets. “In a country where exporters, especially small and medium-sized firms, routinely struggle with high financing costs, currency volatility, and structural inefficiencies, access to cheaper credit can significantly improve working capital cycles and enable investment in new technologies,” says Arif Ehsan Malik, the CEO of Al Ghani Terry Mills and an exporter from Faisalabad. He emphasises that easing access to concessional export finance is critical for small and medium-sized exporters, who are disproportionately affected by tight financial conditions.
Nonetheless, concessional financing alone cannot resolve Pakistan’s deeper structural export weaknesses, says Shahzad Saleem, one of Pakistan’s largest textile exporters and chairman of Nishat Chunian. High energy costs, regulatory uncertainty, infrastructure gaps and so on continue to constrain export competitiveness. While cheaper credit can provide relief, sustainable export growth ultimately depends on broader reforms that enhance productivity, reduce transaction costs and improve the overall business environment. If accompanied by structural reforms and policy consistency, this initiative could provide meaningful support to the country’s export sector.
That said, the ERF intervention represents a pragmatic and balanced policy response to the exporters’ needs for affordable finance. By aligning monetary policy tools with export promotion objectives, authorities have created immediate financial space for exporters without destabilising the banking sector or worsening fiscal deficits. The CRR adjustment ensures that banks remain willing partners in this effort.

These findings have rekindled optimism about alleviating the country’s external economic challenges. However, possessing mineral wealth alone does not guarantee progress.
The experiences of African nations highlight pitfalls to avoid, while Indonesia’s strategic actions offer valuable lessons. Pakistan faces a fundamental decision: whether to simply export raw materials or to pursue a comprehensive strategy that maximises value and drives industrial transformation.
Africa’s cautionary tale
The experiences of countries such as Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo reveal three recurring issues that have hindered progress. Firstly, the development of enclave economies. Mining operations functioned as isolated, capital-intensive ventures with minimal integration into the domestic economy. Equipment and expertise were sourced from abroad, and the extracted ores were exported. As a result, industrial ecosystems failed to develop locally.
Secondly, exporting unprocessed raw materials led to limited value capture. Minerals like copper and cobalt were shipped overseas for refinement and returned to global markets as higher-value products. Consequently, the associated jobs, technology, and profit margins benefited other nations.
Thirdly, weak governance undermined the potential gains. Non-transparent contracts, rent-seeking, and exclusion of local stakeholders fostered mistrust and, at times, instability. While investors are drawn to mineral resources, their decisions are ultimately influenced by the predictability and stability of the operating environment.

If Pakistan settles for extraction and export alone, it risks remaining merely a quarry, rather than achieving broader industrial and economic transformation

For Pakistan, the clear lesson is that mining cannot remain an isolated, extractive activity. Instead, it must serve as a catalyst for broader industrial development, encompassing engineering, service sectors, chemicals, fabrication, and skill enhancement.
Indonesia’s strategic pivot
Indonesia, on the other hand, charted a different course. In 2014, the government enacted a ban on the export of unprocessed mineral ores, with a particular focus on nickel. This policy compelled investors to establish domestic smelting facilities; the policy was further strengthened in 2020.
Indonesia complemented this approach by developing industrial zones, upgrading infrastructure, and fostering partnerships with investors. Although there was initial resistance — such as challenges from the European Union at the World Trade Organisation and a temporary slowdown in investment — Indonesia remained resolute.
The outcome was significant: the country rapidly advanced up the value chain, moving from exporting raw ore to producing nickel pig iron, ferronickel, and battery-grade materials, thereby attracting substantial downstream investment.
The key takeaway is not to imitate Indonesia’s policies but to recognise the importance of purposeful action. Achieving value addition requires disciplined policymaking and the resolve to withstand short-term setbacks in pursuit of long-term benefits.

 

As for Pakistan, the country’s past experiences with similar major projects have been short-sighted. Examples abound — building the port in Gwadar without inland linkages, developing Thar coal fields without rail links, setting up power generation without distribution, incentivising independent power producers without regard to demand, establishing import-based coal plants difficult to convert to local lignite — the list is long. Pakistan can, however, do better with minerals.
Environmental and human safety
Africa’s experience also underscores the consequences of neglecting environmental and human safeguards. Issues such as polluted water, degraded land, and unsafe working conditions have imposed lasting burdens on local communities. Indonesia, too, faces challenges in ensuring environmental and human safety. Today, global buyers and financiers increasingly demand adherence to verifiable environmental, social, and governance standards.
For Pakistan, it is imperative that environmental and human safety considerations are integrated from the outset. As such, environmental impact assessments must be thorough, independently reviewed, and publicly disclosed. Aligning with international benchmarks is essential for access to global markets.
Mining is both a hazardous and water-intensive activity. Implementing closed-loop systems, secure tailings storage, and continuous monitoring is critical to avoid acute water shortages. Meanwhile, strict safety protocols, comprehensive training, modern equipment, and real-time monitoring should be compulsory lest the activity lead to catastrophic outcomes.
Health monitoring, fair compensation, and credible grievance mechanisms must be institutionalised. Projects must deliver tangible benefits to local communities to maintain security and legitimacy.
Furthermore, every project must include a funded plan for mine closure and land rehabilitation to ensure that economic gains do not leave behind environmental liabilities.
Failure to address these areas will not only harm people and ecosystems but also prevent Pakistan from accessing premium markets that require responsibly sourced minerals.
Building a sustainable mineral strategy
Pakistan’s mineral strategy should be founded on several key pillars, beginning with a time-bound pathway to domestic refining, even if initial exports consist of concentrates.
The sector needs competitive and reliable energy supplies to make mineral processing viable, transparent and stable fiscal regimes to anchor long-term investment, and local inclusion to enhance security and legitimacy.
Paired with an integrated industrial cluster that connects mining activities with downstream industries and world-class environmental and safety standards, these pillars could uplift the overall mining sector.
Standing firm under pressure
On the one hand, Indonesia’s experience reveals a difficult reality: there will be considerable pressure from traders, investors, and governments to prioritise rapid exports over long-term value addition. Once raw exports become established, reform becomes increasingly difficult. Fortunately, Pakistan still has time and opportunity to develop a robust processing ecosystem.
The global energy transition has intensified demand for copper and critical minerals, providing resource-rich countries with leverage — if used wisely.
On the other hand, Africa’s experience demonstrates the consequences of missteps, while Indonesia illustrates the rewards of strategic success. Our window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely. Exporting raw minerals may bring short-term financial gains, but responsible refining will foster capability, job creation, and resilience.

On the one hand, rooftop solar has become the most organic energy reform the country has ever witnessed, financed by households, powered by falling global module prices, and accelerated by affordability concerns.
On the other hand, recent amendments to the net-metering regime by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) and the policy posture of the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) suggest an institutional discomfort with this bottom-up transition. The result may not be stabilisation, but a classic J-curve.
The J-curve phenomenon, borrowed from trade and macroeconomics, describes an initial deterioration before eventual improvement. The dynamic is less a J-curve of temporary pain followed by recovery, and more a short-term stabilisation masking long-term disengagement. By tightening export compensation through net-billing and lower buyback rates, the grid’s immediate revenue losses may slow as prosumer growth is curtailed.

 

On paper, this can appear as fiscal relief. Yet the altered incentive structure encourages consumers to maximise self-consumption rather than abandon solar altogether. Higher-income households add batteries, commercial users redesign load profiles, and over time, even middle-income clusters reduce reliance on the grid.

Atempting to suppress its adoption through tariff spreads will likely deepen off-grid autonomy via BESS

Thus, while short-run losses to the national grid may decline, the long-run outcome could be more structural: gradual but decisive movement toward complete or near-complete off-grid autonomy through Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), leaving the grid with a narrower and more vulnerable consumer base.
This trajectory reflects a deeper philosophical fault line in planning. The prevailing doctrine within the Power Division remains capacity-centric, rooted in a legacy model of centralised expansion under long-term contracts.
Planning documents emphasise megawatts installed rather than megawatts utilised; capacity payments rather than system flexibility; and procurement rather than optimisation. Solar proliferation is treated as a disruption rather than a structural signal. And yet, the demand decline is not evidence of decentralisation triumph, but evidence of price failure. Consumers are not exiting the grid out of ideology; they are escaping tariff distress.
The autonomy of Nepra also merits scrutiny. A regulator’s legitimacy rests on independence, evidence-based deliberation, and full institutional quorum. Major recalibrations to prosumer regulations, particularly when they affect investment behaviour and financial flows, should emerge from comprehensive cost-of-service studies and transparent modelling.
An integrated response requires reimagining external financing as well. Under the World Bank Country Partnership Framework, an outcome linked to an additional 10GW of installed capacity reflects an outdated premise: that supply expansion is the central constraint. Pakistan today suffers not from insufficient capacity, but from excess contracted generation with low utilisation.
The government should proactively negotiate a reorientation of this envelope. Rather than adding megawatts, concessional resources can modernise transmission corridors, deploy grid-scale BESS, upgrade dispatch software, and invest in advanced metering infrastructure. In doing so, rooftop solar becomes an asset rather than a liability, absorbed during midday, discharged during evening peaks, and orchestrated through digital control systems.
Similarly, subsidy reform under the International Monetary Fund programme requires nuance. The removal of tariff subsidies for protected consumers, with compensation channelled through Benazir Income Support Programme cash transfers, is fiscally unsustainable and politically fragile. Cash grants indexed imperfectly to volatile tariffs will struggle to maintain purchasing power.
A more durable solution lies in asset-based protection: providing eligible protected households with standardised rooftop solar kits, small lithium or sodium-ion batteries, and high-efficiency DC fans. The capital expenditure is front-loaded but reduces recurring subsidy liabilities. It shields vulnerable consumers from tariff shocks, cuts peak demand, and aligns social protection with climate objectives. In energy policy, ownership can be more empowering than compensation.
Beyond households, surplus green electricity should be strategically directed toward export-oriented industry via the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contracts Market. As the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism tightens compliance for embedded emissions, Pakistan’s industrial competitiveness will hinge on credible decarbonisation pathways. Dedicated green feeders, backed by renewable generation and storage, can enable steel, cement, and textiles to certify lower carbon intensity.
Rather than curtailing solar during low-demand hours, the grid can channel it to industrial clusters at negotiated tariffs, reducing capacity payments per unit and improving load factors. Solar then becomes not a fiscal threat, but a trade policy instrument.
The most innovative pillar of integrated planning lies in repurposing underutilised coal plants. Several imported coal facilities operate at low-capacity factors yet carry heavy fixed obligations. Instead of perpetuating stranded assets, selected sites can be converted into grid-scale BESS hubs.

 

Early retirement, financed through blended climate funds, can be paired with carbon credit generation under high-integrity methodologies. Emissions avoided by replacing coal dispatch with stored renewable energy create monetisable mitigation outcomes. Revenues can service transition costs while improving system flexibility. In effect, yesterday’s baseload becomes tomorrow’s buffer.
Such a roadmap embodies genuine integration: aligning multilateral finance, social protection, industrial policy, and climate markets under a unified system lens. It acknowledges that Pakistan’s solar surge is not an aberration but a structural shift in consumer behaviour. Attempts to suppress it through tariff spreads will likely deepen the J-curve trough. Harnessing it through grid modernisation, storage deployment, and market reform can convert disruption into resilience.
Pakistan’s solar saga is therefore not a tale of excess panels or regulatory anxiety. It is a test of planning philosophy. The choice is between defending an eroding paradigm or orchestrating a coordinated transition, where distributed generation, centralised infrastructure, and climate finance reinforce rather than undermine each other. Integrated planning is not about adding more capacity; it is about adding coherence.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, March 2nd, 2026</p><small>2026-03-02 03:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/69a4c04877861.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976953/debt-loops-and-baby-bonds' target='_blank'><strong>Debt loops and baby bonds</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan runs two loops simultaneously, and both are making us poorer. The first is the household loop where inflation spikes, cash transfers top up, households consume through the shock, and the cycle repeats. The second is the sovereign loop, which borrows short, rolls over often, and pays the price in fragility every time global conditions tighten. Both loops are rational responses to their immediate constraints, and neither builds anything.
A potential solution that addresses both at once is a baby bond structured not as welfare, but as domestic long-tenor capital endowment. For the sake of simplicity, we may call it the Pakistan Child Endowment Account or PCEA.
A child born into a poor household in Pakistan typically enters adulthood with near-zero financial assets; this is a social equity problem, as well as a structural one. Households without assets cannot absorb shocks, invest in education, or take productive risk. They remain permanently dependent on periodic relief — worsened by recurring cash transfers — without much change in poverty graduation.
A PCEA can marginally change this cycle. At birth, a child would automatically have their account opened as soon as the birth is formally registered. The state can make a modest deposit, thereby officially initiating the account; the catch here is that the amount may not be withdrawn until the child turns 18.

A financial account at birth could not only keep children from poverty, but also lead to the emergence of a domestic long-duration investor base

Effectively, the amount the government spends on funding this comes back to the government as long-term debt instantaneously, which it can use for infrastructure development. Through this structure, it avoids a rollover risk associated with existing short-term borrowing. This literally becomes a way to extend debt maturities, while also enabling asset accumulation for the country’s youth.
With a financial account already in place, there will be an incentive to add to it, with family members encouraged to contribute voluntarily, thereby resulting in passive long-term capital growth. Through such a structure, we can formalise savings which have remained consistently low and are among the lowest in the region, even among low-to-middle income countries. Most of our structural capital problems can be solved with a better savings rate.
To make the deal even sweeter, the account should be allowed to grow tax-free until the earlier prescribed age. For vulnerable households, the state can even add matching contributions upto a certain threshold, rather than simply disbursing cash to fuel more consumption. As the programme matures, the child-turned-young-adult would have a real starting asset they can use for their education, skills training, or even a micro-enterprise stake.
Furthermore, for non-vulnerable households, tax-free compounding can also crowd-in long-term capital that may have been parked elsewhere, and not contributed to overall savings or investments in the country.

 

A point to note here is that there shouldn’t be any early cash withdrawal facility. The moment an early withdrawal facility is introduced, the programme will start behaving like a short-duration instrument instead of a long-duration one. Behavioural literature on forced savings is unambiguous, wherein the lock-in is the mechanism. Households that cannot access funds do not factor them into consumption planning. The compounding works precisely because the money is structurally out of reach.
Pakistan’s domestic debt profile has deteriorated on the tenor dimension for years. The International Monetary Fund’s First Review under the current Extended Fund Facility explicitly flags rollover risks and emphasises the need to lengthen average time to maturity to improve debt dynamics. The problem is circular; the market won’t buy a long tenor bond in volume because there are no natural long-duration buyers at scale, and because there are no buyers, the government keeps issuing short ones, and rollover pressure continues to compound.
In this instance, a PCEA can solve the problem of long-term capital, as pooled funds can be directly invested in long-term infrastructure, such as bonds or Sukuks, thereby raising long-term capital to fund infrastructure projects with long tails. Instead of making way to a larger debt pool, such bonds can be designated to long-term infrastructure projects, for which we are always scrambling for funds.
The development of a sovereign infrastructure fund that can deploy this capital in projects with positive economic and social returns can essentially solve both debt loops. Our Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP). allocations are loaded with long-term projects which simply can’t be completed because sufficient long-term capital doesn’t exist.
As such, the pooled funds from the programme can become the anchor investor for long-dated bonds, extending the yield curve and creating a market for more of the same financial products. This also opens potential for executing similar projects through a public-private partnership structure, significantly reducing reliance on the federal budget (funded primarily through short-term debt with high rollover risk) for project funding.
Infrastructure finance in Pakistan suffers a well-documented mismatch as projects are long-lived, but funding is short-lived. A standardised infrastructure bond programme (with appropriate governance rails in place) funded by baby bonds fixes this at the margin, not by replacing commercial finance, but by creating steady, predictable demand for the long end of the curve. That demand signal alone changes the market’s willingness to price long paper.
The critical design safeguard here is how such capital is deployed. Such a programme needs three conditions: a published infrastructure taxonomy defining eligible projects; independent verification of allocation and physical progress; and issuance tied to an approved capital expenditure pipeline.
The plan may seem ambitious, but it is entirely workable. The wins from such an intervention would enable every Pakistani child to enter adulthood with a real financial asset — not a one-time stipend, but 18 years of tax-free compounding anchored by a savings habit.
It also leads to the emergence of a domestic long-duration investor base; the missing institutional buyer that makes 15–20-year bond issuance normal rather than exceptional, directly addressing Pakistan’s rollover vulnerability while also not being hostage to stop-start PSDP rhythms.

Irfan Nasir, who uses blood pressure medication, said for more than two years his monthly medicine expenses had been steadily increasing. “I regularly take the anti-hypertensive drug Telmis-artan. Almost every third or fourth week, when I go to purchase my medicine, I have to pay a higher price than before due to repeated increases,” he said.
Officials and industry sources said the decision followed a recent review of medicine prices and retail-level supply by the federal health ministry and the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan.
The review concluded that the policy, introduced in late 2023, would continue to govern pricing of non-essential medicines, while essential and life-saving drugs would remain under government price controls.
“The policy remains in place,” a senior official said. “The government is monitoring its impact on availability and prices,” he added. He continued that recent assessments indicated the market had stabilised after prolonged shortages of several commonly used medicines.
“Under the previous system of tight price controls, manufacturers struggled to sustain production of low-margin medicines due to rising input costs, currency depreciation and inflation. In some cases, production was reduced or discontinued, contributing to supply gaps. Deregulation was intended to address these distortions,” the official said.
Last year, the government admitted that prices of more than a 100 commonly used medicines had increased by an average of 32 per cent since February 2024, after the caretaker set-up lifted price controls under the deregulation policy, prompting concern among officials and calls for the pharmaceutical industry to explain the steep hikes.
‘Affordability concerns’
Health officials said reports from Sindh drug regulators and hospital pharmacies suggested fewer complaints about stock-outs of routine medicines since the policy shift. However, officials acknowledged concerns about affordability that need to be addressed through regulatory oversight and targeted interventions.
Supporting the government’s stance, representatives of pharmaceutical retailers said the policy had stabilised the market and restored suppliers’ confidence.
Abdul Samad Budhani, chairman of Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, said deregulation ensured availability of medicines, which was key to move away from centralised price controls that had hindered the sector’s ability to respond to rising production costs. But he said, “The real need for relief was in essential drugs, but their prices were not approved.”
Patients, especially those with chronic conditions, face rising monthly expenses for essential medicines, creating financial pressure on those who depend on long-term treatment.
Shakeel Baig of the Consumer Rights Council of Pakistan said his organisation was also deeply concerned about the trend. “There is a need for a mechanism that safeguards the interests of both companies and consumers while allowing the government to remain impartial,” he added.

• Political leaders across country denounce Khamenei’s assassination, express solidarity with Iran• Session to be held at 3pm instead of 10:30am amid tight security
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s leadership and political circles on Sunday strongly condemned the assassination of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, while the joint sitting of parliament was rescheduled in view of the volatile security situation in the country following the tragic incident.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed “profound sorrow over the martyrdom of Khamenei and other members of Iran’s senior leadership killed alongside him”, and conveyed heartfelt condolences to the government and people of Iran.
He said Pakistan “stood with the Iranian nation in this moment of grief and shared in their loss”. He prayed for the departed souls and patience and fortitude for Iranians during this difficult time.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said “the government and people of Pakistan stood with the people of Iran in their hour of grief and extended sincere condolences on the martyrdom of Khamenei”. He expressed concern over violations of international law, stating that it was a long-established convention that heads of state and government should not be targeted.
National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also expressed “profound grief and sorrow over the martyrdom of Khamenei, along with his son, Sayyid Mojtaba Khamenei, his daughter-in-law Ms Zahra Haddad-Adel, his son-in-law and his granddaughter”.
Meanwhile, the joint session of parliament, originally scheduled for 10:30am on Monday (today), will now be held at 3pm, according to a statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat. President Zardari will address the joint session.
Strict security arrangements have been put in place for the session, as entry of any unauthorised person into Parliament House will be prohibited. Guests will not be allowed to attend the session. Only journalists holding new working press gallery cards of the National Assembly and Senate for 2026 will be permitted to cover the proceedings. Only one cameraman from each channel will be allowed.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also expressed sorrow over the assassination, saying in a televised message that “every citizen of Pakistan felt grief over the martyrdom”.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the assassination of Iran’s supreme leader “a shock for the whole world” and said he was praying for patience for those mourning the loss. He warned that rising tensions between Iran, Israel and Gulf countries were dangerous for regional stability and global peace.
In separate statements, PTI and the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) expressed profound sorrow and unequivocal condemnation of the assassination. They said the killing undermined international law, destabilised the region and pushed the world further towards chaos and conflict.
The TTAP announced three days of mourning for the slain leader and urged the government to declare official mourning. The alliance also expressed deep sorrow over the loss of hundreds of innocent lives due to US and Israeli aggression on Iran, including civilian casualties in an attack on a girls’ school.

ISLAMABAD: Combat-related fatalities in Pakistan surged by 30 per cent in February 2026, driven by a sharp increase in suicide attacks across the country, according to monthly statistics released by an Islamabad-based think tank.
The report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) documented 470 deaths and 333 injuries during the month. The dead included 96 civilians, 80 security forces personnel and 294 militants. The number of injured comprised 259 civilians, 50 security forces personnel and 24 militants.
The figures represent a 74pc surge in the deaths of security forces personnel, a 32pc rise in civilian deaths and a 21pc increase in militant deaths compared to the previous month.
Violence escalated significantly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and its merged districts (erstwhile Fata). The region saw 53 security forces personnel and six civilians killed, with an additional 35 security personnel and 48 civilians injured. The province endured three suicide bombings in February, which killed 17 people, including 14 security forces personnel, and injured 20 civilians.
According to the report, the surge in attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa led to Pakistan’s cross-border air strikes and subsequent military clashes with Afghanistan.
The capital also faced a major attack, with one suicide bombing in the suburbs of the Islamabad Capital Territory killing at least 34 people and injuring 165. Another suicide bombing in the Bhakkar district of Punjab province killed two police personnel and injured four others.
The eight suicide attacks recorded in the first two months of the year are nearly half the total for all of 2025, when 17 such incidents occurred, a statistic the report called “a dangerous trend of rising suicide bombings.” Security forces also arrested a would-be suicide bomber during the month.
In Balochistan, however, the PICSS data showed a visible decline in militant attacks following the launch of a retaliatory operation, “Raddul Fitna-1,” by security forces early in the month. Security operations in the province killed 176 militants.
Overall, PICSS data for the first two months of 2026 shows 831 combat-related deaths, including 536 militants, 169 civilians and 126 security forces personnel.

ISLAMABAD: Around $60 billion in investment by New Delhi on storage projects along the two major western rivers — the Jhelum and Chenab — flowing from India-held Kashmir could soon become a lethal weapon against Pakistan, potentially causing both floods and droughts.
At a recent federal-provincial dialogue on water storage projects, Water and Power Development Autho­rity (Wapda) Chair­man retired Lt Gen Muhammad Saeed reported that In­dia’s $60bn investment plan was estimated to increase New Delhi’s storage capacity on these rivers to 55-60 days, up from around 15 days at present.
“Such capacity could cause drought in Pakistan, given a nearly two-month window to stop normal flows, particularly when crops need crucial water downstream,” a participant at the briefing told Dawn. “Conversely, India can trigger floods at will during monsoon or heavy rainfall by releasing stored water, something it has been doing recently even with its existing 15-day storage capacity,” he added.
Therefore, Pakistan must urgently build large reservoirs as preparedness measures to capture floodwaters for use when India disrupts flows, and to hold substantial quantities in case of sudden discharges to avoid devastation.
The Wapda chairman stressed that Pakistan would need new flood reservoirs to conserve surplus water and mitigate potential shocks.
An official said Pakistan must aggressively develop water storage to capture repeated annual floodwaters that otherwise flow into the sea. Weaponisation of river flows by India through ongoing investments, the official warned, could pose existential challenges.
Held on Feb 17, the session was presided over by Water Resources Minister Mian Moeen Wattoo and attended by the AJK PM and the GB CM, but not the provincial chief ministers. The prime minister had also asked chief secretaries and irrigation secretaries to attend.
Sindh’s irrigation minister and secretary warned that Pakistan was already water-deficient and that river flows did not justify a large dam.
They added that lower riparians were not receiving enough drinking water under the current situation and that additional dams could aggravate conditions.
Therefore, detailed feasibility and economic assessments should be prepared before taking any decision.
They also noted that projects developed in urgency in response to Indian actions might not prove to be a bankable solution — perhaps an indirect reference to the Rs500bn Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project that remains mostly out of order.
The GB leadership suggested the region should be granted membership of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) to ensure national representation, or at least observer status to participate in decision-making.
The AJK PM said given Kashmir’s status as the source of river flows, it would welcome more dams, storage facilities and hydropower projects. How­ever, he stressed the need for financial incentives so that the Kashmiri population not only took pride in its contributions but also benefitted economically.
Punjab fully supported new flood storage projects and offered to sit down with Sindh’s leadership, providing assurances and institutional guarantees to address grievances and reservations.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa demanded that its Chashma Right Bank Canal lift-cum-gravity project be developed at the earliest, noting that the province had been unable to utilise its water share without it. The Wapda chairman assured representatives that tenders had already been issued and that the project would be prioritised.
Separately, Wapda is believed to have finalised four medium-sized storages on the Chenab near Jhang, Chiniot, Sargodha and Wazirabad. Estimated to cost around Rs300bn, it would provide a combined storage capacity of about 4.5 million acre feet.

PARIS: The death toll from the Israeli strikes that hit a girls’ school in southern Iran surged to 148, with nearly 100 others wounded, Al Jazeera reported.
While Iranian officials claimed the attack on the Shajareh Tayyebeh girls’ elementary school in the Minab city killed more than 100 people, neither the United States nor Israel confirmed that any such attack has taken place.
Israel’s military on Sunday said it was “not aware” of any US or Israeli strike on any school in Iran.
When asked about the strikes on school, Israel’s military spokesman Lt-Col Nadav Shoshani said, “At this point not aware of an Israeli or an American strike there… We’re operating in an extremely accurate manner.”
However, The New York Times later quoted a CENTCOM spokesperson as saying: “We are aware of reports concerning civilian harm resulting from ongoing military operations. We take these reports seriously and are looking into them.”
“The protection of civilians is of utmost importance, and we will continue to take all precautions available to minimise the risk of unintended harm.”
Video and photographs from the aftermath of the strike, which have been verified as authentic and geo-located to the site, show hundreds of people gathered around the partially collapsed, smoking building, with rubble strewn across the street and men digging through it for victims. Screams can be heard in the background. In some of the images, schoolbags and textbooks are being pulled from the debris.
Norway-based rights group Hengaw said the Shajare Tayyebeh school was holding its morning session at the time of the incident, which reportedly had about 170 students present.
The Nobel peace prize laureate and girls’ education advocate, Malala Yousafzai, said in a statement, “They were girls who went to school to learn, with hopes and dreams for their future. Today, their lives were brutally cut short.
“Justice and accountability must follow. All states and parties must uphold their obligations under international law to protect civilians and safeguard schools.”

ISLAMABAD: Amid Ira­nian counterattacks against US assets in the Gulf, Pakistan reached out to the rulers of Jordan and Bahrain via telephone and urged the need for restraint, de-escalation, and dialogue to preserve regional peace and stability.
The Gulf states, which house American assets, came under attack after Iran retaliated to joint US-Israeli strikes, which killed its top leadership, including the supreme leader, and scores of citizens.
According to the PM Office, the PM held a telephone conversation with Jordan’s King Abdullah II to discuss the evolving regional situation.







The two leaders exchanged views on the serious regional developments following the recent escalation from the Israeli attack on Iran, which was followed by attacks on Jor­dan and other regional countries.
The prime minister expre­ssed Pakistan’s deep concern over the situation and emphasised the urgent need for restraint, de-escalation, and dialogue to preserve regional peace and stability.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the Kingdom of Jordan as well as other brotherly countries during this challenging time and reiterated Pakistan’s readiness to support all efforts aimed at restoring stability.
Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination on regional developments.
In a statement on X, the PM said he also spoke to Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Kha­lifa and conveyed Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the brotherly people of Bahrain during the ongoing crisis in the Middle East.







“While praying for the safety and security of our brothers and sisters in Bah­rain, I emphasised restraint, respect for international law, and the urgent need for dialogue and diplomacy to restore peace and stability in the region,” he said.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke to Omani and Iraqi counterparts to discuss the regional situation. In a call with Oman’s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, the two sides expre­ssed concerns over the ongoing escalation in the region and underscored the urgent need for restraint, dialogue, and de-escalation to preserve peace and stability. Both agr­eed to remain in close contact over the evolving situation.
FM Dar also talked to Iraq’s Fuad Hussein and discussed the rapidly evolving regional situation and stressed the need for sustained efforts to contain tensions, promote de-escalation, and advance peace and stability in the region.
Gulf in turmoil
As retaliatory strikes widened on Sunday they reverberated across Gulf Arab states, with loud blasts heard in Dubai and the Qatari capital Doha and with Oman being hit for the first time.
In the UAE, the defence ministry said three people had died and 58 were wounded since Iran’s strikes began the previous day.
UAE also confirmed the death of a Pakistani national in Iranian missile strikes targeting the UAE. The victim was killed after being struck by missile debris in Abu Dhabi.
Emirati authorities have extended their deepest condolences and sympathy to the bereaved family and relatives of the deceased. As of now, the identity of the victim has not been made public.
In Kuwait, one person was killed and 32 wounded since the start of Iran’s retaliation campaign, the health ministry said.
Debris from an intercepted drone damaged an Abu Dhabi complex housing the Israeli embassy and several other international missions, causing minor injuries to a woman and her child, Abu Dhabi’s state media office said on Sunday.
In Dubai, two people were injured after shrapnel from drones fell over two houses when they were intercepted, a Dubai state media office statement said. Dubai’s international airport, its landmark Burj Al Arab hotel and man-made Palm Jumeirah Island all suffered damage overnight, as did Abu Dhabi’s international airport.
Thick plumes of smoke continued to rise from the Jebel Ali port area, where one of the berths caught fire on Sunday because of debris from an intercepted missile. State-owned logistics firm DP World has temporarily paused operations at Jebel Ali Port, according to a notice seen by Reuters.
Large plumes of smoke were also seen rising at Abu Dhabi’s Zayed Port area, according to a Reuters witness. In neighbouring Oman, which was spared retaliation on Saturday, Duqm commercial port was targeted by two drones, wounding one worker, the state news agency said.
Qatar’s interior ministry said on Sunday that it was responding to a limited fire in an industrial zone after debris fell from an intercepted missile.
Gulf stock markets fell sharply when trading opened on Sunday, with Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index dropping more than 4pc at the open and closing down 2.2pc.
Meanwhile, stock exchanges in Dubai and Abu Dhabi will be closed “until further notice” due to the ongoing conflict in the region, the UAE’s financial regulatory authority announced on Sunday.
“The Authority confirms that it will continue to closely monitor developments in the region and assess the situation on an ongoing basis, taking any further measures as necessary,” it said. Kuwait also suspended trading until further notice.
Saudi intercepts missile attacks
Saudi Arabia on Sunday intercepted Iranian missiles targeting Riyadh’s international airport and the Prince Sultan Airbase, which houses US military personnel, a Gulf source briefed on the matter told AFP.
An eyewitness near the airport said they “saw and heard the air defence intercept the missile in the sky”. Residents and AFP correspondents earlier reported hearing explosions in eastern Riyadh. Saudi Arabia houses US bases and personnel, though the bigger such facilities are located in Bahrain and Qatar.
Meanwhile, the US officials warned citizens in Bahrain to avoid hotels in the capital Manama, while staff at the US embassy to Jordan were told to avoid the embassy compound, citing risks of attacks. AFP also reported blasts in Bahrain’s capital.

JERUSALEM: The war between Iran and the US-Israel alliance escalated sharply on Sunday after Iran confirmed the assassination of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khame­nei in a joint US-Israeli airstrike, a move that has plunged the Middle East into its most perilous crisis in decades.
As Iranian government declared 40 days of national mourning and seven public holidays following the death of the man who wielded absolute power since 1989, Iranian missiles killed at least nine people in a central Israeli town, while the US and Israel continued bombardment of Tehran, with Trump claiming that the war on Iran could last four weeks.
The tit-for-tat attacks have sent shockwaves through global markets, disrupting vital shipping lanes in the Gulf and threatening to draw regional and global powers deeper into a direct military confrontation.
Senior leadership decimated
The Israeli military announced that 40 senior Iranian officials were killed in the coordinated strikes, including six names confirmed by Iranian state media.
Among the dead were Revolutionary Guards commander Gen. Mohammad Pakpour, armed forces chief of staff Abdolrahim Mousavi, Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh, Supreme Leader military office head Mohammad Shirazi, police intelligence chief Gholamreza Rezaian and top security adviser Ali Shamkhani.
Khamenei’s daughter, gran­ddaughter, son-in-law and daughter-in-law were also killed in the strikes, Iranian media reported. State media said Khamenei was working in his office when Saturday’s attack struck.
US President Donald Trump said on his Truth Social network that intelligence and tracking systems had monitored Khamenei’s movements, adding that “there was not a thing he, or the other leaders that have been killed along with him, could do.”
Escalation and retaliation
The escalation has been swift and deadly on multiple fronts.
Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said Israeli aircraft had conducted strikes to open the “path to Tehran” and that the majority of aerial defence systems in western and central Iran had been dismantled.
“Ground forces are not being considered and we have the capabilities and the targets to keep going on for as long as necessary,” Shoshani said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to intensify strikes, saying Israel was not yet at “full strength”.
Iran responded with volleys of missiles targeting Israel and at least seven other countries hosting US bases.
A missile strike on the Israeli city of Beit Shemesh killed at least nine people and wounded 28, with 11 still missing, according to the Magen David Adom emergency service and Israeli police. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards also claimed to have attacked the US aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln with four ballistic missiles, state media reported, though the Pentagon denied this.
The IRGC also said three US and British oil tankers were hit by missiles in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz and were on fire, though there was no independent confirmation.
Iran’s leaders promised a fierce counter-response. Acting President Masoud Pezeshkian called Khamenei’s assassination a “declaration of war against Muslims.”
Senior security chief Ali Larijani promised to hit the US and Israel with a force “never seen before.”
Separately, the US military reported its own naval successes. US Central Command posted on X that an Iranian Jamaran-class corvette was struck by US forces at the start of its operations and was sinking in the Gulf of Oman.







US President Donald Trump said he envisages a four-week military operation against Iran. “It’s always been a four-week process. We figured it will be four weeks or so,” he told The Daily Mail.
“As strong as it is, it’s a big country, it’ll take four weeks — or less,” Trump said.
About the American soldiers dying during war on Iran, he said it was expected in a war that was nevertheless a “great deal”.
“We have three, but we expect casualties, but in the end it’s going to be a great deal for the world,” Trump told NBC after the Pentagon announced three US service members had been killed during military strikes on Iran.
Earlier, in a series of posts on his Truth Social network, he claimed credit for the widening assault.
“I have just been informed that we have destroyed and sunk 9 Iranian Naval Ships, some of them relatively large and important,” Trump wrote.







“We are going after the rest.” He added that the US had “largely destroyed” Iran’s naval headquarters. In separate interviews, he said 48 Iranian leaders had been killed.
The central command also said B-2 stealth bombers armed with 2,000-pound bombs struck Iran’s “hardened ballistic missile facilities” on Saturday night.
Disruption and diplomacy
The conflict has caused immediate chaos in the Gulf, a critical artery for global trade. Shipping data showed at least 150 tankers, including crude oil and liquefied natural gas vessels, had dropped anchor in open waters to avoid the Strait of Hormuz, according to a Reuters analysis of MarineTraffic data.
Major shipping lines MSC and Maersk suspended navigation in the region.
Iranian state television reported that an oil tanker was struck and sinking after attempting to ‘illegally’ pass through the strait, which the Revolutionary Guards declared closed.
Even as the war intensified, diplomatic channels remained active. A statement from Oman’s foreign ministry claimed Araghchi told his Omani counterpart, Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, that Tehran was open to “serious efforts at de-escalation”.
The foreign minister of Oman, who mediated recent US-Iran talks, also said the “door to diplomacy remains open”
“I want to be very clear — the door to diplomacy remains open,” Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said on X.







“Talks in Geneva made genuine progress towards an unprecedented agreement between Iran and the United States and although the hope was to avoid war, war should not mean that the hope of peace is extinguished. I still believe in the power of diplomacy to resolve this conflict.”
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi rejected any suggestion that Iran’s right to self-defence was limited. “What the United States is doing is an act of aggression. What we are doing is the act of self-defence,” he told ABC News.
The United Nations’ nuclear agency announced an extraordinary meeting on Iran for Monday, convened at Russia’s request.
European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called Khamenei’s death “a defining moment in Iran’s history.” She wrote on X: “What comes next is uncertain. But there is now an open path to a different Iran, one that its people may have greater freedom to shape.”







Experts cautioned that while the leadership losses dealt Iran a devastating blow, they would not necessarily spell the end of the country’s entrenched clerical rule or the Revolutionary Guards’ grip on power.
War goes on
Meanwhile, in western Iran, more than 40 security personnel — mostly border guards — were killed in a strike on a border regiment headquarters in Mehran near Iraq, the Mehr news agency reported.
“Tehran’s Gandhi hospital was attacked by Zionist-American air strikes,” ISNA reported, while the Fars and Mizan agencies published a video, presented as being from inside the facility, showing debris on the floor among wheelchairs.
The Israeli military has announced plans to mobilise nearly 100,000 reservists in its campaign against its longstanding adversary, Iran.
“The [army] is preparing to call up around 100,000 reservists and is raising its level of readiness on the various fronts as part of Operation ‘Roaring Lion’,” it said in a statement, using the name Israel has given to its assault — launched in coordination with the US — against Iran.

The situation warranted Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to issue an appeal, urging people to remain peaceful.
“Today is a sorrowful day for the entire Muslim ummah, Pakistan’s public and Iran’s public,” he said in a video statement.
Stating that every Pakistani citizen was as aggrieved as Iranians, Naqvi said, “My only request is that we all stand with you, but please do not take the law into your hands. You may protest but peacefully.”

 


Karachi clashes
In Karachi, protesters clashed with law enforcement personnel near the US Consulate on Mai Kolachi Road. Law enforcement personnel resorted to teargas shelling and baton-charge to control the situation.
Subsequently, Section 144 was also extended across Sindh. According to the Home Department, all kinds of wall chalking, protests, demonstrations, sit-ins, rallies, and display of arms were banned throughout the province for one month, effective from March 1.
However, the guards of registered private security companies were allowed to carry weapons at places of duty during work hours, but they were prohibited from displaying or brandishing weapons during movement in vehicles.
According to a statement by Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed listing all casualties, eight bodies were brought to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK), while two succumbed to their injuries, taking the deaths in the US Consulate incident to 10.
A total of 62 people were injured near US Consulate, with 41 taken to CHK’S SMBBIT, seven taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), eight taken to Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), and six taken to Fatimiyah Hospital.
Separately, eight persons injured during protests at Native Jetty and Numaish Chowrangi were brought to SMBBIT, while three wounded in a protest in Paposh Nagar were taken to JPMC.
This took the total number of people injured in protests across the metropolis to 73, Dr Syed’s statement said.
Out of them, 14 remained admitted in hospitals, while the rest were discharged after treatment, it added.
Of those admitted, six were in a critical condition — two at SMMBIT, two at AKUH and one at JPMC.
In a late-night statement, the Sindh Rangers spokesperson said mobile vigilant teams had been deployed in various areas of Karachi to maintain peace.
He added: “Additional personnel have been deployed in view of the situation and continuous patrolling and  monitoring was under way at the city’s important spots, installations and main arteries. Miscreants are being identified.”
Earlier, the US Embassy in Islamabad said: “We are monitoring reports of ongoing demonstrations at the US Consulate Generals in Karachi and Lahore, as well as calls for additional demonstrations at the US Embassy in Islamabad and the Consulate General in Peshawar.
“We advise US citizens in Pakistan to monitor local news and observe good personal security practices, including being aware of your surroundings, avoiding large crowds, and ensuring your STEP (Smart Traveller Enrollment Programme) registration is up to date.”







In view of the arising security situation, roads near the US Consulate were closed off to traffic.
Later in the day, when authorities tried to place containers to block the roads near the US Consulate, protesters pelted stones, leading to more clashes.

In an official statement, shared by the information minister’s spokesperson Husain Mansoor, the Sindh government expressed “deep grief” over the loss of lives in the clash.
“The protesters entered after breaching the security cordon of the US Consulate and committed vandalism,” the statement said.
However, the government put the number of deaths at six, adding that “several” were injured.
It formed a high-level joint investigation team (JIT) to “impartially review all aspects of the incident”. The JIT will “assess the circumstances under which the incident occurred and what its causes were”.
The JIT will also determine “who was responsible” for the incident.
While the government affirmed the public’s constitutional right to protest, it stressed that “maintaining a peaceful environment was everyone’s shared responsibility”.
“Any kind of vandalism, violence or taking the law into your own hands is inappropriate,” it noted.
The government requested citizens to “express their emotions only in peaceful and legal ways”.
Citizens are urged to express their feelings only in peaceful and legal ways.
“The government wants to keep the situation under control,” the statement said, adding that while citizens had the right to peacefully protest, no one should take the law into their hands.

In his statement, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah termed the incident “extremely tragic” and expressed his deep grief over Khamenei’s death.
“In this hour of grief, the people of Sindh stand in equal solidarity with Iran and all those who are mourning,” he said.
He directed that an impartial investigation be conducted into the US Consulate incident.
“At a time when the country is facing a war-like situation, it is inappropriate to sabotage peace and order,” CM Murad said.
He contacted various religious leaders, including Allama Shahenshah Naqvi, Allama Shabbir Maisami, and others, to urge them to ensure that public sentiments were controlled at all costs.
Allama Naqvi and others spoke about holding a majlis (gathering) at Numaish, the CM Office statement said, adding that Murad directed the administration and the police to provide full security for it.
CM Murad appealed to all religious scholars and people of different schools of thought to guide the public toward maintaining peace and order.
Expressing his deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the US Consulate incident, he said the government cannot allow anyone to take the law into their own hands.
In a video statement, Allama Naqvi termed the consulate clashes “painful” and urged the public to remain peaceful.
He noted that the Muslim community was saddened over Khamenei’s “martyrdom”, adding that people should voice their grief “keeping in mind the sorrow of Karbala”.



Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar sought immediate details about the situation from Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Azad Khan, a statement from his office said.
“No one will be allowed to take the law into their hands,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. He ordered that the security of sensitive installations be made more effective.
The minister further directed that alternative routes be determined to maintain the flow of traffic and that law enforcement agencies (LEAs) remain fully alert and monitor the situation closely.
“Action will be taken in accordance with the law against elements disturbing law and order,” Lanjar warned.
Meanwhile, the Sindh Rangers said it had deployed “heavy contingents of mobile vigilance teams” across the city in view of the prevailing security situation.

Earlier in the day, Keamari Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Amjad Ahmed Shaikh gathered police contingents to strengthen security at sensitive locations.
2 dead, dozens injured in Islamabad
At least two protesters died and over 30 were injured during clashes with law enforcement personnel near the Diplomatic Enclave, where people had gathered to protest the attacks on Iran.
The clashes came after the district administration had banned all kinds of gatherings under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
According to sources at Polyclinic Hospital, as many as nine injured persons were brought there, but one of them succumbed to injuries.
Sources at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) said a body and 25 injured people were brought to the hospital. The injured included three police officials and two Rangers personnel.
Eight of those admitted to Pims and Polyclinic were in a critical condition.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Spokesperson Hasnain Zaidi, speaking to Dawn, also said that at least two persons had died.
He claimed that as many as 15 protesters were taken into custody and taken to a police station. “We have started efforts to get them released,” he added.
Police resorted to heavy shelling near the Foreign Office building in an effort to stop the protesters from entering the Diplomatic Enclave. The police, backed by Rangers, succeeded in pushing the protesters back and out of the Red Zone.

In the late afternoon, thousands of people reached Aabpara Chowk to march towards the US Embassy for protests over Supreme Leader Khamenei’s assassination.
However, the march was stopped by the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) at Serena Chowk, where shelling was employed, resulting in multiple injuries.
Protesters also manhandled mediapersons, including cameramen and photographers, snatching their cameras and phones and deleting the pictures and videos.
Replying to a question earlier, Zaidi said that as the situation was becoming out of control, MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir reached the venue.
“Allama sahib, who is the leader of the opposition in the Senate, has been addressing the masses,” the MWM spokesperson added.
In an advisory at noon, the Islamabad police said all routes leading to the Red Zone, which houses important government buildings, had been closed.







The Islamabad district administration had banned all kinds of gatherings in the federal capital under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
According to the district administration, all kinds of gatherings and assemblies would be considered unlawful under Section 144. It urged residents not to take part in any such gathering.
“Strict legal action will be taken in the case of any protest, demonstration or gathering,” the administration warned.







Earlier in the day, the interior minister visited various areas of Islamabad and reviewed the law and order situation in the Red Zone, Diplomatic Enclave, and other areas.
He inspected security arrangements and issued orders to ensure foolproof arrangements in the Diplomatic Enclave.
While noting that peaceful protest was everyone’s right, Naqvi said, “Mischief under the guise of protest cannot be allowed under any circumstances.”
He ordered that security arrangements must be complete and comprehensive in every respect, adding, “The law will take its course against disruption of daily life routines.”
Islamabad IG Ali Nasir Rizvi briefed the minister on the law and order situation. Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa, the deputy commissioner and other officials were also present on the occasion.
Section 144 imposed across Punjab; crowd dispersed outside US Consulate
Meanwhile, hundreds of activists from Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) assembled outside the US Consulate in Lahore at around 11am and attempted to force their way into the building, catching the police off guard.
However, a few policemen on routine duty around the consulate managed to push back the activists protesting the US-Israel attacks on Iran.

Some protesters told Dawn that one of their colleagues scaled the consulate’s boundary wall and was detained by security guards. By that time, police reinforcements had arrived, and a police inspector negotiated with consulate security to secure the protester’s release.
The protesters, including a large number of women, were carrying portraits of Khamenei and raising slogans against the US and Israel.
The MWM had scheduled the protest for 3pm, but its activists gathered at the venue much earlier.
Police cordoned off the area as activists of Tehreek-i-Bedari Ummat-i-Mustafa marched from the Punjab Assembly to join the demonstration at the consulate.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government imposed a ban on gatherings and sit-ins of four or more persons across the province for seven days.
Such assemblies were prohibited in “any public place, street, road, or open space except with the prior permission of the deputy commissioner concerned”, a notification by the Home Department said.
The ban did not apply to marriage ceremonies, funeral prayers, burial processions, courts of law, and “assemblies of officers/officials in government or semi-government offices for official duty”.
A complete ban was also imposed on the “carrying, display, or brandishing of all kinds of weapons (both licensed and unlicensed) or any destruction-causing material in public places” for seven days.
The notification clarified that the ban did not apply to personnel of LEAs and security agencies on official duty.







“This order shall come into force with immediate effect and shall remain in force for a period of seven (07) days, unless modified or withdrawn earlier,” the notification stated.
It stated: “Multiple credible threat alerts, regarding possible terrorist activities planned by hostile groups aimed at targeting minorities or Muslim scholars to trigger sectarian unrest, have been received.
“Assemblies, rallies, gatherings, sit-ins, processions, demonstrations, jalsas etc could present a convenient target for such terrorist attacks, and the possibility of an untoward incident cannot be ruled out.”
The Home Department noted there was a “strong apprehension that certain political, sectarian or anti-social elements may engage in activities, assemblies, gatherings or demonstrations that are likely to cause a breach of public peace, disturb the public order, and create a security risk for the general public and critical infrastructure”.
Curfew in Skardu after protests in GB
Separately, as demonstrations intensified across Gilgit-Baltistan after Khamenei’s assassination, curfew was imposed in the Skardu district.
Protesters set the offices in Gilgit and Skardu of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) on fire.
They also set a school, the office of the superintendent of police, and the Agha Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) office on fire during the protest.

The GB police issued a statement saying that a curfew has been imposed in Skardu.
The statement said that the Pakistan Army had been called in under Section 245 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), noting that UNMOGIP offices in Skardu and Gilgit were torched.
It said that no casualties were reported due to “timely intervention” by the police and administration.
According to the police, all foreign tourists in GB have been shifted to safe places.
Police requested the public to remain peaceful, saying, “It is everyone’s shared responsibility to thwart attempts to damage national property.”

Protesters blocked the Karakoram Highway (KKH) at multiple locations in Hunza, Nagar and Gilgit, holding pictures of Khamenei and chanting anti-American and anti-Israel slogans. They also staged a sit-in at Siachen Road in Kharmang.
Roads in Shigar and Ghanche also remained blocked, while the Baltistan Road has been blocked in Roundu and other areas. Inter-district roads also remained blocked.
Shops, markets, business markets and commercial activities remained suspended in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Nagar, Shigar, Kharmang, Astore, and Ghanche, a Dawn correspondent reported.
Rallies in DI Khan, other KP areas
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, rallies in solidarity with Iran were staged in Dera Ismail Khan, Tank and Paharpur districts.
Hundreds of people staged a rally in DI Khan from Imamia Gate to Fawara Chowk, where participants held a gathering and offered prayers.
The rally, led by Allama Ramzan Tauqeer, was organised on the call of the Shia Ulema Council and other organisations.
Leaders and workers of various political and social groups joined the demonstration.
Among those present were Jamaat-i-Islami district president Manzar Masood Khattak, Advocate Zahid Mohibullah and Mian Allah Ditta Sajid of the Khaksar Tehreek, along with individuals belonging to different schools of thought.
Participants carried portraits of Ayatollah Khamenei and placards bearing protest slogans, while chants were raised against the US and Israel.
Speakers termed the death of Iran’s supreme leader a grave loss for the Muslim world and warned that such developments could escalate tensions in the region. They urged the international community to play its role in ensuring peace and stability.

Addressing the gathering, Allama Tauqeer said the Iranian people were not alone in what he described as a difficult time and that the people of Pakistan stood with them.
JI’s Khattak said any violation of a country’s sovereignty was against international law and could have serious consequences. Other speakers also emphasised the need for restraint, dialogue and regional peace.
According to the administration, the rally concluded peacefully and no untoward incident was reported.
Heavy security arrangements were made by the district police during the rally, with additional personnel deployed along the route and traffic diverted to alternative roads.
Similar protest rallies were also held in Tank, Paharpur and other adjoining areas. Local authorities said the demonstrations remained peaceful, with no reports of violence or disruption from any of the locations.

Brent crude settled around $72.5 a barrel on Friday, already up nearly 19 per cent year-to-date, according to CNBC. Rumours are swirling of oil touching $100.
For Pakistan, even modest increases carry heavy consequences.
For every $10 rise in oil prices, the current account deficit increases by roughly $1.5–$2 billion, explains former chief executive officer of the Pakistan Business Council, Ehsan Malik.
“If prices were to climb to $100, the deficit could expand by $5–$7bn on an annualised basis, potentially undoing recent gains that allowed FY25 to post a $2bn current account surplus.”
Markets are extremely erratic right now, says energy analyst Syed Rashid Husain.
Iran produces roughly 3–3.5 million barrels of oil per day, exporting about 1–1.5m barrels. While this is far lower than the output of the United States (about 13.5m barrels per day) or Saudi Arabia (around 9–10m), even a loss of one million barrels per day can tighten global balances and push prices higher.
Compounding the risk is the strategic importance of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway through which roughly 20pc of global oil consumption passes. For years, Iran has threatened to block this passage during periods of heightened conflict.
According to Reuters, oil and gas shipments through the area have already faced disruption, with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards reportedly warning ships that passage is not permitted, although Tehran has not formally confirmed such an order.
Analysts say scenarios range from limited disruptions to Iranian exports to a full blockade of Hormuz.
The ripple effects are already visible. Late Saturday night, petrol prices at pumps in Canada had risen by roughly 10–15 cents per litre, Husain said, speaking from experience.
Russia-Ukraine crisis flashbacks
For Pakistan, the situation evokes the economic horror of the Russia–Ukraine war. During 2022-23, Brent crude hovered around $100–125 per barrel, leading Pakistan to float perilously close to sovereign default.
The chain reaction was brutal. The war pushed up oil prices, widening Pakistan’s import bill and putting pressure on the exchange rate. The rupee slid from around Rs170 per dollar in early 2022 to a peak of Rs305 on Aug 28, 2023, before stabilising in the Rs270–280 range toward the end of that year.
There was, however, an important cushion at the time. Despite sanctions, Russia still exported oil and gas by hook or by crook to many countries; Pakistan also tried to get oil from Russia, and India became a major importer of Russian oil.
Since then, however, the US has pressured India to stop importing and tightened the screws on all of Russia’s supplies. If Iranian barrels are disrupted simultaneously, two significant discounted supply streams could disappear, pushing crude firmly into triple-digit territory if tensions do not de-escalate.
There are already signs of strain. Saudi Aramco has reportedly not allocated a March cargo to a Pakistani refinery amid volatility in global oil markets. Uncertainty in global crude trade has made it difficult to secure shipments for March, and this was before the news of the assassination of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
Marine insurers are also considering repricing or cancelling policies in parts of the Middle East, according to reports.
A chain reaction and the IMF
Oil prices have a multiplier effect as they impact secondary markets.
For example, edible oil prices — of which Pakistan imported roughly $3.7bn in FY25 — are indirectly linked to crude oil markets, Malik explains.
Much of the economic breathing space that enabled recent stabilisation came from relatively stable global commodity prices.
“For every $10 increase in oil prices, Pakistan’s inflation typically rises by about 0.5–0.6 percentage points,” says Waqas Ghani, Head of Equity Research at JS Global Capital.
If oil prices surge, inflation would rise again, making further policy rate cuts unlikely.
Industry would face higher input costs, weakening exports. At the same time, fiscal space would shrink, limiting the government’s ability to lower taxes or provide relief, adds Malik.
“The veneer of stability has been damaged,” says Ammar H Khan, Professor of Practice at the Institute of Business Administration Karachi. Capital outflows could increase, or new investment could slow, hurting job creation and — at the margins — reducing demand for migrant labour abroad.
These repercussions may also extend to remittances, which are vital for keeping the current account afloat.
Even if the conflict lasts only a few days and does not turn into a prolonged war, heightened regional risk can weigh on financial flows, he adds.
All this is taking place in the background of talks with the visiting International Monetary Fund (IMF) team. Industry sources say there had been positive talks with the Fund regarding possible tax relief in the upcoming budget. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also emphasised the need to reduce direct tax rates.
However, given the current global uncertainty, meaningful relief now appears unlikely.
Pakistan was already receiving very little foreign direct investment, notes M Abdul Aleem, secretary general of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
“What little was in the pipelines, like investments in Reko Diq, will slow down for now,” he says.
“Equally concerning is the law-and-order environment, particularly when it involves the safety of foreign nationals.”
Referring to the recent incident at the US consulate in Karachi, he said stronger preventive security measures should have been in place.
PSX and gold
For equity markets, the implications extend beyond macroeconomic concerns.
Pakistan’s manufacturing sectors rely heavily on imported raw materials and energy inputs. “Take the cement sector as an example,” says Waqas Ghani, Head of Equity Research. “It relies on coal and petcoke as key inputs. If oil prices rise, the prices of these fuels also increase, raising production costs.”
Because many industries depend on imported inputs across the value chain, higher commodity prices quickly squeeze profit margins.
“When input costs rise, margins come under pressure, and corporate earnings can deteriorate,” he said. “Apart from oil and exploration companies, most sectors would face headwinds.”
Beyond fundamentals, market sentiment itself has turned cautious.
“Investors are already becoming more risk-averse,” Ghani noted. “When uncertainty rises, equities are usually the first asset class where investors reduce exposure.”
Several technical factors are also amplifying selling pressure. Foreign investors have been net sellers in recent weeks, while mutual funds are facing redemption pressures from retail investors. When investors withdraw money, fund managers are forced to liquidate holdings, increasing supply in the market.
“At the same time, settlement dynamics can intensify the pressure,” Ghani added. The Pakistan Stock Exchange currently operates on a T+1 settlement cycle, while the banking system operates on a T+2 cycle, which can create short-term liquidity stress for brokers and investors during periods of volatility.
“All these factors combined can create a downward spiral where selling feeds on itself,” he said.
For now, the key trigger that could stabilise markets would be a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions.
“If the conflict subsides and oil prices stabilise, sentiment could recover fairly quickly,” Ghani said. “But until then, markets are likely to remain under stress.”
Much, however, will depend on how global markets react when trading begins.
“It all depends on the evolving situation and any ceasefire news,” said Muhammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities. “A lot will hinge on how US futures open, along with the trend in oil prices and Asian markets.”
Pakistani stocks are likely to fall initially, he added, though the extent will depend on developments overnight. Some markets that opened on Sunday were already down close to two per cent.
Ali Nawaz, CEO of Chase Securities, expects early weakness in trading when it begins.
“The market is likely to see a decline in the opening hours, driven by investor concerns over the US-Iran conflict, the broader Middle East situation and rising oil prices,” he said.
However, he expects the pressure to ease as the week progresses.
“A recovery could follow as the situation moves towards resolution and institutional investors step in for value buying,” Nawaz said. Given the market’s recent corrections, further declines may create attractive valuations for investors, echoing the age-old advice to buy the dip.
As the Pakistan Stock Market bleeds, investors may turn to gold, which is expected to surge. On Saturday, local gold prices jumped by Rs10,000 per tola in Pakistan. Qasim Shikarpuri, president of the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association, expects international prices to rise by $200–$300 per ounce once markets reopen.
“If that happens, local gold prices could surge by as much as Rs60,000 per tola,” he said.
Bazaars and shopping
Retailers say geopolitical tensions are already affecting shopping activity during Ramazan, a critical sales period for bazaars and malls.
“We have seen this before,” said Asfandyar Farrukh, Chairman of the Chainstore Association of Pakistan. “Even a few days ago, when tensions flared between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and warnings were issued, there was an immediate impact.”
The effect is most visible over the weekend, when shopping activity typically peaks.
“Weekend footfall is usually the highest, especially on Sundays. But in such situations, visitor numbers can fall by half,” he said.
If the tensions subside quickly, retailers expect the slowdown to be temporary.
“If things improve within two or three days, the lost sales can be made up,” he said. “But if uncertainty continues through Ramazan, then the impact could become more significant.”
According to Farrukh, shoppers tend to adjust their behaviour during prolonged uncertainty rather than abandoning shopping altogether.
“People still need to shop for Eid. What they usually do is go out earlier in the day or spread their visits over time,” he said. “But overall, there could still be a 20–25pc decline in footfall during periods of heightened tension.”
Retail activity during Ramazan typically peaks in the final ten days before Eid, though momentum had only recently begun building in markets.
“The last ten days are usually when Ramazan shopping really accelerates,” he said. “But we are already beginning to see some slowdown.”
Farrukh does not expect security concerns to push shoppers significantly toward online retail.
“Eid shopping is an experience. People want to see the fabric, the material, the footwear, hence they prefer to visit markets,” he said. “Online shopping has been growing, but it does not replace the Eid shopping experience.”
Instead, the larger risk for retail spending comes from rising fuel prices.
“If oil prices surge, that will have the biggest impact on consumer spending,” he said. “Fuel prices have already increased, and further hikes are expected. If this situation continues for several days, it would directly affect household spending.”
A path for de-escalation?
Ultimately, much will depend on whether the conflict escalates or finds an off-ramp.
“Domestic politics in the United States may ultimately shape how far this confrontation goes. The US faces congressional midterm elections in November 2026,” notes Husain.
With the American economy already grappling with tariff shocks and a cooling job market amid massive AI investments, the cost of living remains a top voter concern. Surveys cited by The Wall Street Journal show that inflation and household costs remain the most persistent economic complaints.
If gas prices surge sharply, it could damage Republicans at the ballot box, potentially costing them control of the House or the Senate and undermining the administration’s ability to pass major legislation.
That may explain why Donald Trump has suggested there are several “off-ramps” from the military operation, in recent comments to media outlet Axios. Trump is also facing pressure from how own Make America Great Again (MAGA) political base to avoid a prolonged Middle East intervention.
Equally important is Iran’s reaction.
“Iranians have historically been pragmatic in such circumstances,” Husain said. After the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020 and the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in 2024, Tehran’s responses were calibrated.
“There will almost certainly be face-saving measures,” Husain said. “But if past behaviour is any guide, those may eventually be accompanied by efforts to de-escalate as well.”
Pakistan has paid a heavy price on its path to stabilisation. Its fragile economic recovery relies heavily on stable oil prices. The difference between escalation and restraint could mean the difference between continued stabilisation and another severe macroeconomic shock.

Iran carried out the strikes in Gulf countries that have US bases and assets after joint attacks on the Islamic republic by Israel and America.
The UAE Capital Markets Authority said the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange and Dubai Financial Market would remain shut on March 2 and March 3, citing its supervisory and regulatory role over the country’s capital markets.
“The Authority will continue to monitor developments in the region and assess the situation on an ongoing basis, taking any further measures as necessary,” it said in a statement.

 

The UAE’s two exchanges are home to some of the region’s most valuable listed companies.
The closure keeps billions of dollars in listed assets in suspension as investors await clarity on the scale of damage from Saturday and Sunday’s strikes, which hit airports, ports and residential areas across the UAE and broader Gulf region.
Gulf markets that did open on Sunday saw sharp declines. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index fell more than four per cent at the open, Oman dropped 3pc and Egypt’s main index shed 5.44pc, while Kuwait suspended trading entirely.

In a post on X, the premier said, “The government and the people of Pakistan join the people of Iran in their hour of grief and sorrow and extend the most sincere condolences on the martyrdom of His Eminence Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei.”







He further said, “Pakistan also expresses concern over the violation of the norms of international law. It is an age-old convention that the heads of state/government should not be targeted.”
The premier prayed for the Iranian supreme leader and for strength for the people of the country to bear “this irreparable loss”.
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed profound sorrow over the martyrdom of the Iranian supreme leader and other members of Iran’s senior leadership, according to a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat.
“The president said that Pakistan stands with the Iranian nation in this moment of grief and shares in their loss. He observed that the passing of a leader of such stature, along with other senior figures, would be deeply felt across the Muslim world,” the statement said.
He also offered prayers for the deceased and the people of Iran.







PM Shehbaz speaks to Jordan, Bahrain kings
Separately, PM Shehbaz spoke to Jordan’s King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein to discuss the “evolving regional situation”, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
“The two leaders exchanged views on the serious regional developments following the recent escalation from the Israeli attack on Iran, which was followed by attacks on Jordan and other regional countries,” the statement said.
“The prime minister expressed Pakistan’s deep concern over the situation and emphasised the urgent need for restraint, de-escalation, and dialogue to preserve regional peace and stability,” the statement said.
It added that the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the kingdom as well as other brotherly countries in the region during this “challenging time”.
“He also reiterated Pakistan’s readiness to support all efforts aimed at restoring calm and promoting stability. Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination on regional developments,” the statement said.
The premier also posted about it on X, saying, “We emphasised the urgent need for restraint, dialogue, and de-escalation to preserve peace and stability.”







He also spoke to Bahrain King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa to discuss the “ongoing crisis” in the Middle East and Iran’s attacks on several Gulf countries, including Bahrain, after US-Israeli attacks.
According to the PMO, the premier said that such unprovoked acts of aggression only escalated the situation and threatened the peace and stability of the entire region.
“He assured the leadership of Bahrain that Pakistan stood firmly with Bahrain and other brotherly Gulf countries and underscored the need for maximum restraint in this difficult time,” the statement said.







PM Shehbaz also emphasised the need to “preserve the primacy of international law and reiterated that Pakistan would always remain committed to supporting peace efforts and urge all parties to engage in diplomacy and seek a negotiated solution to the crisis”.
In a post on X about his conversation with Bahrain’s king, PM Shehbaz said, “While praying for the safety and security of our brothers and sisters in Bahrain, I emphasised restraint, respect for international law, and the urgent need for dialogue and diplomacy to restore peace and stability in the region.”

Samson hit 12 fours and four sixes in his superb 50-ball knock in the winner-takes-all final Super Eights match to thrill a capacity 67,000 fans at a pulsating Eden Gardens.
After the West Indies smacked 70 off the last five overs to score 195-4 after being asked to bat, India lost two early wickets but were always up with the required rate.
Samson, opening for the second match in succession, led the way.
When India slipped to 41-2, he was joined by captain Suryakumar Yadav (18) and the pair added 58 for the third wicket.
Tilak Varma was next to join Samson and scored 27 off 15 before departing in the 15th over with the score 141-4 and India still needing 55.
Samson stood firm and though Hardik Pandya fell for 17, India reached the target with four balls to spare to spark celebrations and fireworks.
Jason Holder and Rovman Powell earlier put on an unbroken stand of 76 for the fifth wicket to help the West Indies set the defending champions a target of 196 to stay alive.
The West Indies sprang a surprise at the top of the order, promoting Test captain Roston Chase to open alongside T20 skipper Shai Hope.
That enabled them to bring in an extra spinner, Akeal Hosein, with regular opener Brandon King left out.
In their defeat to South Africa last week, the West Indies slumped to 83-7 but the new-look opening partnership was more assured.
Spinner Varun Chakravarthy got the first breakthrough, bowling Hope for a sluggish 32.
Shimron Hetmyer raced to 27 off 12 balls before falling to the faintest of edges off Jasprit Bumrah to make it 102-2.
After Chase fell for 40 and Sherfane Rutherford followed, Powell and Holder launched their brutal late assault.
Powell finished on 34 not out from 19 balls with two sixes and three fours, while Holder was unbeaten on 37 off 22 balls with three sixes and two fours.
It could have been better for India but they dropped three regulation catches in a sloppy fielding display, including Chase when he had made just 15.
South Africa, the only unbeaten side in the tournament, beat Zimbabwe by five wickets earlier on Sunday and will face New Zealand in Kolkata in the first semi-final on Wednesday.
The final is in Ahmedabad next Sunday.</p><small>2026-03-01 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/0121075692f28d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1977094/geo-news-transmission-hacked-subversive-message-displayed' target='_blank'><strong>Geo News’ transmission hacked; subversive message displayed</strong></a><br><p>The live television feed of Geo News was hacked on Sunday night, with a subversive message being displayed.
In a statement, the Geo News management said that for the past 24 hours, attempts were being made to hack the channel — which was on the communication satellite PAKSAT — and disrupt its broadcast.
The management said that for some time now, the channel had been facing continuous disruptions.
“Geo News’ screen was hacked to display an inappropriate message,” the statement said, adding that the situation had nothing to do with the channel.
It called on authorities to take notice of the incident, take immediate action and bring those responsible to justice.

The global oil benchmark has rallied this year and reached $73 a barrel on Friday for its highest since July, buoyed by growing concern over the potential attacks that arrived a day later. Futures trading is closed over the weekend.
“While the military attacks are themselves supportive for oil prices, the key factor here is the closing of the Strait of Hormuz,” said Ajay Parmar, director of energy and refining at ICIS.
Most tanker owners, oil majors and trading houses have suspended crude oil, fuel and liquefied natural gas shipments via the Strait of Hormuz, trade sources said, after Tehran warned ships against moving through the waterway. More than 20pc of global oil is moved through the Strait of Hormuz.
Middle East leaders have warned Washington that a war on Iran could lead to oil prices jumping to more than $100 a barrel, said RBC analyst Helima Croft. Rabobank analysts are slightly less bullish, seeing prices holding above $90 a barrel in the near term.
The OPEC+ group of oil producers agreed on Sunday to raise output by 206,000 barrels per day (bpd) from April, a modest increase representing less than 0.2pc of global demand.
While some alternate infrastructure could be used to bypass the Strait of Hormuz, the net impact from its closure would be a loss of 8million to 10m bpd of crude oil supply even after diverting some flows through Saudi Arabia’s East-West pipeline and Abu Dhabi’s pipeline, said Rystad Energy economist Jorge Leon.
Rystad expects prices to rise by $20 to about $92 a barrel when trade opens.
The Iran crisis also prompted Asian governments and refiners to assess oil stockpiles and alternative shipping routes and supplies. Kpler analysts said in a webinar on Sunday that India might turn to Russian oil to make up for potential Middle East supply loss.</p><small>2026-03-01 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/01212835fb80af7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1977044/pm-shehbaz-chairs-meeting-reviewing-pakistans-security-situation-regional-environment' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz chairs meeting reviewing Pakistan’s security situation, regional environment</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday chaired a high-level meeting to review the regional situation and the country’s security situation, state-run PTV reported.
The development comes as Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban earlier this week after the neighbouring country targeted Pakistani positions along the border.
Separately, the United States and Israel launched strikes against Iran on Saturday, assassinating Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Tehran called the strikes unprovoked and illegal and responded with missiles fired at Israel and at least seven other countries, including Gulf states that host US bases.
In a post on X, the state broadcaster said that during the meeting, the regional situation was reviewed in detail, while Pakistan’s role in maintaining peace in the region and multiple actions in this regard were also considered.







The situation of Afghanistan was also deeply reviewed during the meeting, while the members were also given a briefing on the internal situation of the country and the security arrangements in this regard, it said.
Further, actions taken to repatriate Pakistani citizens in Iran were also reviewed, with the Foreign Office giving a detailed briefing on efforts undertaken for their safe return, PTV said.
It added that evacuation was being facilitated through Azerbaijan for their safe return to the country. It was also briefed that their repatriation was being made possible from Iran via Azerbaijan.
PM postpones visit to Russia
Meanwhile, the premier also postponed his official visit to Russia, citing the recent “regional and internal situation”. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) confirmed the development in a statement.
It added that the premier’s visit to Russia was of “great significance” for advancing the bilateral relations between the two countries, but given the current situation, it was being postponed.
A new date would be decided after “mutual consultations”, the statement added.







According to Russian media, PM Shehbaz was due to travel to Russia from March 3 to 5.

Khamenei, who dominated Iran’s political and religious landscape for nearly three decades, was assassinated early Saturday when his high-security residential compound in central Tehran was targeted. Several family members — including his daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and a grandchild — were also killed in the strike.
The attack came as Israel and the US launched coordinated strikes across multiple Iranian cities, including Tehran, reportedly killing more than 200 people, according to health officials.
The escalation followed three rounds of indirect nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington — most recently in Geneva on Thursday — that failed to produce a breakthrough.
With Khamenei’s death, attention has shifted to the constitutional mechanism that will determine Iran’s next supreme leader. His office announced Sunday that during the transition, the president, the head of the judiciary and a cleric from the Guardian Council will jointly oversee the functions of the Supreme Leader’s office until a successor is chosen.
Role of the Assembly of Experts
At the centre of the succession process is the Assembly of Experts, an influential body tasked with selecting the Islamic Republic’s highest political and religious authority.
It is composed of 88 senior Islamic jurists and clerics elected by popular vote to serve eight-year terms. Its primary responsibility is to appoint a new supreme leader in the event of death, resignation or incapacity.
Since the 1979 revolution, Iran has had only two supreme leaders: Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, and Ali Khamenei, who succeeded him in 1989.
Article 107 of the Iranian Constitution states that “the determination of the Leader rests with the experts elected by the people,” underscoring the Assembly’s authority to vet and appoint the country’s top figure.
Beyond selecting the leader, the body is responsible for supervising his performance and holds the authority to dismiss him if he fails to fulfil his duties.
The assembly’s most recent elections were held in 2024, and it is currently headed by veteran cleric Mohammad Ali Movahedi Kermani.
How is the new leader chosen?
Potential candidates must first be vetted and approved by the Guardian Council, a constitutionally mandated body that screens candidates for key political positions. Only individuals who pass this vetting process are eligible for consideration.
Following Khomeini’s death on June 3, 1989, the Assembly of Experts convened to fill the leadership vacuum at a critical moment, as Iran was emerging from the eight-year war with Iraq. Khamenei was selected as successor, aided by Khomeini’s personal recommendation and an overwhelming vote during an emotionally charged session.
Under constitutional criteria, the supreme leader must be a qualified Islamic jurist, just and pious, well-versed in political and social affairs, and capable of leadership and sound judgment.
If no candidate fully meets all qualifications, the Assembly may select an individual demonstrating strong leadership ability and political competence.
After deliberations, members vote internally, and the candidate securing a majority of votes from those present is appointed.
Internal deliberations
Before a formal vote, the Assembly conducts private deliberations to assess multiple candidates based on religious scholarship, political experience and administrative competence.
These sessions are held behind closed doors, and details are rarely disclosed publicly. However, the 1989 session in which Khamenei was chosen was recorded, and footage shows him visibly emotional after his selection.
Experts note that succession planning is not improvised but the result of years of preparation. Committees within the Assembly evaluate potential candidates and maintain shortlists to ensure readiness.
After Khomeini’s death, several figures were considered before Khamenei ultimately secured 60 out of 74 votes. His experience as president, role during the Iran-Iraq war, and relatively young age at the time were decisive factors.
Potential successors
Unlike 1989, analysts say there is currently no single dominant figure widely viewed as capable of matching Khamenei’s combined political authority and religious standing.
Several names have circulated in non-Iranian media, including his son, Mojtaba Khamenei. However, assessments suggest he is not in the running, or at least not among the leading contenders.
Mojtaba’s wife was reportedly among those killed in the strike on Khamenei’s compound, and he was not present at the compound at the time.
Another figure mentioned in non-Iranian media is Hassan Khomeini, grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder, but insiders say he is also not being considered.
Former President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May 2024, had been viewed by many observers as a potential successor, but his death removed a prominent candidate from consideration.</p><small>2026-03-01 14:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/0118165350f1822.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1977063/south-africa-beat-plucky-zimbabwe-ahead-of-new-zealand-semi-final' target='_blank'><strong>South Africa beat plucky Zimbabwe ahead of New Zealand semi-final</strong></a><br><p>South Africa survived a brilliant all-round show by Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza to record a five-wicket win on Sunday, which means they remained unbeaten ahead of a semi-final against New Zealand on Wednesday.
After Zimbabwe scored 153-7 in New Delhi, South Africa survived an early wobble.
Dewald Brevis hit 42 off 18 balls as the 2024 runners-up reached 154-5 in 17.5 overs.
Raza earlier hit 73 and then took 3-29 with his off-spin for Zimbabwe, who had stunned Australia and co-hosts Sri Lanka in the group stage to reach the Super Eights.
Raza struck on the third ball of the South African chase to send back Quinton de Kock, caught behind for a duck.
Raza bowled skipper Aiden Markram for four in the next over.
Ryan Rickelton was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from Brad Evans and took five minutes to recover.
He then lifted Evans for two straight sixes in the next over before the bowler had him caught for 31.
Brevis and David Miller, who hit 22, put on 50 before two more quick strikes from Zimbabwe.
Blessing Muzarabani dismissed Miller, and Raza removed Brevis.
Tristan Stubbs (21) and George Linde (30) then put on an unbeaten 53 to steer their side to the target.
After choosing to bat, Zimbabwe lost the in-form opener Brian Bennett, who hit an unbeaten 97 in the defeat by India, for 15.
Raza reached his fifty off 29 balls before falling to left-armer Kwena Maphaka, caught by Miller off a leading edge.
Clive Madande boosted the total with 26 not out off 20 balls at the end.
Maphaka took 2-21 from his four overs and Corbin Bosch 2-40.</p><small>2026-03-01 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/011606133f233f2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1977027/foreign-office-activates-crisis-management-unit-advises-pakistani-nationals-in-gulf-region-to-exercise-utmost-caution' target='_blank'><strong>Foreign Office activates crisis management unit, advises Pakistani nationals in Gulf region to exercise ‘utmost caution’</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday issued an advisory on the situation in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, saying it had activated its crisis management unit (CMU) to “closely monitor the developments and extend all necessary assistance” to Pakistani nationals abroad.

From the captain Salman Agha, who was criticised for not being a T20 player, to slow batting rates and the use of all-rounders not up to the job, the Green Shirts were shown to be behind the times in the rapid-fire format.
Former wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal believes there is a huge gulf in standard between Pakistan and the top sides such as India, West Indies, South Africa and England.
“Other teams have evolved to the demands of Twenty20 cricket, but neither our team nor our players meet those standards,” Akmal told AFP.

 

“It is like other teams are playing on the moon and we are on earth. We only beat smaller teams but lose to top teams.”
Pakistan had high hopes for the T20 World Cup after sweeping Australia 3-0 in a pre-tournament series.
The team boasted a quintet of spinners that should have been suited to the turning pitches in Sri Lanka where they played all their matches.
But they received a rude awakening in their first match against the Netherlands when only they squeezed home by three wickets in the final over thanks to Faheem Ashraf’s 11-ball 29.
‘Failed to handle pressure’
Like most of his predecessors at World Cups, Agha blundered in the pressure-cooker match against India, which only went ahead after reversing the decision to boycott the match just days before the encounter.
Agha won the toss and asked India to bat. The decision backfired badly as Pakistan conceded 175 and were hammered by 61 runs.

 

Agha inexplicably held back his mystery spinner and chief weapon Usman Tariq to the 11th over, by which time opener Ishan Kishan had scored his match-shaping 77 and India were well on their way to a winning total.
“How on earth did you bowl at a venue which was suited to batting first,” questioned former Pakistan player Basit Ali.
“After India scored 175 our batters failed to handle the pressure of a chase.”
Agha also held back Tariq’s second over against England, after he took a wicket in his first, allowing captain Harry Brook to build a sparkling match-winning century.
“It was weak captaincy from Agha,” said Akmal, who also took aim at the head coach Mike Hesson and the selectors.
“We were also not helped by head coach Mike Hesson, who has an obsession for bit-and-pieces all-rounders who were neither complete bowlers, nor good batters.”
The insistence in sticking with the out-of-sorts Babar Azam did nothing to help the team’s shaky batting.
The star batsman’s slow scoring at number four interrupted the side’s rhythm.
He was dropped for the final match against Sri Lanka on Saturday where Pakistan finally posted a total in excess of 200, but it proved too little too late as New Zealand progressed on net run rate.
“We are all fans of Azam but he disappointed us by not adapting to the demands of T20 cricket,” said one Pakistan fan, Saud Baloch, who resigned from his job in the United Arab Emirates to go to the World Cup.
“The whole Pakistan fandom is not only disappointed but angry.
“But we know nothing will change and we will continue to mourn such defeats in future.”</p><small>2026-03-01 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/010859206d86bc9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976902/pakistan-maintains-delicate-balancing-act-in-unsc-meeting-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan maintains delicate balancing act in UNSC meeting on Iran</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan struck a delicate balance at a tense UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, condemning unwarranted attacks on Iran, expressing solidarity with Gulf states, and urging an immediate return to negotiations and diplomacy.
The Council’s emergency session examined the repercussions of the US and Israeli air strikes on Iran and laid bare the deep divisions within the 15-member body over the escalating crisis. Speaking at the meeting, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, outlined Islamabad’s growing concern as the situation in the Middle East becomes more complex with each new development.
“Pakistan condemns the initiation of unwarranted attacks against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in violation of international law,” the ambassador said.
At the same time, he stressed that Pakistan also “condemns the attacks against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and stands in solidarity with all these brotherly countries.”
He warned that, at a time when renewed diplomatic efforts were underway, such actions would “undermine the peace and stability of the entire region, with far-reaching consequences.”
Ambassador Ahmad made clear that Pakistan’s concern extends beyond any single capital. Instead, it is focused on the security architecture of the entire Gulf region — home to millions of Pakistani expatriates and a region with which Islamabad maintains deep political, economic and security ties.
This dual condemnation — of strikes on Iran and of attacks on Gulf states — illustrates the fine line Pakistan is walking. It cannot afford to alienate Tehran, a neighbor with whom it shares a sensitive border and a complex security equation. Nor can it distance itself from Gulf partners that host large Pakistani communities and play a critical role in Pakistan’s economy.
The envoy’s emphasis on mediation and dialogue further underscored this balancing act. “We particularly laud Oman’s role in facilitating and mediating dialogue between Iran and the United States,” he said, aligning Pakistan firmly with diplomatic efforts rather than military blocs.
In another pointed observation, he lamented that “diplomacy has once again been derailed as these attacks have happened right in the middle of negotiations,” warning that “these military actions undermine dialogue and further erode trust that was already in short supply.”
Islamabad’s legal framing was equally deliberate. The ambassador reminded the Council that “the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct,” stressing that the Charter “prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states.”
This formulation allows Pakistan to oppose unilateral or pre-emptive military actions without directly isolating any particular power beyond the immediate incidents.
At the humanitarian level, Pakistan sought to humanise the crisis. Ambassador Ahmad offered condolences to “civilians caught in the middle of these violent acts,” specifically mentioning “school children in Iran” and the family of a Pakistani national killed in the United Arab Emirates. In doing so, Islamabad reinforced its message that ordinary people — Iranians, Arabs and Pakistanis alike — are the real victims of escalation.
The strategic anxiety was also explicit. “We are deeply alarmed at the risk of regional conflagration,” the ambassador said, noting that the “safety and well-being of millions of our compatriots in the countries of the region is also our top priority.”
Ultimately, Pakistan’s message was straightforward but urgent: “Pakistan calls on all sides to immediately halt escalation and urgently resume diplomacy with a view to achieving a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis.”
Whether the balance Islamabad seeks to maintain can endure will depend not only on its own diplomatic agility, but also on whether the region itself steps back from the brink.</p><small>2026-03-01 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/01095710b854be3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976864/fbr-misses-collection-target-by-rs429bn-in-eight-months' target='_blank'><strong>FBR misses collection target by Rs429bn in eight months</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) missed its projected collection target by a staggering Rs429 billion during the first eight months of 2025-26.
However, the collection recorded an 11 per cent increase to Rs8.121 trillion during July-February FY26, compared with Rs7.334tr raised in the same period last year, according to provisional figures released on Saturday.
The FBR had set a revenue collection target of Rs8.550tr for 8MFY26. The revenue shortfall is primarily attributed to a slowdown in domestic sales tax collection, suspension of super tax and several other factors.
The February collection grew by 12pc to Rs944bn from Rs844bn in the corresponding month last year. However, the collection fell short of the monthly target of Rs1.029tr by Rs85 bn.

Records 11pc YoY rise to Rs8.121tr; income, sales tax collection falls

The IMF, in its last review, has already revised down the FBR’s annual tax collection target by Rs150bn.
In FY25, the FBR missed its collection target by nearly Rs163bn, even after two downward revisions and raised Rs11.737tr against the revised target of Rs11.900tr. However, the collection reflects a year-on-year growth of 26.19pc from Rs9.301tr in FY24.
The FBR issued Rs386bn in refunds and rebates to taxpayers during 8MFY26, up from Rs352bn a year earlier, an increase of 9.65pc.
Income tax collection reached Rs3.956tr during 8MFY26, recording a shortfall of Rs142bn against the Rs4.098tr target. However, a 12pc increase was recorded compared to Rs3.525tr in the corresponding period last year.
Similarly, the sales tax collection totalled Rs2.783tr, recording a shortfall of Rs245bn against the Rs3.028tr projection, though it marked a 10pc rise over last year’s Rs2.530tr. Customs duty collection stood at Rs850bn, against the Rs898bn target, resulting in a shortfall of Rs48bn. However, it grew by 5pc compared to Rs813bn last year.
In contrast, the Federal Excise Duty collection reached Rs532bn, surpassing the projected target of Rs526bn and growing by 14pc from last year’s Rs467bn.
According to the FBR, income tax collection will improve further once the super tax is collected. This improved revenue collection performance is not incidental but reflects the structural impact of the FBR’s reforms, especially its enhanced enforcement measures and its coordinated effort to realise revenue stuck in litigation.
The improvement in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) production, a very positive and encouraging development, will help raise maximum sales tax collection in the upcoming months.
By leveraging digital infrastructure and the collection through enforcement measures, the FBR is improving compliance, expanding and deepening the tax net, and fostering taxpayer trust. This performance in direct taxes signals emerging behavioural shifts toward greater voluntary compliance, with potential spill-over benefits in the coming months.
FBR vows to collect due taxes
Federal Board of Revenue Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said on Saturday that genuine hardship cases would receive special consideration, but stressed that all legally due taxes would be collected under any circumstances.
The chairman further said that tax evasion would not be tolerated. He was speaking with an 18-member delegation from the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI), led by its President, Sardar Tahir Mahmood, at the FBR headquarters.
The delegation discussed key taxation issues faced by the business community in the federal capital.
During the meeting, the ICCI delegation apprised the FBR chairman of various challenges confronting businesses in the capital, including issues related to super tax, tax refunds, point-of-sale (PoS) integration for small businesses, taxation of the real estate and property sector and other operational hardships.
Mr Langrial and assured the delegation that we will do everything we can to support the business community. He emphasised that genuine hardship cases would be given special consideration, while reiterating that the collection of taxes payable under the law would be ensured and tax evasion would not be tolerated under any circumstances.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened US firm Micron Tech­n­o­logy’s Semiconductor Assembly, Test and Packaging unit in his home state of Gujarat, hailing the “dawn of a new era” for India’s technology ambitions.
“When young Indians look back in the future, they will see this decade as the turning point in our tech future,” Modi told the event, which was broadcast on his official YouTube channel.
The plant will convert advanced semiconductor wafers from Micron’s global network into finished memory and storage products.
India’s semiconductor market has expanded from $38 billion in 2023 to an estimated $45-50bn in 2024-25, with government targets of up to $110bn by 2030.
New Delhi is currently developing 10 chip projects worth more than $18bn , including two cutting-edge 3-nanometre des­ign facilities in the cities of Noida and Bengaluru.
Modi said at least three other semiconductor projects would begin production soon.
“India, which is known for software, is now also building its identity in hardware,” he said.

 

The prime minister linked the launch to deepening technological cooperation with Washington, noting India’s entry into the US-led Pax Silica alliance focused on artificial intelligence, critical minerals and supply-chain security — areas where China holds considerable sway.
“The entire world wants to secure these supply cha­ins which are key for hum­anity’s future,” Modi said.
The US ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, said the opening marked “India’s entry into the global semiconductor supply chain as a manufacturer nation”.
“This is just the beginning,” Gor said.
