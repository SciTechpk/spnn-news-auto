The details were shared during a media briefing on the Reko-Diq project’s progress.
Communications Manager Samia Ali Shah said payments tallied as of June 2025 include $17.5m in royalties, nearly $3.8m in taxes collected on behalf of employees and other parties and $7.2m in community investment.
Ms Shah explained that the Balochistan government holds a 25 per cent partnership in the project without making any direct investment. The overall venture is a 50-50 partnership between the government of Pakistan and RDMC.
The briefing also highlighted the company’s efforts in local workforce development.
Present at the event were trainees who had just returned to Pakistan after completing 18 months of training in Argentina, sponsored by the company.
“The young talent going for training abroad comprises 14pc females,” Ms Shah said, adding the project has long-term benefits for the region.

Saudabad Police Station House Officer (SHO) Ateeq Rehman told Dawn.com, “The victim, Basit Saeed, had left his home to supply milk on a motorbike when a dumper hit him. He sustained critical injuries and died on the spot.”
The incident angered area residents who damaged the heavy vehicle and beat the errant driver, he said.
“However, the police arrived on the spot, preventing the situation from deteriorating. The driver was arrested and the vehicle impounded. The body was taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities.”
Karachi has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Earlier this month, at least four people lost their lives and another six were injured after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a nullah on Hawkesbay Road in the city’s Mauripur area.
In June, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, killing a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl. Another minor girl was injured in that accident.</p><small>2025-07-18 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1811114145e58eb.png?r=111354' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924970/lightning-strikes-kill-33-people-in-eastern-india' target='_blank'><strong>Lightning strikes kill 33 people in eastern India</strong></a><br><p>Lightning strikes during monsoon storms in eastern India this week killed at least 33 people and injured dozens, officials said on Friday.
The deaths in Bihar occurred during fierce storms between Wednesday and Thursday, a state disaster management department statement said, with the victims mostly farmers and labourers working in the open.
More heavy rain and lightning are forecast for parts of the state.
Bihar state’s disaster management minister, Vijay Kumar Mandal, told AFP that officials in vulnerable districts had been directed to “create awareness to take precautionary steps following an alert on lightning”.
The state government announced compensation of 4 million rupees ($4,600) to the families of those killed by lightning.
At least 243 died by lightning in 2024 and 275 the year earlier, according to the state government.
India’s eastern region, including Bihar, is prone to annual floods that kill dozens and displace hundreds of thousands of people during the peak monsoon season.</p><small>2025-07-18 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/180154321160d93.jpg?r=015447' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923019/sindh-has-increased-its-education-budget-by-25pc-but-is-it-enough-for-half-of-its-children-who-are-out-of-school' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh has increased its education budget by 25pc. But is it enough for half of its children who are out of school?</strong></a><br><p>Education lies at the heart of sustainable development and human capital growth. In Sindh, where nearly half the population is under the age of 16, the state of education holds the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and underdevelopment. While the recently announced Sindh Budget 2025-26 has brought education to the forefront, critical gaps remain in access, quality, and equity. And if we don’t fix the cracks now, we risk losing another generation to the same broken system.
Sindh, Pakistan’s second-most populous province with 55.7 million people, faces significant challenges in education despite having a demographic edge. The province has the country’s youngest population — 30 per cent aged between 5 and 16 years and 80pc under 40 years of age. At the same time, there’s a high number of out-of-school children (OOSC), the curriculum is plagued by poor learning outcomes, public-private-madressah disparities, gender inequality, and weak adaptability of the education system to labour market demands and climate risks.
In this year’s budget, the Sindh government has earmarked Rs613.36 billion for education — with Rs524.32 billion directed towards service delivery and Rs89.04 billion set aside for development — marking a significant increase from last year’s allocation of Rs454 billion. Key allocations include Rs13.5 billion for the Sindh Education Foundation (SEF) and Rs 2.5billion for madressah reforms. But can these investments truly reverse the tide of Sindh’s worsening education crisis?
 
 

While spending commitments for school scholarships and endowment funds — including partnerships with organisations like Akhuwat — signal a push to engage the private sector and civil society, the absence of a comprehensive strategy to bring out-of-school children back into classrooms risks rendering these efforts insufficient.
The problems and their solutions
According to the Economic Survey FY25, Sindh’s gross primary enrolment rate stands at 71pc, far below the national average of 84pc, with even Balochistan slightly ahead at 72pc. Middle school enrolment is just 54pc, again trailing behind the national average.

Notably, 47pc of children in Sindh remain out of school, second only to Balochistan.

The problem is worse in disaster-prone districts such as Khairpur, Larkana, Dadu, and Sanghar, where cumulative enrolment barely reaches 33pc.
While the budget includes allocations for climate-resilient infrastructure, investment in flood mitigation — crucial to safeguarding continuous education — remains limited. Sindh’s education system has repeatedly suffered in the aftermath of disasters such as the 2010 and 2022 floods, which devastated rural communities and damaged over 20,000 schools. Investing in disaster-resilient school infrastructure, mobile learning units, and early warning systems can protect educational continuity in future crises.
Moreover, education must be integrated into disaster risk reduction policies to ensure that rebuilding goes beyond physical infrastructure to address the educational needs of displaced children and vulnerable communities. Schools must not only be rebuilt but also designed with resilience to withstand future disasters. Early recovery planning should prioritise the rapid resumption of education through temporary learning centres, distance education, and psychosocial support for children affected by emergencies. Climate-resilient schools with elevated structures, solar power, and rainwater harvesting systems can serve as community hubs in times of crisis.
Beyond disasters, Sindh’s education infrastructure is weak.

Only 31pc of schools have electricity, 58pc have drinking water, and 57pc have toilets, all below national averages.

The province has responded by expanding public-private partnerships through SEF. Programmes like the Adopt-a-School and Foundation-Assisted Schools aim to enhance management and learning outcomes. The current Rs13.5 billion allocation to SEF is a positive step, but further efforts are needed to improve access for girls and marginalised communities. The success of public-private partnerships hinges on careful regulation, teacher training, and local community engagement.
Evaluations of SEF-supported schools have shown that while these schools often outperform purely public counterparts, challenges around quality assurance, equitable access, and gender disparities remain. Transparent performance monitoring and feedback loops are essential to scaling up such models effectively. Evidence from successful public-private partnership (PPP) models in other countries, such as Bangladesh’s BRAC schools, demonstrates that when communities are actively involved and accountability mechanisms are strong, public-private partnerships can significantly boost enrolment and learning outcomes. Sindh can adapt such models by focusing on scalability, transparency, and gender inclusion.
 
 

Learning outcomes remain dismal
According to the 2023 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), only 22pc of Grade 5 students in rural Sindh can read a basic English sentence, and just 27pc can perform division. Private school students consistently outperform their government school counterparts across all subjects. The absence of relief in the current budget for school expenses such as textbooks, stationery, and unchecked private school fees continues to burden poor families, leading to high dropout rates.
The stark divide in education reflects deep-rooted socioeconomic inequalities. For the poorest, madressahs are the only viable option as they offer food and shelter. Low-income families opt for low-cost private schools, while others rely on underfunded government schools. Despite the Sindh Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2013, reforms have failed to eliminate these disparities. The gap is evident in literacy and numeracy outcomes between urban and rural, rich and poor students, and between boys and girls. Gender gaps are exacerbated by unsafe school environments, lack of female teachers, and absence of transport.

Without targeted investment in girls’ education, including stipends, infrastructure, and security, these gaps will persist.

The government must go beyond policy declarations to implement on-the-ground solutions. Conditional cash transfers for families, free transport for rural girls, and incentives for female teachers to work in remote areas can help narrow the learning divide. In urban areas, the government should regulate private schools to prevent exploitation and ensure quality standards. A universal minimum education standard, enforced across all types of schools — including madressahs — is imperative to reduce disparities.
 
 

Bridging this divide will also require a cultural shift. Engaging religious leaders, tribal elders, and local influencers to advocate for education, particularly for girls, can help shift societal norms. Furthermore, the establishment of community-based schools, especially in sparsely populated rural areas, can provide localised access to education, reducing the distance barrier that disproportionately affects girls.
The silver linings
One promising initiative in the 2025-26 budget is the decentralisation of education funds to school-level cost centres, empowering over 34,000 government schools to manage operational budgets. However, without transparency and accountability mechanisms, this reform risks enabling corruption at grass-roots level rather than driving improvement.
Past reliance on (currently dysfunctional) school management committees has shown limited success, particularly in rural areas where community participation remains low. To maximise the impact of decentralised budgets, there must be robust oversight through digital monitoring systems, community scorecards, and third-party audits. Capacity-building for headteachers and school councils is critical to ensuring that funds are used effectively. Without these safeguards, decentralisation may inadvertently replicate existing inefficiencies.
For children with disabilities, the budget promises to double assistive device outreach, benefiting 40,000 persons with disabilities (PWDs) through NGO collaborations. Monthly stipends will increase, alongside the provision of meals and uniforms, which is a commendable move toward inclusive education. In addition to the proposed stipends, the government should establish specialised teacher training, provide disability inclusive school transport, and enforce building codes for disability-friendly school infrastructure. These interventions will align Sindh’s approach with global standards under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Another focus area is the regulation of madressahs. With over 7,118 registered seminaries, the allocated Rs2.5 billion should be spent not only on grants but also on ensuring their registration, regulation, and integration into the broader education system, bringing these children into the national fold. The inclusion of madressah students in standardised assessments would also help track their progress and ensure consistency with national education goals. Bringing these religious schools into the formal education system is essential for national cohesion and human capital development.
Without structural reform, the budget means little
While the Sindh education budget for 2025-26 introduces some forward-looking initiatives — such as decentralisation, SEF expansion, and disability inclusion — it falls short of addressing the systemic barriers that perpetuate low enrolment, poor learning outcomes, and gender inequality. Without stronger political will, enhanced accountability, and targeted investment in girls’ education, disaster resilience, and rural schooling, Sindh risks falling further behind. Education must be made a true national priority, not just through financial commitments but through sustained reforms and implementation.
Achieving these reforms will require more than financial allocations; it demands strong governance, transparent decision-making, and unwavering political commitment. Without these pillars in place, the current budgetary allocations — already insufficient — risks leaving another generation of Sindh’s youth unequipped for meaningful employment and a secure future.

According to Rescue 1122 sources, some locals dared Shabeer (66), a retired railway employee, to swim across the big and deep canal, setting a Rs1,000 bet on the arduous task for the elderly man, who was not even a trained swimmer.
The old man accepted the challenge and jumped into the canal.
Quoting eyewitnesses, the sources said, as the old man started drowning, the onlookers kept laughing and recording videos of him, instead of trying to save him. They also uploaded the video clip on social media.
When the old man disappeared in the water, someone called Rescue 1122 for help. By the time a rescue team reached the spot the old man had already drowned, they said.
The Rescue 1122 divers retrieved the body and handed it over to the victim’s family.
As the video went viral, many social media users condemned those who instigated the elderly man to jump into the deep canal and did not even help him when he was drowning, demandingtheir arrest. 
So far, Uch Sharif police have not taken any action over the tragic incident.
WOMAN MURDERED: A man allegedly axed his sister-in-law to death and seriously injured his niece over her marriage issue at Chak No 95 on Multan Road in the limits of Thingi police station in Vehari district.
According to police and Rescue 1122, the suspect, Ali, brought a marriage proposal of his relative for his niece, Fatimah, but his wife Pakeeza, opposed it.
On Thursday, Ali began quarrelling with his sister-in-law Pakeeza (mother of Fatima) over the marriage issue and in a fit of rage attacked her with an axe, leaving her dead on the spot.
He also attacked his niece, injured her and fled the scene.
On receipt of an emergency call, a Rescue 1122 team reached the spot and shifted Fatima to the hospital. The police shifted Pakeza’s body to the hospital for autopsy.Police have yet to register a case against the fleeing suspect.

The Journal story says the letter featuring a sketch of a naked woman and Trump’s signature was part of a collection of notes for Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003.
The newspaper says it reviewed the letter but did not print an image.
Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Emma Tucker “was told directly by (White House press secretary) Karoline Leavitt, and by President Trump, that the letter was a FAKE,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network.
“Instead, they are going with a false, malicious, and defamatory story anyway,” he said.
“President Trump will be suing The Wall Street Journal, NewsCorp, and Mr. (Rupert) Murdoch, shortly. The press has to learn to be truthful, and not rely on sources that probably don’t even exist.”
 
 

The Republican president was already facing a firestorm over his past relationship with Epstein, and claims that his administration is covering up lurid details of Epstein’s crimes to protect rich and powerful figures.
Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 — during Trump’s first term — after being charged with federal sex trafficking in a scheme where he allegedly groomed young and underage women for sexual abuse by his wealthy contacts.
He was previously required to register as a sex offender in Florida after pleading guilty to two felony prostitution-related charges.
Later on Thursday, Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to release transcripts of grand jury testimony in the Epstein case, “subject to court approval”.
‘Another wonderful secret’
The alleged letter — which Trump denies writing — is raunchy, as were others in the collection, the Journal reported. It contains several lines of typewritten text, contained in an outline of a naked woman drawn with a marker.
“The future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair,” the Journal reported.
“The letter concludes: ‘Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.’”
Trump denied writing the letter or drawing the figure, telling the Journal: “This is not me. This is a fake thing.”
“I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”
Murdoch, who controls the NewsCorp global media company, was in Trump’s suite on Sunday at MetLife Stadium outside New York City for the FIFA Club World Cup final.
Epstein row
The Trump-supporting far-right has long latched onto the Epstein scandal, claiming the existence of a still-secret client list and that he was murdered in his cell as part of a cover-up.
Trump supporters expected the Republican to answer their questions on his return to office in January, but now find themselves being told the conspiracy theories are false.
The Justice Department and FBI said in a memo made public earlier this month that there is no evidence that Epstein kept a “client list” or was blackmailing powerful people.
 
 

They also dismissed the claim that Epstein was murdered in jail, confirming his suicide, and said they would not be releasing any more information on the probe.
That could change if grand jury testimony or evidence are released.
On Thursday, US media reported that a federal prosecutor who handled Epstein’s case, who is the daughter of a prominent Trump critic, was abruptly fired.
Maurene Comey, whose father is former FBI director James Comey, was dismissed on Wednesday from her position as an assistant US attorney in Manhattan, the reports said.
Comey also prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell, the only former Epstein associate who has been criminally charged in connection with his activities.
Maxwell is the person who compiled the leather-bound book of letters for Epstein in 2003, The Journal reported.
“The WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it. Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it?” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.
 






Meanwhile, Democratic lawmaker Pat Ryan wrote: “I think we now know EXACTLY why Donald Trump refuses to release the Epstein files.”

Mr Gandapur filed a petition with multiple prayers from the high court requesting to declare as unconstitutional Rule 94 of the Election Rules, which provided that a political party which didn’t have a party symbol shall not be treated as a political party for the purpose of allocation of reserved seats.
He requested the court to declare as illegal an impugned letter issued to him by the ECP on July 14 for summoning of the KP Assembly session for administering oath to candidates of other political parties notified on reserved seats.
The petitioner prayed the court to strike down the notification issued on July 4, 2025, by Election Commission of Pakistan whereby reserved seats in the KP Assembly had been allocated to political parties having a lesser electoral mandate than the PTI.

Also challenges ECP letter for convening assembly session

He further sought directives for the ECP to allocate reserved seats to PTI strictly in accordance with the principle of proportional representation, as contemplated under the Constitution and Elections Act, 2017.
The petition is filed through a panel of lawyers including Qazi Mohammad Anwar, Alam Khan Adenzai and Basheer Wazir.
The petitioner claimed that the ECP had misinterpreted a Supreme Court judgment and had declared PTI candidates as independent. He stated that the party had secured 93 provincial assembly seats in the general elections, but as the ECP refused to acknowledge PTI as a political party, the said members were forced to submit declaration of joining Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).
He stated that the ECP had not yet issued any notification announcing PTI candidates as members of the SIC.
He said it was a matter of record that the petitioner and majority of the elected members submitted their nomination papers declaring themselves as PTI candidates and openly contested the election under the PTI banner, notwithstanding the denial of the party symbol.
He stated that the ECP failed to treat them as PTI representatives and instead proceeded to allocate reserved seats to other political parties with far fewer general seats than PTI, thereby violating the principle of proportional representation and defying the electoral mandate of the people of KP.
The petitioner contended that denial of reserved seats to PTI would create an entirely unrepresented provincial assembly that didn’t reflect the will of the people.

The event, hosted by the Islamabad High Court Bar Association, was held to celebrate the new CJ’s appointment.
Justices Arbab Mohammad Tahir, Khadim Hussain Soomro, Mohammad Azam Khan and Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas were present on the occasion.
 
 

However, senior judges Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz were not in attendance.
Justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar, who are among the five-judge group that lodged the challenge before the Supreme Court, are already on leave. Justice Mohammad Asif is also availing summer vacations.
Speaking on the occasion, IHC CJ Dogar highlighted the steps taken for swift disposal of cases, saying that specialised benches had been constituted for speedy disposal of cases related to those who are already behind bars.
Justice Dogar said that cases related to overseas Pakistanis will also be given priority, while special attention was being paid to reducing the IHC and district judiciary’s backlog.

At a press conference, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram said Mr Khan is being held in isolation for 22 hours a day and warned that the treatment of detainees, coupled with judicial and economic failures, is pushing the country towards a constitutional and humanitarian crisis.
“Despite being a former prime minister, Khan was denied both his status and even the basic rights of an ordinary prisoner, which was matter of grave concern, as he was the country’s most popular leader, and the entire nation was deeply worried about his wellbeing and safety,” Mr Akram said.
He said that the PTI founder has been denied access to newspapers, television and books and that meetings with friends and political associates have been suspended.

Waqqas warns of constitutional, humanitarian crises due to judicial and economic failures

Mr Akram added that Khan’s legal team has been blocked from consulting him on more than 200 cases, calling it “an outright violation of his right to a fair legal defence”.
Mr Akram accused jail authorities of repeatedly violating court orders that permit meetings with six designated individuals, showing a “blatant contempt of court.”
He also said Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, has been denied family visits, while Aleema Khan was not being allowed to visit her brother and other sisters were granted visits only occasionally.
Highlighting the condition of other detained party leaders, Mr Akram called the worsening health of former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi “a matter of urgent humanitarian concern.”
Referring to the cancer-surviving politician Dr. Yasmin Rashid, Mr Akram said: “Even if she defeated Nawaz Sharif politically, her basic human rights cannot be ignored.”
Mr Akram criticised the judiciary, noting that senior leader Ejaz Chaudhry remains imprisoned in a case despite being granted bail by the Supreme Court.
“I appeal to the Chief Justice of Pakistan that your directives are being openly discarded by Adiala Jail administration,” he said.

IHC Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas issued the ruling during the hearing of a petition filed by former senator Farhatullah Babar against the government’s decision to repatriate Afghan citizens holding refugee registration cards.
Advocate Umar Ijaz Gilani, representing the petitioner, requested the court to suspend the government’s actions until the case is decided.
However, Justice Minhas made it clear that the judiciary would not intervene in policy matters. “I am completely clear on this — the court will not interfere with the government’s policy,” he remarked.
The judge noted that the government has determined that all Afghan nationals must return by June 30 and emphasised that Pakistan has not signed any binding agreement offering long-term protection to refugees.
“The government says no formal contract exists, and no protection can be extended beyond June 30,” the judge added.
The court subsequently adjourned the hearing.

According to the statement issued after the meeting, “Key reforms discussed included revisiting the NFC Award, suggesting that the current 80pe weightage assigned to population be reduced to 50pe, with 30pe allocated as an incentive to provinces that successfully reverse population growth trends.”
The minister also advocated for a focused Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) campaign to educate men across the country about population control measures.
He raised concerns about the high fertility rate, calling it a national issue requiring immediate attention. He encouraged efforts to balance population growth through collaboration with stakeholders, including religious scholars and development partners.
Mustafa Kamal highlighted Pakistan’s challenges, including a high burden of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. He stressed the importance of shifting focus to preventive and promotive healthcare by strengthening primary health care systems to reduce the strain on tertiary care facilities.

• Claims opposition didn’t raise issue of reinstating suspended lawmakers
• Bhachar rejects assertion, says no return to house until MPAs’ suspension withdrawn
LAHORE: Negotiations between the trea­­sury and opposition benches in the Punjab Assembly made headway during the third round of talks on Thursday, with both sides reaching an agreement on parliamentary conduct and activation of key house committees.
However, a deadlock persists over the reinstatement of 26 suspended opposition lawmakers and the withdrawal of fines imposed on them — an issue the opposition insists is non-negotiable for their return to the house.
The 26 PTI lawmakers in question were suspended for 15 sittings following their protest during Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s speech on June 27.
Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehm­an told reporters after the meeting on Thursday, “This was the third sitting of the negotiation committee, and today’s session was productive. We have reached a consensus with the op­­­position (on certain issues),” he said.
He added that in future, there would be no use of abusive language, sloganeering or disruptions during assembly proceedings. “When the opposition leader speaks, there will be no sloganeering. Similarly, there will be no disruptions during the chief minister’s speech. The house will operate according to the recommendations of the Business Advisory Committee,” he noted.
Mr Rehman also said the Ethics Com­m­ittee would be made functional and tasked with reviewing any violations of the assembly’s rules of procedure after each session.
He claimed the opposition had not raised the issue of reinstating suspended lawmakers. However, the assertion was rebutted by opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar. Speaking to the media separately, he said, “We will never enter the house without our suspended colleagues.”
Mr Bhachar confirmed that both sides had exchanged proposals and agreed on reactivating the Advisory Committee and the Ethics Committee.
He emphasised that the house would be run under the framework of the Ethics Committee and Rule 223 of the Rules of Procedure, indicating a move towards more structured parliamentary proceedings.
Regarding the heated exchanges that have plagued recent sessions, Mr Bhachar said the government acknowledged the opposition’s right to protest but stressed that abusive language is not a good practice. “We have never called it good either. Abu­sive language will not be tolerated,” he said.
Despite these agreements on parliamentary decorum, the core demand of the opposition remains the reinstatement of their sus­p­ended members and the withdrawal of fines.
“No one asked us for an apology, nor did we apologise,” Mr Bhachar said, warning: “If our people are not reinstated, the opposition will hold an assembly outside the (provincial) assembly.”
He stressed the opposition’s unwavering stance: “We are in the opposition; it never backs down from protest. If the government wants the opposition to come into the house, then they can reinstate [our members].”
He questioned the rationale behind any expectation of an apology. “Why would we apologise when our members are suspended and fined?” he asked. “Fines have not been waived and our people are still suspended. Until they are reinstated, we will not return to the house.” He also underlined a key constitutional right, stating: “No member can be deprived of their right to vote.”
Meanwhile, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, who is abroad on a private trip, participated in the negotiating committee meeting via an audio link. He congratulated all members of the committee on the successful talks and reiterated the negotiation committee’s decision, particularly the agreement on not using indecent language.
He was quoted as saying that “the decisions of the Ethics Committee will be supreme” and urged that “the act of use of abusive language should not be repeated”.
The speaker affirmed that “the opposition has the right to protest, but according to the Constitution”.

• 24 Palestinians killed in attacks across the besieged enclave
CAIRO: Israeli forces killed at least 27 people in attacks in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, including three people who died in a strike on a church that late Pope Francis used to speak to regularly, medics and church officials said.
Eight men tasked with protecting aid trucks were reported among the dead in airstrikes that were carried out while mediators continued ceasefire talks in Doha.
A US official said this week the talks were going well but two officials from the Pales­tinian group Hamas told Reut­ers there had been no bre­akthr­ough as the Israeli military continued to pummel Gaza.
Two women and one man died and several people were wounded in a strike by the Isr­a­­eli army on Gaza’s Holy Fam­i­­ly Church, said the Latin Patr­iarchate of Jerusalem, which oversees the small parish.
“The Latin Patriarchate strongly condemns this tragedy and this targeting of innocent civilians and of a sacred place,” a statement by the Patriarchate said, adding that the victims had turned to the church compound as a safe haven “after their homes, possessions, and dignity had already been stripped away”.
“This horrific war must come to a complete end,” it said.
Photos released by the church showed its roof had been hit close to the main cross, scorching the stone facade, and that windows had been broken.
Father Gabriele Roma­nelli, an Argentine who used to regularly update the late Pope Francis about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was slightly injured in the attack. TV footage showed him sitting receiving treatment at Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza, with a bandage around his lower right leg.
Pope Leo said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened” by the loss of life and renewed his appeal for an immediate ceasefire, while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said attacks on civilians were unacceptable.
The Israeli military said it was looking into the incident. Israel’s foreign ministry said in a statement on X that the re­­sults of the investigation wou­­ld be published. It also said the country did not target churches or religious sites and regretted harm to them or civilians.
 






Palestinian medics said one air strike on Thursday had killed a man, his wife and their five children in Jabalia in northern Gaza, and that another in the north had killed eight men who had been handed responsibility for protecting aid trucks.
Three people were killed in an airstrike in central Gaza and four in Zeitoun in eastern Gaza, medics said.
Ceasefire talks
Arab mediators Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States, have hosted more than 10 days of talks on a proposed US 60-day truce.
As part of the potential deal, 10 prisoners held in Gaza would be returned along with the bodies of 18 others, spread out over 60 days. In exchange, Israel would release detained Palestinians. The exact number is not clear.
A Hamas source with knowledge of the matter said Israel had presented new maps to the mediators, pledging to pull the army further back than had previously been offered. The source said this partially met Hamas’ demands, but was still insufficient.
Disputes also remain over aid delivery mechanisms into Gaza, and guarantees that any eventual truce would lead to ending the war, said the two other Hamas officials who spoke to Reuters.
Israel has told the mediators it is willing to drop its demand to maintain a military presence along the so-called Morag Corri­dor in southern Gaza during a ceasefire and is prepared to show flexibility regarding the size of the security buffer it would retain near the Israeli border, Israeli media reported.
Prime Minister Benja­min Netanyahu’s office did not immediately comment on the reports.

Without any evidence, New Delhi had blamed Islamabad for the April 22 attack, which saw 26 people killed in the Baisaran hill station, and used it as a pretext to launch military strikes against Pakistan.
According to a recent BBC News report, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.
Thursday’s statement from the State Department seemed to echo India’s viewpoint, which has claimed that the little-known newly-formed group was actually a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
India also blames the LeT for orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks and several other attacks on military forces. The US earlier designated LeT as an FTO in December 2001.
One of the first mentions of the group came in 2020, when then-Indian army chief M.M. Naravane accused Pakistan of creating a “new terror group” in occupied Kashmir.
“I would rather call it Terror Revival Front. It is another terrorist organisation by another name. This is a terrorist organisation supported by its proxies across the border. They will be dealt with appropriately,” he was quoted as saying. Pakistan’s Foreign Office had rejected the allegation at the time.
“These actions taken by the Department of State demonstrate the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,” the statement said.
In a recent interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that Pakistan was ready to cooperate with India against this group.
At the time, Mr Thapar had claimed that New Delhi’s attempts to have the group designated as a terror outfit by the United Nations had been blocked by China, on Pakistan’s behalf.

•  US assessment finds only one of three Iranian nuclear sites ‘greatly damaged’
ISLAMABAD: The Iranian embassy in Pakistan has said attacks by the US and Israel in June killed over 1,100 people and were aimed at toppling the regime in Tehran.
The comments were made by the Iranian defence attaché in Islamabad, who briefed military personnel of various foreign missions over the 12-day war on Thursday.
On the same day, NBC News reported that a new US assessment has found that US strikes mostly destroyed one of three targeted Iranian nuclear sites, but the other two were not as badly damaged.
 
 

Col Moshen Shahabi, the Iranian defence attaché, called Israel’s attack a “gross miscalculation”. He said Israeli leaders assumed the Iranian regime would collapse rapidly after the killing of key military and nuclear figures. “They believed there would be political chaos and potential defections.”
He said the attacks were a “regime change effort” as demonstrated by Israeli Prime Mi­­nister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address on June 14 where he addressed the Iranian people directly, attempting to “incite internal dissent”.
However, these efforts “failed”, Mr Shahabi said, adding Tehran quickly filled the leadership vacuum created by the killing of top soldiers and initiated self-defence through missile strikes. He said Israeli attacks extended far beyond military targets, hitting civilian, academic, industrial, residential, and cultural sites, including Evin Prison, hospitals, and a state broadcaster.
At least 1,100 persons, including 56 children,  were killed in these attacks, according to the Iranian official.
He added that Iran, in response, targeted Israeli military and security sites, while any civilian casualties were “likely collateral damage from Israel’s defence systems” which intercepted incoming Israeli missiles.
Mr Shahabi also talked about Iranian strikes on US bases and said the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar was chosen since it was “far away from civilian populations and cities”.
Negotiation ‘cover for attack’
He called the US and Israeli attacks a violation of the UN Charter and the principles of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The Iranian defence attaché also slammed Western nations for “diplomatic betrayal”, stating negotiations were ongoing when Israel launched its strikes.
The US negotiations with Iran were a “facade” to prepare for military escalation.
He said Israeli PM Netanyahu confirmed the operations were fully coordinated with Washington, contradicting US claims of diplomatic engagement.
US assessment
Meanwhile, according to NBC, US officials believe the attack on Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility was successful in setting back enrichment capabilities there by as much as two years. The report, citing two current officials, said the two other facilities struck by the US were not as badly damaged and may have been degraded only to a point where nuclear enrichment could resume in the next several months if Iran wants it to.
Reuters could not immediately verify the NBC report.
White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told Reuters in an emailed statement: “As the President has said and experts have verified, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran’s nuclear capabilities.”
The chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told NBC that US President Donald Trump “was clear and the American people understand: Iran’s nuclear facilities in Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz were completely and totally obliterated. There is no doubt about that.”
The US launched strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities last month, saying that they were part of a programme geared towards developing nuclear weapons.
Tehran maintains that its nuclear development is purely for civilian purposes.
A preliminary assessment in June from the Defence Intelligence Agency suggested that the strikes may have only set back Iran’s nuclear program by months. But Trump administration officials said that assessment was low confidence and had been overtaken by intelligence showing Iran’s nuclear programme was severely damaged.

The presidential physician found Trump, 79, has  “chronic venous insufficiency” — a condition where damaged leg veins fail to keep blood flowing properly — Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, calling it a  “benign and common condition.”
Responding to speculation over recent photos showing bruising on Trump’s hand, Leavitt said  “this was consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”
Trump became the oldest person in history to assume the presidency when he began his second term this January, replacing Democrat Joe Biden, who stepped down at 81.
She said he had undergone  “a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70.”
“Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease,” she said. All Trump’s test results  “were within normal limits,” she said and he had a  “normal cardiac structure and function, no signs of heart failure, renal impairment or systemic illness.” The hand issue, she said, was linked to the aspirin he takes in a  “standard” cardiovascular health programme.
Leavitt said there was  “no evidence” of more serious conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.

• ANP’s Shahida Waheed wins draw on women seat
PESHAWAR: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Thursday withdrew its candidate in favour of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) for a seat reserved for non-Muslims, paving the way for JUI-F to become the largest opposition party in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly with 18 lawmakers.
As a result, JUI-F’s candidate Gorpal Singh will now be notified as MPA-elect on the said seat by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Meanwhile, Awami National Party (ANP) candidate Shahida Waheed was declared the winner through a draw against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P) candidate for a seat reserved for women. She will also be notified by the ECP as MPA-elect.
 
 

Both developments took place at the office of Provincial Election Commissioner (PEC) Saeed Gul in Peshawar on Thursday, where senior party leaders were present.
PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam and JUI-F’s Maul­ana Attaur Rehman attended the event along with their respective candidates, Gorsaran Lal and Gorpal Singh. The PML-N delegation formally withdrew its candidate in support of JUI-F’s nominee.
Similarly, delegations of ANP, led by MPA Nisar Baz and candidate Shahida Waheed, and PTI-P, led by MPA Arbab Waseem and candidate Somi, were also present for the draw. Following the draw, ECP officials declared Ms Waheed the winner.
Both PML-N and JUI-F were allo­­t­ted one seat each, reserved for non-Muslims, on the basis of the seven general seats won by each of them. The ECP had decided to allot the remaining seat through a draw.
Similarly, both ANP and PTI-P were awarded one seat each reserved for women and the remaining seat had to be allotted through a draw between candidates of these parties.
Following the notifications, JUI-F and PML-N will each hold nine of the total 26 reserved seats for women in the KP Assembly. PPP holds five, while ANP and PTI-P will now hold two and one, respectively.
For the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, JUI-F will hold two, while PML-N and PPP will have one each.
The opposition now holds a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly, including 18 MPAs of JUI-F, 17 of PML-N, 10 of PPP, four of ANP, and three of PTI-P. Presently, Dr Ibadullah of PML-N is the leader of the opposition in the KP Assembly. PTI-backed lawmakers maintain their tally of 92 members.

• Justice Mazhar says critical remarks can permanently tarnish reputations
• In case of doubt over judge’s conduct, matter should be discreetly sent to relevant chief justice
ISLAMABAD: The Supr­eme Court on Thursday cautioned superior jud­g­es over issuing critical orders against their peers as these observations have an “interminable impact” on the reputation of adjudicators.
“It always haunts the judicial officer and causes sev­e­re hardship and disparagement to his name and reputation in judicial service,” remar­ked Justice Muha­mmad Ali Mazhar in an order released on Thursday.
The verdict was issued in a revision application moved by Syed Zakir Hussain, a presiding officer of an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Karachi.
Mr Hussain, who was also the administrative judge of ATC in Karachi, came to the spotlight after refusing the remand of Armaghan Qureshi, the prime suspect in the high-profile Mustafa Amir murder case.
The judge’s action drew flak from the Sindh High Court (SHC), which ordered the provincial government to remove Mr Hussain from his role as the administrative judge of ATC.
Subsequently, the Sindh government, through a notification on Feb 26, withdrew Mr Hussain’s administrative powers as ATC judge.
The judge moved the Supreme Court against the SHC order and sought to expunge adverse observations over his alleged “judicial misconduct” and “procedural improprieties”.
In its order, the three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Mazhar, removed the adverse remarks against Mr Hussain, but kept the Feb 26 notification intact, stripping the judge of his administrative powers.
In the 12-page judgement, Justice Mazhar observed that “strictures” against judges create a “serious impairment and a sense of guilt in the eyes of the subordinates of the judge”.
Besides, it also damages the public’s confidence in the judicial system.
Another important aspect that cannot be ignored is that a judge against whom disparaging remarks or strictures were passed cannot defend their judgment or order in front of superior courts.
Therefore, high courts “should exercise greater caution and judicial restraint”, Justice Mazhar observed.
He added high courts, on a daily basis, review judgements and orders of lower courts and if those judements and orders are found to be deficient or flawed, they should be “modified, remanded or set aside”.
He added that no ulterior motive should be attributed even to a “serious error” committed by a judge without confronting them or seeking their comments.
The high court should be mindful that scornful and demeaning remarks or observations against a judge of the subordinate judiciary, even if expunged, “would not totally restitute the defacement of esteem and dignity”.
The criticism of a judgement or order must be “judicial” in nature and it should only point out errors or flaws in the said judgement.
Justice Mazhar observed that if the court has any doubt regarding the judge’s conduct, the matter should be confidentially referred to the high court’s chief justices, who can deal with the judge as per their “own fine sense of judgement”.
He added the principles of natural justice, due process, fair play and right to fair trial are also afforded to the judges of subordinate judiciary.
“They, too, being dispensers of justice, should be granted the right to a fair trial, rather than being condemned unheard.”

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday issued a warning of torrential rains with wind-thundershowers that would last throughout the country till today. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that heavy rains will continue to lash parts of the country over the next 24 hours.
Data from the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) showed that 61 people were killed and 268 injured in the last 24 hours, warning that more monsoon rains were expected in the coming days.
An order from the Punjab Home Department said there was a significant increase in the accumulation of rainwater in low-lying areas, streets and open spaces, posing serious risks to the safety of children who often bathed in standing water.
“Dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries across the province of Punjab experience heightened water levels and stronger currents during these periods, making swimming and unauthorised boating activities extremely hazardous for human life, leading to a high potential for drowning and other tragic incidents.
“Prevailing weather conditions and the inherent dangers associated with these activities, necessitates immediate preventive measures to safeguard public safety and prevent loss of precious human lives,” the order said.
It added that the home secretary was thus imposing a complete ban under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure across the province on bathing in accumulated rainwater on streets, roads, open spaces, or any other area where rainwater has collected; swimming in dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries, and boating by any unauthorised person or for unauthorised purposes in dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries.
“This order shall remain in force for a period of 45 days from the date of issuance unless withdrawn.”
 






Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also announced that “a rain emergency has been imposed in different areas of Punjab due to unprecedented torrential rains and a flood situation.”
She added that directives were issued to keep the public alert through sirens and announcements. The chief minister urged the public to cooperate with the local authorities and take safety precautions.
 






In Jhelum, rescue operations were underway to evacuate citizens trapped in floodwaters in Dhok Biddar, Dhok Shah Arif, Sohawa, Rasoolpur, Chak Muhammad and Bhampar villages, according to Punjab Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad.
Around 57 people have been rescued so far with the help of the Pakistan Army, he said in a statement, with more than 50 rescue boats involved in the Jhelum operations.
The spokesperson added that rescue teams have been deployed across the province, including Mianwali, Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Attock, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Layyah. Over 15,000 rescue personnel and 800 rescue boats were on high alert, Ahmad added.
“Pakistan Army personnel and rescue teams are currently rushing the citizens to safe locations,” he said.
“Children were screaming for help, and women stood on rooftops, waving their shawls and begging to be rescued,” Tariq Mehbood Bhatti, a 51-year-old farmer in Gujrat’s Ladian village, was quoted as saying by AFP.
 






Jhelum Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Meisam Abbas told Dawn.com that high floods were noted in Bhimber, Dara Pur, Chakri, Chak Majo, Dhoke Bidar, Rajroor, Nakki, Mamyan, Nakka Khlaspur, Sahoowal, Samanwaal, Bara Phaphrah and other towns and villages were among the affected areas.
DPO Tariq Aziz Sindhu said six policemen got stuck amid the flood, five of whom were rescued while a constable was carried away by the water.
“A search operation for him was underway in the area,” the officer added.
Bilal Azhar Kiani, minister of state for finance, said while talking to Dawn.com from the monitoring centre about floods in his home district of Jhelum that a quick response was given to the eventual situation that was being directly monitored by the chief minister.
“The integrated response by Rescue 1122, the army, the police and the civil defence prevented casualties,” he said.
The minister said that relief centres for displaced families were established at safe places with medical teams for the treatment of the residents and livestock.
Kiani said that a search operation for the retrieval of missing cattle and livestock of those affected was also underway, and all-out efforts were underway to minimise.
“The chief minister will announce a package for the rehabilitation of the affectees,” the minister said.
Punjab Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Director General Tayyab Farid said that “rivers have overflowed due to heavy rains in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and surrounding areas”, leading to a flood situation.
“Citizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, stay away from power lines and open manholes,” the Wasa DG said in a statement.
The PMD’s Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) warned that urban flooding was expected in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Faisalabad divisions during the next 24 hours.
However, it added that the wet spell was likely to subside in the next 48 hours.
In a post on X, the PMD said the heavy monsoon rains triggered a “significant surge” in water levels at the Tarbela, Mangla, Khanpur, Simly and Rawal reservoirs.
The water level at Khanpur witnessed a gain of 4.5 feet, while the other four recorded an increase of a foot each.
 






In a weather outlook, the FFD said the water flows in the eastern rivers were likely to increase from July 21.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority’s website, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 178 people across the country and injured 491 people.
The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 103 deaths and 385 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 38 fatalities, Sindh 20, Balochistan 16 and one death in Azad Kashmir.
Over 57 per cent of nationwide deaths were caused by “house-collapse” incidents. Monsoon rains so far have damaged 610 houses and led to the deaths of 126 livestock.

Flood alert issued for Rawalpindi
Earlier today, the PMD issued a flood alert for the Gawalmandi and Kattarian stations in Rawalpindi as the water level in the Leh Nullah rose.
At 10:50am, the Gawalmandi and Kattarian gauges had crossed the 20ft level, at which evacuation is supposed to be ordered. However, the water levels soon started to recede, reaching 7ft at Gawalmandi and 8ft at Kattarian at 4:21pm, according to the PMD’s real-time monitor.

Following the flood alert in the morning, the PDMA imposed a rain emergency in Rawalpindi, with Director General Irfan Ali Kathia noting that a local holiday has been announced in the district.
DG Kathia urged residents of low-lying areas near Leh Nullah to “cooperate with the administration if evacuation becomes necessary”. In a statement, he warned that strict action will be taken against those gathering or bathing near Leh Nullah.
 


In a separate statement, the PDMA also detailed the equipment provided to the Rawalpindi administration for its relief efforts. This included 16 outboard motor boats, 205 life jackets, 31 ambulances, 19 fire brigade vehicles and four rescue vehicles.
The PDMA provided 28 de-watering sets, five suction pumps, six tractors and as many jetting machines to Wasa.
Another five de-watering sets, seven mini trucks and three jetting machines were given to the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC), the statement added.
The Pakistan Army rescued a family stranded in the flood on Rawalpindi’s Chakri Road using a helicopter, Radio Pakistan reported.
 






Chakwal records 400mm of rain in 10 hours
Punjab’s Chakwal district was among the heaviest hit by the recent rains as it recorded 400 millimetres of rain overnight due to a cloudburst, triggering flash floods across the city, a statement from the PDMA said.
“Chawkwal recorded 400mm of rain in 10 hours, which left many areas flooded,” the PDMA said in a statement issued in the early hours of Wednesday.
However, a rainfall record issued by it at 8am stated 142mm of rainfall in the previous 24 hours.
Footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed water gushing across vast swathes of land, with floodwater entering various buildings, including a Rescue 1122 office.
 


In a statement, the PDMA said water levels had begun to recede with the cessation of the downpour, and evacuation efforts were underway to rescue trapped citizens.
DG Kathia spoke on the phone with Chakwal Deputy Commissioner Sarah Hayat, who briefed the former on the relief efforts.
She said the relevant departments, including Wasa, Rescue 1122 and other civil personnel, were present on the ground to take part in the rescue operation.
Relief arrangements had been made in hospitals and public buildings, Hayat said.
DG Kathia assured Hayat of providing all possible resources and assistance, according to the PDMA statement. He added that the district administration was in contact with the army as well for additional support.
“The district administration is continuing to monitor the situation, particularly in low-lying areas.”
District Emergency Operation Centre, including the PDMA Control Room, were on high alert, he said, adding that “helicopters and other rescue resources” were also on standby.
DC Hayat announced a flood emergency in Chakwal and Talagang. She directed all officers to remain present at the place of their duty for 24 hours and the leaves of all officers and employees were cancelled.
The DC also directed officials to ensure the availability of required machinery, equipment and staff to Rescue 1122. DC Hayat, along with District Police Officer Ahmed Mohiuddin, visited the affected areas and supervised the rescue operations and relief work.
Scores of mini dams built by private individuals were washed away by the torrents, inundating many villages. Budhial village was submerged after a mini-dam was wrecked in Ghokal village.
“I have never witnessed such kind of flooding in my village”, Prof Syed Ali Raza from Budhial told Dawn.com. He added that five to six feet of rainwater accumulated in the houses, forcing people to leave their homes. The bridge on the road which connects Budhial to the rest of the area was also swept away, cutting off the village from the rest of the area.
“Three cattle were also swept away and still could not be found,” he said.
Additional Deputy Commissioner Bilal Bin Abdul Hafeez said that the exact cause of the unprecedented rain could not be ascertained yet.
“However, this situation has occurred possibly due to two factors. The first one could be a cloudburst, and the second one could be the shifting of the confluence of eastern and western winds to Chakwal from Kallar Kahar. Until now, the confluence of eastern and western winds was being considered near Kallar Kahar, but Kallar Kahar and neighbouring Choa Saidan Shah did not witness such heavy downpour as it was witnessed in Chakwal city and twenty km to its eastern belt,” he maintained.
Chakwal and Talagang have 24 small dams and due to the prolonged drought, the water level in all dams has decreased to a dead level. “All the small dams in Chakwal and Talagang are safe and they are operating as per their structure,” Executive Engineer Small Dams Division Naeemul Hassan told Dawn.com. He added that all the dams were filled 80 per cent.
NDMA forecasts more heavy rainfall across country
The NDMA has forecasted more heavy rains over the next 24 hours, Radio Pakistan reported.
“Various districts in Punjab — including Lahore, Chakwal, Attock, Jhelum, Khushab, Sargodha, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Kasur, Sheikhupura, and Hafizabad — are likely to experience thunderstorms and heavy rain in the next 12 hours,” the report read.

Amid heavy rains and flooding in Punjab, authorities in the federal capital were also directed to remain on high alert by Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa.
“Field teams should provide all possible assistance to citizens in case of an emergency,” Randhawa, also the Capital Development Authority (CDA) chairman, said.
The chief commissioner directed that strict monitoring of all highways, drains and waterways of Islamabad should be ensured.
In case of any emergency, citizens were advised to contact the CDA and district administration on 16 and 1334, respectively.
Child dead, 11 injured in Mandi Bahauddin
Separately, heavy downpour in Mandi Bahauddin left one dead and injured 11 people on Wednesday, rescue officials said. According to the PMD, Mandi Bahauddin recorded 167mm of rainfall in 24 hours up till 8am.
Shah Hussain, aged 10, drowned while bathing in the rainwater, while in another incident, two boys — eight-year-old Qasim and six-year-old Huzaifa — were injured due to electrocution during the rain.
Nine people were injured after the roofs of three dilapidated houses collapsed at separate locations in Mandi Bahauddin. College Chowk, Pindi Purani, Jail Chowk and several other areas remained submerged under 2-4ft of water.
PM directs NDMA, ministers to prepare comprehensive disaster management plans
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the NDMA chair and federal ministers for climate change and planning to work together with the provinces for developing a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year’s devastating rains and cloudburst events.
The prime minister visited the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) at the NDMA headquarters, where he was briefed on the country’s monsoon situation, disaster response efforts, and the increasing intensity of weather patterns.
 






PM Shehbaz commended the NDMA’s efforts and lauded the role of modern technology and skilled human resources at the authority.
“NDMA always provides an encouraging environment, and it is because of its modern infrastructure and highly capable team. This is my second visit here, and I am pleased to see the dedication.”
The prime minister highlighted recent cloudbursts and heavy downpours in Chakwal, Lahore, Islamabad, and hilly areas, acknowledging the severity of weather conditions. He remarked that while southern parts of the country saw less rainfall impact, the northern and central regions continue to face significant risk.
“As projections show increased cloudburst activity, we must prepare accordingly. The federal government and NDMA must maintain close coordination with provinces,” PM Shehbaz said.
The prime minister pledged full support from the PM Office in procuring the necessary disaster response equipment and emphasised the importance of federal-provincial cooperation in strengthening human resources, capacity building, and equipment for rescue and relief operations.
“Pakistan contributes minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions but ranks among the top ten most climate-vulnerable countries. This is a challenge, but also an opportunity to build a climate-resilient nation, especially in agriculture and infrastructure.”
With an urgent call for a unified national response and long-term climate adaptation, PM Shehbaz concluded his visit by reiterating the federal government’s commitment to protecting lives, property, and infrastructure in the face of intensifying climate challenges.
Mangla Dam situation
Meanwhile, the district administration of Jhelum dispelled the rumours of flooding in the river Jhelum.
The press release from the district information department said that the inflow of water in Mangla lake and its storage level were being monitored, and there was no imminent danger of overflooding from the dam, as its current level was 1186 feet against a storage capacity of 1,242 feet.
The deputy commissioner clarified to the residents of the area that the current flooding was a result of a heavy downpour that continued during the last 36  hours.
“The low-lying areas of Gujar Khan tehsil, including Gujar Khan city, Daultala, and Hassal village, were also flooded, while the local administration remained on alert and no casualties were reported,” Hamza Ehtisham, the assistant commissioner of Gujar Khan, confirmed.</p><small>2025-07-17 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1719563727edc65.jpg?r=195647' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924786/pakistan-uzbekistan-afghanistan-sign-trilateral-agreement-on-railway-project-in-kabul-moot' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan sign trilateral agreement on railway project in Kabul moot</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan signed the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project in Kabul on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar made the announcement in a post on X from Kabul, where he arrived earlier today on a day-long visit for the signing.
“I congratulate the people and governments of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan on the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Naibabad–Kharlachi rail link under the UAP Railway Corridor.
“I also thank the foreign ministers of Uzbekistan and Afghanistan for their support and commitment for timely signing of the agreement. We remained closely engaged throughout the negotiation process to finalise the details.”
 






He hailed the UAP Railway Corridor as a major milestone in advancing regional connectivity and economic integration that would connect Central Asian countries to Pakistani seaports through Afghanistan.
Dar said the signing of today’s agreement was a result of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership and commitment, who had tasked him as finance minister of the Pakistan Democratic Movement-led government to lead the effort with the countries.
“We collectively laid the foundation for this transformational project.”
The foreign ministers of the three countries held a meeting before the signing.
“The meeting reaffirmed strong ties and a shared commitment to peace, connectivity, trade and regional development. The three sides emphasised the importance of sustained cooperation to unlock the region’s economic potential and ensure long-term prosperity for their peoples,” the Foreign Office (FO) said.
 






In 2023, the three countries agreed on the UAP Railway project to build a rail link, which will pass through Termiz in Uzbekistan, Mazar-i-Sharif and Logar in Afghanistan and enter Pakistan via the Kharlachi border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The project will facilitate regional, transit, and bilateral trade among­­st participating countries, while supporting both passenger and freight services.
Dar arrived in Kabul earlier today, accompanied by Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi, the special representative for Afghanistan, and the secretary of the Ministry of Railways.
 






Dar and Abbasi later met acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.
According to the FO, both sides called for maintaining “the momentum in bilateral relations” and expanding cooperation in the trade, transit and security sectors.
“They agreed to remain engaged to achieve the full potential of regional economic development, including through [the] realisation of trans-regional connectivity projects,” the FO wrote on X.
 






Dar later met Afghan Prime Minister Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund, and the two leaders exchanged views on issues of mutual interest, including peace and security, trade and transit cooperation and regional connectivity.
 






In a meeting with acting Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, both sides held in-depth discussions on security matters and reaffirmed the importance of eradicating threats to regional countries.
FM Dar underlined the importance of addressing all issues of concern, in particular security and border management, to harness the full potential of economic cooperation and regional connectivity.
 






Earlier in the day, the FO said the railway project aimed to build a rail link to connect Uzbekistan with Pakistan via Afghanistan and facilitate access to Pakistani seaports for Central Asian States.
“By facilitating regional trade and transit, the project is expected to promote regional stability, growth and development.”
It added that the agreement between the three participating countries will be an “important step towards its implementation”.
“During the visit, the deputy prime minister (Dar) will also hold a meeting with the Afghan acting foreign minister and will call on [the] acting prime minister of Afghanistan to discuss bilateral matters and exchange views on regional and international developments,” it said.
 






Earlier this month, Dar spoke with Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov and discussed progress on the Framework Agreement for the project.
In June, Pakistan and Uzbekistan decided to begin work on the trilateral railway transit corridor project, describing it as a milestone for regional economic growth and stronger trade ties.</p><small>2025-07-17 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1722304214bd613.jpg?r=223102' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924822/french-court-tries-couple-accused-of-plan-to-sacrifice-son' target='_blank'><strong>French court tries couple accused of plan to ‘sacrifice’ son</strong></a><br><p>A French couple went on trial on Thursday, accused of planning to “sacrifice” their five-year-old son in the Moroccan desert, accusations they have strongly denied.
The two music teachers were arrested in southern Spain in late 2023 as they were about to board a ferry to Morocco after buying a new four-wheel-drive and subletting their apartment near the French city of Bordeaux.
An alarmed relative had told French prosecutors that the father intended to “sacrifice” his son in the desert because he believed he was “possessed”, the investigation showed.
The father, Florian L, denies ever having said that, his lawyer Audrey Boussillon said.
“Never did he have the intention to harm his son in any way,” she added.
The couple, who hold “anti-system” and “mystical” beliefs, vehemently reject the charges of being part of a criminal gang and failing in their duties as parents, their defence team has said.
The attorney for the mother, Marie L, Aurelie Filippi-Codaccioni, said the couple had been to Morocco two years earlier and had wanted to return for an undetermined period.
But Merlene Labadie, a lawyer representing the interests of the child, said the couple’s beliefs endangered their son, who spoke of the importance of “being cold, scared and removing the snake within us” when found.
He is now in the custody of his maternal grandparents, she said.
The trial is to last a single day and the verdict will likely be announced at a later date.</p><small>2025-07-17 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17185904866965d.jpg?r=221233' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924807/punjab-police-arrest-bushra-bibis-son-for-shooting-domestic-servant-at-pakpattan-home' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Police arrest Bushra Bibi’s son for shooting domestic servant at Pakpattan home</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Police on Thursday arrested former first lady Bushra Bibi’s son, Musa Maneka, for allegedly attempting to kill his domestic servant by shooting him at his Pakpattan residence.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at the complaint of the servant’s father at Saddar Police Station under Section 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The complainant said that he and his son worked at Maneka’s residence, adding that the incident occurred at 11am when his son placed two bedsheets outside the bedroom, prompting Maneka to ask his son why he touched the bedsheets.
The son responded by saying, “I kept the sheets outside with care,” according to the FIR. “The suspect became enraged and shot my son using a pistol,” it added.
“My son was hit in front of his left knee, and the bullet passed through his leg, causing him to fall,” the complainant said. He also stated that two other people witnessed the incident, who reached there after hearing the gunshots.
District Police Officer (DPO) Javed Iqbal Chaddar told Dawn.com that police rushed to the scene after receiving an emergency call.
“I entered the premises and confronted Maneka, taking him into custody,” he said, adding that the suspect was currently held at the Saddar Police station and that the police had recovered the pistol which was used in the incident.
Rescue 1122  immediately took the injured servant to District Headquarters Hospital Pakpattan for medical treatment, he said.
DPO Chaddar said that “no one is above the law”, adding that the suspect “would not be spared”.
Today is not the suspect’s only run-in with the law. He and his father Khawar Maneka and elder brother were indicted in corruption cases in a reference filed by the Okara deputy commissioner on Aug 23, 2023.
Police also registered an FIR against him on charges of possession of liquor in February 2022.</p><small>2025-07-17 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17182448fdaa0b3.jpg?r=182452' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924805/white-house-says-no-trump-visit-scheduled-to-pakistan-at-this-time' target='_blank'><strong>White House says no Trump visit scheduled to Pakistan ‘at this time’</strong></a><br><p>The White House on Thursday said that no visit of United States President Donald Trump was scheduled to Pakistan “at this time” after widespread reports of a trip.
Earlier in the day, some local television news channels reported, citing sources, that Trump was expected to visit Pakistan in September. The news channels said that Trump would also visit India after arriving in Islamabad in September. The channels later withdrew their reports.
The White House dismissed the rumours. “A trip to Pakistan has not been scheduled at this time,” a White House official said.
Talking to Dawn.com on the reported visit earlier, Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: “We have no information about this matter.”
Similarly, a US embassy spokesperson in Islamabad told Reuters, “We have nothing to announce,” and said that the White House might be able to provide confirmation on the president’s schedule.
George W Bush was the last US president to visit Pakistan in 2006.
 
 

US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an unprecedented meeting.
India is due to host the summit of the so-called Quad countries this year, but dates for the meeting have not been announced yet.
The Quad grouping includes the US, India, Australia and Japan and is focused on countering China’s rise in the Indo-Pacific region.

A first information report (FIR) — available with Dawn.com — was filed by the victim’s uncle at Saddar police station on July 10 under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code (rape) and Section 53 (sexual abuse) of the KP Child Protection Act (CPA).
The complainant alleged in the FIR that the child, after feeling pain, told their mother about the incident and said that he was sexually abused by the teacher in his room in the mosque.
“The child is visually impaired and just five years old,” the complainant stated in the FIR, demanding legal action against the suspect.
According to a statement issued by Haripur District Police Officer Farhan, after the incident, he actively engaged the team at Saddar police station, who successfully arrested the suspect.
“Under the supervision of DSP (Deputy Superintendent of Police) Saddar Muhammad Arif, SHO Inspector Akhtar Hussain, along with the investigation team and other police personnel, arrested the [suspect],” the statement read.
The DPO’s statement added that the investigation is ongoing.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, the Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in the year 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.

EU Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Riina Kionka in March had announced that European companies recognised Pakistan as a potential business destination and were exploring new avenues for economic partnership.
The EU is Pakistan’s sec­ond-largest trading partner, with the GSP+ status allowing the country to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on European exports.
According to the press release, Pakistan and the EU held their 10th Political Dialogue in Brussels and discussed key regional and international issues, including multilateral cooperation. Both sides agreed to deepen dialogue and discussions on security during the event.
“The EU and Pakistan reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation of the Strategic Engagement Plan (SEP) signed in 2019,” the FO stated. “Both sides aim to further deepen cooperation in all areas covered under the SEP.”
Additionally, both sides agreed to continue close engagement under the GSP+ framework. They also acknowledged meaningful cooperation on various aspects of migration, with the third Comprehensive Migration and Mobility Dialogue slated for later in 2025, the FO stated.
According to the FO, the EU and Pakistan acknowledged the importance of multifaceted cooperation on security matters, including counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics.
“They condemned all forms of terrorism,” the press release read. “Both sides agreed on the need for efforts based on dialogue and diplomacy in order to solve contentious issues and underscored the importance of upholding international law and the sanctity of international agreements [and] treaties.”
The FO stated that both sides also exchanged views on the situation in Ukraine and Indian-occupied Kashmir and stressed the need to pursue peaceful solutions to conflicts, in respect of the principles of international law and the UN Charter.
“They agreed on the urgent need to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza,” the statement read. “Both sides called for the resumption of a ceasefire and expressed support for initiatives that contribute to a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Palestine, in accordance with the two-state solution.”
Pakistan and the EU reaffirmed their aspiration to convene the 7th Strategic Dialogue in 2025 to strengthen Pakistan-EU cooperation. According to the FO, they agreed to hold the next Political Dialogue meeting in Islamabad next year.
Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch led Pakistan’s delegation, while the EU delegation was headed by Olof Skoog, Deputy Secretary General of the European External Action Service.
The EU is not the only Western power with whom Pakistan has experienced improved relations.
US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when US President Donald Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an unprecedented meeting.
During the meeting, Trump “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations said.
