This alarming situation has exposed serious lapses on the part of the Prisons Department and the Punjab Aids Control Programme (PACP).
Adiala has been in the headlines lately as former PM Imran Khan is also incarcerated there. However, it must be kept in mind that Mr Khan is kept in isolation and is not allowed to mingle with other inmates.
The prison is currently very overcrowded as well, housing 4,337 prisoners against its authorised capacity of 1,994.

PACP report reveals there are 645 infected individuals in Punjab’s 43 prisons; some of them are already receiving anti-retroviral therapy

The presence of such a large number of HIV-infected prisoners poses a grave risk to the health and lives of other inmates if immediate measures are not taken to curb the transmission of the virus.
 
 

Medical experts explain that HIV attacks the body’s immune system, and remains incurable.
“Once you contract the infection, your body cannot get rid of it. However, there are medicines that can control HIV and prevent complications. Everyone diagnosed with HIV should be placed on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART),” one medical expert said.
They expressed serious concern that if a high-profile prison like Adiala is struggling to contain the rapid spread of HIV/Aids, the situation in other jails could be even worse.
Numbers
The PACP report sheds light on the number of prisoners suffering from HIV/Aids across the province. It reveals that the number of HIV-positive inmates in all of Punjab’s 43 prisons has reached 645, with the highest number of cases being reported from Adiala Jail, where 148 inmates have tested positive for HIV.
According to official figures, 83 inmates were tested positive for the HIV/Aids in District Jail Lahore (also known as Camp Jail), followed by 37 in Central Jail Faisalabad, and 27 each in Central Jail Lahore (also known as Kot Lakhpat prison) and Central Jail Gujranwala.
 
 

In the remaining 38 prisons of Punjab, the combined number of HIV-positive inmates stands at 323. An official privy to the development claimed that several HIV-positive inmates were facing an interruption in the provision of medicines in the jails.
As per the PACP protocols, after screening process, jail authorities shift the suspected HIV patient to the ART centre of the district concerned, where the inmate undergoes further testing to confirmation the diagnosis.
It repeats tests using elaborate methods, and after confirmation that the inmate has tested positive, it shifts them back to prison, where the programme provides them with medicines for a three-month period.
PACP teams normally visit jails and perform screening of all inmates every six months or so.
Alarming situation
The HIV/Aids outbreak in the jails of Punjab, particularly, in Adiala, has caused alarm among PACP authorities.
This was evident from an official correspondence, wherein the PACP head immediately activated all the ART Centres established under the programme.
“All ART Centres shall undertake fortnightly visits to jails within their respective districts to ascertain the total number of HIV-positive patients registered from the jail and the number of those presently receiving Anti-Retroviral Therapy,” reads a letter issued by PACP Project Director Dr Summaira Ashraf.
She emphasised that the centres must ensure all registered jail patients continue to receive treatment without interruption and any gaps, deficiencies or challenges observed during the visit must be clearly identified and reported.
Talking to Dawn, Punjab Inspector General (Prisons) Mian Farooq Nazeer said the PACP had taken over responsibility of screening all new inmates for various diseases, including HIV/Aids and hepatitis B and C, a couple of years ago.
Following the guidelines, the programme was to provide kits at the health facilities of each jail where the prisoners were tested for chronic diseases, adding that jail doctors would then perform tests on the patients under the programme’s guidelines. However, he maintained that his department had nothing to do with the screening of inmates entering or leaving prisons.

• Calls for revised Afghan refugee policy that balances humanitarian obligations and national security
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Friday expressed concern over the lack of preparedness of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) governments and their failure to act on early warnings issued by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and States and Frontier Regions, presided over by Senator Asad Qasim at the Parliament House, voiced displeasure over the absence of the GB chief secretary, stressing that the participation of senior officials was vital for effective parliamentary deliberations and meaningful decision-making.
The committee decided to defer the agenda pertaining to Gilgit-Baltistan and directed that senior GB officers must ensure their presence at future meetings.
Senators Faisal Saleem Rehman, Attaul Haq and Nadeem Ahmed Bhutto, the ministry’s additional secretary and senior officials from relevant departments attended the meeting. The committee members were briefed on monsoon-induced damage, relief operations, and tourism-related challenges in Azad Kashmir.

The State Disaster Management Authority secretary informed the meeting that since June 26, AJK had faced nine spells of monsoon rains following a May cloudburst. These disasters claimed 28 lives, damaged over 2,100 houses and caused extensive destruction of public infrastructure, including roads, water supply schemes, schools and electricity networks.
Committee Chairman Asad Qasim observed that despite NDMA alerts, tourists were not restricted from entering vulnerable areas, which was the responsibility of the local administration. He also noted the absence of early warning systems in disaster-prone zones and suggested installing such systems at 100-kilometre intervals across AJK.
On financial matters, the chairman raised concerns over the monitoring of relief funds, including Rs3 billion provided by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet. He suggested setting up an ad hoc oversight mechanism comprising parliamentarians, the judiciary and other stakeholders to ensure transparency and accountability.
Mr Qasim also questioned the accuracy of official data, warning that incomplete surveys and underreporting undermined public trust.
 
 

About communication infrastructure, the senators regretted that private operators had failed to provide services in remote areas, leaving the Special Communication Organ­isation (SCO) as the only functioning network during calamities.
The committee recommended that the Universal Services Fund be used to expand coverage, particularly in tourist areas, as required by the law.
Refugee policy
The committee also called for a revised and coordinated policy on Afghan refugees that balances humanitarian obligations with national security needs.
Phase III of the deportation plan will begin on September 1, targeting Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards. The committee was briefed on the role and scope of the Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CCAR).
The CCAR chief commissioner informed the committee that, following the expiry of the voluntary repatriation deadline, Afghan refugees’ status had been changed to “aliens”.
 
 

The government’s “Illegal Foreigners Repa­triation Plan”, announced in October 2023, required all undocumented migr­ants to leave under a three-phase regime. Phase I, launched in October 2023, covered the return of all illegal foreigners. Phase II, beginning April 1, 2025, included the deportation of illegal foreigners along with Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders. Since then, about 48,000 ACC holders have been deported. Phase III, starting September 1, will focus on POR card holders.
CCAR officials said that around 300,000 Afghans had voluntarily returned so far, with Sindh hosting nearly 80,000 refugees, and significant numbers residing in KP and Balochistan.
The committee members observed that undocumented refugees remained undercounted, while international funding for refugee management had largely dried up.
The officials said cooperation with the UNHCR was limited to humanitarian support, as agreements last revised in 2009 had expired.
The committee also sought clarity on the ownership of 54 refugee camps and their associated land assets.
“You know the numbers, you know the funds received, now we must ensure accountability, inter-ministerial cooperation, and clarity on the way forward,” the committee chairman said.

• Over 429,000 residents evacuated, 20 lives lost across three rivers
• Ninth spell of monsoon rains begins
• 855,000 cusecs expected at Head Trimmu within 24 hours

• Worst Sutlej flooding since 1955 compounded by Indian dam breach
LAHORE: In an unprecedented flood crisis, the Punjab government has initiated controlled breaches of key flood bunds to divert surging waters from the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers, as all three major rivers overflowed simultaneously for the first time in the country’s history.
With 855,000 cusecs expected to reach Head Trimmu within 24 hours, authorities have evacuated over 429,000 residents, deploying explosives and breaching embankments to protect urban centres from catastrophic flooding.
Torrential monsoon rains ravaged both Pakistan and India this week, with further heavy downpours forecast for this weekend.
Bunds near Athara Hazari in Jhang district were breached to relieve pressure on Head Trimmu, situated downstream of the confluence of the Jhelum and Chenab rivers.
To prevent inundation of Jhang city, the Rivaz Bridge flood bund was breached, and residents from adjacent villages were evacuated. Explosives were deployed near Rungpur and Sher Shah bunds to divert water away from Head Muhammad Wala, where a surge of up to 800,000 cusecs is anticipated.
“There was no other way to drain the water,” Relief Commissioner Nabil Javed said, defending the drastic measures. “We are deploying all available resources and machinery to protect lives and infrastructure.”
Explosives were also deployed, with dynamite installed near the Rungpur and Sher Shah bunds to strategically divert water from Head Muhammad Wala.
Data released by Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Friday revealed that flows were predominantly steady with a notable improvement at Rivaz Bridge on the Chenab River, where the water level is now holding steady at 521.9 feet against the critical gauge of 526 feet.
However, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a flood warning for the Chenab River at Head Marala. As a precautionary measure, the NDMA sent out alerts via SMS to mobile phone users. The authority warned of a high flood risk at Marala, Khanki and Qadirabad headworks, urging residents in these areas to remain prepared for any emergency situation.
 






Water flow
On Friday, Marala and Khanki headworks were steady at 109,540 and 174,472 cusecs, respectively, while Qadirabad Headworks was at 175,272 cusecs and falling.
Chiniot Bridge remained at a very high but steady 855,000 cusecs, and Trimmu Headworks was steady at 128,215 cusecs.
Conditions on the Ravi River were mixed; Head Jassar was steady at 82,140 cusecs, and Ravi Syphon was falling at 160,515 cusecs. Shahdara was steady at 159,847 cusecs; however, Balloki Headworks continued to rise, reaching 180,520 cusecs. Sidhnai Headworks remained steady at 29,278 cusecs.
The Sutlej River was showing incre­a­sed activity at its upstream point, with Ganda Singh Wala rising at 385,569 cus­ecs. Downstream, Sule­­manki Headworks was steady at 138,058 cusecs, and Islam Headworks was steady at 60,814 cusecs.

20 lives lost, millions affected
According to PDMA data, over 1.46 million people in 1,769 mouzas have been affected due to extremely high floods in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers, with a total of 20 lives lost.
The government has evacuated over 429,177 people, of whom 3,565 were living in 365 relief camps, and 300,174 cattle were transported to safety.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the Sutlej River is facing the worst flooding since 1955. He said that the catastrophic inflow of water is a result of a dam breach in India, and it is increasing the threat to Kasur.
 


In 1955, more than 2,000 people lost their lives and crops were devastated in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) due to heavy floods caused by monsoon rains. Those floods also impacted 15 million people in Sindh and parts of India.
“We have been compelled to deliberately breach the embankment to save Ka­­s­ur city from devastation due to unprecedented water flow,” Mr Kathia said.
He said the crisis is widespread and evolving rapidly. “The Sutlej is not the only concern; the Chenab and Ravi rivers are also overflowing, marking the first time in Pakistan’s history that three major rivers have flooded simultaneously,” he added.
The PDMA chief termed it a “historic flood situation”, particularly noting the severe impact at Qadirabad Headworks.
Communities living downstream were bracing for impact, and water is expected to reach Sidhnai Headworks within 36 hours, while Okara, Sahiwal and Pakpattan remain on high alert.
Around 40 to 45 villages were already inundated in Mandi Bahauddin before the water receded back into the river. He said that 28 people lost their lives so far, though timely rescue operations have mitigated further casualties.
He said that evacuations in vulnerable areas continued, including those near Trimmu, where water levels are rising steadily. “The area downstream of Trimmu may not withstand this pressure,” Mr Kathia warned, though he expressed hope that damage could be minimised.
A statement from the PDMA has said the ninth spell of monsoon rains began, as heavy rains were forecasted till Sept 2.
The rains were predicted in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Lahore, Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Okara, Sahiwal, Kasur, Jhang, Sargodha, Mianwali, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan and Rajanpur, the PDMA spokesperson said.
Arrangements in Multan
Earlier, National Highway Autho­rity (NHA) Chairman Shahryar Sultan and Multan Commissioner Amir Kareem Khan visited the Head Muhammad Wala breaching section and Bund Bosan to review the flood management arrangements.
Mr Khan briefed about the current flood situation and the measures being taken to mitigate potential risks.
He said that a flood surge of up to 800,000 cusecs is expected in the Chenab River within the next two days. “The Head Muhammad Wala Road will be breached if Multan city faces any threat. The final decision will be made by the technical committee of the Irrigation Department.”
He said that over 119,715 people have so far been safely relocated across the division and a total of 84 relief camps have been set up. He said that uninterrupted provision of meals and medical care is being ensured in all relief camps, while arrangements have also been made for the supply of fodder and water for livestock. The assessment of losses will be carried out once the water recedes, and full compensation will be provided to the affected families, he added.
Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said the administration has set a target of relocating 300,000 residents to safer locations and assured that all riverine areas will be evacuated by Saturday night.

Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari has summoned a session of the National Assembly on Sept 1 (Monday) at 5pm in the Parliament House, according to a press release issued by the Presidency.
According to the Senate Secretariat, Mr Gilani and Mr Sadiq focused on strengthening institutional cooperation between the two houses of parliament and improving coordination on both national and international issues.
Talking to Dawn, PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly, Amir Dogar, expressed concerns that the government intends to introduce controversial constitutional amendments in the near future.
 







President summons NA session on Sept 1

During their meeting at the Senate’s chairman’s residence, Mr Gilani briefed Mr Sadiq on preparations for the upcoming Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference, scheduled for Nov 11-12. The event will bring together representatives from over 45 countries, marking one of the largest multilateral parliamentary gatherings ever hosted by Pakistan.
 
 

Mr Gilani said the conference would address key global challenges, including regional peace, sustainable development, climate change and the need for collective strategies to tackle emerging threats.
Mr Sadiq assured Mr Gilani of the National Assembly’s full support in ensuring the successful organisation of the conference, expressing confidence that the event would serve as a significant opportunity for Pakistan to showcase its commitment to global dialogue, cooperation, and peace-building.
Both leaders also discussed the prevailing political and economic situation in the country, with a particular focus on the devastating impact of recent rains and floods. They expressed concern over the exacerbating situation caused by India’s release of floodwaters into Punjab’s rivers, which has intensified both human and material losses in the affected areas.
In light of the natural calamity, the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker appealed to the people of Pakistan to take precautionary measures and fully cooperate with the government and relevant authorities. They stressed the need for united national efforts to minimise casualties and reduce financial damages.

Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas delivered the judgment on three consolidated petitions filed by journalist Hamid Mir, the Judicial Activism Panel, and Sharif’s widow, Javeria Siddique.
The petitioners sought a federal government-initiated judicial commission for a “transparent inquiry” into the circumstances surrounding Sharif’s departure from Pakistan, his stay in Dubai, and his murder in Kenya in October 2022.
 
 

They argued that the current investigation by a Special Joint Investigation Team (SJIT) was flawed and violated constitutional rights to a fair trial and due process.
Deputy attorney general, representing the state, countered, stating that the Supreme Court was actively supervising the case following its suo motu intervention.
He stressed that procedural actions have been completed, including FIR registration and submitting charges to the trial court, alongside securing a Mutual Legal Assistance agreement with Kenya to facilitate the investigation.
After a review, Justice Minhas recalled the apex court’s intervention, with a five-member bench initiating oversight in December 2022 to guarantee an independent and impartial investigation.
He highlighted that the creation of the SJIT was under the Supreme Court’s directive, with continuous oversight from the apex court.
“The matter concerning the tragic murder of the journalist Arshad Sharif is presently sub judice before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan,” Justice Minhas stated in the written order. “Consequently, this Court is restrained from issuing any directive … as doing so would encroach upon the apex Court’s jurisdiction.”
While dismissing the petitions, the court granted the petitioners partial relief. It ordered the federal government and the SJIT to keep the petitioners “duly informed regarding all developments in the ongoing investigation”.
The court also directed the state to provide the petitioners with copies of all reports and findings and to apprise them of future progress.
The ruling concluded that the petitioners were “not without remedy” and could bring their concerns directly to the Supreme Court.

Agha hit a 36-ball 53 not out with three sixes and as many boundaries, which lifted Pakistan to 182-7 in their 20 overs.
Pacers Rauf took 4-31 and Shaheen Afridi 2-21, while spinners Mohammad Nawaz (2-23) and Sufiyan Muqeem (2-25) dismissed Afghanistan for 143 in 19.5 overs before a noisy capacity 16,000 crowd at the Sharjah stadium.
Afghanistan matched Pakistan with opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz, 27-ball 38 with a six and three boundaries, adding 51 for the second wicket with Sediqullah Atal, who made 23.
It was Rauf who changed the game with a two-wicket 12th over, sending Atal and Karim Janat back without conceding a run.
Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan smashed five sixes and a four in his whirlwind 16-ball 39 but fell to Rauf to end his team’s fight.
Earlier, Pakistan was lifted by Agha’s fourth T20I half-century.
Agha anchored the innings admirably well after opener Sahibzada Farhan smashed two sixes and a boundary in his 10-ball 21 after Pakistan won the toss and batted.
Agha added 53 for the fifth wicket with Nawaz, whose 11-ball 21 had two sixes and a boundary as the duo helped Pakistan get 51 runs in the last five overs.

Earlier this month, it was announced that Pakistan would be joining the Global Sumud Flotilla to break the Israeli siege of Gaza, according to a post on Instagram by the Pak-Palestine Forum, a platform aiming to advance support for the Palestinian cause.
According to its website, the flotilla is a “coordinated, nonviolent fleet of mostly small vessels sailing from ports across the Mediterranean to break the Israeli occupation’s illegal siege on Gaza”.
Reuters reports that dozens of boats carrying aid will depart Spain and Tunisia and set sail for the Gaza Strip. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and Portuguese left-wing politician Mariana Mortagua are among hundreds of people from 44 countries participating in the flotilla. Sumud means “perseverance” in Arabic.
Among the participants is a five-member delegation from Pakistan, led by former senator Khan.
 






In comments to Dawn.com, the former senator said that the flotilla — the largest civilian aid mission in history — will depart the Tunisian capital on September 4.
“We will be trained on the vessel and the journey from September 1 to 3 in Tunis,” the ex-senator said. “There will be over 100 ships from over 50 countries … this is the biggest humanitarian operation led by civilians,” he said.
“This flotilla is made up of vessels from four different coalitions. One of them, the Sumud Nasantra, includes delegations from the Philippines, Thailand, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan, which I am leading,” he added.
Other coalitions participating in the flotilla include the Maghreb Sumud Flotilla, Freedom Flotilla Coalition and Global Movement to Gaza.
“Europe’s Freedom Flotilla will depart from Barcelona, Spain, on September 1,” Khan said. “We are further away, so we will depart on September 4 and converge with the other vessels in the Mediterranean on September 5. We will then travel to Gaza via a sea route.”
The former senator emphasised that the flotilla is legal, nonviolent and peaceful.
“It is legal because we will be travelling from international waters, from which we will transition to Palestinian waters, so we are not coming into contact with Israel,” he explained. “We are only carrying food and water.
“We need to break the blockade, establish a humanitarian assistance corridor and stand up against the genocide,” Khan said. “These are our goals.”
Khan noted that he was the only member of the delegation to arrive in Tunis, as the remainder of the delegation are struggling to obtain visas.
“At the moment, I am alone; however, I am trying to help group members obtain visas. They are four men, none of whom are prominent political figures,” he explained.
In a Facebook post, the ex-senator said he had a meeting with the Pakistani ambassador in Tunisia, who him assured of full cooperation.
When asked about the difficulties or even consequences of embarking on this journey to Gaza, the former senator painted three scenarios.
“There are three options. One is that we reach Gaza successfully and are able to break the blockade and show the world what is taking place there,” Khan said. “Another possibility is that they (Israel) could arrest and deport us.”
The former senator could not rule out the possibility of death, recalling that in the past, Israel attacked and killed those who attempted to challenge their stranglehold on the besieged enclave.
“We are putting ourselves at risk so that the world turns its attention to Gaza and it is moved to stop the genocide going on,” he said.
This flotilla is the latest attempt by activists to break Tel Aviv’s blockage of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition’s previous attempts, the Handala and Madleen, ended in the detention and deportation of the volunteers on board.
Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed over 63,000 people and injured 157,951, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
The United Nations warned last week that with Israeli forces blocking aid, half a million people face “catastrophic hunger” in Gaza, with famine conditions likely to spread further across the Strip.
Meanwhile, Israel has continued its bombardment after approving a plan to seize control of Gaza City, calling it the “last bastion of Hamas.”</p><small>2025-08-29 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/292114433107375.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938200/dar-confirms-pakistans-ambassador-in-kabul-received-a-demarche' target='_blank'><strong>Dar confirms Pakistan’s ambassador in Kabul received a demarche</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday confirmed that Afghanistan issued a demarche to Islamabad’s ambassador in Kabul, after they alleged that Pakistan carried out drone strikes across the border.
At least three people were killed and seven wounded in two separate incidents in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar and Khost provinces, which Afghan authorities claimed were strikes carried out by Pakistan. There was no official word from Islamabad, and Afghan authorities did not provide any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the incidents.
Fielding questions after a press briefing in Islamabad today, Dar said that he had just returned from travelling and was still “going through the system”. However, he added that had received a copy of the letter to Pakistan’s ambassador but did not elaborate on why it was issued.
“I’m still going through the system, but they handed our ambassador a letter, which is called a demarche,” the foreign minister said. “This needs investigation, to look into the situation and why it is happening … right now, it’s too early to say anything.”
He did not respond to the question whether Pakistan was involved in the alleged strikes.
 






Replying to another question, Dar said that Islamabad had “only one ask” from Kabul, that being to either handle the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and not let its soil be used for terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
“We asked them ‘please take these people away from our borders or hand them over to us, whatever you choose’,” Dar said.
“Their development and stability is in our interest. Imagine what a massive mutual benefit there will be once the railroad gets off the ground,” he said, referring to the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway project.
“Once the railway system is complete, you will have connectivity with these Central Asian states, it’ll be a different ballgame.”
The foreign minister said he has no doubts regarding Kabul’s intentions and noted its intention to cooperate with Pakistan.
“During my bilateral meeting with [Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi], I said ‘this is a bilateral border and a very large one, please do what you can to control your side’. There is no resistance there.”
Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul to prevent its soil from being used to stage attacks in Pakistan, and that it is fully capable of targeting terrorists who carry out such attacks.
Earlier this month, Pakistan, China and Afghanistan committed themselves to bolstering joint efforts against the menace of terrorism and deepening their collaboration in key spheres.
“The three sides committed to strengthening joint efforts against terrorism. They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as extension of CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) to Afghanistan,” the Foreign Office (FO) had said regarding the meeting.
Before the meeting, Dar met Muttaqi on the sidelines and the two men are said to have noted the positive movement in political and economic ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan. They also reaffirmed their commitment to working closely on counter-terrorism and ensuring peace and stability in the region.

According to the board, the tickets are being sold starting from 40 dirhams (PKR 3,069.51) for the matches in Abu Dhabi and 50 (PKR 3,836.89) dirhams for the ones in Dubai.
 






“Tickets for the most sought-after India v Pakistan match will initially be available in a seven-match tickets package starting at 1,400 [dirhams] (PKR 10,743.28),” the ECB announced.
It said fans could buy separate (standalone) tickets for each of the remaining matches not included in the seven-match ticket package.
The board said that, in the coming days, tickets will also be made available at the ticket booths at both the Dubai International Stadium and Zayed Cricket Stadium, Abu Dhabi — the details of which will be announced in due course.
The Salman Ali Agha-led Pakistan are set to compete in the Asia Cup that runs from Sept 9 to 28 in the UAE. The Green-shirts are in Group ‘A’ alongside arch-rivals and defending champions India, Oman and the UAE while Group ‘B’ comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Hong Kong. The matches will be staged in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
The eight-team tournament will kick off on Sept 9, with Afghanistan taking on Hong Kong at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi.
India’s sports ministry has declared that India and Pakistan would not have any bilateral sporting ties even on neutral venues as per an unprecedented new policy but the cricket team would not be stopped from playing the Asia Cup next month as it is a multi-lateral engagement.
Last month, the Pakistan Sports Board had asked sports federations in the country to seek approval before participating in sporting events held in India.
Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi has said that any talks on sporting ties with India would be held on equal footing and there would be no more pleading for negotiations.</p><small>2025-08-29 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2921111360da80b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938193/smog-then-floods-pakistani-families-cant-catch-a-break' target='_blank'><strong>Smog then floods: Pakistani families ‘can’t catch a break’</strong></a><br><p>Perched on her neighbour’s rooftop, Ghulam Bano gazes down at the remains of her home, submerged in murky, foul-smelling floodwater that has engulfed much of Punjab province.
Monsoon rains this week swelled three transboundary rivers that cut through Punjab, the country’s agricultural heartland and home to nearly half of its 255 million people.
Bano moved to Shahdara town last year, on the outskirts of Lahore, to avoid the choking smog pollution of Pakistan’s second-largest city, only to have her new beginning overturned by raging floods.
“My husband had started coughing blood and his condition just kept getting worse when the smog hit,” Bano told AFP, walking through muddy streets.

Pakistan regularly ranks among the world’s most polluted countries, with Lahore often the most polluted megacity between November and February.
“I thought the smog was bad enough – I never thought it could be worse with the floods,” she said.
Her impoverished neighbourhood is home to thousands of low-lying homes crammed together on narrow streets.
The nearby overflowing Ravi river flooded many of them, forcing dozens of families to take refuge in an elementary school on higher ground, where doctors were treating people for skin infections linked to the flood water.
More heavy rain is predicted over the weekend, including warnings of increased urban flooding in Lahore.
With her husband bedridden from tuberculosis, worsened by the relentless smog, Bano became the sole provider in a household struggling to breathe, survive, and endure the floods.
“I ate today after two days. There is no clean water to drink. I left my daughter at a relative’s place and stayed back hoping the water recedes,” she said.
No time to pack
Landslides and floods triggered by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains have killed more than 800 people nationwide since June this year.
While South Asia’s seasonal monsoon brings rainfall that farmers depend on, climate change is making the phenomenon more erratic, unpredictable and deadly across the region.

More than 1.4 million people living near the rivers have been affected by the floods, with over 265,000 evacuated, said Azma Bukhari, the provincial information minister.
“We just can’t get a break,” Amir Mehmood, a 32-year-old shopkeeper in the same neighbourhood as Bano, told AFP.
“Children fall ill in the smog because of the extreme cold. Some become sick due to the (everyday) unsanitary conditions,” he said, referring to piles of waste that routinely line the streets.
“And now there’s a flood. Our homes have collapsed, the walls have fallen, and everything is damaged.”
He moved his family to a relative’s home on the other side of the town along with his 10 cows and two goats as the water crept closer.
More than 300 relief camps have been set up across the province to shelter those displaced with no family to turn to.
“The women you see here, and me, we had to run for our lives… we did not even get the time to get clothes for our kids,” 40-year-old widow Tabassum Suleman told AFP from the school camp.
“We do not know when we will be going back home,” she said, looking up at the dark skies. “But the worst is yet to come.”

He provided few details in comments to parliament, which appeared to summarise steps that Turkiye has already taken against Israel over the conflict in Gaza or has started to implement.
Turkiye on Friday fiercely criticised Israel’s offensive in Gaza and accused it of committing genocide in the Palestinian enclave and halted all trade with Tel Aviv, called for international measures against it and urged world powers to stop their support.
Sources told Reuters last week that Turkish port authorities had also started informally requiring shipping agents to provide letters declaring that vessels are not linked to Israel and not carrying military or hazardous cargo bound for the country.
A source had also said that Turkish-flagged ships would be prohibited from calling at Israeli ports.
“We have totally cut our trade with Israel, we have closed off our ports to Israeli ships and we are not allowing Turkish vessels to go to Israel’s ports,” Fidan told an extraordinary parliamentary session on Israel’s attacks on Gaza.
“We are not allowing container ships carrying weapons and ammunition to Israel to enter our ports, and aeroplanes to go into our airspace,” he added, without giving details.
The Israeli government did not immediately comment on his remarks.</p><small>2025-08-29 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/291636576ec13f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938157/pakistan-agrees-to-consider-diplomatic-relations-with-armenia' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan agrees to consider ‘diplomatic relations’ with Armenia</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday said that Pakistan has agreed to consider establishing diplomatic relations with Armenia.
“Foreign Minister of the Republic of Armenia, H.E. Ararat Mirzoyan
@AraratMirzoyan and I held a cordial conversation on phone today, and agreed to consider establishing diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Armenia,” FM Dar posted on X.
 






Meanwhile, Armenia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ararat Mirzoyan also posted on X, saying, “Had an important call with DPM & FM H.E. Ishaq Dar @MIshaqDar50 today. Following recent developments & in line with the vision of cooperative engagement both bilaterally & on multilateral platforms, we discussed establishment of diplomatic relations between Armenia & Pakistan.”
 






Pakistan and Armenia do not have formal diplomatic relations so far.
The relationship is characterised by a regional geopolitical rivalry, with Pakistan supporting Azerbaijan against Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, as per the Press Information Department.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed US President Donald Trump’s peace efforts following his role in brokering the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal.
“Pakistan welcomes the historic peace agreement signed between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia at the White House Summit under the auspices of US President Donald J Trump,” the premier wrote in a statement on X.
He congratulated both countries on “charting a course for a peaceful future for their region”, stating: “Pakistan has always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan and we stand with them at this proud moment of their history.”</p><small>2025-08-29 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/29172727daa39ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938172/bangladesh-detains-group-including-ex-minister-for-alleged-plot-against-govt' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh detains group including ex-minister for alleged plot against govt</strong></a><br><p>An 87-year-old former minister was among 16 people ordered by a Bangladesh court Friday to be detained in custody on charges of plotting against the government, police said.
The South Asian nation has been in turmoil since a mass uprising toppled Sheikh Hasina’s autocratic government in 2024, with political parties vying for power ahead of elections scheduled for February.
The 16 were arrested on Thursday after attending a meeting at Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU), a journalists’ association, where they accused political parties of conspiring to undermine the constitution.
Witnesses said a mob stormed the venue, heckled the participants, and later handed them over to the police.
“They were arrested under the anti-terrorism act,” said Khalid Mansur, officer-in-charge of Dhaka’s central police station.
Among those held was Abdul Latif Siddiqui, a former minister under Hasina.
Police told the court that the accused were “hatching conspiracies and inciting unrest to destabilise the country and topple the government”.
Hafizur Rahman Karzon, a law professor at the University of Dhaka, was also among those detained.
In court on Friday — where the group was taken in handcuffs, helmets, and bulletproof vests — he said that they were victims, not offenders. Another of the detained, journalist Manjurul Alam, raised his arms and said: “These hands have written against corruption for years”.
Abu Saleh Akan and Mainul Hasan Sohel, the president and secretary of DRU, said that “freedom of expression is a fundamental right of every citizen”.</p><small>2025-08-29 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/291522085f8e5b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938150/govt-forms-special-body-to-provide-legal-aid-to-missing-persons-families' target='_blank'><strong>Govt forms special body to provide legal aid to missing persons’ families</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Friday constituted a special committee to provide legal aid to address the issues of families of missing persons, a press release said.
The committee aims to provide legal aid to those families whose cases are being investiged by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIOED) in family law-related matters.
The commission was set up in 2011 to trace the missing persons and fix responsibility on the individuals or organisations responsible. In the first half of 2025, a total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted there.
“The families of missing persons having any such issue, especially relating to National Database and Registration Authority regarding issuance of  Computerised National Identity Card/Form-B for various purposes, may submit their grievances, in writing, to the Special Committee through any mode of communication, including email (coioed@gmail.com) or WhatsApp (0321-5101070), followed by submission of hard copies,” the press release read.
It added that the families could also visit and meet COIOED Islamabad Assistant Registrar Saadia Rashid at the Directorate General Civil Defence Building on any working day for submission and discussion on their issues.
On Saturday, Supreme Court Justice Athar Minallah elaborated on the difficulties judges faced regarding cases of missing persons and enforced disappearances in the face of non-cooperation by the state and lawmakers.
The total number of cases received up by COIOED till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, according to the commission.
Last year, the government announced a Rs5 million “support package” per family of missing persons, which would provide them with legal and financial assistance as per the law minister.</p><small>2025-08-29 10:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/291507111264ed7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938149/thai-court-sacks-pm-paetongtarn-shinawatra-for-ethics-violation' target='_blank'><strong>Thai court sacks PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra for ethics violation</strong></a><br><p>Thailand’s Constitutional Court dismissed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office on Friday for an ethics violation after only a year in power, dealing another crushing blow to the Shinawatra political dynasty that could usher in a new period of turmoil.
Paetongtarn, who was Thailand’s youngest prime minister, becomes the sixth premier from or backed by the billionaire Shinawatra family to be removed by the military or judiciary in a tumultuous two-decade battle for power between the country’s warring elites.
In its verdict, the court said Paetongtarn violated ethics in a leaked June telephone call, during which she appeared to kowtow to Cambodia’s former leader Hun Sen when both countries were at the brink of an armed border conflict. Fighting erupted weeks later and lasted five days.
The decision paves the way for the election by parliament of a new prime minister, a process that could be drawn out, with Paetongtarn’s ruling Pheu Thai party losing bargaining power and facing a challenge to shore up a fragile alliance with a razor-thin majority.
In a 6-3 decision, the court said Paetongtarn had put her private interests before those of the nation and damaged the reputation of the country, causing a loss of public confidence.
 
 

“Due to a personal relationship that appeared aligned with Cambodia, the respondent was consistently willing to comply with or act in accordance with the wishes of the Cambodian side,” the court said in a statement.
The ruling brings a premature end to the premiership of the daughter and protégé of influential tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra. Paetongtarn, 39, was a political neophyte when she was thrust abruptly into the spotlight after the surprise dismissal of predecessor Srettha Thavisin by the same court a year ago.
Paetongtarn has apologised over the leaked call and said she was trying to avert a war.
Uncertainty ahead
She is the fifth premier in 17 years to be removed by the Constitutional Court, underlining its central role in an intractable power struggle between the elected governments of the Shinawatra clan and a nexus of powerful conservatives and royalist generals with far-reaching influence.
The focus will next shift to who will replace Paetongtarn, with Thaksin expected to be at the heart of a flurry of horse-trading between parties and other power-brokers to try to keep Pheu Thai in charge of the coalition.
Deputy premier Phumtham Wechayachai and the current cabinet will oversee the government in a caretaker capacity until a new prime minister is elected by the house, with no time limit on when that must take place.
There are five people eligible to become prime minister, with only one from Pheu Thai, 77-year-old Chaikasem Nitisiri, a former attorney general with limited cabinet experience, who has maintained a low profile in politics.
Others include former premier Prayuth Chan-ocha, who has retired from politics and led a military coup against the last Pheu Thai government in 2014, and Anutin Charnvirakul, a deputy premier before he withdrew his party from Paetongtarn’s coalition over the leaked phone call.
The ruling thrusts Thailand into more political uncertainty at a time of simmering public unease over stalled reforms and a stuttering economy expected by the central bank to grow just 2.3 per cent this year.
Any Pheu Thai administration would be a coalition likely to have only a slender majority and could face frequent parliamentary challenges from an opposition with huge public support that is pushing for an early election.
“Appointing a new prime minister…will be difficult and may take considerable time,” said Stithorn Thananithichot, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University.
“It’s not easy for all parties to align their interests,” he said. “Pheu Thai will be at a disadvantage.”</p><small>2025-08-29 10:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/291442324001f54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938146/polish-f-16-crashes-during-airshow-rehearsal-pilot-killed' target='_blank'><strong>Polish F-16 crashes during airshow rehearsal; pilot killed</strong></a><br><p>A Polish Air Force F-16 fighter jet crashed during a rehearsal for an airshow in Radom, central Poland, and the pilot died, the army said on Thursday.

“Rescue operations were immediately initiated at the scene,” it said in a statement.
Footage obtained by Polish media showed the F-16 performing a barrel roll aerobatic manoeuvre, and then crashing in flames as it slid on the ground.

CERN, one of the world’s largest and most respected centres for scientific research, was established in 1954 on the principle of “science for peace”, according to its website. Pakistan became CERN’s associate member on July 31, 2015, contributing to the centre’s projects as a “significant partner”. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) is the lead agency for the Pak-CERN collaboration.
“During the visit, a team of five top experts from CERN met with the chairman of the PAEC and toured various science and technology institutions,” a statement from the FO said.
“The purpose of these visits was to assess Pakistan’s progress in the field of science and technology.”
The institutions include the National Centre for Physics, Heavy Mechanical Complex-3, Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology, Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology, National Institute for Laser and Optronics and other advanced facilities, the statement read.
“Through its associate membership, Pakistan has gained significant benefits — advancing the frontiers of scientific knowledge, fostering technological development, and training a new generation of scientists and engineers,” it further noted.
 






In 2022, a task force of the CERN held meetings with different entities in Pakistan to review the associate membership.
Pakistan has attained numerous benefits from the membership, such as an increased number of engineering contracts to support CERN programmes, which are beneficial for the country’s industrial sector, human resources development and sharing of techniques and technology in key areas, besides numerous intellectual benefits.</p><small>2025-08-29 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/291157583a0b57b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938129/ctd-arrests-three-most-wanted-sra-terrorists-in-sindhs-jamshoro' target='_blank'><strong>CTD arrests three ‘most-wanted’ SRA terrorists in Sindh’s Jamshoro</strong></a><br><p>The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Hyderabad has arrested three “most-wanted” terrorists affiliated with the banned Sindhu Desh Revolutionary Army (SRA) in Jamshoro district during an intelligence-based operation, a statement from CTD said on Friday.
In 2020, the interior ministry banned the SRA, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz-Aresar Group (JSQM-A), and Sindhu Desh Liberation Army (SLA) under the Anti-Terrorism Act.
“CTD Hyderabad established a network to eliminate these terrorists through which information about them was obtained,” the statement said, adding that they were planning to carry out bomb blasts and targeted killings in Hyderabad city.
“The terrorists of the banned SRA were wanted in the cases related to firing on cargo trawlers going to Punjab, especially in the areas of district Sujawal.”
The statement detailed that the terrorists were found to possess a hand grenade, explosive material, detonator, ball bearings, nut bolts, remote control, battery, and prohibited weapons, including an 8MM rifle and bullets, which were confiscated following the operation.
The arrested terrorists confessed to carrying out multiple attacks, including planting bombs on railway tracks and targeting law enforcement personnel, while admitting to working under the direct instructions of SRA’s central leadership.
It added that one of the arrested terrorists revealed during interrogation that he and his group had been assigned 14 tasks, including targeted killings of police officials and bomb blasts in Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Kotri, and other areas.
Per the statement, the terrorist further revealed that on August 18,  a remote-controlled bomb was planted on railway tracks near Hyderabad, while another bomb was planted on August 28 in Latifabad but was successfully defused by the CTD.
“He disclosed that he had been receiving direct funding from SRA leadership abroad through Hawala/Hundi channels for carrying out terrorist activities and confessed that he had been providing logistical support to other SRA operatives in Sindh and was actively involved in recruiting youth for terrorist activities.
“The arrested terrorist has admitted that his group was planning a series of bomb blasts in Sindh to disrupt peace, and was also planning to carry out an attack on September 6,” the statement added.
Last week, CTD claimed that it unearthed a network of India’s intelligence agency, the Res­earch and Analysis Wing (RAW), which used Pakistanis and a separatist outfit in Sindh to carry out the targeted killing of a well-known soc­ial worker in Badin district.
In April, CTD Shaheed Benazirabad district claimed to have arrested a suspected operative of the SRA.</p><small>2025-08-29 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/291205389fc64a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938124/cash-strapped-taliban-look-to-airspace-for-windfall' target='_blank'><strong>Cash-strapped Taliban look to airspace for windfall</strong></a><br><p>Far above Kabul, the cash-strapped Taliban government has located a potentially lucrative revenue stream: Afghanistan’s airspace.
As Israel and Iran’s exchange of missiles threw flight paths into disarray this year, the skies above Afghanistan offered carriers a less turbulent and faster route to ply — for a flat $700 overflight fee, according to industry insiders.
The US aviation authority eased restrictions on the country’s airspace and paved the way for commercial flyovers in 2023, two years after the Taliban takeover.
Airspace that had long been avoided — as the country endured four decades of war and shifting powerbrokers — suddenly became a viable option, allowing carriers to abbreviate routes and save on fuel costs.
But it was not until the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June that the route really gained traction, allowing the Taliban government to potentially rake in millions.
Faced with shuttered airspace over Iran and Iraq, and unpredictable openings and closures across the Middle East, airlines saw reason to divert course and found refuge over Afghanistan.
While missiles clogged the neighbouring airspace, “the risk of flying over Afghanistan (was) virtually zero”, said France-based aerospace and defence consultant Xavier Tytelman.
“It’s like flying over the sea.”
May’s average of 50 planes cutting through Afghanistan each day skyrocketed to around 280 after June 13, when the Iran-Israel war erupted, data from tracking website Flightradar24 showed.
Since then, in any given day, more than 200 planes often traverse Afghanistan — equivalent to roughly $4.2 million a month, though this figure is difficult to verify as the authorities do not publish budgets and have declined to comment.
Opaque transactions
While not a princely sum in terms of government revenue, the overflight fees offer a much-needed boost to Afghanistan’s coffers as it contends with a massive humanitarian crisis and a war-battered economy.
Around 85 per cent of Afghanistan’s population lives on less than one dollar a day, according to the UN, and nearly one in four Afghans aged 15 to 29 are unemployed.
The World Bank says overflight fees contributed to modest growth in Afghanistan’s economy in 2024, before the route began attracting carriers needing to bypass Iran.
International airlines returned to Afghanistan starting in 2023, with Turkish Airlines, flydubai, and Air Arabia making almost daily flights from Afghan airports.
Others, such as Singapore Airlines, Air France, Aeroflot, Air Canada and Swiss Air, fly over Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif or Kandahar — as practicality outweighs the risks, which remain.
Consultant Tytelman warned that Afghanistan is still a less than ideal place to land in case of technical or medical emergencies, with potential complications due to a lack of spare parts and dilapidated health care services.
Yet he noted, “planes are landing in Kabul every day”.
Airlines were loath to discuss the mechanics of paying the Taliban government, which remains isolated by many countries in part over its restrictions on women.
Multiple companies contacted by AFP said they do not provide overflight payment information.
Afghanistan’s aviation officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and would not confirm the overflight fees or the process by which they are paid.
“Companies are not formally prohibited from trading with Afghanistan, as US sanctions target only certain Taliban officials,” a World Bank expert told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
However, “some abstain out of fear of being associated with the ruling power”, he added.
Industry insiders speaking on condition of anonymity said the $700 overflight fees are paid to third-party intermediaries, such as the United Arab Emirates-based GAAC Holding, which manages airports in Afghanistan, or overflight brokers.
Some airlines may now even pay directly, as more countries develop diplomatic ties with the Taliban government.
Reinforcing authority
Only Russia has officially recognised the Taliban authorities, who are hamstrung by frozen assets, sanctions on individuals and a lack of trust in the banking sector.
Against such economic headwinds, the airspace revenue stream “is helpful for the cash-strapped current administration”, said Sulaiman Bin Shah, former deputy minister of industry and commerce in the ousted government and founder of the Catalysts Afghanistan consultancy.
But Bin Shah emphasised that the overflight traffic offers more than just financial benefits, as it increases normalisation of the Taliban authorities.
“It reinforces their grip on state functions and supports the image of a functioning government, even without formal international recognition,” he said.
“So while the income itself is not transformative, it plays a meaningful role in the administration’s economic narrative and political positioning.”</p><small>2025-08-29 07:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/291120243a430e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937984/pakistan-shaping-up-well-says-skipper-salman-ahead-of-tri-series' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan shaping up well, says skipper Salman ahead of tri-series</strong></a><br><p>SHARJAH: Salman Ali Agha is not too concerned by Pakistan’s recent losses.
Instead, Pakistan T20 captain is looking forward to his “quality side with exciting youngsters and amazing seniors” doing well at the upcoming tri-nation series and the subsequent Asia Cup.
The Salman-led team face Afghanistan in a T20 tri-nation series opening match in Sharjah on Friday. The event, a warm-up for next month’s T20 Asia Cup, also includes hosts UAE.
Besides Afghanistan, Pakistan and the UAE, the Asia Cup will also include defending champions India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Oman and Hong Kong.
Pakistan’s white-ball fortunes are dipping after they crashed out of last year’s T20 World Cup in the group stage before failing to win a match at the ODI Champions Trophy.
This year they lost a T20 series in Bangladesh 2-1 but overcame the West Indies by the same margin.
Pakistan, under Salman, are going through a transition with former skippers Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan out of the T20 squad. Both the veteran players have been unable to impress in recent T20 Internationals.
“We’re not too concerned with our rankings or the opinion of the ex-players and the public,” Salman told reporters at the pre-series media conference.
“As a team, we are not thinking about it. We are here to play good cricket and win matches. We are a new team and we are shaping up well.
“We are trying to build a team and this tri-series and then the Asia Cup will be a good opportunity to achieve that. We know both these events will be challenging but we are ready.”
The captain continued, “Leading the Pakistan team is not only an honour for me but also a great responsibility. The team is playing good cricket at the moment and I am hopeful we will continue to deliver strong performances in the matches ahead.”
All three teams in the tri-series will play each other twice, with the top two to face off in a final on Sept 7.
 
 

Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan said his team have no “specific targets” despite producing groundbreaking performances in recent ICC global events.
Afghanistan reached the semi-finals of the 2024 T20 World Cup in the US and the Caribbean, and narrowly missed out on reaching the last four at the ODI Champions Trophy staged in Pakistan earlier in 2025.
Those performances followed an impressive showing at the 2023 one-day World Cup, when the Afghans produced statement wins over England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
“We do not have specific targets, and we do not want to put extra pressure on our players,” Rashid said on Thursday when asked if Afghanistan were targeting the Asia Cup title.
“Our target is to play the brand of cricket we have played over the years. For us the main target is to put in 200 percent effort on the ground.
“I think we have been doing well in the ICC events and although we haven’t played T20I cricket over the last few months, the guys have been playing in T20 leagues around the world and that has helped.”
Afghanistan beat Pakistan 2-1 in a T20I series at the same venue in 2023.
The 16-man Afghan squad for the tri-series includes fast-rising mystery spinner Allah Mohammad Ghazanfar along with fellow spin bowlers Noor Ahmad, Mohammad Nabi, Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Rashid.
The Asia Cup gets under way on Sept 9, as teams ramp up their preparations for the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, Rashid has asked for “unity” among supporters when Afghanistan play Pakistan.
The last time Afghanistan and Paki­stan met at Sharjah Cricket Stadium, in the 2022 Asia Cup, crowd unrest broke out in the stands after the game.
Special security measures will be in place for the games in Sharjah, including potentially segregating supporters.
Rashid has pleaded with spectators to support their sides, but respect their opposition also.
“It is a message to everyone who ever comes to watch the game in the stadium,” Rashid said.
“This game is something that brings unity, in brings people together, and brings nations together. It shows the right message, a message of peace.
“Everyone coming to the ground should support their team, support the players, and have fun. This game is all about enjoyment.
“We play this game to enjoy it and give entertainment to the crowd. I feel like it is just a game. There is nothing bigger to it.
“For the crowd to come and support their teams, and the respective players, that is what I request of them, and make sure they have fun and enjoy every moment of the game.”
The UAE team look clear underdogs in the tri-series but their skipper Muhammad Waseem is upbeat they can make a mark in the event.
The UAE have claimed scalps of teams like New Zealand and Afghanistan themselves in recent times, and also beat Bangladesh in a T20I series in Sharjah.
The idea that they have home advantage for the series is debatable: Pakistan and Afghanistan have each played home fixtures in the UAE in recent years.
However, Waseem is quietly confident.
“It is home for all three teams, but the way we have prepared, the way we have played for the past couple of years, and the work we have done over the past one and a half months, I think we are going to play good cricket over here,” the skipper said.

According to the directive, oil marketing companies, gas utilities, CNG stations, LPG and LNG operators, refineries and lubricant marketers must introduce and prominently display digital payment options — particularly the State Bank of Pakistan’s Raast QR code — at their outlets.
“No outlet will be allowed to refuse customers opting for digital transactions. Full compliance is required by Oct 31, 2025,” the regulator said. While consumers will still have the option to pay in cash, businesses will be bound to accept digital payments.
Ogra said the initiative supports the State Bank’s digitisation programme and is aimed at improving financial inclusion, transparency and operational efficiency across the energy sector. Companies have been advised to coordinate with banks, microfinance institutions or electronic money providers to obtain free-of-cost Raast QR codes for timely rollout.

All fuel outlets, utilities told to adopt cashless payments by Oct 31

“This initiative will facilitate consumers and strengthen Pakistan’s digital payment ecosystem,” the regulator noted.
The directive applies to the entire upstream, midstream and downstream value chain, covering marketing, refining, transportation, storage, transmission and distribution of petroleum products and natural gas, including CNG, LPG and LNG.
 
 

Officials said the decision had been under consideration before the FY26 budget under the direct supervision of the premier as part of the government’s “war on cash.”
Petrol pumps nationwide — from Karachi to Khyber and Azad Kashmir to Chaman — will be required to offer QR code, debit and credit card, and mobile payment options alongside cash transactions.
Unlike point-of-sale (POS) systems, which require investment in machines and maintenance, QR codes and similar digital solutions involve minimal cost. Authorities cited the experience of India, Indonesia and Bangladesh, where similar measures had expanded cashless transactions significantly.
Despite longstanding legal requirements, tens of thousands of restaurants and businesses — some located near the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) headquarters in Islamabad — continue to issue paper invoices and resist digital payments.
Separately, the government is pushing legislation in parliament to introduce digital tracking of petroleum products from import and production to retail sales. The measure is aimed at curbing smuggling and adulteration, which are estimated to cause annual revenue losses of Rs300-500bn, while also damaging engines and the environment.

The Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts are a federal paramilitary force responsible for internal security in GB and for guarding its borders.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Diamer Abdul Hameed told Dawn.com that the terrorists attacked the GB Scouts checkpoint situated at the KKH near Chilas of Diamer district on Friday at 12:15 am.
“Unknown armed men fired at the checkpoint from an elevated hilltop position, injuring three scout personnel, two of whom succumbed to their injuries later,” he said. “A total of nine people were present at the checkpoint when the attack took place.”
The deceased were identified as Naib Subedar Khush Dad and Havaldar Ashraf, while Lance Naik Sajid Ali sustained abdominal injury and is under treatment, he said.
“The police, led by the deputy inspector general and the district police officer, responded immediately and visited the incident site within the next 15-20 minutes, travelling there from Chilas,” he said.
The injured were immediately shifted to the Regional Headquarters (RHQ) Hospital in Chilas, SSP Hameed added.
The police recovered two grenades and 10 spent shells from the site of the firing at the hilltop, while 17 bullet holes were found at the checkpoint. The terrorists managed to flee the area.
Following the incident, Elite Force and additional police were dispatched to the area to strengthen the post and chase the attackers, the SSP said.
“The police have started carrying out raids to arrest the culprits and have raided many areas,” Hameed said, adding that no organisation had so far claimed the responsibility for the attack.
The incident occurred in the same area when ten people lost their lives and 20 passengers received injuries when an Islamabad-bound bus came under fire near Chilas in Diamer in December 2023.
GB’s Interior Minister Shamsul Haq Lone said in a statement that the terrorists targeted the KKH checkpoint in the dark of night.
“Immediately after the attack, a large contingent of security forces reached the spot and sealed the area and expanded the search operation to pursue the terrorists,” he said.
“There had been no prior intelligence regarding the attack.”
He said that the soldier injured in the incident has been shifted to the hospital for medical treatment, and his condition is out of danger.
“The GB government would pursue the terrorists and bring them to their ultimate fate,” Lone said, adding that those who attempt to sabotage the peace of this otherwise peaceful region are enemies of the country and the nation.
The minister further said the GB Scouts checkpoint had been set up on December 2, 2023, following a firing incident on a passenger bus in which nine people were killed and 21 were injured.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has taken strict notice of the tragic incident and ordered the pursuit of the perpetrators.
The spokesperson termed the attack an act of extreme cowardice.
On July 21 this year, armed men martyred a Federal Constabulary soldier at a forest checkpoint along the KKH in GB’s Diamer district, according to police.</p><small>2025-08-29 06:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/29105214ff80c66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938019/fbr-moves-to-tighten-e-commerce-oversight' target='_blank'><strong>FBR moves to tighten e-commerce oversight</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has tightened compliance protocols by mandating quarterly return filings from couriers and payment intermediaries responsible for collecting or deducting withholding tax.
The revenue authority issued draft amendments to the Income Tax Rules, 2002, through SRO 1634 of 2025. The draft will be finalised after receiving feedback from stakeholders.
The proposed protocols will only apply to domestic e-commerce outfits and couriers.
Under the proposed amendments, in line with Sub-Section 2 of Section 165 and Sub-Section 1 of section 165C, any courier or payment intermediary tasked with tax collection or deduction under Division II or Division III of Part V of Chapter X of the Ordinance, or under Chapter XII, must submit a quarterly statement. These are to be filed electronically using the format prescribed in Part X of the Second Schedule to the rules.
 
 

The deadlines for filing are set as April 20 for the quarter ending March 31, July 20 for the quarter ending June 30, Oct 20 for the quarter ending Sept 30, and Jan 20 for the quarter ending Dec 31.
In a parallel move aimed at strengthening oversight of digital commerce, the FBR has also imposed a monthly reporting requirement on online marketplaces handling digitally ordered goods and services.
According to Sub-Section 2 of Section 165C, digital platforms must submit detailed monthly statements covering both transactional and aggregate data of registered sellers.
Additionally, if an online marketplace provides courier services, it will also be required to file statements under Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 44, read with Part X of the Second Schedule. The FBR has specified that these filings must be submitted using two designated formats: Form A1 and Form A2.

There was no official word from Islamabad, and Afghan authorities did not provide any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the incident, either.
Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul to prevent its soil from being used to stage attacks in Pakistan, and that it is fully capable of targeting terrorists who carry out such attacks.
Quoting Afghan authorities, the Reuters news agency reported on Thursday that three children were killed and several others wounded when ‘drones’ hit the home of one Haji Naeem Khan in Khost’s Spera district, near the border with North Waziristan.
AFP photographs from Spera showed people standing outside a badly damaged home in the Lahori Village.
Meanwhile, Afghan officials claimed that four sons and two wives of a man named Shahsawar were among those injured when his house was destroyed in Nangarhar’s Shinwar district.
The Taliban foreign ministry said in a statement that it strongly condemns the violation of Afghanistan’s airspace, and that the bombing of civilians such irresponsible actions will inevitably have consequences.
It said that a protest note was formally handed to Pakistan’s ambassador, Ubaid-ur-Rehman Nizam­ani, during a meeting in Kabul on Thursday.
Pakistan has targeted terrorist camps in Afghan territory in the past: most recently in December last year, when Pakistan jets bombed positions in Pak­tika province, targeting members of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­is­tan (TTP).
At the time, the Foreign Office had avoided di­r­ectly commenting on the claim, but admitted that Pa­k­­i­stani forces conducted “operations in border areas to protect the people of Pakistan from terr­­­orist groups”.
A number of cross-border infiltration bids have also been foiled. In April of this year, ISPR claimed killing at least 54 terrorists who were trying to cross into North Waziristan.
 
 

Then, earlier this month, at least 50 attackers were killed trying to cross from Afghanistan into Balo­chistan’s Zhob district.
Recent negotiations bet­ween the TTP and tribesmen in border districts have also laid bare the reality of their chain of comm­and, as the militants rep­e­a­tedly sought time to consu­lt their leaders in Afgha­n­istan.
