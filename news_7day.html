Canada has been looking to open new markets for the commodity after China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, a year after Canada said it would levy a 100 per cent tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles.
In a joint statement released late on Monday, the two countries said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had held a phone call with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand on October 30, “reaffirming the strong and enduring ties between Pakistan and Canada and emphasising the importance of deepening cooperation in areas of mutual interest”.
 






“Pakistan and Canada agreed to facilitate the export of Canadian canola to Pakistan, recognising the significant potential of Pakistan’s expanding market for this Canadian commodity,” the statement said.
It added that the ministers also welcomed the successful conclusion of the first round of negotiations toward a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement. It said that led by Minister for Investment Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh and Canadian Minister of International Trade Maninder Sidhu, the agreement was an “important priority which reflects both countries’ dedication to fostering a stable and transparent investment environment”.
“Both sides also expressed keen interest in expanding bilateral cooperation on energy security and critical minerals, recognising the strong and growing role of Canadian companies in achieving Pakistan’s ambitious mineral development goals and harnessing its clean energy potential,” the statement said.
It further said that the minister also looked ahead to the upcoming sixth round of bilateral consultations, which would serve as a platform to “advance shared priorities, reinforce government-to-government and private sector linkages, and explore new avenues for strategic collaboration”.
“Pakistan and Canada remain committed to working together to promote peace, prosperity, and inclusive growth, both bilaterally and on the global stage,” the statement concluded.
Canadian Foreign Minister Anand also posted the joint statement on social media platform X.
 






Meanwhile, Canadian MP Rob Oliphant said that Ottawa was strengthening and diversifying its trade relationships.
“As we continue negotiations toward a Foreign Investment and Promotion Agreement with Pakistan, our governments have agreed to facilitate Canadian canola exports — a beneficial deal for both sides,” he said.
 






Canadian MP Shafqat Ali said the two countries were strengthening cooperation in areas of mutual interest, including renewed trade in Canadian canola.
“Good news for both our countries,” he said.
Last week, Dar and his Canadian counterpart had discussed the strengthening of bilateral trade and cooperation between the two countries. During the call, Anand had thanked Dar for facilitating market access for imports of Canadian canola to Pakistan.
“Both leaders appreciated recent constructive engagements, reaffirmed their commitment to advancing mutually beneficial economic cooperation,” the Foreign Office had said, adding that the two foreign ministers agreed to remain in close contact.
Subsequently, Anand said on X that she spoke to Canola Council of Canada and explained that “our diplomatic efforts had resulted in Pakistan’s decision to lift restrictions on imports of Canadian canola”.
“This decision re-establishes a significant market for Canadian canola producers,” she said. “As Pakistan expedites regulatory approvals, for Canadian canola, I understand that import orders have already been placed,” she said.

The three-month voter registration overhaul — known as the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) — kicked off in 12 states and territories, many of which are slated to hold local elections next year.
Tens of thousands of election officials and nearly half a million volunteers will go door-to-door to help residents complete voter enumeration forms.
Officials “will help the elector fill the enumeration form, collect it and submit it”, Election Commission of India chief Gyanesh Kumar told reporters while announcing the exercise.
Earlier this year, the ECI conducted a similar revision in the eastern state of Bihar, home to more than 130 million people, ahead of its state elections beginning November 6.
 
 

The process led to the exclusion of around 6.5 million names, which the ECI said was necessary to prevent the inclusion of “foreign illegal immigrants”.
Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have long claimed that undocumented Muslim migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh have fraudulently registered as voters.
Critics, however, argue that stringent documentation requirements could result in large numbers of Indian citizens being wrongly removed from the rolls.
Activists have reported cases of living voters declared dead and entire families being struck off draft lists.
In August, India’s Supreme Court eased some concerns by ruling that the widely used biometric-linked Aadhaar identity card could be accepted as valid documentation for the process.
The latest SIR drive will cover major states including Uttar Pradesh — India’s most populous state with about 199 million people — as well as West Bengal with 91 million, Tamil Nadu with 72 million, and Kerala with 33 million, according to the 2011 census.
Several rights groups and opposition parties have filed legal challenges.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, whose party filed its opposition in the Supreme Court on Monday, said the exercise was a “mere trick to delete the names of genuine voters”.
“Voting is the body and soul of democracy, and that right is facing a threat,” he told opposition parties on Sunday.
The final electoral roll is expected to be released on February 7, 2026.</p><small>2025-11-04 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/041109036ac1891.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953093/trump-backs-ex-governor-cuomo-threatens-to-cut-funds-for-new-york-city-if-mamdani-wins-mayoral-race' target='_blank'><strong>Trump backs ex-governor Cuomo, threatens to cut funds for New York City if Mamdani wins mayoral race</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump endorsed former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for mayor of New York City on Monday and threatened to hold back federal funds to the city if Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the mayoral election on Tuesday.
Trump, a Republican who has offered frequent commentary on the New York mayoral election, injected himself further into the race by crossing party lines to support Cuomo over Mamdani and the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, who trails badly in public opinion polls in the heavily Democratic city.
Cuomo, a longtime stalwart in the Democratic Party, is running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary.
Tuesday’s New York City election has been closely watched nationally as one that could help shape the image of the Democratic Party as it seeks its identity in opposition to Trump.
 
 

Mamdani, 34, a self-described democratic socialist who is leading Cuomo in the polls, has energised younger and more progressive voters, but he has also alarmed more moderate Democrats who fear a shift too far to the left may backfire. Republicans have attacked Mamdani’s candidacy throughout the campaign, with Trump casting him as a communist.
“Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
Trump said a vote for Sliwa would only help Mamdani.
“If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home,” said Trump, a native New Yorker.
The US federal government is providing $7.4 billion to New York City in fiscal year 2026, or about 6.4 per cent of the city’s total spending, according to a report from the New York State Comptroller.
Trump has threatened federal funding cuts throughout his second term in office over climate initiatives, transgender policies, pro-Palestinian protests against Israel’s onslaught on Gaza and diversity, equity and inclusion practices.
Mamdani, a Uganda-born state assembly member, shocked political observers on June 24 with a convincing victory in the primary.
Mamdani has used his campaign to rally New Yorkers against establishment candidates like Cuomo, who was elected governor of New York three times but resigned in 2021 following a report from the New York Attorney General that concluded he had sexually harassed 11 women, including state employees.
A US Justice Department investigation later concluded Cuomo subjected at least 13 female state employees to a “sexually hostile work environment.”
“The MAGA movement’s embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump’s understanding that this would be the best mayor for him,” Mamdani said at a campaign event following Trump’s endorsement of Cuomo.
“They (Trump and Cuomo) share the same donors, they share the same small vision, they share the same sense of impunity,” Mamdani said.
 






Mamdani’s policies include hiking taxes on New York City’s wealthiest, raising the corporation tax rate, freezing stabilised apartment rental rates and increasing publicly subsidised housing.
His rise presents both risks and rewards for the national Democratic Party, which acknowledges the need to appeal to young voters but is wary of Republican attacks over Mamdani’s criticism of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories and his democratic socialism, which has concerned New York’s finance community.</p><small>2025-11-04 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04121242007cea1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953096/4-militants-killed-in-intelligence-based-operation-in-kalat-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>4 militants killed in intelligence-based operation in Kalat: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Four Indian-sponsored terrorists were killed after security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Kalat district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Tuesday.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on the night of November 1, security forces conducted an IBO on the reported presence of militants belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
 






“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and resultantly, four Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said.
“Weapons and ammunition [were] also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” it added.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area,” the statement said, adding that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to wipe out foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.
President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for eliminating the terrorists, his official account posted on social media platform X.
“The nation stands firmly with its forces in their resolve to root out terrorism under Operation Azm-i-Istehkam,” he said.
 






The development comes a day after the ISPR said at least three terrorists were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p><small>2025-11-04 08:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04122617eb0f40d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953097/us-seeks-un-approval-for-gaza-security-force-with-broad-2-year-mandate-report' target='_blank'><strong>US seeks UN approval for Gaza security force with broad 2-year mandate: report</strong></a><br><p>The United States is seeking approval from the United Nations for the establishment of an International Security Force (ISF) in Gaza with a mandate of at least two years, Axios reported on Tuesday.
According to the report, the US sent several UN Security Council (UNSC) members a draft resolution yesterday outlining the establishment of its proposed security force to maintain security in the Palestinian enclave.
Axios, which obtained a copy of the draft, said that the resolution was designated “sensitive but unclassified”. It reported that the resolution would give the US and other participating countries a broad mandate to deploy security forces to govern Gaza until the end of 2027, and allowed the possibility of extensions beyond that time.
The force would be established “in consultation with the Gaza ‘Board of Peace’”, to be chaired by US President Donald Trump, the publication reported. The Board of Peace is also to remain in place “at least through the end of 2027”.
However, a US official told Axios that the ISF was to be an “enforcement force and not a peacekeeping force”. The official said that the goal was to vote to establish the force in the next few weeks and deploy the first troops to Gaza by January.
 
 

The publication said the draft would serve as the basis for upcoming negotiations between UNSC members. It further said that the proposed resolution tasked the ISF with “securing Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt, protecting civilians and humanitarian corridors, and training a new Palestinian police force, with which it’s to partner in its mission”.
The ISF would also “stabilise the security environment in Gaza by ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” the draft stated, as well as taking on “additional tasks” as required to support the Gaza peace deal.
Axios said that this suggested that the mandate included disarming Hamas if it does not do so of its own volition.
The resolution further said that the ISF would deploy in Gaza “under unified command acceptable to the Board of Peace” and stressed that there would be “close consultation and cooperation with Egypt and Israel”. The proposed force would have the power “to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate consistent with international law, including international humanitarian law”.
According to Axios, the ISF was intended to provide security in Gaza during a transition period during which Israel would gradually withdraw from additional parts of Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority would conduct reforms that would enable it to take over Gaza longer-term.
 
 

The draft resolution also called for the empowerment of the Board of Peace as “a transitional governance administration”. The draft resolution said that the board would be “supervising and supporting a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Strip … which shall be responsible for day-to-day operations of Gaza’s civil service and administration”.
It added that aid would be delivered by organisations working with the Board of Peace, including the UN, Red Cross and Red Crescent; meanwhile, any organisation that misuses or diverts this aid it will be banned“.
Muslim nations’ meeting in Istanbul
The establishment of the ISF is a cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement, which paved the way for the October 10 ceasefire in the Palestinian territory. The ceasefire, which halted two years of continuous bloodshed, has been tested by fresh Israeli strikes in Gaza.
The ceasefire was achieved with the efforts of eight Muslim countries —Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia — that worked with the Trump administration on the Gaza peace plan.
Foreign ministers from seven of these countries, namely Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia — met in Istanbul yesterday and agreed to back a post-war framework for Gaza, where Palest­ine’s governance and security is ensured by Palestinians. They also stressed the importance of a UN mandate for the proposed task force for stabilisation in Gaza.
After the meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters that the propsoed taskforce to monitor the Gaza ceasefire under a US-brokered deal needed a mandate defined by the UNSC and a framework for legitimacy, on the basis of which countries would decide whether to send soldiers to the enclave.
Washington is currently working with Arab and international partners to decide on the composition of the force, with Turkiye hoping to play a role, despite fierce opposition from Israel. “The countries we’ve spoken with say they will decide whether to send troops based on … the ISF’s mandate and authority,” Fidan said yesterday.
“First, a general consensus needs to be reached on a draft, then it needs to be approved by the members of the Security Council.
“And it needs to be free from vetoes by any of the permanent (UNSC) members,” Fidan said of a blocking move frequently used by key Israel ally Washington.
Top-level consultations are reportedly also underway in Pakistan over the question of sending troops for the proposed Gaza force, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the UN umbrella.</p><small>2025-11-04 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04110739fd6e361.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953092/citizens-anger-boils-over-after-dumper-truck-kills-man-injures-woman-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Citizens’ anger boils over after dumper truck kills man, injures woman in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Angered citizens set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it killed a man and injured his wife, resulting in some people opening fire on them, police said on Tuesday.
“A garbage dumper hit a motorcyclist on Nishtar Road near Karachi Sweets, killing him,” South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.
He identified the deceased man as 23-year-old Shahzeb Shahid and his wife as Misbah. The driver, Niazullah Afzal, was arrested and taken to a police station, DIG Raza said.
“The public set the dumper on fire,” the police officer said. He added that the blaze was later extinguished and 40 per cent of the vehicle was burnt. Police reached the site of the incident and the injured woman was taken to a hospital, a statement by the Karachi police’s media cell said.
 
 

A first information report (FIR) was registered against the dumper driver under Sections 320 (negligent driving) and 337-G (hurt by rash or negligent driving) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on the complaint of the victim’s father.
As per the FIR, the father received information about the accident of Shahzeb, who had gotten married three to four months ago, at around 12 midnight.
When he, along with other relatives, arrived at the hospital, his son had already expired, the complainant said. The complainant said the dumper driver was involved in rash and negligent driving.
Meanwhile, police also registered a separate FIR against Liaquat Mehsood, the Sindh president of the All Dumper Truck Owners Association, and other suspects for firing on the enraged protesters.
The FIR invoked Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed) and 337-H (ii) (rash or negligent act to endanger human life) against the dumpers association’s head and others.
In the FIR, complainant Abdul Qadir, who introduced himself as a social worker, said he was present at Nishter Road, where the dumper had killed the man and injured his wife when the public set the heavy vehicle on fire.
He claimed that at around 3:30am, Mehsood arrived with 20-25 people, including two to three armed men, who resorted to firing and fled.
The armed men continued firing while fleeing, the complainant said. The social worker said he wanted to initiate legal proceedings against Mehsood and other unidentified persons for open firing.
On the other hand, in a statement shared on Mehsood’s Facebook account, the dumpers’ association claimed people opened fire at the official’s car and attempted to set it on fire.
The association’s spokesperson threatened to block the Super Highway in protest at 2pm if a case was not registered over the incident.
Rise in heavy vehicle accidents
In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles such as dumpers and water tankers. Nearly 500 people lost their lives and 4,879 were injured in 2024 in road accidents resulting from various reasons, from reckless driving to construction activities, hospital data showed.
On October 12, a reckless dumper driver smashed into six vehicles, including three ambulances of the Edhi Foundation, near Merewether Clock Tower, killing a man and injuring two others. The driver, who possessed a “fake” licence, was arrested.
On August 10, two siblings were killed and their father was injured when a dumper truck ran over them on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall. A mob then set seven trucks on fire, which sparked protests from transporters.
August 15 recorded two accidents involving heavy vehicles, including one where a speeding water tanker ran over and killed a four-year-old boy in Orangi Town.
In another accident, a young couple lost their lives when a fast-moving dumper truck hit their motorcycle in the Sultanabad area on M.T. Khan Road.</p><small>2025-11-04 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/041122075e8a7c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953094/ac-explosion-reported-at-sc-building-in-islamabad-media' target='_blank'><strong>AC explosion reported at SC building in Islamabad: media</strong></a><br><p>An explosion has taken place at the Supreme Court building in Islamabad, according to local media. Media reports initially said the explosion was caused by a gas cylinder but later linked it to an air conditioner.
In multiple videos received by Dawn following the incident, the damaged interior of parts of the SC building is visible with blood stains on the floor. One of Dawn’s court correspondents identified one of the areas as a cafeteria located in the building’s basement.
In other videos recorded outside, people, including lawyers, could be seen spilling out of the building. At least one person, who was visibly injured and bleeding, could be seen being taken away. Another person, with no visible injuries but apparently badly affected, could also be seen being brought out of the building.
Another video also showed policemen present at the site.

This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expected to meet the winners on Wednesday, believes the  “historic win will motivate future champions to take up sports”.
Hosts India defeated South Africa by 52 runs on Sunday, claiming their first-ever Women’s World Cup.
At the top level, gender parity has long been championed by former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jay Shah, who introduced equal match fees for men and women.
The 50-over World Cup also boasted a record $13.88 million prize purse, eclipsing the men’s total from two years ago.
Shah, now International Cricket Council (ICC) chairman, hailed the win, citing the BCCI’s  “increased investment, pay parity with male cricketers (and), overhaul of the coaching staff”.
Former India skipper Mithali Raj described it as the culmination of years of effort.
“For every person standing behind a young girl who dares to dream of wearing India’s colours, this is a pivotal moment, a reminder that dreams do come true,” she wrote, posting a photograph of herself embracing the trophy.
Despite the triumph, women’s sports in India still have far to go and the impact of the World Cup win may be gradual.
“The gender gap is stark, especially during adolescence and early adulthood,” according to a 2024 State of Sports and Physical Activity report, backed by global consultancy firm Dalberg.
“The largest gender gaps unsurprisingly occur when caregiving responsibilities increase,” it adds, citing household chores and care of children or the elderly.
The UN children’s agency, in partnership with the ICC, sought to use the World Cup to  “create equal opportunities for every girl and boy”, Unicef representative to India Cynthia McCaffrey said.
“As a cricketer, I know how the sport is a great equaliser,” India’s vice-captain Smriti Mandhana said, who joined the Unicef campaign.
Women now make up more than a third of India’s estimated 655 million sports fans.
A 2024 Deloitte and Google study found women — 236 million fans, or 36 percent — are shaping the sports market, debunking the notion of a male-only fanbase.
India’s Women’s Premier League (WPL), staged first in 2023, delivered the BCCI roughly $700 million in franchise and media rights alone.
Young women cricketers say the World Cup success will strengthen their sport.
At a net session in a New Delhi academy, a bouncer slammed into Armeet Kaur’s helmet, prompting a flurry of concerned apologies.
The 20-year-old brushed them off and told the bowler to carry on. The next ball, she stepped out of her crease and lofted it clean.
“Girls are not fragile,” she said.  “And the good thing is that people know that now — after seeing women’s cricket on TV. That matters because what people think does have a bearing on the world.” Kaur credited systemic changes in women’s cricket for India’s success.
“Now the money is almost at par with men’s cricket, and there are more tournaments for women at all levels,” she said.
“The good thing is that people no longer discourage girls from playing.”
The World Cup drew record viewers: the first 13 matches attracted more than 60 million viewers, five times the 2022 edition.
While modest for the world’s most populous nation, it signals growing interest in women’s cricket.
That means Indian girls can see cricket as a viable career.
“I started playing because it was my passion,” said Ishita Singh.  “But now I want it to be my full-time profession.”

“Where we are as a country, we find ourselves in a good spot at this point and time because there is a confluence of factors,” he said, adding that macroeconomic stability combined with “geopolitical tailwinds” had boosted the economy.
The finance minister made these remarks in a virtual address at the second edition of the Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference 2025 (PIMEC-25), which is being held in Karachi.
“Our traditional partners, who have helped us through thick and thin … we find ourselves in a spot that we can now leverage, and we should leverage — in terms of these relationships which have been strong for the longest time — to move from government-to-government (G2G) discussions to trade and investment flows into the country,” he said.
In his address, the finance minister described blue economy as a game changer for Pakistan’s future growth. He also went on to say that Pakistan had received “external validation” for its economic policies.
“After a hiatus of two to three years, we have three global rating agencies which are fully aligned, not only in terms of the upgrades we have seen over the course of this year but also [in terms of] their outlook, which is stable for Pakistan’s economy,” he said.
He noted that Pakistan was currently part of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme. Stating that a staff-level agreement was announced last month, he said that this pointed to the confidence being reposed in Pakistani authorities.
He said that improved trade and investment flows which were expected in the coming months would help the country in moving toward sustainable growth.
Talking about blue economies, he said that Pakistan had a “modest starting point”.
“We are hovering at about 0.4 to 0.5 per cent of the national gross domestic product (GDP) which equates to roughly $1 billion,” he said. He said that the current GDP was $411bn, adding that Pakistan’s “real potential” was $3 trillion.
“It is very heartening and encouraging to see that the Ministry of Maritime Affairs has also put a marker in the ground, which is ambitious but very reachable,” he said.
He said that the government’s aim of becoming a $100bn blue economy by 2047 was “transformational and the right ambition”.
He said that the broad pillars of getting to that number were “robust”, adding that it started with achieving excellence in fisheries and aquaculture. Aurangzeb said that Pakistan’s seafood exports were currently $500 million, saying that getting that to $2bn over the next three to four years was a “very achievable milestone”.
“As the finance minister, I would like to assure you … that we are going to ensure that there is policy consistency. Whatever we say, we see it through the cycle. So I think that is going to be a very important part of how we are going to take this discussion forward,” he said.
He went on to say that another pillar was the modernisation of ports and logistics, and digitisation of the country’s ports. He said that another was renewable energy which included looking at “innovative financing” for projects.
“We have done green bonds in the past,” he said, highlighting the need for issuing blue bonds and blended financing mechanisms to fund conservation and sustainable development initiatives.
He added that marine biotechnology and regional collaboration presented further avenues for growth, with the ultimate objective of integrating blue economy principles into Pakistan’s national economic transformation agenda.
He concluded his remarks by wishing all panelists and delegations participating in PIMEC a “fruitful and constructive discussion”, adding that he looked forward to receiving feedback at the end of the conference.</p><small>2025-11-04 05:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/041031356946c46.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953000/rare-pod-of-endangered-arabian-humpback-whales-spotted-off-gwadar' target='_blank'><strong>Rare pod of endangered Arabian humpback whales spotted off Gwadar</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A rare large pod, comprising more than six endangered Arabian humpback whales, identified by the shape of their spouts and distinctive diving patterns, was sighted on Sunday night off Gwadar, the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) said on Monday.
Previously, the organisation had reported several sightings of this species from Pakistani waters; however, most of those involved only one or two whales.
According to experts, a group of fishermen led by Nakhuda Amir Dad Karim spotted more than six Arabian humpback whales migrating from west to east in the offshore waters about 11 nautical miles south of Gwadar headland.
Muhammad Moazzam Khan, technical adviser of WWF-Pakistan, considered the occurrence of such a large pod along the Pakistan coast an indicator of recovery for the species’ once-declining population.
“Whaling operations in the Arabian Sea, including off Pakistan’s coast from 1963 to 1967, by Soviet fleets used to target humpback whales. They are believed to have severely impacted the population of the Arabian Sea humpback whales, which have been struggling to recover since then,” he said.

Senior Director Biodiversity WWF-Pakistan Rab Nawaz said that the recent sightings of the large pod of whales, along with frequent reports of Bryde’s and blue whales along the Sindh and Balochistan coasts, reflected the high productivity of Pakistan’s Arabian Sea.
 
 

“These observations highlight the richness of our marine ecosystems and the importance of continued monitoring. I deeply appreciate the fishermen’s community, who remain vigilant and regularly report sightings of marine species to the organisation. Their efforts are a remarkable contribution to citizen science. The awareness we’ve created among coastal communities and the public is generating invaluable information for the conservation of these magnificent species, and that deserves recognition,” he said.
Arabian humpback whales, inhabiting the Arabian Sea, are a small subpopulation of humpback whales, which are considered to be the most isolated whale population on Earth. A population estimation study suggests that they have remained separate from other humpback whale populations for perhaps 70,000 years, which is extremely unusual in a species famed for long-distance migrations.
Most whales migrate to the Antarctic waters during the summerto feed on the abundant pelagic shrimp (krill) and small fish. This rich food source allows them to build up thick layers of blubber, which is essential for their energy during the colder months when they migrate to warmer, tropical waters to mate and give birth.
The major population of the Arabian Sea humpback whale inhabits the waters of Oman and, after the cessation of the southwest monsoon, migrates to Pakistani waters for feeding on rich planktonic shrimp and other pelagic fishes.
Last week, a pod of Bryde’s whale was reported from Gwadar (East Bay), which indicates the biodiversity potential of the Balochistan coast. So far, 27 species of cetaceans (dolphins and whales) have been reported from Pakistan, which reflects the abundance and productivity of its coastal and offshore ecosystems.

The other half is their children. What then accounts for the vile invectives flung at Jemimah Rodrigues?
For want of a better explanation, Pablo Neruda’s lines from the ‘Fable of the mermaid and the drunks’ could help us see the viciousness on display in the cowardly caverns of the internet. Neruda’s searing lines describe a trusting mermaid who strays into a tavern of drunk and abusive men. “They blackened her with burnt corks and cigarette stubs/ and rolled around laughing on the tavern floor/ She did not speak because she had no speech … Her lips moved, silent, in a coral light, and suddenly she went out by that door/ Entering the river she was cleaned, shining like a white stone in the rain…”
Jemimah played an innings of her life to outwit a formidable Australian team thereby putting India into the finals against South Africa. Her teammates, chiefly the one who was summoned at the last minute to stand in for an injured colleague and who took the best performance prize in the final match to mock the selectors, brought back elegance and class that had eluded Indian cricket in recent years.
Jemimah was viciously trolled after she gave the credit for her outstanding performance to Jesus Christ. There’s a background to it. Her father was stripped of his membership of the prestigious Hindu Gymkhana Club in Mumbai last year over communally inspired claims he sought to convert people to Christianity on the club’s premises. The father denies the charge. That plus the stress of being kept on her toes perpetually by the selectors was as good a reason as any for her to share her angst publicly.
Which player does not have a prayer on their lips when they brace for a tense contest? Is there a dearth of Indian players or their fans who perform yagnas and make temple visits to seek boons for this or that game? No less a person than Gandhiji was a devotee of Christ, quoting often from the Sermon on the Mount. And forget not how Diego Maradona described his World Cup winning goal against England in 1986. Impishly and not without double entendre he said: “It was a little with the head of Maradona, a little with the hand of God.”

Which player does not have a prayer on their lips when they brace for a tense contest?

The ugliness we witnessed from Indian fans (and some players) towards Pakistan’s squad in a recent cricket contest is sought to be passed off as an aspect of national fervour. How then shall we explain pretty much the same louts attacking a quality Indian player like Jemimah Rodrigues? Let’s face it. Contrary to a widely indulged belief, sports and politics have seldom if ever been separated from each other, and the connection precedes the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia. Denying the bond is a fool’s errand.
 
 

It was Europe that collectively conjured the idea of the modern nation state, paving the way for newfound but eventually vulgarised nationalism to tether the fleet-footed human spirit to a yard of coloured cloth. (The non-resident India for all his shortcomings is at least honest in switching his national loyalty at will.) The idea of thousands of years old nationhood claimed by some Indians is clearly a canard. Before the 17th-century innovation of frozen borders, human loyalties and identities would change by staying still while empires expanded and contracted around them. Else it would have been tricky for Shelley to compose Ozymandias as a commentary on how egos of transient men in power are laid low by the vagaries of time.
Given that the history of sports precedes the innovation called nationalism, it is safe to conclude that elements other than those driven by national identity were in orbit when Indian players were ordered not to shake hands with Pakistani players. The sickening behaviour, while insincere, was not much different from say the mealy-mouthed boycott of the Moscow Olympics by the West, which Pakistan and some others had dutifully embraced. That decision may have unwittingly allowed the Indian hockey team to walk away with the gold medal, it’s last in Olympics. However, what was posited in the 1980s to be in Pakistan’s national interest would be described by senior Pakistan ministers in recent days to have been a grave and self-harming error.
It cannot be national interest that admiring Brian Lara or Donald Bradman is a most agreeable thing to do but applauding the swinging yorkers of Pakistani bowlers is not. The narrow national spirit was in abeyance when Yuri Gagarin and Neil Armstrong defied gravity to applaud the questioning spirit of Galileo. Likewise with sport. When Bob Beamon scaled improbable heights to become an invincible long jump athlete in Mexico City the world cheered on.
To underscore the link between politics and sports, the origin of the marathon was rooted in a political legend. It was a minor military victory that the Athenian city state scored over the formidable Persian empire of Darius. The ancient Greek legend Pheidippides, ran from the battle site of Marathon to Athens in 490 BC to announce the Athenian victory over the Persians. The modern marathon was created for the 1896 Olympic Games to honour this story.
Curiously, when Hitler staged the 1936 Berlin Olympics to legitimise Nazi rule, no Western country thought of boycotting the games. Instead, the US sent Jesse Owens, the legendary African-American athlete who won four gold medals. While his participation challenged Hitler’s racist worldview it also threw a convenient cover on America’s own racist reality. The World Cup victory should help lift the veil from the anti-women subterfuge being perpetrated by a combination of nationalism and religion in India today.

“Direct flights have cut travel time significantly, especially when layovers in Dubai have been eliminated,” an official from the Uzbekistan Embassy told Dawn.
Uzbekistan Airways, the national carrier of the Republic of Uzbekistan, now operates a total of four weekly flights between Uzbekistan and Pakistan, doubling the frequency of its Tashkent–Islamabad service while continuing its regular Tashkent–Lahore flights.
According to Uzbekistan Airways, the decision to expand services was driven by strong passenger demand, as previous Islamabad flights often operated at full capacity and tickets sold out days in advance.
“Tashkent–Islamabad–Tashkent” flights operate twice weekly, every Tuesday and Saturday, while “Tashkent–Lahore–Tashkent” flights operate twice weekly, every Wednesday and Friday.
The embassy said that with this expansion, Uzbekistan Airways has strengthened its role as a key bridge between Central and South Asia, offering Pakistani travelers greater choice, convenience, and connectivity to destinations across the world.
Flights from Tashkent to Islamabad take around two hours, providing a fast and efficient link between the two capitals. One-way fares start at approximately $200, while round-trip tickets are available from $400, making this route one of the most affordable and time-saving options for business, education, and leisure travelers alike.
The embassy added that the “Tashkent–Lahore” route is equally attractive, with one-way fares from about $200 and round-trip fares from $400. All flights are operated on modern, comfortable aircraft, ensuring passengers enjoy world-class onboard service, professional crews, and the highest safety standards.
Tashkent International Airport, the airline’s primary hub, is strategically positioned at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, offering passengers efficient connections and a comfortable travel experience.
Beyond direct travel between Pakistan and Uzbekistan, the airport serves as a strategic transit hub, connecting travelers to over 50 international destinations across Europe, North America, the Middle East, East Asia and Southeast Asia.
Passengers flying via Tashkent can enjoy smooth transit connections to major global cities including Istanbul, Frankfurt, Paris, London, New York, Moscow, Dubai, Tokyo, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Baku, Astana, Batumi and many more.
According to the embassy, this extensive network makes Uzbekistan Airways an increasingly popular choice for Pakistani travelers seeking both regional and long-haul connections, combining competitive pricing with superior comfort and efficiency.
The embassy said that Uzbekistan and Pakistan share centuries-old historical, cultural and spiritual ties rooted in the heritage of the Silk Road and Islamic civilization. The enhanced air links will further strengthen tourism, trade and people-to-people exchanges between the two brotherly nations.
For Pakistani tourists, Uzbekistan offers a gateway to the legendary Silk Road cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva and Kokand.
The embassy added that Uzbek visitors are increasingly drawn to Pakistan’s diverse landscapes, historic landmarks and renowned hospitality.
Enhanced air links will make it easier for companies, students, and families to connect, while boosting mutual investment and tourism growth.

And their attacks on each other in television studios have become the only truth in town, so much so that when they do come together for the greater good, it is rarely noticed and even more rarely appreciated. Consider the moment some years ago when they all joined hands to give Gen Bajwa’s extension legal cover. It was for the greater good, few realised back then, as they were busy castigating the parliamentarians.
There was a similar moment in Punjab recently when everyone in the assembly came together to pass a resolution demanding local governments! Jointly sponsored by young MPAs from the PML-N and the PPP, the draft was so impressive that the PTI lot in parliament also voted for it. The two sides might be at war at the centre and elsewhere but in Punjab everyone was in the mood for love — with LGs.
And they have asked for LGs which are constitutionally protected, with defined tenures and responsibilities. It also asked that fresh elections be held within 90 days of the completion or dissolution of the LGs and for linking the provincial finance commission to the NFC.
Not only did the legislators come together to ask for this, the Speaker of the assembly, Malik Ahmed Khan, who has in the past been known not just for his generous defence of his party but also of Gen Bajwa, also took the time out to support the resolution in a press conference. According to a news report, he warned that the relationship between the state and the people weakens if there is no effective local governance. He also blamed successive governments for undermining the LG system and cautioned political parties against shortening LG terms for political convenience.

Why should one assume that legislators would pass a law with the same intent as a military despot?

What a slap in the face all this was for those who blame the politicians for being against LGs and disinterested in the needs of the people.
But it has been decades of socialisation against the political class. And the distrust is so high that it is hard to understand why these politicians who are concerned about LGs were also on board when the Punjab Assembly recently passed a law which seems to contradict the very principles they are so anxious about.
The new legislation was passed as recently as last month and is criticised for allowing the real power to lie with the provincial government and the bureaucracy. And what has received even more attention is that the new law provides for party-less LG elections — but only up to votes being cast and counted. After that, the footloose and fancy-free victors can join a political party within 30 days. But no more.
 
 

Those conditioned to distrust politicians point out that this is rather reminiscent of the elections held by Gen Ziaul Haq. Fearing a win by the PPP, he too held party-less elections in the hope that it would throw up a parliament he could control easily.
But this is a bit of a stretch. After all, why should anyone, however sceptical of politicians, assume that legislators would pass a law with the same intent as a military dictator? And secondly, who in their right mind would assume that elected politicians at present would behave the same way as their predecessors from 40 years ago? The world has changed since and so has Pakistan.
Indeed, if one has to provide a comparison with what happened 40 years ago, the 1985 assembly and the then prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo proved so troublesome that Zia was forced to let them go. But at present there are no such issues in these times of hybrid togetherness where the politicos and the establishment are singing ‘hum saath saath hain’.
Indeed, there is little reason to question this happily ever after. Which also appears to be rather organic. In fact, it is just a coincidence that the politicians in the Punjab Assembly discovered the importance and necessity of LGs at a time when Islamabad is abuzz (it has been for months) about the discussions in a nearby town about how to ‘fix’ governance and the economy. Would it simply require a rejigging of the NFC to address economic issues, or would there also be a need to address some governance matter by dividing the four provinces further?
Many argued that new provinces would prove to be too politically difficult and empowered LGs might be easier to ensure. And with all this talk of solutions came the rumour that the impending 27th constitutional amendment (which was simply a case of when rather than if) would be used to make more changes than just continue tweaking the judiciary.
However, no one really has any concrete answers at the moment and so far the government has insisted it is not working on any draft of a possible amendment. This is the answer more than one government minister has given during interviews. But an opposition member has set the proverbial cat among the pigeons; Kamran Murtaza, a JUI-F senator, has said during a talk show on television that the draft of the 27th amendment to the Constitution may be laid in parliament soon enough.
Oh dear! I seem to have digressed far from the matter at hand. The Punjab Assembly politicians care so much about the people that they want constitutionally protected LGs. A greater good that they all — PPP, PML-N and PTI — came together to ask for it. We the people should appreciate this grand gesture and not question it.
Postscript: As these lines were being written Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari posted on X that the PML-N has approached the PPP for support on the 27th amendment which addresses a number of matters including the NFC.

• Children up to 15 to be immunised as older kids now identified as key to transmission
• Drive to be extended to other high-risk urban centres, such as Karachi, Hyderabad
• Police rescue polio team detained at private school
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Health auth­orities in Punjab on Monday launched a massive Extended-Age Fractional IPV Campaign, aiming to vaccinate up to 2 million children with an injectable polio vaccine as part of a critical effort to eradicate the virus from its last reservoir in the region.
The campaign, which will run until Nov 12, targets children aged 4 months to 15 years, across 122 high-risk union councils (UCs) in Lahore.
Officials hope the drive will interrupt the transmission of poliovirus detected in the city’s environmental samples, a key step toward declaring the entire province polio-free.
The fractional inactivated polio vaccine (fIPV) campaign was formally launched by Punjab Minister for Health and Popu­lation Khwaja Imran Nazeer and Health & Pop­u­lation Department Secretary Nadia Saqib.
The initiative follows a recommendation from the global Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio, which identified that while children under 5 are mostly protected, the virus is now being spread by older, unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children.
“Our priority is to remain vigilant and continue building population immunity until transmission ends everywhere in Pakistan,” Mr Nazeer said at the launch ceremony. “Children who repeatedly miss vaccination remain our biggest vulnerability. Every single child must be vaccinated in every campaign.”
The campaign is a significant logistical undertaking, with approximately 10,848 frontline workers participating. This force includes 2,700 skilled vaccinators, 2,700 team assistants, 4,800 community mobilisers, 496 area in charges and 122 UC medical officers.
Former health minister Dr Nadeem Jan, while talking to Dawn, called the decision a positive step that should have been taken much earlier.
“IPV enhances individual protection of a child and further transmission of virus through child is stopped,” Mr Jan said. “Moreover it also saves child from chances of vaccine derived paralysis and keeps child safe.” He recommended that at least two or three similar rounds should be held in each targeted block to fully eradicate the virus.
Lahore is considered the only remaining polio reservoir in Punjab. According to a polio programme expert, DNA sampling indicates the virus circulating in Punjab has not travelled from other hotspot areas like southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“It has been decided to start with Laho­­re as if Lahore block will be cured the whole Punjab province will be declared polio free,” the expert said, noting that South KP remains a more problematic area.
The oral polio vaccine (OPV) remains in a child’s gut and stops the further spread of the virus, while the injectable polio vaccine (IPV) offers complete protection from infection. TAG suggested using IPV in reservoirs that were less severely affected.
Secretary Saqib emphasised that the fIPV provides an essential boost to immunity. “The fIPV provides an additional layer of protection by boosting immunity, especially where environmental virus detections are recorded,” she said.
She highlighted that Punjab has already conducted four national immunisation ca­­mpaigns this year.
However, the campaign faces significant challenges. Officials acknowledged there is resistance to injectable vaccines, similar to what was encountered during a recent HPV vaccine drive. There is also a limited supply of equipment, with only 4,000 specialised injectors available, each costing $500.
Following the Lahore campaign, similar drives are plan­ned for other high-risk ur­­ban blocks, including Karachi, Hydera­bad and Chaman.
Polio workers rescued
Separately, police on Monday rescued a group of female polio workers who were attacked and detained by staff at a private school in Gulberg Town, Lahore.
The health workers had arrived at the school in Union Council 31 to administer polio vaccines to children when the confrontation occurred.
The school’s management refused to allow the vaccinations and the workers were assaulted and locked in a room.
One of the workers sustained a head injury, and others were reportedly beaten when they attempted to help their colleague.
Video clips later emerged showing the women crying and pleading for help during the incident.
The police response was swift following the Punjab CM’s intervention, which included instructions to apprehend the suspects and pursue criminal charges.
Later, Misri Shah police filed a case against the school staff.

• Istanbul moot backs plans for Palestinians to take control of security, governance in besieged enclave
• Erdogan says Hamas committed to truce, urges Muslim states to lead reconstruction efforts
• FO denounces ceasefire violations, demands Israel’s withdrawal from Palestine
ISTANBUL: Foreign ministers from several Muslim states have backed a post-war framework where Palest­ine’s governance and security is ensured by Palestinians, as they stressed the importance of a UN mandate for the proposed task force for stabilisation in Gaza.
Turkiye wants to see a post-war framework for Gaza in which “Palestinians ensure Palestine’s governance and security,” Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters after a meeting in Istanbul involving Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Turkiye.
Brokered by US President Donald Trump, the October 10 ceasefire — which halted two years of continuous bloodshed — has been tested by fresh Israeli strikes in civilians in Gaza.
Mr Fidan said the taskforce that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire under a US-brokered deal needed a mandate defined by the UN Security Council and a framework for legitimacy, on the basis of which countries will decide whether to send soldiers to the enclave.
He said it was crucial that the emerging International Stabilisa­tion Force that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire under Trump’s plan, have a “mandate defined by a UN Security Council resolution and a framework for legitimacy”.
Washington is currently working with Arab and international partners to decide on the composition of the force, with Turkiye hoping to play a role, despite fierce opposition from Israel. “The countries we’ve spoken with say they will decide whether to send troops based on … the ISF’s mandate and authority,” he said.
It may be noted that top-level consultations are reportedly underway in Pakistan as well over the question of sending troops for the proposed Gaza force, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the UN umbrella.
“First, a general consensus needs to be reached on a draft, then it needs to be approved by the members of the Security Council.
“And it needs to be free from vetoes by any of the permanent (UNSC) members,” Mr Fidan said of a blocking move frequently used by key Israel ally Washington.
Israel has long viewed Turkey’s diplomatic overtures with suspicion over Ankara’s close ties with Hamas and adamantly opposes it joining the task force that is meant to take over after Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza.
“Our principle is that Palestinians should govern the Palestinians and ensure their own security, the international community should support this in the best possible way – diplomatically, institutionally and economically,” Mr Fidan said. “Nobody wants to see a new system of tutelage emerge,” he said.
“We’ve now reached an extremely critical stage: we do not want the genocide in Gaza to resume,” Mr Fidan added, saying all seven nations supported plans for the Palestinians to take control of Gaza’s security and governance.
Mr Fidan, who also held talks at the weekend with a Hamas delegation led by its chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, said the movement was “ready to hand Gaza to a committee of Palestinians”.
He also expressed hope that reconciliation efforts between Hamas and the rival West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, “will bear fruit as soon as possible,” saying inter-Palestinian unity would “strengthen Palestine’s representation in the international community”.
Hamas in compliance
Earlier on Monday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Hamas appeared committed to the truce, pointing the finger of blame at Israel.
“It seems Hamas is quite determined to adhere to the agreement while Israel’s record is very poor,” he told an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) gathering in Istanbul, saying Muslim states should play “a leading role” in Gaza’s recovery.
“At this point, we need to deliver more humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza and then begin reconstruction efforts. “The Israeli government is doing everything in its power to prevent this,” Mr Erdogan said.
He also urged Muslim states to play “a leading role” in Gaza’s recovery. “We believe the reconstruction plan prepared by the Arab League and the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) should be implemented immediately,” he said of the plan unveiled in March.
Ceasefire violations denounced
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, along with other “Arab-Islamic foreign ministers”, deliberated on the way forward for a lasting ceasefire and sustainable peace in Gaza.
 






“The leaders jointly called for urgent humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, condemned Israeli ceasefire violations, demanded Israel’s withdrawal from the Occupied Palestinian Territory and emphasised the rebuilding of Gaza,” the statement added.
“Pakistan reaffirmed its principled stance for the establishment of an independent, viable and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in line with the UN and OIC resolutions,” it said.

• Warns India against ‘false flag operation’ in deep waters
• Says decision to join Gaza peacekeeping force will be made by govt
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Monday adopted a tougher stance toward the Taliban regime ahead of the next round of talks in Istanbul, declaring that Pakistan’s only and non-negotiable demand is an end to terrorism emanating from Afghan territory.
“The conditions that Afghan Taliban keep putting forward are meaningless, what matters is the end of terrorism,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military’s spokesman, while briefing a group of journalists at Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“Pakistan has a one-point agenda: Afghan soil must not be used against us,” he asserted.
 
 

Gen Chaudhry’s remarks came as Islamabad prepares for the Nov 6 meeting in Turkiye, the next phase of negotiations following last month’s six-day talks in Istanbul between Pakistan and the Taliban regime.
Those talks, mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, produced a reaffirmation by both sides to ceasefire agreed in Doha and an agreement on establishing a monitoring and verification mechanism for cross-border terrorism, though implementation details remain unresolved.
Ahead of the upcoming Istanbul talks, Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah also held consultations with his negotiators, led by Mullah Najib, to deliberate on the next phase of dialogue with Pakistan, according to sources familiar with the discussions in Kandahar.
During his briefing, the military’s spokesperson highlighted that operations were underway against terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned TTP — with 1,667 terrorists killed.
Gen Chaudhry disclosed that 206 Afghan Taliban fighters and 112 TTP terrorists were killed during the recent border tensions.
Pointing to growing participation of Afghans in TTP and subsequent blurring of lines between the two groups, he said about 60 per cent of the terrorists killed during infiltration attempts in the last three to four months were Afghan nationals.
Afghan Tailban’s support to TTP
“The TTP is not a separate entity, it is a branch of the Afghan Taliban,” Gen Chaudhry observed, explaining that the outfit had sworn allegiance to the Taliban’s emir, “and we have clear evidence that the Taliban are settling TTP fighters in densely populated areas to provide them a protective shield”.
He added that while Pakistan continues efforts to settle matters peacefully with Afghanistan, “there can be no compromise on our security and sovereignty”.
The spokesman dismissed recent Taliban statements suggesting preconditions for dialogue, including demands that Pakistan end alleged support for the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP) and anti-Taliban propaganda. “Such conditions are meaningless. The only meaningful step is verifiable action against terrorists,” he said.
US drone operations
He categorically denied reports in “Afghan and Indian media” about a supposed secret US-Pakistan understanding allowing American drone operations in Afghanistan.
“This is fake news propagated by Zabihullah Mujahid,” the Taliban spokesman, he said. “Pakistan has not given permission to the US or any other country to use its territory for attacks inside Afghanistan. These claims are baseless propaganda.”
Pakistani officials view the Istanbul process as a test of the Taliban’s credibility. A senior security source said last week that Pakistan expects “credible evidence of action including dismantling of hideouts, disruption of logistical networks, and arrests of TTP leadership.”
False flag operation
The military spokesman warned that India was planning a “false flag” operation in the maritime domain to fabricate evidence of a major Pakistani strike or act of aggression, potentially triggering a new round of tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals.
Gen Chaudhry, citing intelligence reports, indicated India could stage the incident “in deep waters,” portraying it as a Pakistani attack to justify escalation and malign Islamabad internationally.
 
 

He said Pakistan’s armed forces were on “high alert” and would deliver a “far stronger, more decisive, and severe” response than in previous incidents if provoked.
Security observers say the military’s unusually pointed warning coincides with several converging developments that Pakistan views as provocative or politically timed including India’s Trishul exercise, Bihar state elections, and regional tensions.
Last Saturday, the government released a video confession by Ijaz Mallah, a fisherman from Sindh who had been detained by Indian forces in 2024. In the video, Malah claims he was coerced by India’s external intelligence agency, RAW, to engage in espionage-related activities in Pakistan.
ISPR officials cited the testimony as partial evidence of Indian maritime sabotage plans, connecting it to what they describe as a “covert Indian terror network” disrupted earlier this year.
Gaza peace force
The military spokesman said that any decision regarding the deployment of Pakistani troops to a proposed Gaza peacekeeping force would be made by the government and parliament.
His comments came amid reports that Pakistan is weighing a potential contribution of troops to an International Stabilization Force (ISF) for Gaza.
The proposed mission could also include disarmament and security enforcement tasks, which have drawn criticism from opposition parties. They argue the government has not held a full parliamentary debate and warn that participation without clear UN oversight could risk Pakistan’s complicity in coercive actions against Palestinians.

According to sources, hundreds of Umrah pilgrims were stranded at the Islamabad, Lahore and Kara­chi airports due to the delay in PIA flights scheduled for Saudi Arabia.
A spokesman for PIA said the Society of Aircraft Engineers had no legal status and alleged that the main aim of this movement was to sabotage PIA’s privatisation, which was in its final stages.
He warned that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he warned, adding that the management was obtaining alternative engineering services from other airlines to resume operations.

• Floods, border tensions fuel pressures
ISLAMABAD: Food items and energy spiked the inflation, measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI), to 6.24 per cent in October against 5.6pc in September, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported on Monday.
As a result, average inflation (CPI) in the first four months (July-October) of FY26 also moved up to 4.73pc when compared to the same period of last fiscal year. A month-on-month increase in CPI was reported at 1.83pc in October over September. Rural areas suffered the most due to rising prices as rural CPI was reported to have increased by 2.26pc in October while their urban compatriots faced 1.54pc increase in inflation.
The PBS said the 6.24pc increase for October was caused by an across-the-board rise in prices, except recreation and culture, which dropped by 3.7pc.
On the other hand, national prices of food and beverages (non-alcoholic) increased by 5.6pc, clothing and footwear by 8.07pc, housing, water, fuels and energy by 4.24pc, health 9.7pc, transport 6.7pc, education 10.6pc and other goods and services by 18.2pc.
Major food items that impacted the household expenses included 127pc increase in the prices of tomatoes, sugar (345pc), butter (30pc), wheat (23pc), honey (18pc), wheat flour (15.7pc), vegetable ghee (12.50pc) and pulse moong (12pc). The prices of non-food items which went up included gas charges (23pc), electrical appliances for personal use (13.59pc), footwear (12.67pc), newspapers (11.93pc), woollen ready-made garments (11.66pc), transport services (11pc), solid fuel (10.63pc) and education (10.41pc).
On the other hand, the prices of onions were down in October over October of last year by 33.82pc, chicken (29.08pc), pulse gram (27.28pc), besan (22.27pc), pulse mash (21.80pc), tea (17.75pc), gram whole (17.49pc), potatoes (17.12pc), pulse masoor (5.41pc), beans (4.88pc) and fresh vegetables (2.13pc). Also, the electricity rates were down 15.59pc in October when compared to the same month last year followed by textbooks (10.61pc) and liquefied hydrocarbons (1.72pc).
Major food items driving the price index in October over September included tomatoes (58.64pc), onions (18.71pc), fresh vegetables (12.22pc), wheat (10.51pc), wheat flour (5.49pc), eggs (4.22pc), fish (3.83pc), wheat products (2.61pc), fresh fruits (2.44pc), butter (2.21pc), vegetable ghee (1.91pc) and cooking oil (1.02pc). These kitchen items are major part of the household budgets. Food items have almost 35pc share in overall national price index.
On top of this, some non-food items contributing to the monthly price hike included electricity charges which went up by 8.78pc, postal services (6.1pc), transport services (2.93pc), house rent (1.46pc), dental services (1.19pc) and tailoring (1.14pc).
On the other hand, the key kitchen items whose prices eased in October compared to September included chicken (21.52pc), potatoes (2.36pc), beans (1.93pc), Besan (1.81pc), pulse gram (1.74pc), gram whole (0.78pc) and pulse masoor and moog down by 0.32pc and 0.20pc, respectively.
Floods, border tensions fuel prices
According to Reuters, the government last week forecast inflation in the 5 to 6 per cent range for October, noting that flood-related supply pressures and border closures with Afghanistan had pushed up prices of some essential goods. Floods in August swamped farmland and industrial hubs in Punjab, killing more than 1,000 people, displacing 2.5 million and damaging crops and factories, tightening food supplies across the country. The pressure was compounded by border clashes with Afghanistan that shut major crossings used for food and fuel trade. The two countries later agreed to extend a ceasefire, but crossings remained restricted after October 11, disrupting commerce and deepening shortages in Pakistan’s northwestern regions.
The central bank said the overall economic outlook had improved, with better-than-expected crop yields, stronger industrial activity and a rebound in high-frequency indicators, though risks from global commodity volatility and domestic energy prices remain.
A private survey, meanwhile, showed manufacturing activity contracted for a second straight month in October, though the pace of decline slowed.
The HBL Pakistan Manufacturing PMI rose to 49.6 from 48.0 in September, with firms citing weak demand, higher taxes and power outages as key drags, even as business confidence remained cautiously optimistic. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction.

Senior Professor Dr Zafar Nawaz Jaspal, being the acting VC chaired a meeting of deans, heads of departments and other concerned, before the summer break in which it was decided to get the hostels vacated from students aimed at removing illegal occupants.  
After a lot of resistance, police got the hostels vacated. Sources said when the hostel issue flared up there was a discussion in the WhatsApp group of the faculty members in which the acting VC in response to intervention of lawmakers termed them ill-informed [about the QAU issue].  
This led several senators to move a privilege motion in July this year as according to them the word “ill-informed” breached their privilege. Dr Jaspal has been stating that ill-informed is not a derogatory word, rather it means someone had less information of a certain issue. 

VC says none of my professors can mock any public representative; extends unconditional apology on behalf of professor

The agenda of the subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Rules and Procedure, which met on Monday, stated that besides others the meeting will “examine the derogatory remarks of acting VC of QAU wherein he termed the honourable senators ‘ill Informed.’” 
The subcommittee headed by Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan reviewed the derogatory remarks.  
During the meeting, the VC Dr Akhtar stated: “None of my professors can mock any public representative.” He extended an unconditional apology on behalf of Prof Jaspal.  
Dr Niaz requested the subcommittee to take lenient view regarding the instant case. The subcommittee disposed of the matter with instructions to maintain the sanctity of parliament and public representatives in future. 
Earlier, the committee while discussing the issues of QAU heard the VC and representatives of the students’ council and HEC. 
The discussion entailed university administration and operating of councils with political and religious influence. 
The convener of the committee said lawmakers would help addressing the administrative lacunas that were disrupting not only the university’s discipline but also damaging the sanctity of parliament. 
According to a press release issued by Senate, “the concerned Acting Vice Chancellor apologized in writing to the Standing Committee, a statement confirmed and read aloud by the Secretary Committee during the session.”   
Sources said Dr Jaspal did not attend the meeting; however, in previous meetings he had appeared and submitted his reply, stating: “The phrase ‘ill-informed’ the senators cited in the motion has regrettably been interrupted as derogatory. The phrase, as used in internal communication on an unofficial faculty Whatsapp account, referred explicitly to the lack of access to complete and updated information on the University’s internal decision and academic procedures.” In his three-page written reply, he said the language used in his internal message was “never meant to be derogatory. There was no intention whatsoever to offend or show disregard.” 
However, Senator Jan Mohammad was not satisfied with the reply of Professor Jaspal and stated that he had not apologised to the senators till date.  
The committee also discussed encroachment on the university land and alleged illegal stay of a number of students in hostels. 
Meanwhile, police officials informed the committee that FIRs had been registered against those selling drugs in surrounding areas of the university during last two years. They stated: “Ice, heroin and hashish had been recovered during various operations near the campus.” 
Interior Minister visits QAU 
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited QAU to participate in a Pashtun cultural event. He attended a traditional dance event organised by the Pashtun Council, where he joined the students in performing the traditional Attan dance.

The Punjab Regulari­sation of Service (Repeal) Ordinance 2025 was promulgated on Oct 31 to repeal the Punjab Regularisation of Service Act 2018 and it was tabled in the Punjab Assembly as the house convened on Monday. 
The reason behind the ordinance was that the provincial government intended to shift the mode of appointment from basic pay scale to a lump sum pay package so that the financial burden on the exchequer could be reduced which was borne by the government in the form of pensions.
By doing away with the 2018 law, the new ordinance, with immediate effect, has blocked the regularisation of services of contractual employees after four years in service.
The ordinance, however, protected all the decisions or actions taken under the repealed act, saying that “anything done or action taken under any provision of the repealed act, shall continue to have effect as if the said act had not been repealed”.

New recruitment to be made on ‘lump sum pay package’; ordinance laid in assembly for legislation three days after promulgation 

The Punjab Regularisation of Service Act 2018 had offered that any person appointed on contract, immediately before the commencement of the act, shall be deemed to have been validly appointed and such appointment shall not be called in question.
The repealed act stated that a contract employee, who has been continuously serving for a period of four years shall be eligible to be considered for appointment on a regular basis if a regular vacancy is allocated for initial recruitment, subject to the fact that the employee is qualified for the post and shows satisfactory performance.
The revoked law had also given a procedure for the regularisation of contractual employees. It required that a contract employee be recommended by a specifically constituted commission to the appointing authority for regularisation.
The repealed act had also given a complete framework for appointments, termination of contract, determination of seniority, pay fixation, option for regularisation, legal framework, appeal or review, rules, removal of difficulties and savings.
Under the new policy being envisaged in the new act to be legislated by the Punjab Assembly, departmental recruitments will be made on a lump-sum pay package instead of the basic pay scale. According to the decision, the employees recruited on contract will stay on the contract mode for the rest of their service. 
Officials say employees appointed on contract will not be entitled to a pension, as the move aims to reduce the financial burden on the provincial treasury caused by pension liabilities.
The ordinance caused some confusion as well about the fate of contractual employees appointed before the ordinance. 
Some officials said the new ordinance did not impact them, while others claimed this would also affect the regularisation of the existing employees.
Law Secretary Asif Bilal Lodhi did not respond despite multiple attempts while Regulations Secretary Mian Abrar Ahmed confirmed that the law was repealed but refused to share further details about the impact of the new ordinance despite repeated requests. 
A senior civil servant said the government should either offer regular job options or offer market-competitive salaries to its employees, adding that such a move would strengthen the quality of its human resources.

The PPP said earlier today that its coalition partner PML-N has officially sought its support for a proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment — the idea of which had been floated soon after the 26th Amendment. The development comes even as three dozen petitions challenging most of the 26th Amendment, which had also faced sizeable censure, are pending before the Supreme Court.
The proposals include setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, ending protection for provincial shares under the National Finance Commission and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces.
 
 

Addressing the situation in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Sanaullah said: “The speculations appear to be such and our media and senior anchors have [created] such a fear about the 27th Amendment as if a storm or disease is coming.”
He said constitutional amendments were always made to update a country’s constitution and make it effective and relevant as per the needs of the present.
Sanaullah further questioned which of the issues raised by the PPP had not already been under constant discussion.
Questioned about the sudden announcement of the proposed amendment by the PPP, he said: “The consultation you’re talking about … this is the start of that discussion which has been underway for the past two to four months. If Bilawal felt it appropriate to talk about this today, then that is his choice.”
He said the government would consult various stakeholders on the issue, but first it would make the amendments public after discussing them with its coalition partners.
The senior PML-N leader said there would be a full debate on the changes and there was nothing to worry about or fear in regards to democracy or any other matter.
Questioned whether the government intended to remove the condition for the opposition and treasury benches to agree on the nominee for the chief election commissioner, Sanaullah strongly rejected the suggestion and said this would not happen.
“The government has no intention for this,” he said.
He also reassured that “the government is not going to impose any calamity in the shape of the 27th Amendment. Whatever reservations are raised, there will be a debate on in a positive and sophisticated manner, no matter how long it takes.”
He stressed that any eventual amendment would be made after reaching a consensus.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said in an interview on GTV News show ‘G for Gharidah’ that the amendment was aimed at bringing education and population control back under federal control.
Changing stances
The government had last year passed the 26th Constitutional Amendment. It was passed by parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
Even though the 26th Amendment remains mired in controversy and faces challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad are abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to the insiders, will further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
In August, however, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said during a press conference that the country was “running well” and experiencing stability and economic improvement, adding that there was no need for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Bilawal had also previously dismissed talk of any potential legislation regarding a 27th Amendment as “baseless rumours”.
But, the ruling coalition now seems to be steering in a different direction.
The matter of the proposed legislation had reportedly come up during an Oct 27 meeting between Bilawal and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. The two leaders had met to discuss the prevailing political situation and formulate a joint strategy on key national issues.
JUI-F sources said that the focus of the discussion was to formulate a collective strategy related to new legislation and develop parliamentary cooperation between the PPP and the JUI-F. They claimed that Bilawal had stressed during the meeting the importance of the role of opposition parties in the upcoming legislation.
Meanwhile, opposition PTI has been criticising the proposed amendment.
In June, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) had also endorsed the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges. Speaking at a press conference, IHCBA President Syed Wajid Hussain Gilani had stated that the legal fraternity welcomed the 27th Amendment, which followed the precedent set by the 26th Constitution Amendment.</p><small>2025-11-03 19:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/032157479c3fb85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952945/29609-e-tickets-issued-since-system-inaugurated-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>29,609 e-tickets issued since system inaugurated in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>As many as 29,609 tickets have been issued for traffic rule violations since the newly implemented e-ticketing system was inaugurated in Karachi, according to data from the police.
Sindh Chief Minister inaugurated the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (TRACS), commonly known as the e-ticketing system, at the Central Police Office (CPO) last week.
He explained that the new system replaces the outdated manual ticketing process with a fully automated e-ticketing mechanism, utilising advanced AI-integrated CCTV cameras to detect violations such as speeding, red-light jumping, and helmet non-compliance.
Of the 29,609 tickets issued, 17,639 of them were issued to drivers not wearing a seatbelt, while 6,362 were issued to motorcyclists not wearing helmets, the data shows. Another 1,967 tickets were issued for speeding, while 1,655 were issued for running through red lights.
Meanwhile, 943 tickets were issued for using mobile phones while operating a vehicle and 298 were handed out for having tinted windows and glass. For parking in a ‘no-parking’ zone, 165 tickets were issued, while 162 were issued to motorists using the wrong side of the road; 44 tickets were handed to people going the wrong way on a one-way street.
Additionally, 152 motorists were ticketed for having passengers on the roof of their vehicle, and 91 others were caught violating stop lines. An additional 65 tickets were handed out due to lane line violations, with 44 tickets issued to vehicles carrying an improper load and 37 for being overloaded.
No tickets were issued for having “fancy number plates”, sudden lane changes or expired tax.
In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred.
The decision came amid Karachi witnessing a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to ban heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates.</p><small>2025-11-03 17:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/03221910c5fa3b6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952944/pti-imran-should-take-a-step-back-govt-should-create-space-for-engagement-fawad' target='_blank'><strong>PTI, Imran should ‘take a step back’; govt should create space for engagement: Fawad</strong></a><br><p>Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said on Monday that both the government and the PTI, along with Imran Khan, need to show flexibility in order to create space for engagement to decrease the political friction in the country.
Fawad is one of the three former PTI leaders who say they have been engaging with the party’s incarcerated leadership to put an end to politics of confrontation as part of their political outreach initiative.
They also visited PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, after he was taken to a hospital in Lahore from prison, on Thursday, to convince him to join their campaign.
“I’ve said this from the first day, the government should move one step forward and the PTI and Imran Khan should move back one step so space is created,” said the former PTI leader while speaking during an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘News Wise’.
He maintained that both sides would have to decide on the need to bring down the temperature, warning that if the PTI did not pursue engagement and talks, it would face similar treatment as the disbanding and ban on the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan.
“The government needs this, because whatever international successes they have gained are not translating into Pakistan … so both sides need the temperature to come down. We think the leaders of Lahore should play the role of a pivot and take this forward.”
Chaudhry added that the immediate need was to lower the political temperature, saying talks could not proceed if both sides could not even bear to see each other.
Defending his former party’s obstinacy against engagement in talks, he said it was also due to the behaviour of the government, which had made a policy of “crushing and sidelining” the opposition.
“The two ruling parties, the establishment and the PTI, are the four big players and the political temperature between them should come down. How will that happen? …you will have to give the leadership in Lahore’s jail the chance to talk to Imran Khan.”
He further said that the establishment and the government needed to decide whether the country needed a reduction in political temperature or not. “I am very hopeful they have this view too.”
Referring to the group’s recent activities, Chaudhry said they had a meeting of at least 45 minutes with Qureshi.
He added that the proposal being carried by the group was not even their own, instead pointing to a letter by incarcerated PTI leaders in Lahore earlier this year, which called for a reduction in political friction and encouraged engagement.
Chaudhry was not without criticism for the government, saying it had backed the PTI into a corner. “If you don’t engage with the PTI, the only way forward it has is to protest,” he said.
The former federal minister added that in such a situation, the PTI could lead a protest to Islamabad and resign from the National Assembly, while the government would attempt to impose governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which would be resisted by the party.
 
 

“Another event like November 26, 2024, will happen, and as a result of this, the tensions and political temperature in Pakistan will increase. The problem right now is that, we the people, living in Pakistan are being severely impacted by this,” he said, adding that the group had requested the incarcerated PTI leaders in Lahore that if there was no implementation of their earlier recommendation, it would lead to great loss for both the party and the government.
He also said the fact that the group was allowed to meet the incarcerated PTI leadership in Kot Lakpat jail was an encouraging sign.
“Senior government ministers called me and appreciated the effort,” he said, pointing to Information Minister Attaullah Tarar’s welcoming of the development in particular.
“Senior PTI leadership also called and said that this is the only way.”</p><small>2025-11-03 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0321374534a7c9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952943/lhc-expresses-displeasure-at-anti-smog-measures-lack-of-enforcement' target='_blank'><strong>LHC expresses displeasure at anti-smog measures, lack of enforcement</strong></a><br><p>The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday expressed its displeasure at the city administration’s lack of action to counter smog and pollution, questioning the use of anti-smog guns and tree cutting in the metropolis.
Last Wednesday, Lahore ranked as the most polluted city in the world in terms of air quality, according to global monitor IQAir. As of today, it still leads the world in terms of poor air quality, registering an air quality index (AQI) reading of 259, which the monitor considers very unhealthy.
 
 

The Punjab government has tried numerous methods to reduce the smog, including limiting citizens’ time moving in the city, fining industrial units and brick kilns causing pollution and using ‘anti-smog guns’ to fire tiny droplets of water into the air, cleaning dust and other particulates.
According to a Dawn correspondent present during the hearing, LHC Justice Shahid Karim summoned the Director General of the Punjab Environment Protection Department, Hamid Sheikh, and questioned why trees are being cut down, despite a court order prohibiting it.
Justice Karim also heard petitions on poor air quality. A lawyer representing the Lahore Parks and Horticultural Authority (PHA) noted that a case has been registered since a banyan tree was felled within the limits of the Cantonment board.
“It is not possible to reverse the damage caused by tree cutting, nor is there anyone to stop it,” the petitioner’s counsel argued.
The government’s lawyer argued that winds from India had caused air quality to plummet, to which the petitioner’s lawyer rebutted that there is no evidence to back up the claim.
Afterward, the court heard the case on smog remediation and Justice Karim expressed concern over increasing pollution and displeasure over the failure to enforce new working hours for restaurants, also questioning the use of anti-smog guns.
Additionally, the court summoned Lahore Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza on November 4, also ordering action against smoke-emitting vehicles and hinting at holding a smog remediation hearing on a daily basis.
“These court proceedings are not against any one person, but aim to guide and assist the government,” the judge stated. “This court has been working on smog remediation for the past seven years. Had you read the previous orders, you would know what work we are doing here.
“Instead of blaming others, we need to resolve the situation ourselves,” he added.</p><small>2025-11-03 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031718052d4ebbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952930/pakistan-has-re-established-itself-as-respected-voice-in-regional-intl-forums-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan has re-established itself as respected voice in regional, int’l forums: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that Pakistan had successfully re-established itself as a respected voice in regional and international forums due to the efforts of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“Through the prime minister’s sustained diplomatic outreach, Pakistan has successfully re-established itself as a respected voice in regional and international forums, from the United Nations and SCO to OIC and the World Economic Forum,” said the defence minister while addressing a seminar organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Islamabad.
He said the government’s current diplomacy reflected a “confident and forward-looking” Pakistan that engaged constructively, built bridges and believed in the power of partnerships.
“These achievements reaffirm a simple truth. When guided by clarity of purpose, coherence of policy and continuity of engagement, Pakistan’s diplomacy becomes its strongest national asset. Ladies and gentlemen, our journey of diplomacy is far from over. The progress we have made is both tangible and inspiring.
“Pakistan’s foreign policy is once again being recognised for its maturity, balance and forward direction.”
Asif added that at the core of Pakistan’s renewed diplomatic activism lay economic diplomacy, guided by the prime minister’s “vision of transforming foreign knowledge”.
The defence minister also lauded the vital role of Pakistan’s ambassadors in diplomatic missions abroad.
“Our envoys have been at the forefront of advancing Pakistan’s vision of global engagement and an economically connected Pakistan. Their tireless efforts in strengthening bilateral ties, facilitating investment, promoting trade and projecting Pakistan’s positive image have significantly contributed to our recent diplomatic success.”
Reiterating the foreign policy successes, he said relations with Saudi Arabia had entered a “new era of mutual confidence and economic cooperation” after the prime minister’s recent engagements reinvigorated strategic cooperation and opened pathways to multi-billion dollar investments in diverse sectors.
He said relations with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates had also deepened, adding that both had expressed interest in expanding their economic footprint in Pakistan.
 
 

With the United States, Asif said Pakistan continues to build a “broad-based and balanced partnership”, adding that recent diplomatic engagements emphasised cooperation in trade, technology, climate resilience and counter-terrorism, along with reaffirming Pakistan’s “constructive role as a bridge between regions and interests”.
The relationship with China, he said, remained an “anchor of regional peace and prosperity”. Asif further said the deepening cooperation with China symbolised a shared vision for connectivity and inclusive growth.
The defence minister added that the outreach to Central Asian republics also represented another “milestone in our diplomacy”.
He said that through active engagement, the prime minister has advanced Pakistan’s role as a gateway for trade and energy transit between Central and South Asia.
“Projects like CASA-1000, TAPI and proposed Trans-Afghan Railway underscore our commitment to regional connectivity, economic integration and shared prosperity.
“In the broader Muslim world, Pakistan has actively sought to revitalise ties with Iran, Turkiye and Egypt. These engagements are grounded in shared faith, mutual respect and collective aspirations for peace and development. Our deepening cooperation with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation further amplifies Pakistan’s diplomatic voice on issues such as Islamophobia, Palestinian rights and humanitarian relief in Gaza and Afghanistan,” he said.
On his first visit to the US in February after the Trump administration took office, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar boasted that Pakistan had broken its diplomatic isolation through active diplomacy, and called for sweeping global reforms and strengthening the UN to create a more inclusive international order.
In remarks made on separate occasions, Dar said Pakistan was no longer isolated in the global community, adding that the country’s economy was set to take off as a result of his government’s hard work.</p><small>2025-11-03 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/03210030f37648f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952942/at-least-three-terrorists-killed-in-separate-operations-across-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>At least three terrorists killed in separate operations across KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>At least three terrorists were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Monday.
“Movement of a group of khwarij, opposite general area Esham, North Waziristan District, who were trying to infiltrate through Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was picked up by the security forces.”
The military’s media wing said troops effecttively engaged the group of khawarij. “As a result of precise and skillful engagement, two khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell.”
In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
The ISPR added that one of the terrorists killed was identified as Qasim, and Afghan national who was serving in the Afghan Border Police.
In another intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s Tank district, security forces killed another terrorist, identified as Ikramuddin aka Abu Dajana, also an Afghan national.
“These incidents reveal continued involvement of Afghan nationals in numerous terrorist activities against innocent civilians and security forces inside Pakistan.”
“Pakistan has repeatedly been asking Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border and is expected to fulfil its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by Khwarij and involvement of its citizens in terrorism inside Pakistan,” said the ISPR.
The statement added that the security forces of Pakistan remain “resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers”. A sanitisation operation was launched in the area to eliminate any “other Indian sponsored Kharji”.
Last week, the deputy chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Amjad alias Mazahim, was killed in an IBO.
According to ISPR, Amjad was a deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p><small>2025-11-03 16:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/03193841aeb7c06.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952938/fearing-fraud-canada-rejects-most-indian-study-permit-applicants' target='_blank'><strong>Fearing fraud, Canada rejects most Indian study permit applicants</strong></a><br><p>Canada’s clampdown on international students has hit applicants from India particularly hard, government data shows, as what was once a preferred destination loses its allure for Indian students.
Canada lowered the number of international student permits it issues for the second year in a row in early 2025 as part of a broader effort to reduce the number of temporary migrants and address fraud related to student visas.
About 74 per cent of Indian applications for permits to study at Canadian post-secondary institutions in August — the most recent month available — were rejected, compared to about 32pc in August 2023, according to immigration department data provided to Reuters.
By contrast, about 40pc of study permit applications overall in each of those months were refused. About 24pc of Chinese study permits in August 2025 were rejected.
The number of Indian applicants has dropped as well, from 20,900 in August 2023 — when Indians formed just over one quarter of all applicants — to 4,515 in August 2025.
India has been Canada’s top source of international students over the past decade. In August, it also had the highest study-permit refusal rate of any country with more than 1,000 approved applicants.
The spike in refusals of would-be students comes as Canada and India seek to mend ties after more than a year of tension.
Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of involvement in the 2023 murder of a Canadian in Surrey, British Columbia. India has repeatedly denied the allegations.
An effort to crack down on fraud
In 2023, Canadian authorities uncovered nearly 1,550 study permit applications linked to fraudulent letters of acceptance, most of which originated from India, Canada’s immigration department told Reuters in an email.
Last year, its beefed-up verification system detected more than 14,000 potentially fraudulent letters of acceptance from all applicants, it said.
Canada has implemented enhanced verification for international students and has increased its financial requirements for applicants, the immigration department spokesperson said.
The Indian embassy in Ottawa said the rejection of study permit applications from students in India had come to its attention, but that the issuance of study permits is Canada’s prerogative.
“However, we would like to emphasise that some of the best quality students available in the world are from India, and Canadian institutions have in the past greatly benefited from the talent and academic excellence of these students,” the embassy said in a statement.
Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand told Reuters during an October visit to India that Canada’s government is concerned about the integrity of its immigration system but wants to continue having Indian students in Canada.
A drop in Indian enrolment
People who work with would-be international students say they are seeing a higher level of applicant scrutiny.
Michael Pietrocarlo of Border Pass, which helps people apply for Canadian visas, said his firm prepares applicants to show their eligibility beyond what’s required on paper.
He says, for example, when students must demonstrate they have sufficient funds to support themselves, “it’s not enough just to say, ‘Here are some bank statements.’ They may have to go the extra mile and say, ‘Here’s where the money came from.’”
The University of Waterloo, home to Canada’s largest engineering school, has seen a two-thirds decline in the number of students from India entering its undergraduate and graduate programs over the past three to four years.
Ian VanderBurgh, its associate vice president of strategic enrolment management, said the drop was largely due to a government cap on foreign student visas and had altered the composition of the student body.
“We pride ourselves on being an international university,” he said.
The University of Regina and the University of Saskatchewan have also reported a decline in the number of Indian students enrolled.
When Jaspreet Singh, who founded the International Sikh Students Association, came to Canada from India in 2015 to study mechanical engineering, he remembers government posters exhorting newcomers to “Study, work, stay” in the country. That attitude has soured, he said.
Singh is not surprised at the higher rejection rate for Indian study permit applicants, saying he knows fraud is a concern.
But as it becomes harder to get permanent residency or a job in Canada, he says some of those recently rejected appear to not mind: “They are happy they didn’t come.”</p><small>2025-11-03 14:51</small></div><hr>
