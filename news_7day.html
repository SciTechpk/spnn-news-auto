Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the explosion took place on the top floor of Bismillah Residency near Hyderi Market in Block-E of North Nazimabad at Sehri time.
The sound of the explosion was heard miles away.
He said that two flats caught fire as a result of the explosion, leading to the death of a 15-year-old while another four people were injured.
The spokesperson added that four fire tenders were being employed to extinguish the fire while a snorkel had also been called.
He adding that the exact nature of the explosion would be ascertained after the fire was brought under control, but said that it could be a gas-related explosion.
Meanwhile, an Edhi Foundation spokesperson in a statement said the injured also included a 70-year-old man and a four-year-old girl. The injured sustained serious burn injuries and were rushed to the burns centre of Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.
Central District police also issued a statement, saying that after receiving information about the incident, police immediately rushed to the spot and called the rescue and fire brigade services.
The statement added that evidence was being collected to ascertain the cause of the explosion.
The incident comes days after at least 15 people, including women and children, were killed, and 18 others were injured after a gas explosion caused part of a residential building to collapse in Karachi’s Soldier Bazaar area.
The incident occurred at a residence in the Gul Rana Colony area of Soldier Bazaar.

“We held a peaceful sit-in for five days, but unfortunately some people behaved senselessly,” the chief minister said, adding that his party did not want to politicise the health of PTI founder Imran Khan; otherwise, it could have taken a different course of action.
Addressing a ceremony after administering the oath to the newly elected body of the Peshawar Press Club at the Chief Minister’s House, Mr Afridi said the world knew his party was the largest political force with the biggest street movement, yet its democratic protest was mishandled and Mr Khan was denied access to his personal physician.

 

“Mr Khan has sought a meeting with his personal doctors. Matters are moving in the wrong direction, and no one will be able to stop us if we give a call,” he said, adding that continued refusal to grant access would be dangerous for both the government and the country.

Claims peaceful five-day sit-in mishandled; warns continued refusal poses risks for govt and country

The CM claimed that when Mr Khan was prime minister, he allowed former premier Nawaz Sharif to travel abroad for medical treatment despite reservations abo­ut his medical reports, alleging that Mr Sharif later returned after three years.

 

He said that federal ministers had acknowledged Mr Khan’s eye condition and that the apex court had ordered proper treatment, which was never provided. He added that his leader had been shot yet was still summoned for court cases, while the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who had left the country, was facilitated with biometric verification at the airport.
Mr Afridi told media persons that his government welcomed constructive criticism, unlike other provinces where, he alleged, journalists were picked up over minor issues.
He added that he faced what he termed a media trial after allocating Rs4 billion for victims of Tirah Valley, while questioning why there was silence over the alleged purchase of an aircraft worth Rs11 billion by the Punjab government.
He claimed that while Pakistan was seeking IMF support to run its economy, alleged embezzlement of Rs5,300bn highlighted in reports had not received due attention.
Earlier, Special Assistant to the CM for Information and Public Relations Shafi Jan said journalism was a pillar of the state.
President-elect of the Peshawar Press Club, M. Riaz, said the club symbolised democratic values and human rights and held annual elections regularly.

UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar has cautioned that the deepening liquidity crisis at the United Nations is significantly undermining peacekeeping operations, reinforcing urgent concerns previously raised by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
Antonio Guterres earlier this month warned that the United Nations could face an “imminent financial collapse” unless member states pay their dues fully and on time, or reform budget rules that require the organization to return unspent funds despite cash shortages.
Ambassador Iftikhar speaking at the opening of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, said funding shortages are undermining mandate implementation, civilian protection, violence deterrence, and the safety of peacekeepers.
He stressed that UN peacekeeping remains vital to international peace and security but is facing mounting political, operational, and financial pressures that demand collective action.
Highlighting Pakistan’s longstanding role, he noted that the country hosts the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan and has been among the largest troop contributors for over six decades. He paid tribute to 182 fallen Pakistani peacekeepers and said more than 250,000 Pakistanis have served in 48 UN missions across four continents.
Meanwhile, Pakistan reaffirmed its opposition to adding new permanent members to the UN Security Council, arguing that doing so would increase the 15-member body’s dysfunction and violate the principle of sovereign equality.
Speaking at a resumed session of the long-running Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) aimed at reforming the Security Council, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said that the demand for individual permanent membership runs counter to the agreed principles of reform.
As part of the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group, he said Pakistan advocates expanding only non-permanent, elected seats to enhance democratic representation and ensure “reform for all, privilege for none.”
Full-scale negotiations to reform the Security Council began in the General Assembly in February 2009, focusing on five key areas: categories of membership, the question of the veto, regional representation, the size of an enlarged Council, and the Council’s working methods and relationship with the General Assembly.
Progress toward restructuring the Council remains blocked as the G-4 countries — India, Brazil, Germany, and Japan — continue to push for permanent seats, while the Italy/Pakistan-led UfC group opposes any additional permanent members. arguing that it would create “new centres of privilege”.
As a compromise, the UfC has proposed creating a new category of members — not permanent members — with longer terms and the possibility to re-election.
The Security Council currently comprises five permanent members — United Kingdom, China, France, Russia, and the United States — and 10 non-permanent members elected to two-year terms.
The IGN framework aims to make the Council more representative, effective, and accountable.
In his remarks, the Pakistani envoy emphasised that the campaign for individual permanent membership cannot serve as the basis for reform governed by agreed principles.
He said the overwhelming majority of UN member states recognize that permanent membership and the veto lie at the core of the Council’s paralysis and inaction over the years.
“For them, this is not a peripheral concern; it is the central fault line that undermines the Council’s credibility and effectiveness,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad said.
“At a time when the multilateral system is under extreme stress and there are calls for a UN that is fit for purpose, the demand for special privileges must have no place in these discussions.”
Highlighting Pakistan’s consistent position, he said, adding new permanent members would not neutralise the “inordinate” influence of the existing permanent members; rather, it would risk entrenching and expanding it.
“Two wrongs cannot make a right, and a larger oligarchy is no antidote to an elite power club,” the Pakistani envoy remarked.

Some observers view the visit as a “message of displeasure” to the ruling PML-N, while others see it as preparation for early general elections.
Amid media reports suggesting the possible release of Mr Khan from jail, Mr Zardari’s aggressive tone is also being seen as an attempt to block such a move.
Although the president, as head of state, should remain apolitical, Mr Zardari has often acted otherwise. As the PPP supremo, he acts as a shield for the party against political odds and offensives.
Mr Zardari has just completed his visit to Punjab, where he stepped up his political engagements by holding several public meetings with PPP provincial leaders.
In a series of public addresses, he criticised Mr Khan, saying the jailed PTI leader should face imprisonment “like a man” and should not order his party leaders and workers to block roads. “He has served less than two years of imprisonment and is exhausted. In fact, [one realises what jail] actually is after two years of imprisonment,” he said. He added that leaders like Mr Khan had never made sacrifices and always made tall claims to [mislead] the public.

South Punjab’s visit sparks speculations of early polls

Political analysts believe these engagements are more than routine activities of a head of state and have some objectives behind them.
A senior PPP leader, who did not want to be named, said Mr Zardari’s remarks carried weight amid media reports that a deal was being struck between the PTI founder and the establishment for his early release.
However, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar rejected such reports on Thursday, stating on X that there was “neither any deal nor any leniency for Imran”.
He added that any impression of government concessions to the ex-premier was “entirely false and misleading”.







Mr Khan, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case. He was also convicted months ago in a case related to state gifts and faces pending trials linked to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The minister’s clarification followed remarks by Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah, who said efforts had been made to find a solution but Mr Khan was not ready for any “deal”.
The PPP leader suggested that Mr Zardari’s visit to Punjab and outburst against Mr Khan might have been intended to block any move for the PTI founder’s release.
“However, the remarks backfired, drawing strong criticism from the PTI’s social media brigade,” he added. He also said there was a strong possibility of early general elections and that Mr Zardari might be laying conducive groundwork for his son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, for a key position in the next regime.
“Some political circles believe elections could be held by the end of this year or early next year. Mr Zardari may be trying to dent the PML-N in its Punjab stronghold.”
Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) president, Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, said sadly apolitical offices in the country — the presidency and governorships — have remained political.
“Not only the president but governors often prioritise party affiliations and safeguard their parties’ interests,” he said.
Although the PPP was part of the ruling set-up holding key offices such as the presidency, governorships and Senate chairmanship, he said, Mr Zardari’s visit to Punjab, a PML-N stronghold, was significant, particularly after his recent expression of mistrust in the government and his return of several parliamentary bills without assent.
“I think the president’s visit to Punjab is a message to the PML-N that the PPP is unhappy with government decisions and policies. The PPP has already complained that it was not taken on board in decision-making,” Mr Mehboob added.
A source close to Mr Zardari said politics could not be separated from his personality, as he simultaneously held the offices of president and PPP co-chairman. The source said there was no specific agenda behind the Punjab visit, adding that Mr Zardari only sought to strengthen the party in the province.
“The president is of the view that political activities usually remain slow during Ramazan and that is why he visited Punjab to meet party leaders and workers there.” He dismissed the possibility of early elections or Mr Khan’s release, saying Mr Zardari’s outburst was a response to remarks by some PTI leaders against his daughter, First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari.
The source said the president was keen to strengthen the PPP in Punjab and reach out to other parties and groups.
“A recent statement by Jahangir Tareen (Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party leader), suggesting the PPP could be his next political destination after the [next] general elections, is ‘quite significant’,” he added.

Islamabad has shared “irrefutable and concrete evidence of Indian sponsorship of terrorism and terrorist groups operating in Pakistan from across our borders,” said Tahir Abdrabi, spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a recent press briefing.
The warning comes as Nikhil Gupta, an American citizen, formally stands convicted in a US federal court after a Manhattan judge accepted his guilty plea in a murder-for-hire conspiracy targeting Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh activist living in New York.
The case carries a maximum prison exposure of 40 years.

Observers say conviction confirms Indian plot to kill Sikh activist, but it does not resolve broader diplomatic questions of ‘state responsibility’

Under US law, a conviction occurs once a judge accepts a guilty plea after determining it was made knowingly, voluntarily, and with a factual basis. In Gupta’s case, the finding of guilt is final; only sentencing remains. His hearing is scheduled for May 29, with prosecutors calculating an advisory sentencing range of 235 to 293 months (roughly 19 to 24 years).
Gupta admitted to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. US officials have emphasised the broader implications.
A US Department of Justice state­­ment said the assassination plot was initiated by an Indian government employee, identified in reports as former Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) officer Vikash Yadav.
FBI Assistant Director James C. Barnacle, Jr., added that Gupta acted at the “direction and coordination of an Indian government employee,” facilitating a “foreign adversary’s unlawful effort to silence a vocal critic of the Indian government.”
When the case first appeared in the media in November 2023, then-Senator and Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin described it as “a foiled assassination plot against a US citizen involving Indian government officials,” highlighting the need to examine how governments attempt to silence dissidents abroad.
While US lawmakers have not publicly commented on Gupta’s conviction, reports indicate interest in assessing whether the plot reflects a systemic pattern or a limited operation. Intelligence cooperation between Washington and New Delhi could see subtle recalibrations in sensitive channels, while the Trump administration is expected to use the case as a warning against extraterritorial targeting on American soil.
Diplomatic observers in Washington note that the case will likely influence “intelligence sharing, law-enforcement coordination, and visa or security vetting in sensitive areas,” rather than immediately prompting public sanctions or a breakdown in relations.
The case also remains linked to the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada, an episode that strained Ottawa-New Delhi relations and drew attention from the United States and other Five Eyes partners. Together, the two incidents have positioned India in Western security discourse as a country accused of targeting dissidents abroad.
While Gupta’s conviction confirms the plot, it does not resolve broader diplomatic questions of state responsibility, the observers noted.
Those issues are expected to be addressed through intelligence channels, congressional oversight, and private diplomatic engagement — the quiet processes through which Washington balances law enforcement red lines with strategic partnerships central to its Asia policy.
In that sense, the case is no longer just about the criminal act itself, but about how the United States chooses to translate a conviction into long-term norms governing the conduct of both allies and adversaries.

Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday, where the envoy asserted that Israel’s borders are based on the Bible when questioned about the country’s current boundaries.
In response, Carlson noted that the biblical verse included the region between the Euphrates River in Iraq and the Nile in Egypt. To this, Huckabee, who is a staunch pro-Israel conservative, said, “It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all”.
In a joint-statement issued today, the foreign ministers of countries including Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Indonesia, Kuwait, Oman, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, along with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the League of Arab States (LAS), and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), expressed “profound concern” regarding Huckabee’s statement.







“They affirm their countries’ categorical rejection of such dangerous and inflammatory remarks, which constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region,” the statement said.
The joint statement stressed that Huckabee’s remarks were in contradiction of “the vision put forward by US President Donald Trump, as well as the Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict, which are based on containing escalation and creating a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state.”
It stressed that Trump’s plan was “grounded in promoting tolerance and peaceful coexistence, and that remarks seeking to legitimise control over the lands of others undermine these objectives, fuel tensions, and constitute incitement rather than advancing peace.”
The countries maintained that Israel held “no sovereignty whatsoever over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands.”
“They reiterated their firm rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank or separate it from the Gaza Strip, their strong opposition to the expansion of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and their categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states,” the statement read.
The ministers also warned against the “continuation of Israel’s expansionist policies,” stating that the “unlawful measures will only inflame violence and conflict in the region and undermine the prospects for peace”.
They called for “an end to these incendiary statements.”
The statement further underscored the countries’ “steadfast commitment to the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of their independent state along the lines of June 4 1967, and the end of the occupation of all Arab lands.”</p><small>2026-02-22 03:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699a2c0ca54db.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974898/iran-demands-evidence-amid-us-claims-of-tens-of-thousands-of-deaths' target='_blank'><strong>Iran demands evidence amid US claims of tens of thousands of deaths</strong></a><br><p>• Trump tells reporters 32,000 killed during last month’s nationwide protests; UN expert puts toll at 20,000• Pezeshkian says Tehran will not bow to pressure as threat of war looms large
TEHRAN: The Iranian government has demanded evidence after the US President Donald Trump told reporters that 32,000 people were killed during last month’s nationwide protests in the Islamic Republic, Al Jazeera reported on Saturday.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the government released a list of 3,117 people, including about 200 security personnel, whom he described as “victims of recent terrorist operation”.
“If anyone disputes accuracy of our data, please share any evidence,” the diplomat, who has previously stated that 690 people on the list were “terrorists” armed and funded by the US and Israel, wrote on X.







His comments came as the threat of war looms increasingly large over the country and potentially the region, with Serbia on Saturday becoming the latest country to call on all its citizens to immediately leave Iran.
‘20,000 civilians’
Mai Sato, UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, has said more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed, but information remains limited amid heavy internet filtering by the state, six weeks after a nationwide communications blackout was imposed.
The US-based HRANA says it has documented more than 7,000 people killed during the nationwide protests, and is investigating nearly 12,000 more cases.
Sato was among 30 special rapporteurs and international human rights experts who signed a joint statement on Friday calling on Iranian authorities to fully disclose the fate and whereabouts of tens of thousands arrested, forcibly disappeared or missing in the aftermath of the nationwide protests, and to halt all related death sentences and executions.
‘Iran will not bow to pressure’
Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that his country would not bow its head to pressure from world powers amid nuclear talks with the United States, Reuters reported.
“World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads … but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us,” Pezeshkian said in a speech carried live by state TV.
On the other hand, the Iranian foreign minister has also been speaking with multiple US media outlets to advocate for a “fair” agreement with Washington over Iran’s nuclear programme.
The comments come after President Trump said he was considering a limited strike on Iran after ordering a major naval build-up in the Middle East aimed at pressuring Tehran to reach a deal to curb its nuclear programme.
The latest warning came after Iran’s foreign minister said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready within days, following negotiations between the two sides in Geneva earlier this week.
Trump had suggested on Thursday that “bad things” would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, a deadline he later extended to 15 days.
Asked by a reporter on Friday whether he was contemplating a limited military strike, Trump replied: “The most I can say — I am considering it.”
As part of the military build-up, the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford was seen entering the Mediterranean Sea on Friday, transiting the Strait of Gibraltar, after being ordered to the region by Trump.
Washington had already deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln and escort warships to the Gulf in January.

The prime minister’s spe­cial aircraft touched down at Luton Airport, after which he travelled to his residence in the British capital.
Sources said he would remain in London for two days before leaving for Pakistan on Monday. He is accompanied on the visit by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Federal Information Minister Atta Tarar.
The premier had travelled to the United States at President Trump’s invitation to participate in the high-level gathering foc­u­sed on Gaza and broader peace efforts. Addressing the gathering in Washington, PM Shehbaz stressed the need to end ceasefire violations in Gaza, calling it “very important” for achieving long lasting peace in the war-torn territory. “The people of Palestine have long endured illegal occupation and immense suffering,” he said, adding that protecting lives and advancing reconstruction required strict adherence to the ceasefire.
He emphasised that Palestinians must exercise full control over their land and future in line with UN Security Council resolutions, and called for a credible pathway to self-determination through the establishment of an independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine.
Earlier, Mr Tarar shared a video on social media in which President Trump praised PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Asim Munir.

• Calls blocking ID cards as unreasonable as cutting off water or electricity
• Says courts shouldn’t curtail basic rights
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court ruled on Saturday that a judgement debtor’s Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) cannot be blocked as a mode of executing a money decree, declaring that such a practice is beyond the jurisdiction of executing courts.
A two-judge bench, headed by Justice Munib Akhtar and including Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, made the decision after hearing an appeal from Agha Abid Majeed Khan, who had challenged an Aug. 1, 2023, ruling by the Sindh High Court that rejected his plea.
In a three-page order authored by Justice Akhtar, the Supreme Court observed that a CNIC is not a luxury or a mere statutory requirement.
“In these times it has become essential to being able to carry on a normal way of life in the ordinary course,” the judgement said.
Petitioner Agha Abid was a judgement debtor in a summary chapter suit where a decree was passed in favour of respondent Idrees Ahmed. During execution proceedings initiated by the decree holder, the executing court ordered the blocking of Mr Abid’s CNIC until he furnished surety for the decretal amount.
Consequently, the petitioner approached the high court through a revision petition. It was dismissed on Aug 1, 2023, with an observation that blocking a CNIC was “a step towards execution of lawful orders”.
The lower court had noted that the litigation between the parties had been pending observation that blocking a CNIC was “a step towards execution of lawful orders”.
The lower court had noted that the litigation between the parties had been pending since 2012 and the judgement and decree had remained unexecutable since March 29, 2016.
However, the Supreme Court cautioned against a “muscular” approach, observing that Section 51 of the Code of Civil Procedure sets out different modes for executing a decree.
The final clause (e) allows the decree to be executed “in such other manner as the nature of the relief granted may require”. While this clause confers the necessary flexibility to enable the executing court to ensure that a decree is satisfied, the Supreme Court observed that it cannot obviously be stretched to the point where the order made in execution loses all contact with the statutory provision.
In the case at hand, the decree is simply a money decree on a summary chapter suit, Justice Akhtar noted, adding that the court was not at all satisfied that such a decree would require or make permissible execution by blocking the CNIC of the judgement debtor by resort to Section 51(e).
“One might as well then allow the executing court to order the blocking of utilities like electricity, water, etc., from the residence or workplace of a judgement debtor for execution of a money decree,” the judge observed.
While a robust approach should certainly be taken to ensure execution, it cannot be so muscular — especially in the exercise of a general power conferred by clause (e) — that it essentially deprives the judgement debtor of an essential aspect of living, the judgement continued.
To curtail a judgement debtor from this is not the proper exercise of discretion or statutory powers, as the high court erroneously concluded, Justice Akhtar emphasised.
During the hearing, an Additional Attorney General had drawn the attention of the court to a 2018 amendment in which Order 21, Rule 117 was added: “The modes of compelling the judgement debtor for his attendance or for completing the execution proceedings may include blockage of his CNIC.”
Justice Akhtar noted that the rule may apply in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but not in Sindh, from where the present proceedings arose.
While concluding, the Supreme Court converted the petition into an appeal and allowed it while setting aside the orders of both the executing court and SHC.

Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The action was taken, “in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan, including Imam Bargah at Islamabad, one each in Bajaur and Bannu, followed by another incident today in Bannu during the holy month of Ramazan,” the information ministry’s statement said.
“Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij on behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers. Responsibilities for these attacks were also claimed by Afghanistan-based Pakistani Taliban belonging to Fitna al Khwarij (FAK) and their affiliates, and Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP),” the statement said.

 

The statement asserted that “Pakistan has always strived for maintaining peace and stability in the region, but at the same time, the safety and security of our citizens remains our top priority”, adding that the action against the seven camps and hideouts was “a retributive response”, carried out based on “intelligence-based selective targeting”.
“Despite repeated efforts by Pakistan to urge the Afghan Taliban Regime to take verifiable measures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the statement noted.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates [that the] Interim Afghan Government […] fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost. Pakistan also expects the international community to play a positive and constructive role by urging the Taliban regime to stand by its commitments as part of [the] Doha Agreement to deny use of its soil against other countries; an act vital for regional and global peace and security,” the statement added.
Souring relations
There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded.
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire.
Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast.

 

Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault.
Then, on Saturday, Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district.
In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”.
“This clearly indicates that they have no link with Islam,” the ISPR declared.
On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable.
Not the first time
In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR.
The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.</p><small>2026-02-21 22:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2121274450219ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974820/effective-immediately-trump-announces-hike-in-us-global-tariff-rate-from-10pc-to-15pc' target='_blank'><strong>‘Effective immediately’: Trump announces hike in US global tariff rate from 10pc to 15pc</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he is raising the worldwide tariffs on goods entering the United States from 10 per cent to 15pc “effective immediately,” a day after the Supreme Court largely struck down his sweeping duties.
Trump had immediately announced a 10pc  across-the-board tariff on Friday after the court’s decision, which found the president had exceeded his authority when he imposed an array of higher rates under an economic emergency law.
The new levies are grounded in a separate law, known as Section 122, that allows tariffs up to 15pc but requires congressional approval to extend them after 150 days.
Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Friday’s “extraordinarily anti-American decision” by the court to rein in his tariff programme, the administration was hiking the import levies “to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15pc level”.







“During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again — GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE,” he said in his post.
On Friday, the conservative-majority US Supreme Court ruled the emergency powers law — International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — “does not authorise the President to impose tariffs”, marking Trump’s biggest defeat at the SC since returning to the White House last year.
While hard-hit Canada welcomed the ruling, pointing out the levies were always “unjustified”, other US trading partners, particularly European powers, were cautious in their response, with the United Kingdom, Germany and the European Union stating that they were in contact with the Trump administration and analysing the court decision “carefully”.
Trump has leveraged tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a key economic and foreign policy tool. They have been central to a global trade war that Trump initiated after he began his second term as president, one that has alienated trading partners, affected financial markets and caused global economic uncertainty.
Trump’s tariffs were forecast to generate over the next decade trillions of dollars in revenue for the United States, which possesses the world’s largest economy.
However, Trump’s administration has not provided tariff collection data since Dec 14, 2025.</p><small>2026-02-21 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21205752247ce6d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974819/inaugural-board-of-peace-meeting-comes-under-discussion-during-call-between-dar-azerbaijan-foreign-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Inaugural Board of Peace meeting comes under discussion during call between Dar, Azerbaijan foreign minister</strong></a><br><p>The inaugural Board of Peace meeting came under discussion during a phone call between Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Azerbaijan’s Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov.
In a post on the social media platform X, the Foreign Office said DPM Dar spoke to Bayramov while in London.
“The two leaders discussed bilateral cooperation, regional and international developments, including the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington, which they both attended,” the FO said.







Both countries are among the founding members of the Board of Peace, which came together after the Trump administration, teaming up with Qatar and Egypt, negotiated a ceasefire in October to halt two years of devastating Israeli onslaught in Gaza.
The plan’s second phase calls for the disarmament of Hamas. US President Donald Trump on Thursday promised $10 billion and five Muslim-majority nations  — Morocco, Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Kosovo — offered funding and troops for Gaza at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the meeting had stressed the need for an end to ceasefire violations in Gaza, saying that it was “very important” for long-lasting peace in the war-torn Strip.</p><small>2026-02-21 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21192115b7ab6c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974812/england-captain-brook-says-a-shame-if-pakistan-players-snubbed-for-hundred-competition' target='_blank'><strong>England captain Brook says a ‘shame’ if Pakistan players snubbed for Hundred competition</strong></a><br><p>England captain Harry Brook said on Saturday that it would be “a shame” if Pakistani players were shut out of England’s domestic white-ball Hundred competition by Indian-owned franchises.
Former England skipper Michael Vaughan on Friday urged the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to “act fast” on BBC reports that Pakistani players will be “overlooked” in the player auction next month.
Ahead of England’s opening Super Eights clash against Sri Lanka in Kandy on Sunday, Brook — who will play for Indian-owned Sunrisers Leeds in the Hundred this year — was asked about the issue.
“Our main focus now is what’s coming up in the T20 World Cup. It’s not really any of our business, to be honest,” said Brook.
“But what I would say is Pakistan have been a great cricket nation for many years.”
Long-standing political tensions between India and Pakistan have led to the border rivals only playing each other in international cricket events.
Their Colombo showdown at the ongoing T20 World Cup only went ahead after Pakistan called off a threatened boycott.
“I think there’s about 50, 60 players in the auction, and it would be a shame to not see some of them in there,” said Brook.
“There’s some amazing cricketers and, yeah, and they bring some great crowds as well.
“So it would be a shame to not see some of the Pakistan players in there and make the tournament and competition even better.”
The newly renamed Sunrisers Leeds is owned by Indian conglomerate Sun Group, one of the four of the eight Hundred franchises with connections to the Indian Premier League (IPL).
The others are Manchester Super Giants, Southern Brave and MI London.
It has been claimed that politics has also led to an effective ban on Pakistani players participating in the Indian Premier League since 2009.
The ECB has been unable to substantiate the BBC allegations, but former England captain Vaughan called for the governing body to investigate the issue thoroughly.
Vaughan referred to the ECB’s stated aim of cricket becoming the most inclusive sport in the country.
“The ECB need to act fast on this… they own the league and this should not be allowed to happen… the most inclusive sport in the country is not one that allows this to happen,” Vaughan posted on X.







An ECB spokesman said: “The Hundred welcomes men’s and women’s players from all over the world and we would expect the eight teams to reflect that.”
Only two Pakistan internationals — Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim — appeared in last year’s Hundred, the final edition before new investors became involved.</p><small>2026-02-21 15:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21161650de6ed87.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974792/ctd-claims-arrest-of-suspected-female-suicide-bomber-in-di-khan-operation' target='_blank'><strong>CTD claims arrest of suspected female suicide bomber in DI Khan operation</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) police claimed to have averted a major incident after arresting a suspected female suicide bomber during a raid in the Sheikh Yousaf Khema Basti area of Dera Ismail Khan, officials said on Saturday.
According to a CTD spokesperson, the Dera region received intelligence regarding the presence of a young woman allegedly linked to a banned outfit and preparing for a suicide attack. Acting on the tip-off, a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team conducted a raid at the specified location.
Officials said the suspect, identified only by the initial “Z”, was taken into custody after preliminary questioning. During interrogation, she allegedly disclosed that she had remained under the training of a militant commander, identified as Shah Wali alias Tariq Kochi, who is reportedly deceased.
The suspect further claimed that she had recently consented to carry out a suicide attack and that a suicide vest and target were to be provided by another militant commander identified as Asim, police said.
During the search, officials recovered a bag containing a pistol with ammunition, two mobile phones allegedly used for contact with members of the banned organisation, a power bank, and other items.
Police also claimed that a perfume bottle was recovered, allegedly intended to mask the smell of explosives.
The suspect has been formally arrested and shifted for further investigation.
Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed commended the CTD team for the operation and announced a cash reward for the officials involved.
Further investigation is underway to verify the suspect’s claims and trace her alleged handlers.
“Across the province, indiscriminate operations will continue to crush terrorists’ evil intentions, prevent all forms of terrorism, and ensure full implementation of a zero-tolerance policy against anti-state elements,” said the CTD statement.
Last week, four police personnel, including an SHO, embraced martyrdom and two officials sustained injuries in a terrorist ambush in the district.
On January 23, five people, including a peace committee leader, were killed, while 10 others were injured in an explosion — said to be a suicide attack — during a wedding ceremony in DI Khan district.</p><small>2026-02-21 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2119435824040d7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974811/kidnapping-case-registered-against-unidentified-suspects-after-canadian-national-reportedly-goes-missing-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Kidnapping case registered against unidentified suspects after Canadian national reportedly goes missing in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Police on Saturday registered a kidnapping case against unidentified suspects after a Canadian national pursuing doctoral research allegedly went missing in Lahore three days ago.
A police station in Defence Housing Authority registered the case under kidnapping charges on the complaint of Yousif Rasheed, a friend of the Canadian citizen who has been identified as Hamza Ahmad.
According to the first information report (FIR), Ahmad arrived in Pakistan on February 13 to work on his PhD thesis and was staying with his friend in DHA Phase 10.
The complainant stated that Ahmad had booked a cab and left the home between 1am and 2am on February 19 but did not return. He said that the friends searched for Ahmad on their own but were unable to trace his whereabouts.
The FIR stated that unknown persons may have kidnapped Ahmed, requesting legal action against those responsible.
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran confirmed to Dawn that a kidnapping case had been registered against unidentified suspects and that efforts were under way to recover the Canadian national.
“At this stage, we do not know who might have kidnapped Ahmad or whether he went missing under other circumstances,” the DIG said, adding that police were making all-out efforts to trace him.
He said the motive behind the alleged kidnapping was also unknown, adding the investigation was ongoing and that further developments would be shared as the search progressed.
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed grave concern over the incident.
In a post on X, the commission stated that it was deeply troubled by reports that Ahmed had “gone missing” while conducting “field research” in Pakistan.
“Colleagues in Lahore have alleged that he was abducted by unidentified persons on February 19,” it said.







The commission urged authorities to “immediately” trace his whereabouts and ensure his safe recovery and return home.
Academics, political activists and social media users also expressed concerns over the alleged abduction.
In a social media post on X, political activist Ammar Ali Jan stated that he had recently met Ahmad in Lahore.







He described him as a PhD scholar from Canada working on anti-imperialist politics and said, “Yesterday, Hamza was abducted in Lahore. This regime is waging a relentless attack on dissent.”
The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also commented on the matter on X, saying that “the right to pursue academic research and express scholarly views is fundamental in a democratic society”.
It added that “silencing researchers through harassment or forced absence undermines intellectual freedom and weakens institutions”, and that Ahmad “deserves fairness, safety, and the opportunity to continue his academic work without fear”.</p><small>2026-02-21 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/211856074fd90ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974798/integral-inseparable-part-of-province-sindh-assembly-passes-resolution-against-creation-of-karachi-province' target='_blank'><strong>‘Integral, inseparable part of province’: Sindh Assembly passes resolution against creation of Karachi province</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Saturday passed a resolution declaring Karachi an “inseparable part” of the province and opposing any move that suggested otherwise.
The resolution, tabled by CM Murad and passed with a majority, stated that the House “unequivocally condemns and rejects any conspiracy aimed at the division of Sindh or the creation of a separate province comprising Karachi”.
“Karachi is, and shall forever remain, an integral and inseparable part of Sindh,” it declared.
The chief minister’s move comes after the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has repeatedly called for the Centre’s intervention in Karachi, demanding that the metropolis be made a “federal territory”.



The resolution urged “all political stakeholders to refrain from divisive rhetoric or actions that threaten provincial harmony and national cohesion”.
It reaffirmed that the “unity, territorial integrity, and historic identity of Sindh are sacred trusts inherited from our forefathers and shall be defended through constitutional, democratic, and political means”.
The resolution stated that the Sindh Assembly stood “united — beyond party lines — in defence of Sindh’s integrity, dignity, and unbroken legacy”.
Lone Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) MPA Muhammad Farooq, and PTI’s Shabbir Qureshi and Sajjad Soomro supported the resolution, while MQM-P leaders voted against it.
In their speeches, the MQM-P members contended that the resolution contradicted the Constitution.
The MQM-P and the PPP have been engaged in a war of words since the deadly Gul Plaza inferno, trading blame over improper governance during the tenure of their respective party mayors.
Earlier this week, MQM-P’s Mustafa Kamal — also the federal health minister — criticised the provincial administration for what he described as systemic neglect of Karachi’s residents.
Responding to the opposition’s debate regarding the resolution, CM Murad categorically rejected claims that the resolution was unconstitutional, challenging opponents to identify even a single point that violated the law.
He pointed out the “shifting” stance of the MQM-P, recalling that the House had passed a similar unanimous resolution against the division of Sindh in 2019, and at that time, MQM-P stood in support.
“The members of MQM cannot play on both sides of the fence,” he remarked.
On the opposition’s grievance regarding mentions of the governor, the chief minister clarified that the resolution itself did not mention the governor by name.
“If a member takes the governor’s name, you may expunge it from the proceedings; it has nothing to do with the resolution,” Murad stated. However, he noted that a meeting regarding such matters did indeed take place at the Governor’s House.
Rejecting the opposition’s claim that they “smell something fishy” behind the resolution, the Sindh CM retorted, “You say you smell something [fishy], but I smell something from your conduct.”
Murad condemns ‘division’ rhetoric
Speaking on the floor of the assembly after tabling the resolution, CM Murad said no one could divide Karachi or separate it from Sindh.
“Karachi is an inseparable part of Sindh,” the chief minister added.
He affirmed that the Sindh Assembly would uphold provincial unity and solidarity, as well as protect the province.







Referring to opinions suggesting Karachi be made into a province separate from Sindh, CM Murad said: “I condemn all these statements.”
The chief minister contended that the “enemies” of Pakistan had launched a campaign to divide the country’s people. “Whoever believes in Pakistan will support this resolution,” he said.
The chief minister noted it was for the two-thirds majority of the Sindh Assembly to decide if any move to create a new province was attempted.
He also invoked the slogan “Pakistan Khappay”, raised by Asif Ali Zardari, emphasising that the PPP stands for national unity and federalism.
“PPP will never go against Pakistan’s integrity. It is you who speak of dividing Pakistan,” he said in a pointed rebuttal to critics.
He recalled that a similar resolution had been passed by the Sindh Assembly in 1994, emphasising that this was “not the first time” the province had resisted attempts to undermine its unity.
He pointed out that when Karachi was declared the capital in 1948, the country did not yet have a constitution, arguing that constitutional clarity today leaves no room for “unilateral” decisions.







Without naming any political party, Murad said the resolution targeted no individual but urged members to read it carefully and raise objections, if any, through democratic debate.
“Opposing this resolution would amount to supporting the division of Sindh,” he remarked.
Concluding his speech, CM Murad declared: “Even the thought, dream or idea of breaking Sindh will never succeed.”
‘Sindh has collectively contributed to building Karachi’
The resolution detailed Sindh’s history as a province, including it being the first province to “pass the resolution in favour of Pakistan, reflecting its longstanding commitment to federalism, democracy, and national unity”.
It highlighted that the framers of the 1973 Constitution “reaffirmed the federal structure of the country and explicitly provided under Article 239 that no alteration of provincial boundaries shall take place without the consent of more than two-third members of the concerned provincial assembly”.
“The sons and daughters of Sindh — from Karachi to Ketibundar, from Kashmore to Karoonjhar — have collectively contributed to building Karachi into the economic engine of Pakistan, symbolising unity in diversity rather than division,” the resolution noted.

 

It pointed out: “Karachi, historically known as Kolachi, emerged from the soil of Sindh and evolved as its principal port, commercial heart, and gateway to the world — nurtured by the land, labour, and collective spirit of the people of Sindh — and despite serving as the first capital of Pakistan after independence in 1947, remained geographically, historically, and emotionally inseparable from Sindh.”
The resolution cautioned, “Any attempt to divide Sindh, fragment its territory, or detach Karachi from Sindh is contrary to history, constitutional spirit, democratic norms and the deeply held sentiments of the people of Sindh, and would undermine national cohesion and the federal compact.”
It recalled that the people of Sindh resisted the imposition of the One Unit scheme in 1955, which dissolved historic provinces into an artificial administrative structure, and that the “restoration of Sindh in 1970 stands as enduring testimony to the unwavering resolve of its people to safeguard their province”.

 

Noting that Sindh was one of the world’s oldest living civilisations, the resolution highlighted that it was a province “whose identity, language, and cultural continuity predate modern political boundaries and have endured invasions, empires, and colonial rule”.</p><small>2026-02-21 14:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/211240286450c9c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974779/sindh-govt-reinstates-dig-pir-muhammad-shah-as-chief-of-karachi-traffic-police' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt reinstates DIG Pir Muhammad Shah as chief of Karachi Traffic Police</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government reinstated Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Pir Muhammad Shah as the chief of the Karachi Traffic Police, it emerged on Saturday.

Shaikh was transferred and posted as the new traffic police chief after the government removed Shah as the chief of Karachi traffic police at the end of January.
While last month’s notification was silent about the reasons behind DIG Shah’s removal, informed sources told Dawn that Inspector General of Police (IGP) Javed Alam Odho had sought an explanation from him regarding allegations of “misuse of authority” in the registration of a case in Hyderabad last year, allegedly on his instructions.
Dawn reached out to the Sindh home minister and the provincial police chief for comments on whether the allegations of misuse of authority against Shah had proven to be false.

In a press release, ISPR said a security forces’ convoy was “targeted by Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij” while an IBO was being conducted on the reported presence of terrorists, including a suicide bomber.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The military’s media wing added that five terrorists were also killed during the operation.
“A vehicle-borne suicide bomber was intercepted by the leading group, foiling his nefarious design to target innocent civilians/law enforcement personnel in Bannu City, averting major catastrophe,” the ISPR stated.
It added that the terrorists were located during the operation and after an “intense fire exchange, five khwarij were sent to hell by the security forces”.
The statement added: “However, in desperation, khwarij rammed the explosive-laden vehicle into one of the vehicles of the leading group.”
Resultantly, 43-year-old Lt Colonel Shahzada Gul Faraz, hailing from Mansehra, whom the ISPR described as a “brave commanding officer renowned for his daring actions, who was leading his troops from the front”, and 28-year-old Sepoy Karamat Shah from Peshawar, embraced martyrdom.
In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”.
“This clearly indicates that they have no link with Islam,” the ISPR declared.

 

It also noted that the “Afghan Taliban Regime has yet again failed to stop the khwarij from use of Afghan soil for terrorist activities inside Pakistan, that too in the holy month of Ramazan”.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted.
The military’s media wing added that the counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan “will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
“Such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further reinforce our unwavering commitment [to] safeguarding our nation at all costs,” the military affirmed.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, strongly condemned the “cowardly terrorist attack” and expressed grief over the martyrdoms.
“The supreme sacrifice of the martyrs is the nation’s asset,” President Zardari was quoted as saying.
Conveying his condolences to the martyrs’ families, the president said: “We aim to continue the operations against Fitna al Khawarij indiscriminately and with full force. There will be no compromise on the public’s protection.”
“The terrorists violating the sanctity of the month of Ramazan have no relation with Islam,” he added.







Similarly, in his statement reported by state-run APP, PM Shehbaz stressed that the terrorist act carried out by Fitna al Khawarij during Ramazan was “proof that terrorists had no religion”.
The prime minister commended the security forces for “foiling the nefarious designs of Fitna al Khwarij” by eliminating five terrorists, acting swiftly, and “saving the city from major destruction”.
Noting the security forces were achieving “major success” under the Azm-i-Istehkam vision, the premier reaffirmed that the state was determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country.
Concerns over usage of Afghan soil amid terrorism resurgence
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack, prompting targeted operations.
Islamabad has also raised concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan.

 

It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks.
Earlier this week, Pakistan issued a demarche to the Taliban regime over the use of Afghan soil for a terrorist attack on security forces in KP’s Bajaur that martyred 11 soldiers.
Pakistan had also issued a demarche to Afghanistan in late December, over its failure to rein in terrorist organisations ope­r­ating from Afghan soil, after a deadly attack on a military camp in North Waziristan.</p><small>2026-02-21 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2111362379ff111.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974778/youth-abducted-released-after-filming-viral-cricket-video-of-aina-wazir-in-north-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Youth abducted, released after filming viral cricket video of Aina Wazir in North Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: A youth from North Waziristan who was reportedly abducted by unidentified individuals for sharing a viral video showing a young girl playing cricket in the region was released, it emerged on Saturday.
A viral video showing young cricketer Aina Wazir bowling in North Waziristan drew widespread attention on mainstream and social media. However, the abduction of the young man who filmed and shared the clip on social media triggered concern across the region.
According to local police, the man, Zafran Wazir, was allegedly abducted by unidentified individuals from the Shewa subdivision of the district.
During his captivity, a video circulated on social media in which he termed sharing the cricket clip his “mistake” and stated that he was in the custody of unknown persons.
In the same video, the abductors claimed that recording and circulating footage of a minor girl playing cricket was “against Islam and Pashtun traditions”.
Following efforts by local tribal elders through a jirga, Zafran was safely recovered and returned home. Residents welcomed him warmly, placing garlands around his neck, with videos of the reception also circulating online.
District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Hussain confirmed that the youth had safely reunited with his family and said investigations into the incident were underway.
Eight-year-old Aina’s passion for cricket had already been a subject of discussion in the region. Her viral video caught the attention of the owner of the Pakistan Super League franchise Peshawar Zalmi, Javed Afridi, who said that “talent like this deserves the right platform”.
In a post on X, Afridi said that she would be part of the upcoming Zalmi Women League — a platform for girls to “play, inspire, and express their talents”.
“We will ensure she is provided with all necessary cricket equipment and proper facilities so she gets the opportunity she truly deserves to grow and shine and become the next Saira Jabeen,” he said.







The video had also captured the attention of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who said on X, “It is truly heartening to witness such extraordinary raw talent emerging from our soil, a powerful reminder of the immense potential within our youth.”
He said he hoped to see Aina receive the encouragement, training, and institutional support she deserved so her talent “can be fully refined”.







Aina, in response, pledged to work hard to play for the women’s cricket team and expressed special gratitude to Afridi for including her in the Zalmi Women League, calling it the “biggest moment” of her life.</p><small>2026-02-21 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/211711408edae2d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974797/pakistan-us-express-desire-to-enhance-economic-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US express desire to enhance economic cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the United States on Saturday expressed the desire to enhance economic cooperation, especially in the fields of trade and investment, according to the finance ministry.
In a post on the social media platform X, the ministry said that a delegation led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met US Commerce Secretary Howard A. Lutnick in Washington.
It said that finance minister was accompanied by the commerce secretary, Pakistan’s ambassador to US, and trade and economic ministers.
“Both sides expressed the desire to enhance our economic cooperation, especially in the fields of trade and investment, besides discussing the USA’s interest in investing in fields of information and communication technology, mining, minerals and energy,” the ministry said.







According to the ministry, Aurangzeb appreciated the role of the US Chamber of Commerce in organising the US-Pakistan Trade and Investment Forum, which will take place on March 31 and will be attended by renowned companies and ministerial representation from both countries.
He expressed the hope that the office of the US commerce secretary would also participate in the forum, the ministry said.
“Both sides reiterated their commitment to further their engagements on investments in major projects in the coming months,” it concluded.

The case was registered on Nov 9, 2025, by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016, following allegations that the KP CM made false and defamatory claims against state institutions.
This is the fourth time the court has issued non-bailable arrest warrants for the KP chief minister in this case, with two issued in January and another on February 10.
As during a previous hearing, Senior Civil Judge Muhammad Abbas Shah today ordered the immediate arrest and production of CM Afridi, noting that the latter had consistently ignored multiple summons and remained absent without any lawful justification.
The court then adjourned the hearing until March 9.
During the January 28 hearing, the court had termed Afridi’s persistent non-appearance a deliberate attempt to evade the legal process and emphasised that he had been given multiple opportunities to appear and respond to the allegations.
According to the first information report (FIR), the case stems from remarks made by CM Afridi during a media interaction outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail three days prior.
He had allegedly accused security forces of bringing dogs inside mosques in KP and tying them there — an accusation widely condemned for allegedly violating the sanctity of holy places.

 

Following an inquiry conducted on November 8, authorities concluded that CM Afridi and others had “knowingly and deliberately, with mala fide intentions and ulterior motives”, made false, misleading, and intimidating statements against state institutions.
The FIR contended that the video contained “offensive, profane, false, misleading and unfounded allegations” intended to malign and defame state institutions and harm their reputation.
Investigators had alleged that the content formed part of an organised campaign to undermine public trust in state institutions, incite unrest, promote racial hatred and destabilise national security.
The investigating team has further accused Afridi of preparing and circulating fake content on social media with the intention to incite violence, create panic and promote anti-state sentiments deemed harmful to Pakistan’s security and stability.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21154309de0ddb2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974782/ji-chief-terms-govt-participation-in-trumps-board-of-peace-meeting-on-gaza-unacceptable' target='_blank'><strong>JI chief terms govt participation in Trump’s Board of Peace meeting on Gaza ‘unacceptable’</strong></a><br><p>Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman on Saturday criticised the government for participating in the Boa­rd of Peace’s (BoP) first meeting over Gaza, terming it “unacceptable”.
His remarks came after the inaugural BoP meeting on Thursday in Washington, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the peacemaking efforts of United States President Donald Trump, who is heading the forum.
Addressing the media in Lahore, the JI leader said it was “unacceptable at any cost” to ignore the country’s long-established policy on the Palestine issue.
He emphasised that since the time of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan’s policy had remained clear and that any deviation from it would be intolerable.
Rehman also opposed any plan to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) envisioned under Trump’s 20-point plan.
He argued that the matter concerned Gaza’s internal affairs and should be handled only by local Palestinian police and security forces rather than foreign troops.

 

However, Pakistan was not named among the five nations that committed troops for the proposed ISF, which is tasked with securing reconstruction zones and supporting a post-conflict governance arrangement in Gaza.
Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi has said Islamabad had clearly outlined its “red lines”, stating that Pakistan could consider participation in a peacekeeping mandate but would not be part of any disarmament or demilitarisation mission.
The JI chief also expressed scepticism over Trump’s statements about Hamas’s disarmament, questioning how Pakistan could reconcile participation in any such framework with its official stance.
“You will go there under whose command?” Rehman asked.
“When you do not speak openly against America or President Trump even while sitting here, how will forces placed under their command raise their voice against Israel or the United States?”
He maintained that there was no need for Pakistan to become part of the ISF planned for the Palestinian enclave.

 

In a post on X, the JI’s official account said: “The government’s decision to join the so-called Trump peace board without consulting Parliament, the cabinet, or key stakeholders is unacceptable.
“Participation in a board that includes Israel and profiteers of human suffering undermines national dignity and deviates from national policy.”
The JI stressed that Pakistan should instead advocate for the Palestinian cause at the United Nations and “expose the repeated use of veto power by the United States to shield Israel from accountability for the genocide in Gaza”.







Earlier this week, Trump pledged $10 billion for Gaza’s reconstruction and brought together representatives of several Muslim-majority countries that offered funding and troops for a proposed ISF.
According to officials at the meeting, Morocco announced it was ready to send police personnel and officers to the nascent force.
The ISF’s American commander, Major General Jasper Jeffers, said that Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Kosovo had also pledged troops.
Indonesia earlier indicated it was prepared to contribute up to 8,000 personnel — nearly half of the 20,000 troops reportedly being sought.

 

The initiative follows a ceasefire negotiated in October by the Trump administration in coordination with Qatar and Egypt, aimed at halting two years of Israeli bombardment in Gaza.
The second phase of the plan calls for the disarmament of Hamas — a proposal that has drawn mixed reactions from regional stakeholders.
While Trump expressed hope that the use of force to disarm Hamas would not be necessary, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas would be disarmed “one way or the other”.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21162629cb7c4d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974794/india-brazil-ink-critical-minerals-deal-as-modi-lula-meet-in-new-delhi' target='_blank'><strong>India, Brazil ink critical minerals deal as Modi, Lula meet in New Delhi</strong></a><br><p>India and Brazil agreed to boost cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after talks in New Delhi with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
“The agreement on critical minerals and rare earths [is] a major step towards building resilient supply chains,” Modi said.
Brazil has the world’s second-largest reserves of critical minerals, which are used in everything from electric vehicles, solar panels and smartphones to jet engines and guided missiles.
India, seeking to cut its dependence on top exporter China, has been expanding domestic production and recycling while scouting for new suppliers.







“Increasing investments and cooperation in matters of renewable energies and critical minerals is at the core of the pioneering agreement that we have signed today,” Lula said.
The details of the deal were not immediately available.
Nine other agreements and memoranda of understanding were finalised on Saturday, the foreign ministry’s spokesman said, touching on digital cooperation, health, entrepreneurship and other fields.
“Brazil is India’s largest trade partner in Latin America. We are committed to taking our bilateral trade beyond $20 billion in the coming five years,” Modi said.
“Our trade is not just a figure, but a reflection of trust.”







Lula, who arrived in New Delhi on Wednesday for a summit on artificial intelligence, is accompanied by a delegation of more than a dozen ministers as well as business leaders.
On Saturday, he was given a ceremonial welcome and paid his tributes to India’s independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, before going into the meeting with Modi.



With China holding a near-monopoly on rare earths production, some countries are seeking alternative sources.
Rishabh Jain, an expert with the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank, said India’s growing cooperation with Brazil on critical minerals complements recent supply chain engagements with the United States, France and the European Union.
While these partnerships grant India access to advanced technologies, finance and high-end processing capabilities, “Global South alliances are critical for securing diversified, on-ground resource access and shaping emerging rules of global trade”, Jain told AFP.

‘New momentum’
India, the world’s most populous nation, is the 10th largest market for Brazilian exports, with bilateral trade topping $15 billion in 2025.
Key Brazilian exports to India include sugar, crude oil, vegetable oils, cotton and iron ore.
Demand for iron ore has been driven by rapid infrastructure expansion and industrial growth in India, which is on track to become the world’s fourth-largest economy.
India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said he was confident that Lula’s talks with Modi “will impart a new momentum to our ties”.







Modi said that “our cooperation in the defence sector is also continuously growing,” hailing a “win-win partnership”.
“When India and Brazil work together, the voice of Global South becomes stronger and more confident.”
Brazilian firms are also expanding in the country, with Embraer and Adani Group announcing plans last month to build aircraft in India.
Lula addressed the AI Impact summit in Delhi on Thursday, calling for a multilateral and inclusive global governance framework for artificial intelligence.
He will travel on to South Korea for meetings with President Lee Jae Myung and to attend a business forum.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/211436253936f8e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974788/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retires-as-microsoft-shakes-up-gaming-unit' target='_blank'><strong>Xbox boss Phil Spencer retires as Microsoft shakes up gaming unit</strong></a><br><p>Microsoft on Friday put out word that Xbox stalwart Phil Spencer is retiring, in a shakeup of leadership at the tech titan’s video game unit.
Former Instacart chief operating officer Asha Sharma will take over as head of Microsoft Gaming, with Matt Booty becoming executive vice president and chief content officer.
“As we celebrate Xbox’s 25th year, the opportunity and innovation agenda in front of us is expansive,” Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a message to employees.
“I am long on gaming and its role at the centre of our consumer ambition.”
Changes to the gaming team include Sarah Bond leaving her job as Xbox president “to begin a new chapter” away from Microsoft, according to the company. Booty was previously president of game content and studios at Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn page.
The shakeup comes as cloud computing and artificial intelligence have become priorities at Microsoft, driving revenue growth but also massive spending on infrastructure to power the technology.
“When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join,” Spencer said in a message to colleagues.
“It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.”







Spencer headed the Xbox unit for 12 of his 38 years at Microsoft, nearly tripling the size of the business as video games evolved from packaged software for consoles to subscription services and digital downloads on an array of devices.
Spencer also guided the Xbox team through acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft.

 

Xbox boasts more than 500 million monthly users and a vast stable of game studios, along with a subscription gaming service.
“We are witnessing the reinvention of play,” Sharma said in a blog post announcing the leadership changes.
“To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters and worlds that people love.”







Sharma said she would renew focus on the Xbox console, aiming to “recommit to our core Xbox fans and players”.
Microsoft Gaming has been grappling with tariff-induced cost pressures, strong competition and uncertain consumer spending, prompting price rises on Xbox hardware.
Last month, Microsoft reported that its gaming revenue fell around 9.5 per cent in the December quarter, and it recorded undisclosed impairment charges in the division.

 

Microsoft had closed its $69 billion deal for “Call of Duty” maker Activision Blizzard in 2023, swelling its heft in the video-gaming market after heavy regulatory scrutiny.
The company’s gaming unit contends with robust competition from Sony’s PlayStation, particularly regarding console market share and exclusive game offerings.
“Microsoft’s leadership transition is appropriate as it comes at a time when the technology underlying gaming is shifting. As AI becomes a bigger element in game development, Microsoft needs a new generation of leaders to manage through this transition,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/211511223ad8da0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974790/us-ambassador-says-it-would-be-fine-if-israel-takes-over-large-swathes-of-middle-east' target='_blank'><strong>US ambassador says it ‘would be fine’ if Israel takes over large swathes of Middle East</strong></a><br><p>The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said that he would not be opposed to Tel Aviv taking over large swathes of the Middle East, reported Al-Jazeera.
Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, is a staunch pro-Israel conservative.
In a Friday interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, the envoy asserted that Israel’s borders are based on the Bible when questioned about the country’s current boundaries.
Carlson noted that the biblical verse includes the region between the Euphrates River in Iraq and the Nile in Egypt.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” said Huckabee, who was appointed by President Donald Trump last year.







Carlson, clearly surprised, questioned Huckabee on whether he truly endorsed Israel’s expansion across the entire region.
“They don’t want to take it over. They’re not asking to take it over,” the ambassador replied.
The US envoy then appeared to downplay his comments, describing them as “somewhat of a hyperbolic statement,” while still allowing for the possibility of Israeli expansion according to his religious view.
“If they end up getting attacked by all these places, and they win that war, and they take that land, OK, that’s a whole other discussion,” Huckabee said further.
The ambassador is not a stranger to controversy. In June 2025, he said he does not think an independent Palestinian state remains a US foreign policy goal, prompting the State Department to say he spoke for himself, Reuters reported.
Asked whether Huckabee’s remarks represented a change in US policy, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to comment, saying policy-making was a matter for Trump and the White House.
“Unless there are some significant things that happen that change the culture, there’s no room for it,” Huckabee was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. Those probably won’t happen “in our lifetime,” he said.
Huckabee suggested a piece of land could be carved out of a Muslim country rather than asking Israel to make room. “Does it have to be in Judea and Samaria?” Huckabee said, using the biblical name the Israeli government favors for the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where some 3 million Palestinians live.
In 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and must cease immediately.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21142553279af59.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974787/islamabad-court-indicts-former-kp-cm-ali-amin-gandapur-in-audio-leaks-case' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court indicts former KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur in audio leaks case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The prolonged legal saga surrounding the audio leak case involving PTI leader and former chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, finally moved to the next stage on Saturday with an additional district and sessions judge indicting him and his co-accused.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Nasr Minallah Baloch conducted the proceedings. Gandapur, accompanied by his counsel, Advocate Raja Zahoorul Hassan, appeared before the court, along with his co-accused, Asad Farooq Khan.
At the outset of the hearing, the judge addressed the core issue that had stalled the proceedings: the repeated failure of the accused to appear. The court enquired why he had not been presenting himself before the law.
Responding to the court’s query, Gandapur cited serious security concerns and logistical hurdles for his absence.
“Due to the security situation and road closures, I could not appear,” the former chief minister explained, adding that there was a prevailing situation akin to a curfew in certain areas, which prevented his travel.
He also informed the judge that his mobile phone had been taken during raids at his premises.
Judge Nasr, while taking note of the explanation, reminded the accused that discretion regarding appearance lies with the court.
He emphasised that a conviction or punishment cannot be based merely on the prosecution’s request, and pointed out that the case had been lingering for a considerable period without a formal indictment being filed.
In a significant move, the defence counsel rose to request the formal cancellation of his client’s arrest warrants, arguing that since the accused had now appeared, the court possessed the full authority to rescind them.
The judge accepted the request, suspending the arrest warrants for Gandapur. However, he issued a clear warning: “The warrants are cancelled, but in the future, you must be careful and ensure your appearance in court.”
The judge also advised that, should similar unavoidable situations arise again, the proper legal channel would be to file an application for exemption from personal appearance beforehand.
Following the resolution of the warrant issue, the court formally terminated the proceedings initiated by publishing an advertisement for the absconding suspect.
Subsequently, the judge read out the charges and formally indicted both Ali Amin Gandapur and Asad Farooq Khan in the audio leak case.
Both accused were present in the dock as the charges were framed against them.
After the indictment, the court adjourned the hearing of the case until April 6.
Earlier on February 9, a court in Islamabad declared Gandapur a proclaimed offender due to his continued absence from court hearings in a liquor and arms recovery case.
Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times since over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024, September 4, 2024, July 19, 2025 and Sept 10, 2025.</p><small>2026-02-21 10:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21113700253b1e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974776/45-magnitude-earthquake-shakes-twin-cities-surrounding-areas' target='_blank'><strong>4.5-magnitude earthquake shakes twin cities, surrounding areas</strong></a><br><p>A 4.5-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of northern Pakistan on Saturday, alarming residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, with tremors also felt in nearby cities, including Swabi, Haripur and Khanpur.

Residents reported that homes and office buildings swayed during the quake, prompting many people to step outside as a precaution.
Seismologists said moderate earthquakes are common in northern Pakistan due to tectonic activity in the Himalayan region and advised residents to stay calm and follow safety precautions.

The LHC’s Rawalpindi Bench gave this ruling while dismissing a petition filed by Fauji Foundation’s educational entity Foundation University. The plea challenged the deduction of Zakat from its investments in National Saving Certificates.
The bench, led by Justice Jawad Hassan, held that the university does not qualify for exemption as a charitable institution under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance 1980.
Justice Hassan ruled that the university, despite being established under the Foundation University Ordinance 2002 and sponsored by the Fauji Foundation, functions as an independent body corporate with financial autonomy, making it liable to compulsory Zakat deduction.

 

The university had approached the court through counsel Sayyid Murtaza Ali Pirzada, seeking to set aside a letter issued by the Ministry of Religious Affairs on April 24, 2018, which held the institution liable to pay Zakat on its investments.
The petitioner argued that as the university was sponsored by Fauji Foundation — a trust established under the Charitable Endowment Act 1890 — and reinvested its surplus funds to provide quality education, it should be exempt from Zakat.
Assistant Attorney General (AAG) Barrister Zain Mansoor, who appeared on the state’s behalf, opposed the petition, contending that the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance contains a comprehensive mechanism defining assets and institutions liable to Zakat.
He argued that the university’s statutory status neither exempts it from the operation of the law nor alters the character of its accounts attracting Zakat.
The court observed that Section 3(2) of the Foundation University Ordinance 2002 explicitly defines the university as a “body corporate” with perpetual succession and power to acquire, hold and dispose of property.

 

Justice Hassan noted that such attributes establish the university as an independent juristic person, separate from the federal or provincial government.
“The preamble to the statute situates the establishment of the petitioner university within the broader framework of national interest, but that alone does not confer charitable status for fiscal purposes,” the judgment stated.
The court further examined the university’s powers under its governing statute, which include the authority to enter into agreements, charge fees, create posts, appoint staff and invest funds.
“The university operates on a revenue-generating model rather than a pure charitable basis. Though chartered and sponsored by Fauji Foundation, the record of the Higher Education Commission unequivocally classifies it as a private sector university,” the judgment noted.
Referring to Section 1(2) of the Zakat Ordinance, the court held that any company, association of persons, or body of individuals — whether incorporated or not — with majority shares owned by Muslim citizens of Pakistan, is liable to Zakat.
The court further observed that the university, as a body corporate, squarely falls within the definition of “person” under the ordinance.
The judgment extensively relied on Supreme Court precedents, including Liaqat National Hospital versus Province of Sindh, which held that registration under a charitable law does not automatically confer tax exemption, and institutions charging fees while providing some charity operate with a duality of function, irreconcilable with exclusivity demanded by fiscal statutes.
The court also considered Pakistan Telecommunication Employees Trust versus Federation of Pakistan, which laid down a two-limbed test requiring registration as a charitable organisation and approval by revenue authorities for exemption.

 

Justice Hassan noted that despite repeated directions issued on Dec 8, 2020, Feb 17, 2022, April 4, 2024, and Nov 19, 2024, the university failed to place on record any document establishing its status as a charitable institution or pointing to any specific provision granting exemption from Zakat liability.
The court also rejected the petitioner’s reliance on Administrator General Zakat versus Pakistan Insurance Corporation, distinguishing it on facts as that case involved a statutory corporation wholly owned by the federal government, unlike Foundation University, which operates independently.
Amicus Curiae Nisar A Mujahid, appointed by the court to assist in the matter, submitted that the university does not qualify as a charitable institution under the ordinance, as educational advancement alone does not confer charitable status without fulfilment of statutory conditions.
“The petitioner university has failed to demonstrate any illegality in the impugned letter warranting interference by this court in its constitutional jurisdiction,” the judgment concluded, dismissing the petition with no order as to costs.
The verdict upholds the compulsory Zakat deduction from the university’s investments in National Saving Certificates, affirming the position taken by the Ministry of Religious Affairs.</p><small>2026-02-21 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21113438584e7c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974777/trump-to-travel-to-china-next-month-with-us-tariffs-in-focus' target='_blank'><strong>Trump to travel to China next month, with US tariffs in focus</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 for a highly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies, a trip announced as the Supreme Court overturned Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imported goods.
A White House official confirmed the trip on Friday, just before the highest US court dealt Trump a stinging defeat by striking down many of the tariffs he has used in a global trade war, including some against rival China.
Trump’s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on an extended visit to Beijing had been expected to revolve around extending a trade truce that kept both countries from further hiking tariffs.
Ruling raises questions for US-China relations
But the Supreme Court’s reversal created new questions for tense US-China relations that had recently stabilised after Trump trimmed tariffs on Chinese goods, in exchange for measures from Beijing, including cracking down on the illicit fentanyl trade and pausing export restrictions on critical minerals.
Twenty percent tariffs on China’s US-bound exports were imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the court ruled Trump had overstepped. Those tariffs were tied to national emergencies related to fentanyl distribution and trade imbalances.
Other duties on Chinese goods, including those implemented under legislated trade authorities known as Section 301 and Section 232, remain in place.
It was not immediately clear how many of the tariffs Trump would restore, but he told a press conference that he would impose a new 10% global tariff for 150 days.
Trump’s last trip to China, in 2017, was the most recent by a US president.
“That’s going to be a wild one,” Trump told foreign leaders visiting Washington on Thursday about the upcoming China visit.
“We have to put on the biggest display you’ve ever had in the history of China.”
The Chinese embassy in Washington declined to comment on the dates of the trip, which were first reported by Reuters. Beijing has not confirmed the trip.
Trump sees trade imbalance as national emergency
The Trump administration has said the global tariffs were necessary because of national emergencies related to trade imbalances that have weakened US manufacturing.
Trump had already been “playing defense” in the trade war, given the effectiveness of Beijing’s threat to cut off rare earths, said Scott Kennedy, a China economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The tariff defeat likely “cements his weakness in their eyes,” he said.
Chinese officials “like the direction of travel of the bilateral relationship in which the US is diminished and they want to keep things from re-escalating,” Kennedy said.
Trump’s visit will be the leaders’ first in-person talks since an October meeting in South Korea, where they agreed on the trade truce.
While the October meeting largely sidestepped the sensitive issue of Taiwan, Xi raised US arms sales to the island when the two leaders spoke this month.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a position Taipei rejects. The US, bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, has formal diplomatic ties with China, but it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island’s most important arms supplier.
Washington announced its largest-ever arms sale approval with Taiwan in December, including $11.1 billion in weapons that could ostensibly be used to defend against a Chinese attack. Taiwan expects more such sales.
Xi also said during the February call that he would consider further increasing soybean purchases, according to Trump.
Struggling US farmers are a major political constituency for Trump, and China is the top soybean consumer. Analysts said on Friday that China may be less likely to follow through on another big purchase of US soybeans after the Supreme Court ruling.
Although Trump has justified hawkish policy steps from Canada to Greenland and Venezuela as necessary to thwart China, he has eased policy toward Beijing in the past several months in areas from tariffs to advanced computer chips and drones.
The global trade war Trump initiated after he began his second term as president in January 2025 has alienated other trading partners, including allies.
Critics had argued that imposing steep tariffs on countries across the board actually insulated Beijing from the tariff barrage and reduced incentives to move supply chains out of China.
Friday’s ruling could indirectly increase pressure on Beijing if the effective tariff rates on other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, fall more than those on China, said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
“Unlike with many other countries, there is a well-established, much more legally durable mechanism for most of the tariffs on China that make them less affected than those on other countries,” Chorzempa said.</p><small>2026-02-21 06:38</small></div><hr>
