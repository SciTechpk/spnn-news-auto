Last week, four Al Jazeera journalists were killed in cold blood, among them Anas al-Sharif, the most prominent face on the global television network who had courageously been reporting on the catastrophic war and famine conditions in Gaza. The journalists were killed in a drone attack on a makeshift media tent outside Al-Shifa hospital. Targeting journalists is a war crime but Israel has acted with impunity and has long shown contempt for international humanitarian law or norms.
The Israeli military has been carrying out deliberate assaults on journalists since its war on Gaza began nearly two years ago. According to the UN, 242 journalists have been killed in that period, which is described as the highest number in any conflict. Israel’s military claimed responsibility for the murder of Anas al-Sharif saying he was a “Hamas terrorist” — a patently false allegation that Al Jazeera vehemently denied. Labelling journalists as militants is a disingenuous tactic Israel has always used. According to the Israeli-Palestinian news outlet ‘+972 magazine’ Israel’s military has a special unit charged with identifying journalists to ‘smear’ as Hamas members and target them.
The killings of journalists sparked global outrage. UN Secretary General António Guterres denounced it and the UN’s Human Rights Office called it a grave breach of international law. Journalists’ bodies and human rights organisations, including Reporters without Borders, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Committee for the Protection of Journalists all issued strong condemnations of these extrajudicial murders and called for accountability and international action to stop Israel. There have been worldwide protests over the killings.
Clearly, Israel’s intent is to silence voices and prevent media coverage of the atrocities and war crimes it is committing in Gaza as well as the mass starvation it has subjected Palestinians to. Suppressing the truth is a time-old practice of occupying forces, but it is always in vain. Despite Israel’s ban on the international media from reporting from Gaza, the world knows exactly what’s happening there, thanks to brave local journalists who have risked their lives to report the atrocities. Pictures of starving children have been on television screens across the world and video footage of Israeli soldiers firing on desperate aid-seekers have gone viral on social media. This, in fact, is the most documented genocide in history.

Even though Israel faces global isolation, US backing enables it to continue its genocidal war.

Israel has stepped up both its military offensive and its war on truth ahead of its planned takeover of Gaza City leading to the full occupation of Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his plan for the military capture of Gaza City earlier this month with Israel’s military given the go-ahead to launch an offensive to achieve this objective. This prompted worldwide condemnation with UN officials warning it would lead to “unimaginable suffering” and “another calamity”, which would reverberate across the region. Arab states, Pakistan, the EU and many Western countries denounced the impending move. In an emergency meeting of the Security Council on Aug 10, China, the UK, France, Russia and other members voiced opposition to the plan and called on Israel to reverse its decision. The only exception was the US, which backed Israel.
The shift in global especially Western opinion against Israel is palpable. It is being driven by the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and Israel’s use of starvation as weapon of war. As a BBC correspondent put it, “Starvation appears to be an inflection point for European countries — a moral impetus to drive their divergent diplomacy.” Last week, the foreign ministers of 27 countries, including over 20 European nations, issued a joint statement demanding that Israel allow unhindered aid into Gaza.
More Western nations are moving towards recognition of a Palestinian state. Australia has followed France, Canada and the UK, who announced plans to recognise Palestinian statehood, even though the UK has qualified that by saying it will refrain from doing so if Israel moves towards ending the war. France’s decision is particularly significant as it is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. These announcements are aimed at raising diplomatic pressure on Israel but haven’t been enough to stop it from continuing the war. As of now, 147 of the UN’s 193 member states recognise the state of Palestine.
The US, of course, remains opposed to recognition, saying that would reward Hamas. This echoes Tel Aviv’s stance. The US position on a two-state solution, which it long supported but is now ambivalent on, isolates it from the rest of the international community and bucks the global consensus reflected in several Security Council resolutions. Mike Huckabee, the American ambassador in Israel said in June — and wasn’t contradicted by the administration — that he did not think a sovereign Palestinian state is still a goal of US foreign policy. If this is the case, then it marks a significant shift in American policy under President Donald Trump. Again, it would be in line with Israel’s complete rejection of a Palestinian state and imply backing Netanyahu’s vision of a ‘Greater Israel’, a notion that has recently been condemned by the OIC.
Despite Israel’s growing global isolation, Netanyahu can ignore that as well as violate international law and continue its ethnic cleansing policy because he can count on unwavering US support. Trump’s oft-repeated desire for a Gaza ceasefire rings hollow as he has done nothing to pressure Israel in this direction. Throughout the war, Washington has extended military, diplomatic and financial support to Israel. It has also backed the militarised aid-distribution system Israel set up, which has been rejected by the UN and is widely seen as ‘death traps’; over 1,400 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food at these sites.
All this with no real effort to restrain Netanyahu, has given Israel a licence to do whatever it wants in Gaza. The US has also not dissuaded Tel Aviv from its disastrous plan to take over Gaza City and eventually reoccupy the entire Strip. Washington and the self-proclaimed ‘man of peace’ are fully complicit in the catastrophic situation in Gaza. And the world, for all its condemnations and moral outrage, has been unable to mount real pressure on the US to change course.

Published in Dawn, August 18th, 2025</p><small>2025-08-18 04:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931625/no-easy-path' target='_blank'><strong>No easy path</strong></a><br><p>IN recent months, the economy has offered some welcome signs of stability: inflation has slowed sharply, reserves have climbed above $14bn, the current account is in surplus, and the fiscal deficit has been reined in.
These improvements — achieved mainly through IMF-prescribed austerity policies — have prompted global rating agencies to lift Pakistan’s sovereign rating, hinting at a restoration of market confidence in its economy. But the weaknesses are still obvious. Large-scale manufacturing shrank by 0.74pc last year, missing even the government’s modest growth target of 3.5pc.
This is not an isolated setback. Big industry has been stuck in a cycle of low growth or contraction for three years on the trot. That LSM, which contributes around 8pc to GDP, has failed to achieve sustainable momentum for three years running should set off alarm bells for policymakers as it is yet another reminder of the structural weaknesses weighing on the fragile national recovery. The year-on-year growth of 4.14pc in LSM output in June — the fourth straight month of positive numbers — offers hope.
Yet, the simultaneous month-on-month decline of 3.67pc underscores the brittleness of this recovery. This volatility indicates deeper, unresolved issues: higher than regional energy prices, weak investment on elevated borrowing costs, high tax burden on the corporate sector, policy unpredictability and ‘informal’ curbs on imports, including raw materials, due to a dollar liquidity crunch. The recent positive spurts in big industry output, therefore, should not be mistaken for a turnaround. The slower growth in LSM output mirrors the overall low growth of GDP, which expanded by just 2.7pc last year after swinging between contraction and modest growth in the previous two fiscal years.
In its last monetary policy statement, the State Bank rightly underlined the need for steadily executing structural reforms to consolidate recovery, deepen macroeconomic stability and achieve sustainable growth. The recent macro improvements — reflected in lower inflation thanks to a global drop in oil and commodity prices, reduced fiscal deficit achieved largely through curtailed development spending and austerity measures and a build-up of foreign exchange reserves supported by debt rollovers by friendly countries, modest multilateral inflows, rising remittances and strict import controls — are fragile at best.
These improvements depend on external and temporary support, such as debt rollbacks, limited multilateral financing, remittances, etc, rather than durable fiscal and productivity reforms, leaving the economy only a small shock away from crisis. That Pakistan’s rating remains in speculative territory despite the upgrade from rating agencies is a reminder that markets still view the risks as high.
The question is: can policymakers use this breathing space to push through reforms that improve productivity, cut energy costs and attract investment? Without this, the economy will remain where it has been for years: underperforming, vulnerable and dangerously reliant on stopgap measures.

“For weeks I have been unable to work,” said Fooladi, who uses Iran’s homegrown ride-hailing app Snapp to find customers. “Most of the time was wasted wandering around aimlessly,” the 35-year-old Iranian driver added.
Unprecedented disruption has plagued users of GPS, which stands for Global Positioning System, in Iran since Israel’s surprise attack in mid-June which triggered a deadly 12-day war.
Iran’s communications ministry has said the disruptions were necessary for “security and military purposes”, without giving further explanation.

Navigation activity on Neshan falls by 20pc

Missiles, drones and rockets often use GPS or other similar technologies, which involve triangulating signals from multiple satellites, to find their targets.
Iran has long employed GPS jamming and spoofing around sensitive military sites but the recent disruptions have been the most sustained and widespread.
It remains unclear how long the measures will last or how much damage they have caused to Iranian businesses.
Ride-hailing apps, delivery platforms, and even basic mapping services like Google Maps and its Iranian equivalent, Neshan, have buckled under the interference.
In many areas, especially around Tehran, users often spot themselves on the maps hundreds of kilometres away from their actual locations.
“To get around, you either need a sharp memory for routes or already know the city well,” Fooladi said.
But the driver, originally from the western Lorestan province and less familiar with the capital’s winding backstreets, also finds himself running into dead ends. “I only pick up passengers who know the directions,” he said, adding the strategy had severely cut his income.
‘Collateral damage’
In early August, Neshan mapping app chief executive Javad Amel said in a video interview that daily disruptions through GPS spoofing had been ongoing for years, especially in Tehran.
But he explained in recent weeks that Neshan’s daily active users “had dropped by 15pc, while navigation activity on the app fell by 20pc”.
The continued disruption has also heightened fears of a deepening economic crisis among Iranians amid international sanctions, compounded by the revival of US President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign earlier this year.
Nuclear talks with Washington, which began in April, have also stalled since the United States joined its ally Israel to strike Iranian nuclear sites in June.
“This war has upended our lives and frozen our future plans,” said Fooladi.
In a report last week, the Khabar Online news agency warned against the disruption of GPS, saying it caused “collateral damage” to the digital economy and public safety, including delays to emergency services.
Former communications minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi argued the disruption was costly and would likely have limited defensive results. “Drone manufacturers and operators are not stupid either. If the GPS is disrupted and another positioning system replaces it, they will also use the new system,” Jahromi said according to his Telegram channel.
‘Unclear future’
With the significant impact on civilian lives, deputy communications minister Ehsan Chitsaz suggested that Iran could consider alternatives to GPS.
“Disruptions are created by domestic systems on GPS, and this has pushed us toward alternative options such as BeiDou,” he told Iranian daily Ham Mihan in July.
The Chinese satellite system BeiDou, fully operational since 2020, is emerging as a global rival to GPS.
Chitsaz said Iran was “drafting a program” so some of the country’s location-based services for transport, agriculture could “gradually migrate from GPS to BeiDou”. He acknowledged disruptions in Iran, coupled with years-long internet restrictions, have damaged businesses and created “social distrust and despair”.
But experts say that replacing GPS would be complex.
“Doing so would require extensive and costly infrastructure changes,” said Amir Rashidi of the US-based Miaan group, adding that Iran is currently “highly vulnerable in cyberspace”.
Many in Iran believe that another confrontation with Israel is on the horizon as Israel and the United States continue to threaten attacks if Iran restarts its nuclear programme, which has been on hold.
“Everything is uncertain, and we can’t plan. The future is unclear,” said Mohammad Hossein Ghanbari, a 32-year-old Snapp driver. “We don’t know whether the war will break out again or what will happen next.”

“The Secretary-General offers his sincere condolences to the victim’s families and stands in solidarity with those affected by this disaster,” a statement iss­u­ed by his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.
“We stand ready to provide assistance should it be requested,” it added.
At least 323 people are reported dead in Pakistan’s KP province alone after two days of heavy rains, while the nati­onwide tally has risen to 657.
In 2022, UN chief visited Pakistan to assess the catastrophic floods that had ravaged the country, particula­rly Sindh and Baloch­istan.
Pope prays for victims
Aslo on Sunday, Pope Leo XIV addressed the flooding with prayers “for all those who suffer because of this calamity”.
Pope Leo expressed his closeness to the people in Pakistan, India, and Nepal affected by severe flooding. He shared his prayers “for the victims and their families, and for all those who are suffering as a result of this calamity.”

IT WAS a bright morning when I set out from Gilgit towards Sost, a town perched near the Khunjerab Pass on the Karakoram Highway (KKH), on the nation’s Independence Day.
The sky was a flawless blue, but the land bore fresh wounds: roads torn apart like paper, fields drowned beneath silt-laden water, bridges twisted and broken.
The KKH, a lifeline for the region, runs alongside the Hunza-Nagar river. But here, swollen waters had swallowed farmland and trees, in places spilling into homes across the Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar districts. Elsewhere, too, the landscape was a tableau of devastation.
You see, in Gilgit-Baltistan, death doesn’t announce itself. Even under spotless skies, clouds can gather around high peaks within minutes, unleashing furious rain and birthing floods that race down valleys.
The water changes its mind in an instant, giving people no time to escape, grab their belongings, or even hold onto each other.

As climatic disasters riddle the region, Dawn’s Gilgit correspondent recounts his own precarious journey from Sost to his hometown

When heatwaves grip the mountains, glacial lakes burst, sending walls of water thundering through sleeping villages.
Despite the mounting risks, no scientific studies have mapped these glaciers’ behaviour, and no functional early warning systems are looking out for vulnerable areas.
I reached Sost by threading through the Sas Valley — the main road had been eaten by a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (Glof) from the Shishper glacier just days before.
The town greeted me with no electricity. The Khunjerab River had damaged transmission lines and a sudden flashflood from had blocked the KKH at Gulmit, an area I had just crossed.
Internet and mobile networks were down — the flood had severed the optic fibre cable connecting GB to the outside world.
As a journalist, the complete communication and electricity blackout made me nervous. I needed to file my story, but we were marooned. In our desperation, we drove to Misgar village, climbing higher as we searched for a signal, but found nothing.
By now, there was no way back to Aliabad, the district headquarters of Hunza.
At my hotel in Sost, a young waiter from Chipurson valley — a mere 40km away under normal circumstances — told me he hadn’t heard his family’s voice for a week.
“The road to Chipurson valley was eroded by the river a week ago, and mobile communication in my village is disconnected,” he said.
We returned to the blockade at Gulmit. Thousands of passengers, including those travelling to or from China via the Khunjerab Pass, were stranded on both sides, waiting for the road to reopen. The only way across was on foot, through the flooded zone, with the help of local volunteers.
There I met Saeed Jan, still trembling from what he’d witnessed. “Twenty floods in just hours,” he said. “Sweeping away everything in their path.”
I managed to cross the blockade and found a vehicle to take me towards Aliabad. But before the KKH could be fully restored, another wave of floodwaters roared down the mountain, halting work and making the passage impassable once again.
To help the stranded, locals started a boat service across Attabad Lake, where the flooded nullah now drains.
In Passu, families from Shimshal Valley sat on the roadside like refugees in their own land. Their village—Hunza’s last outpost — has been cut off from the world for a week as floods and river erosion destroyed its access road in multiple locations.
When I finally reached Aliabad, my hopes crumbled. There was no internet or phone service, and a Glof in Hassanabad had, once again, disconnected the optic fibre cable.
Here, a newly constructed bridge on the KKH was closed. It was dark, and volunteers blocked the path forward. The only sound was the roaring flow of glacier water. Everyone was in shock, uncertain about which way the glacier would turn.
“The uncertainty of Shishper glacier’s behaviour puts local residents at risk,” one said.
My own journey home to Nagar Khas felt perilous. Rocks pounded the road like bombs. The river lapped at what remained of the road, as if tasting it before deciding whether to swallow it whole.
In my village of Tokorkot, I found my neighbours fleeing as the Hoper nullah unleashed its fury.
“The flood intensity was too heavy. I have never experienced it in my life,” said Niyat Ali, 75, pointing towards the nullah. “In our times, floods occurred under special circumstances, either continued heatwaves or heavy rains, once or twice.”
August 14 was the most disastrous day for the region, particularly for Ghizer residents, as cloudbursts induced floods in 40 locations in a single day, killing ten people and destroying dozens of homes, bridges and roads.
“The devastation was sudden. People have no way to flee,” said Naeem Anwar, a resident of Ghizer. “Local residents have never experienced such horrific devastation.”
The geography that once blessed this region — dramatic peaks and pristine valleys — has now become a curse. The KKH lifeline lies broken in too many places to count. The Baltistan Highway and Ghizer-Shandoor road are also damaged, leaving much of the population stranded.
The local government, meanwhile, seems overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster.
“We don’t have resources,” GB Home Minister Shams Lone confessed.
Even volunteers who rushed to help became part of the tragedy; nine died trying to restore what nature had undone—two on the Fairy Meadows road, and seven repairing a water channel in Danyore.
The over 8,000 glaciers of GB, which once supported around 70pc of Pakistan’s agriculture, are now rapidly melting.
If this is just the beginning, I shudder to imagine what the endgame may look like.

• Hamas calls relocation plans ‘a brutal assault’ and ‘blatant deception to cover up massacre’
• Israelis rally seeking end to war, prisoner swap deal
GAZA STRIP: Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli attacks killed at least 40 people on Saturday, as the Israeli military hinted at an approaching call to push civilians from Gaza City ahead of a new offensive.
The latest toll comes more than a week after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to capture the Palestinian territory’s largest city, following 22 months of war that have created dire humanitarian conditions.
According to the civil defence agency, at least 13 of the Palestinians killed on Saturday were shot by troops as they were waiting to collect food aid near distribution sites in the north and in the south.
Ahead of the offensive, COGAT said that starting from Sunday, the military would supply more tents and shelter equipment.
“As part of the preparations to move the population from combat zones to the southern Gaza Strip for their protection, the supply of tents and shelter equipment to Gaza will resume,” it said in a statement.
 






Hamas later slammed the move, saying the announcement was part of a “brutal assault to occupy Gaza City”.
Earlier, Gaza’s civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said conditions in Gaza City’s Zeitun neighbourhood were rapidly deteriorating with residents having little to no access to food and water amid heavy Israeli bombardment.
The spokesman added that about 50,000 people were estimated to be in that area of Gaza City, “the majority of whom are without food or water” and lacking “the basic necessities of life”.
Bassal told AFP the number of people killed in the central Gaza Strip on Saturday had risen to 40.
On Friday, the Israeli military said its troops were operating in Zeitun.
Hamas said in a statement that Israeli forces had been carrying out a “sustained offensive in the eastern and southern neighbourhoods of Gaza City, particularly in Zeitun”.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army’s chief of staff said Sunday the military was pressing ahead with plans for the next phase of its Gaza offensive, with a focus on Gaza City.
“Today we are approving the plan for the next phase of the war,” Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir said during a field visit to the Palestinian territory, according to an army statement.
In response, Hamas said the plans would result in “a new wave of extermination and mass displacement”.
The Palestinian group also condemned the proposals “a major war crime” which it said reflected Israel’s “disregard for international and humanitarian law”.
Hamas said Israel’s statements on this, including its plans for the installation of tents in southern Gaza, were “a blatant deception to cover up the imminent massacre and forced displacement”.
Israelis rally
Demonstrators across Israel called on Sunday for an end to the Gaza war and a deal to release prisoners still held by Hamas, a push lambasted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies.
The protests come more than a week after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to capture Gaza City.
A huge Israeli flag covered with portraits of the remaining captives was unfurled in Tel Aviv’s so-called Hostage Square – which has long been a focal point for protests throughout the war.
Demonstrators also blocked roads, including the highway connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem where they set tires on fire, according to local media footage.
Some Israeli government members who oppose any deal with Hamas slammed Sunday’s demonstrations.
Famine warnings
The Israeli plans to expand the war into Gaza City and nearby refugee camps have sparked an international outcry as well as domestic opposition.
UN-backed experts have warned of widespread famine unfolding in the territory, where Israel has drastically curtailed the amount of humanitarian aid it allows in.

• Move comes amid push to address continuing glut in gas network
ISLAMABAD: The government is almost set to allow new gas connections at the price of imported LNG — around Rs3,900 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) at the current rate — and almost four times the current connection fee.
Sources told Dawn that a summary has been moved by the petroleum division to the federal cabinet for lifting the ban on new connections, with a first-year target of 120,000.
Priority would be given to applicants who had previously been issued demand notices or had paid the urgent fee but could not get connections because of a subsequent ban. The number of new connections would be enhanced for next year.
Around 250,000 applicants fall in this category, who would have to file affidavits not to approach the courts for their past claims and the connection fee increase. Before the ban, consumers were allowed to pay an upfront fee of Rs25,000 to secure a connection on a priority basis, unlike the routine Rs5,000-Rs7,500 fee. On the other hand, a new LNG connection earlier cost Rs15,000.
At present, more than 3.5 million applications for new connections are pending with the gas companies. While new connections provide an additional avenue for the gas companies to claim a guaranteed return on fixed assets (pipelines and related infrastructure), this also leads to higher gas losses and lower revenue recoveries on top of greater gas shortages in winter.
No wonder then that the Lahore-based Sui Northern is rationing gas supplies even before the peak winter demand and provides gas to domestic consumers for 6-9 hours per day — at breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours. The recent increase in fixed charges starting July 1, 2025 by 50pc provides an additional incentive to secure higher funds without the additional gas supply.
 
 

The moratorium on new gas connections was imposed in 2009, partially removed after six years before being enforced again in 2022 due to rising gas shortages. Sources said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had recently expressed displeasure with delays in new connections.
New connections
The new connection fee would now be set at Rs40,000-50,000 and the consumers would be billed at the notified re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) price — currently at about Rs3200 per mmBtu. The final price, including general sales tax, would go up to Rs3,900-Rs4,000 per mmBtu. The average gas price for high-end domestic consumers with a monthly consumption of 300 cubic metres per month currently stands at Rs3,300 per mmBtu and goes up to Rs4,200 per mmBtu for more than 400 cubic metres of monthly consumption.
The cabinet was informed that a comparative price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was worked out at around Rs5,300 per mmBtu, and it was being used by millions of poor and lower-middle-class consumers, including those in the remote areas, which meant the LNG-based piped gas supply would still be cheaper 35-40pc.
Gas surplus
The removal of the gas connection ban is being pushed to address a continuing glut in the gas network that is putting at risk the integrity of the pipeline system and the sovereign international commitments. The Ministry of Finance recently suggested considering “demand side intervention through lifting of moratorium on new gas connections” to address the issue of the LNG surplus.
The higher LNG imports also involve greater foreign exchange requirements. Interestingly, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had been resisting allowing the cost of LNG diversion to domestic consumers for almost a decade, but it recently allowed Rs75 billion in revenue requirements of gas companies for the 2015-22 backlog and indicated it’d adjust the 2023-25 claims in the subsequent price revisions.
Even with existing gas connections, the two gas companies, particularly SNGPL serving Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, face acute gas shortages in winters and imported LNG supply to residential consumers leads to the multiplication of circular debt. Already, the gas companies face around Rs200bn of annual revenue shortfall on this account.
However, the government has found itself in a paradoxical situation owing to economic slowdown, forced closure of gas to industrial captive power plants, unaffordable electricity rates, and insignificant utilisation of LNG by the power sector, for which the entire import arrangement was made in 2015-16, including sovereign commitments and more than $7bn worth of infrastructure.
The mandatory 66pc LNG utilisation in four “must-run” power projects of over 5200MW, for which the long-term international contracts were signed in 2015-16 and then in 2020-21, has since been reduced to 33pc LNG utilisation. These plants, however, remain outside the grid through tactical operations, shifting the power sector’s circular debt to the petroleum sector.
At present, more than 300 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of domestic gas fields have been put on forced closure to create space for the imported LNG at more than twice the domestic producer price.
This is not only at the expense of domestic gas fields, but also causes weekly losses of billions of rupees to gas producers, compromising future exploration and development activities.
This means at least three monthly cargoes under the long-term contracts with Qatar have become surplus. This is on top of the diversion of a monthly LNG cargo to the international market that was contracted by Pakistan under a guaranteed private long-term contract.
Last winter, the government had postponed five cargoes — 500mmcfd — from Qatar, which are now due for rescheduling in FY2026 on top of about 150 annual routine cargoes.

• Experts urge government to make insurance mandatory
WITH the country currently in the grip of cataclysmic monsoon rains, every passing day brings with it more reports of deaths and destruction.
Among the losses to life and property, images of damaged veh­icles — either swept up by floodwaters or battered by falling debris — have become a common sight.
Alongside lost homes, businesses and civic amenities, damage to vehicles constitutes a major chunk of the losses incurred by people.
According to insurance experts, however, the uptake for motor vehicle coverage in the country stands at a paltry 2.5 per cent.
Take, for example, the freak hailstorm that inflicted damages worth millions of rupees to vehicles across Islamabad earlier this year. According to data from around 12 insurance and takaful operators (out of a total of 28 providers), around 958 vehicle repair claims were received in the wake of the hailstorm from the federal capital and its adjoining areas in April 2025.
Sources in the motor insurance sector put the gross claim amount at around Rs144 million.
But this figure only includes those who had insurance and opted to go that route. Given the massive bills and long queues for repair work in the aftermath of the hailstorm, many vehicle owners chose to avail themselves of offers for discounted repairs offered by carmakers themselves, or took their business to their local ‘ustaad’.
According to an insurance company official, who asked not to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media, his company had served around 250 customers, with a total payment estimate of around Rs30 million during FY25 alone.
A majority of these claims came from Islamabad and its surrounding areas, and most were for saloon or sedan vehicles.
He highlighted that parts shortages, such as the one created in the wake of the Islamabad hailstorm, put pressure on supply, leading to a price rise. This is exactly what was witnessed in the case of the damages from the hailstorm, with workshops and technicians making hay due to the sky-high demand for parts such as windshields.
The insurance official claimed that this practice also hurts their company, which tries to find the best possible deal for their clients.
Insurance ‘not the norm’
Sectoral experts say that most car owners in Pakistan do not have coverage.
Saqib Zeeshan, CEO of Pak-Qatar General Takaful, told Dawn that out of the millions of vehicles on Pakistan’s roads, only about three million were covered by any insurance or takaful policy.
“This is despite the presence of 28–30 companies offering attractive insurance and takaful packages. Unfortunately, we are not an insurance-oriented society, and a large segment of the population lacks basic awareness about the concept of insurance,” he said.
He added that Pak-Qatar received over 60 vehicle claims from the April hailstorm alone.
“Currently, we have around 14,000 vehicles insured under Motor Takaful, which is still a small number compared to major players who handle significantly larger volumes and claims.”
Lack of coverage
With widespread flooding, heavy rains, and landslides ravaging the northern parts of the country, thousands of affected vehicle owners are likely to submit claims to their respective insurers, in the hopes of compensation.
But industry experts say that a large chunk of those affected would not have insurance to begin with. Non-customs paid vehicles, such as those widely used across the Malakand Division — in areas such as Swat, Dir, Chitral — are usually not insured. The same goes for many of the private vans or buses plying on inter-city routes, save for those that are part of organised fleets.
However, Mr Zeeshan pointed out that vehicles financed through banks and leasing companies are compulsorily insured until the loan matures, i.e. the instalments are paid off.
“However, only 20pc of customers continue insurance coverage after the financing period ends. Once the loans are repaid, the insurance penetration drops drastically,” he said.
In his view, most people in Pakistan view insurance or takaful as an expense rather than an investment. Given the country’s propensity towards climatic disasters, this thinking needs to change.
Even though most insurance companies offer both comprehensive and third-party liability coverage, Mr Zeeshan says the latter, which is available for a nominal premium, is often ignored.
In addition, while natural disasters are now covered under comprehensive policies, certain insurance packages — especially those with low premiums — still don’t insure against force majeure (unforeseen circumstances or acts of God).
To address this issue, the industry has urged the government to make motor insurance mandatory. Countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have already made vehicle insurance mandatory.
“Only the government has the authority to enforce such a policy,” Mr Zeeshan said.
As per data from the Insurance Association of Pakistan (IAP), the gross premium contribution for the motor insurance segment reached Rs36.18 billion in 2024, up from Rs34bn in 2023. However, IAP does not maintain segregated data on vehicle claims resulting from natural calamities.

• Official says ‘faulty carriages’ impede train’s ability to stop
LAHORE/BAHAWALPUR: The Karachi-bound Awam Express train hit a sand-hump and derailed on Sunday morning apparently due to brake failure, leaving a passenger dead and 33 others injured.
The initial assessment held train driver responsible for not stopping the train properly owing to over speeding.
On the other hand, the federal minister for railways ordered for a ‘thorough inquiry’, appointing the federal government inspector of railways, a senior position in the department, to probe the incident and submit a report.
The train was on its way to Karachi after departing from Lahore railway station in the evening.
When it reached near Lodhran, around 400km from Lahore, it received reception signals for Line No-5. But the driver, allegedly due to over-speeding, couldn’t stop and hit the sand-hump.
 
 

As a result, the train engine, four passenger coaches and a luggage van derailed completely. Some of them overturned, leaving a passenger dead and 33 others injured.
Soon after the accident, cries for help were heard from the derailed coaches as passengers remained stuck for sometime and later succeeded in coming out on their own.
Rescue-1122 reached the spot after some time and started shifting the injured passengers to the government hospital where one of them died.  He was identified as Waqas, 37, from Khushab.
According to an internal document, while entering the Line No-5 the train overshoot and hit the sand-hump, leaving the locomotive and five coaches, including a luggage van, derailed.
A relief train from Multan was also called to reach the spot to remove the affected coaches and engine from the line in a bid to restore the rail traffic on Main Line-1.
As many as four trains, including 6-Down, 48-Down and 39-Up, delayed for hours.
The initial investigation held the driver responsible for the derailment. “Had he applied brakes well on time, he would have averted the crash. We have reached a consensus that he failed to stop the train on Line No-5, left with no option but to enter the sand-hump,” it concluded.
On the other hand, a senior PR official held faulty passenger coaches responsible for the accident and requested the federal minister for railways to thoroughly get this aspect investigated.
“In fact, the reports mentioned on papers are different than the practical [situation]. On paper, this train had one dummy coach [the coach without brake]. But I think it is not correct, because if there is one dummy among 12 coaches, the driver would have succeeded in stopping the train without any issue. This means, there were around 5/6 coaches that were dummy but not mentioned in the papers as faulty,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.
Talking about the rolling stock, he said a number of passenger coaches and goods’ wagons are not up to the mark, leading to frequent derailment incidents.
The Federal Railways Minister, Hanif Abbasi, while presiding over an emergency meeting, reprimanded officers for not doing well for the safety of passengers.
 
 

The minister also ordered the officers to ground dummy coaches from the railway system and if there is need to stop operation of any train, it must be done. “The officers must come out of their AC offices and inspect the rail track, rolling stock etc,” he said.
According to rescue 1122 media coordinator Muhammad Safdar, 11 passengers were rendered first aid on the spot, while 22 seriously injured including six women, were taken to DHQ hospital, Lodhran.
A press release issued by Multan Railways division, 21 passengers suffered injuries and out of them two were taken to Bahawal Victoria Hospital (BVH), Bahawalpur.
Divisional Superi­ntendent Iftikhar Ahmed of Multan Railway division, who also rushed to Lodhran Railway station, told journalists that the down track has been cleared and the derailed bogies have been removed after 10 hours’ struggle.
Despite derailment on the down railway track, he said, the railway traffic has not been suspended and Awam Express passengers were sent to Karachi by the Hazara Express.

Chairing a review meeting on cashless economy in Islamabad on Sunday, he directed all the provincial chief secretaries to fully cooperate with the federal government in expanding the Raast digital payment system to the district level.
The prime minister expr­essed satisfaction over the progress made towards a cashless economy and digital financial systems.
 
 

The meeting was briefed that Pakistan will develop digital public infrastructure to create digital IDs for every citizen, integrating national identity cards, biometrics and mobile numbers.
These digital IDs will enable secure and efficient payments.
It was further said that the provincial governments have shown significant progress in linking government-to-public and public-to-government payments with the Raast system.
The meeting was info­rmed that the federal development agencies have granted right of way for fibre connectivity, while discussions are ongoing with Pakistan Railways and the National Highway Authority to expand digital infrastructure.

• 657 lives lost nationwide since June 26; NDMA warns of more rain spells next month
• Food shortages, lack of utilities take hold as parts of GB remain cut off
• Flows in Punjab rivers subside to ‘low flood’ levels
PESHAWAR/ISLAM­ABAD: With more than 150 people feared missing, the recent catastrophic floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have claimed at least 323 lives, provincial authorities said on Sunday, as the nationwide toll from rain-related incidents since late-June rose to 657.
As another two to three waves of heavy rain are expected in early September, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed members of his federal cabinet to personally supervise relief operations in the worst-hit KP province.
Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Asfandyar Khattak said that as per details collected by revenue staff in the Buner and Shangla districts, around 150 people are still missing.
He added that rescue operations were underway and that five armed forces helicopters were at the disposal of the provincial government.
Flanked by Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif and Dir­ector General Resc­ue-1122 Muhammad Tayyab Abdullah, Mr Khattak said the provincial government had released Rs1.5 billion for relief activities.
Out of the initial release of Rs500m, the allocations included Rs150m for Buner, Rs100m for Mansehra, Rs50m for Bajaur, Rs40m each for Batagram, Swat, and Shangla, and Rs10m each for Upper Kohistan, Lower Kohistan, and Kolai Palas, he added.
The PDMA DG further said that 33 trucks of non-food items had reached Buner, eight had reached Swat, and seven had reached Bajaur, while additional supplies were also being dispatched.
More rain in Sept
With heavy monsoon rains expected to persist until August 22, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Spokes­person Dr Tayyab Shah warned on Sunday that two to three more spells of heavy rain are expected to hit the country in September.
He noted that this year, monsoon rainfall had been 50 to 60 per cent heavier than last year.
This year’s monsoon season ranks among the most destructive in recent memory, he said.
NDMA put the number of those who had lost their lives in rain-related incidents across Pakistan since June 26 at 657, with 929 injured.
Of the total casualties, 171 were children, 94 women, and 392 men.
KP province alone accounted for 390 deaths, including 288 men, 59 children, and 43 women, underscoring the province’s disproportionate vulnerability to seasonal downpours and related hazards.
 
 

In Punjab, 164 people including, 70 children, 63 men, and 31 women, have died in rain-related incidents since June 26.
Sindh has recorded 28 deaths, including 14 children, 10 men, and 4 women.
In Balochistan, 20 fatalities, including 11 children, 5 men, and 4 women were reported.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, the toll reached 32 deaths, comprising 18 men, 8 children, and 6 women.
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) reported 15 casualties, evenly split among 5 men, 5 women, and 5 children while in Islamabad, 8 people died, including 4 children, 3 men, and a woman.
GB situation
In Gilgit-Baltistan, a cloudburst-triggered flood in Katishu village of Kharmang district claimed two lives on Sunday.
Police said a woman and her daughter went missing after the flash flood struck their village. The body of their daughter has been recovered, while the woman is still missing. Two other women, injured in the flood, were shifted to Skardu for treatment.
The flash flood also caused severe damage to fields, water channels, agricultural land, and both public and private properties.
Meanwhile, rescue teams recovered the body of a four-year-old girl from under flood debris in Khalti village, Gupis Valley (Ghizer district), while the body of an elderly man was retrieved on Saturday night. Both had gone missing in flash floods on Friday.
On the other hand, several major roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), Baltistan Highway, Ghizer–Shandur Road, and Naltar Highway, along with various link roads, remained blocked, leaving thousands of people, including tourists, stranded.
Local residents faced acute shortages of drinking water, prolonged power outages, and disruption of mobile and internet connectivity in several areas.
In Gilgit city, residents held protest demonstrations, blocking main roads against the prolonged water and electricity crisis. They said locals had been without basic utilities for several days.
‘Ministers to supervise KP relief ops’
In the wake of recent destructive rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed federal ministers to supervise relief operations in the province.
 
 

“On the prime minister’s directives, federal ministers will participate in relief operations in the flood-hit districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” said an official statement from the PM Office.
As per the instructions, Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam will oversee relief distribution in Shangla and Buner; the Federal Minister for Power Division will assist in Buner; Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Yousaf will supervise operations in Mansehra; and the PM’s Special Assistant Mubarak Zeb will oversee aid distribution in Bajaur.
The prime minister is personally overseeing NDMA’s relief operations across all flood-affected districts of KP.
Under the PM’s Relief Package, more truckloads of supplies are being dispatched to the affected districts. The relief goods include food rations, tents, and medicines, which are being handed over to the respective district administrations.
Water levels in rivers
Meanwhile, the PDMA Punjab reported that the River Sutlej continued to experience fluctuating water levels, with a low-level flood situation at Ganda Singhwala and Sulemanki.
The authority said that the current water flow stands at 70,000 cusecs at Ganda Singhwala and 74,000 cusecs at Sulemanki, with authorities closely monitoring the situation due to ongoing fluctuations.
The Sutlej River is expected to remain at low to medium flood levels in the coming days, with flows ranging between 75,000 to 85,000 cusecs.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that water flows exceeding 80,000 cusecs could trigger low-level flooding in the Sutlej, while 120,000 cusecs may lead to moderate flooding, and 175,000 cusecs could cause high-level flooding.
The PDMA has also forecast severe monsoon rains in most districts of Punjab, with the seventh spell of monsoon rains expected to continue until August 22/23.

Set in the 24th century, it showcases astounding technological leaps. One unmissable character is a humanoid robot called Data. Although immensely capable, he’s unable to experience emotions; any attempt returns comical failures.
Meanwhile, humans have spread to other planets. In one episode, one such planet is visited by a powerful character Ardra. A contract is said to entitle her to ownership of both the planet and its inhabitants. The people submit to her, convinced of her power and authenticity; however, the protagonist, Captain Picard, demands arbitration. Confident of success, Ardra agrees but only if Data is the arbiter. Her reason: the artificial intelligence (AI) within him “is incapable of deceit and bias”. Hold that thought!
We may not yet have a Data, but we are unmistakably in the age of AI. It can conduct surgeries, decide lawsuits and drive cars. But imagine having your chest ripped open by a robot which, although well-calibrated and immune to fatigue, overestimates your pain threshold because of your skin colour. Now switch to a courtroom, where an AI judge — invited by the honourable Supreme Court — hands down a life sentence without explaining the decision, as the commercial licence prohibits disclosure. The scene shifts again: you are in a self-driving car, thoroughly tested in the US but unable to recognise a donkey cart in Pakistan, and it accelerates instead of stopping.
These are no improbable hypotheticals. AI learns from human experiences fed to it during training; any exceptions result in biased decisions that can be inconvenient, life-changing, even fatal. For example, in 2016, a passport application of an Asian man in New Zealand was rejected because AI declared the eyes in his photo were closed. They weren’t. They were only smaller. The applicant had ‘no hard feelings’ against the robot. Glenn Rodríguez, though, wanted to be released from jail after an exemplary 26-year record. However, the proprietary AI system COMPAS denied his parole application; and the board had no idea why. Later research showed that COMPAS deemed him high-risk simply because he was black. In 2016 again, a self-driving Tesla crashed into a truck because it mistook its white side for the sky. The driver died.
The point is not to scare anyone, it is to raise awareness. AI holds immense potential, but its ability to mimic or even surpass human accuracy across a range of situations can inflate trust in its safety and ethicality, ignoring the fact that the learning process behind this impressive performance is not faithful to human cognition and neurobiology. Also, modern AI systems are complex, with properties that may only be discovered long after their creation. They can embed systemic human bias and perpetuate it at scale: due to limited medical access, dermatological data grossly underrepresents people with darker skin tones. This leaves even doctors with little evidence to test the efficacy of costly treatments — and AI risks reinforcing such under-treatment. Accordingly, legislation such as the EU AI Act classifies systems impacting human welfare, opportunities and safety as high-risk to stamp the importance of the responsible use of AI.

AI’s ability to mimic human accuracy can inflate trust in its safety.

For an ethnically, environmentally and socioeconomically diverse Pakistan, this presents challenges and opportunities. Bias is multidimensional and cannot be estimated or even defined without engaging stakeholders in a cross-spectrum manner. Therefore, this is an opportunity for researchers from both the technical and social sciences to collectively engage communities and develop contextually aware and demographically representative AI systems for Pakistan. By embracing this appr­o­ach, Pakistan can st­­r­ategically cultivate AI solutions that are in­­herently fairer and more effective for its unique sub-populatio­­ns, directly addressing existing healthcare inequalities and ensuring equitable outcomes in areas like criminal justice and economic opportunities.
To enable broader societal uptake and understanding, it is also important to develop conversion courses that allow people from all academic backgrounds to engage with AI. Experience from the UK shows that such courses attract students from diverse fields and foster stakeholder engagement directly within the classroom.
Fairness, equity and justice are divine ideals, yet they are fundamental to human dignity. The quest for them has now turned to machines. But will artificial intelligence succeed where biological intelligence has failed? This question brings empirical ethics into the spotlight. Regardless, the road to the elusive ideal of true justice is paved with the fundamentals of transparency, integrity and inclusivity.

According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the case was dismissed after “no incriminating material is available on record which connects the accused persons with the commission of alleged offences.
“Hence, the request of 10 days for physical remand of the accused persons is hereby turned down, and the accused persons present in the court are hereby discharged in this case.”
The order added that no private witness of the occurrence was associated during the raid, nor were any statements taken.
“Moreover, no permission for making a raid is attached with the file on a private place. Prima facie, it seems that the accused persons were included in the case on the basis of forged and concocted facts,” the order said.
Lawyer Haider Butt represented the accused in the case. He confirmed to Dawn.com that all the accused were released and the case was discharged against them.
According to the first information report (FIR) of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the Punjab government ordered the arrests after videos of the party, purportedly involving 50-60 individuals, including transgender persons, went viral on social media.
Fashion designer Maria B initially posted videos on her social media accounts, demanding action against “transgender activists” that she claimed featured in the clips, terming such gatherings “against the moral values of the country.”
Per the FIR, the footage, dated August 1, allegedly contained “explicit content, prompting public outcry and a swift response from law enforcement.”
The case was registered on behalf of the government at the Naseerabad police station against “a group of 50 to 60 transgender persons under sections 292 (sale of obscene material), 292-A (printing/advertising obscene matter), and 294 (obscene acts in public) of the Pakistan Penal Code, alongside Section 6 of the Sound System Act.”
Following the arrests, Deputy Inspector General of Police (Operations) Lahore, Faisal Kamran, had said, “Promoting obscenity under the guise of a party or photoshoot is a serious legal offence.”
He said that illegal and unethical acts will not be tolerated in any form. “All individuals involved in the incident will be brought to justice.”
Kamran added that the screening of the banned film Joyland, which features a transgender love affair, was also stopped in the city. “Strict action will be taken against any activity conflicting with Islam and the law.”
The movie was set to screen in Lahore today, nearly two years after it was barred from cinemas in Punjab. The long-awaited screening was said to take place at an alternative venue instead of a movie theatre.
Responding to the development, Islamabad-based transgender rights activist Nayyab Ali said in a post on X that individuals seen in the video were “not trans activists” and had “nothing to do with our movement.”
Ali also alleged that the video was shot at a private party and only went viral after Maria B posted it, saying, “If it’s fahashi (vulgarity), then who spread it to millions? Maria B did. That’s a crime itself.”
Meanwhile, human rights activists raised concerns over the potential misuse of morality laws on social media. “While obscenity laws exist, their vague wording often leads to arbitrary enforcement, disproportionately targeting marginalised communities,” said a legal expert, requesting anonymity.
The government authorities also vowed to expand the crackdown on “immoral activities” across the province.</p><small>2025-08-18 01:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/17164649272e9e5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931468/death-of-senior-journalist-being-probed-from-all-possible-angles-sanghar-police-official' target='_blank'><strong>Death of senior journalist being probed from ‘all possible angles’: Sanghar police official</strong></a><br><p>The police on Sunday said that they were investigating the death of senior DawnNews TV reporter “from all possible angles,” hours after his body was found in Sindh’s Sanghar district.
The senior journalist was found dead in his car, parked on Hyderabad Road in Sanghar, on Saturday night under what police termed “mysterious circumstances”. The body was found in the driving seat, with a gunshot wound to the head.
Sanghar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abid Baloch told Dawn.com that police were investigating the death of DawnNewsTV reporter Khawar Husain Bajwa from “all possible angles”.
“The postmortem of the journalist was conducted in Sanghar’s Civil Hospital, and police are awaiting the provisional findings of the process,” he said.
“Apparently, there is a single bullet wound from a 9mm pistol with an exit wound on the left side of the temple”, SSP Baloch said, adding that only one bullet casing was found.
“We are not drawing any conclusion at this point and are looking at this case from all possible angles,” the SSP explained.
According to Sanghar police, Husain’s body had been kept in the cold storage facility at the Red Crescent hospital in Latifabad, as his parents are said to be arriving from the United States early on Monday morning.
“Then the body will be taken to Sanghar, which is the ancestral home of the journalist, for burial,” the SSP said.
Later today, the Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) ordered the formation of a fact-finding committee under the supervision of the Sindh Additional IGP (Counter-Terrorism Department) Azad Khan to probe Husain’s death.
According to a copy of the order seen by Dawn.com, the committee will comprise the Additional IGP, Karachi West Zone Deputy IGP Irfan Baloch and SSP Baloch.
“The committee will do [a] preliminary investigation and ascertain facts from all angles. The complete report into the incident may be finalised in two days for the perusal of IGP Sindh,” the order read.
Separately, a request was submitted to the Sindh Home Department for the constitution of a medical board comprising senior doctors and forensic experts to perform a “fair, transparent, and impartial postmortem examination”.
The letter, submitted by Additional IGP (Operations) Zubair Nazir Ahmed Shaikh and seen by Dawn.com, requested the formation of the medical panel so that “the matter may reach its logical and conclusive end in accordance with the principles of justice”.
Meanwhile, Sanghar police obtained a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera recording of a restaurant, outside of which was the car in which his body was found.
The SSP stated that a guard at the restaurant told police that he arrived at around 7pm for his duties, and Husain arrived in his vehicle 45 minutes to an hour later.
The guard told the police that the journalist had used the restaurant’s toilet and then sat back in the vehicle.
“After some time when he didn’t place any order, the guard, out of curiosity, went towards the vehicle and reported back to the restaurant manager, telling him he noticed something unusual with a man sitting inside,” the SSP said.
“Two waiters arrived to confirm the watchman’s statement and found out that blood was oozing from the right side of his [Husain’s] temple, with a 9mm pistol in his right hand,” SSP Baloch added.
According to the SSP, Husain’s brother-in-law told police that he didn’t inform them about his Saturday arrival, although he asked them to hold an annual religious ritual as per the family’s tradition. Husain neither told friends in Sanghar about his visit nor did he attend the ritual.
“His sister confirmed that he had celebrated Eidul Azha with her on her insistence, after their parents shifted to the US this May,” the SSP said.
Last night, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and sought a report from the police chief, with instructions that the investigation be handed over to the best police officer.</p><small>2025-08-17 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/172250182d652f1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931482/fazl-questions-govts-writ-in-tribal-areas-as-various-political-parties-set-their-demands' target='_blank'><strong>Fazl questions govt’s writ in tribal areas as various political parties set their demands</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday questioned the government’s writ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s tribal areas as various political parties set their demands in a declaration at the Awami National Party-organised multiparty conference (MPC) in Islamabad.
The ANP organised the conference, which was attended by representatives from the PPP, JI, MQM, JUI-F and Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), among other parties
Speaking at the conference, Fazl said: “No doubt there is a question mark on the government’s writ [in KP’s tribal areas].”
He added that the tribal areas of the province are in the grip of armed groups, as people have to pay extortion money to them.
“Armed groups take 10 per cent of the officially approved funds,” he claimed.
He also questioned why there was a need to restore the jirga system after seven years of the merger of tribal areas with KP.
The multiparty conference also saw speeches by ANP central president Senator Aimal Wali Khan, National Democratic Movement chief Mohsin Dawar, Qaumi Watan Party chairman Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao and BNP-M’s Sanaullah Baloch, among others.
The conference’s declaration was read out by Aimal and termed the “ongoing unrest, terrorism and violation of constitutional rights in Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, as the result of past flawed domestic and foreign policies”.
It added that all the participating parties agree that sustainable peace and development in Pakistan is not possible without democracy, supremacy of the Constitution and the legitimate rights of provinces.
The resolution called for the cessation of all ongoing military operations in KP and Balochistan, adding that a truth commission should be formed under the supervision of the judiciary to conduct an impartial investigation into the human and financial losses.
“The so-called ‘death squads’ and illegal armed groups should be immediately eliminated, and the protection of public life and property should be ensured,” the resolution read.
It also called for the 18th Amendment to be fully implemented in accordance with its original spirit so that the provinces have their legitimate powers.
The declaration also “condemned” the conversion of the Frontier Constabulary into the Federal Constabulary, and opposed the proposal to merge the Levies with the police in Balochistan.
The failure to arrest the murderers of the ANP’s martyred leaders was also condemned. The declaration called for the establishment of a judicial commission for the killing of ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb.
Expressing regret over the flooding situation in KP, the MPC also postponed the ‘Islamabad Peace March’, previously scheduled for August 23.
“The new date of the Islamabad Peace March would be decided through mutual consultation,” the statement said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Earlier in the week, Aimal said that the law and order in KP was deteriorating rapidly, and feared that the worsening situation in Bajaur may engulf the entire province.
Around 55,000 people have been displaced from different areas of Mamund tehsil in Bajaur tribal district due to the military operation, while 400,000 residents remain hostage to the suddenly-imposed curfew, local lawmaker Nisar Baz had told the KP Assembly on Monday.</p><small>2025-08-17 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/172216475c630d1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931481/swat-school-principals-swift-order-saves-900-students-from-floods' target='_blank'><strong>Swat school principal’s swift order saves 900 students from floods</strong></a><br><p>Principal Saeed Ahmad’s swift order on Friday saved nearly 900 students in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat minutes before surging waters demolished the school.
“It was exactly 9am when I had a last glance at the stream and sensed it was going to burst its banks due to continuing rains,” Ahmad, 59, the school’s principal, told Anadolu. Ahmad ordered an immediate evacuation of nearly 950 enrolled students.
Within 15 minutes, the children and teachers had left. Minutes later, torrents of water smashed into the school, washing away half the building, its boundary walls and the playground.
“Around 900 students were present on August 15 when the flood struck our village and other adjoining areas,” said Sarwar Khan, a local councillor. “This timely action by the principal saved 900 lives.”
The school was one of dozens of educational institutions destroyed in floods that have wreaked havoc across several districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing more than 350 people in the past three days, officials said.
Ahmad, who has served as principal for 12 years, recalled that the same building was destroyed during floods in July 1995. “There were summer vacations; that’s why there was no casualty,” he said. “That incident was in my mind when I decided to evacuate.”
The monsoon season brings South Asia about three-quarters of its annual rainfall, vital for agriculture and food security, but also brings destruction.
“The intensity of this year’s monsoon is around 50 to 60pc more than last year,” said Lieutenant General Inam Haider, chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
“Two to three more monsoon spells are expected until the first weeks of September,” he told journalists in Islamabad.
Landslides and flash floods are common during the season, which usually begins in June and eases by the end of September. The torrential rains that have pounded Pakistan since the start of the summer monsoon have killed 657 people, with 929 injured, according to daily data from the NDMA.
Pakistan is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change and is contending with extreme weather events with increasing frequency.
In 2022, catastrophic floods submerged one-third of the country, killing over 1,700 people and causing an estimated $32 billion in damage.</p><small>2025-08-17 17:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/17211810cc091bc.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931456/death-toll-in-kp-floods-climbs-to-323-as-rescue-operations-continue' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll in KP floods climbs to 323 as rescue operations continue</strong></a><br><p>Rescue operations continued on Sunday after severe flash floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with the toll rising to 323 people dead and 156 injured, with 217 deaths recorded in Buner alone.
The KP government declared an emergency on Saturday as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond, with authorities warning that dozens of victims may still be trapped under debris.
On Sunday evening, the PDMA released an updated damage report outlining casualties and property damage from August 15 until 6:30pm.
“The dead include 273 men, 29 women and 21 children, while the injured include 123 men, 23 women and 10 children,” the PDMA stated.

The PDMA’s figures also show that 320 cattle heads were killed in the flooding, while 336 homes, 57 schools and 23 other structures were damaged or destroyed.
In Swat, 219 homes were affected, with 177 partially destroyed and 42 fully destroyed. Around 163 cattle heads also perished in the district, affecting people’s livelihoods.
“A total of 209 people have been displaced in Buner district, which was the most affected by the floods,” the PDMA report said. “These accidents occurred in different districts of the province, Swat, Buner, Bajaur, Torghar, Mansehra, Shangla and Battagram.”
The authority added that heavy rain was forecast from August 17-19, with ongoing rain expected to continue intermittently until August 21.
“The Emergency Operation Centre of PDMA is fully functional,” said the PDMA. “The public can contact the toll-free helpline 1700 for any untoward incident, weather condition updates and information.”
Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered federal ministers to supervise relief operations in KP, due to the severe damage.
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, additional relief goods are being dispatched to the flood-affected areas on the directives of PM Shehbaz, who is personally monitoring the relief operations of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in all flood-affected districts of KP.
“Teams of federal ministers, on the instructions of the prime minister will participate in the relief operations in the flood-affected areas,” Radio Pakistan reported.
 






Federal Minister for Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir Affairs and States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam will supervise the distribution of relief goods in the Shangla and Buner districts.
Minister for Power Division Awais Leghari will look after activities in Buner, and Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Yousaf will oversee operations in Mansehra. Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Mubarak Zeb will supervise relief distribution activities in Bajaur.
“Additional trucks carrying relief goods are being sent to the affected districts under the Prime Minister’s Relief Package,” Radio Pakistan reported. “The relief goods include rations, tents, and medicines, which are being district administrations.”
PM Shehbaz directed the NDMA chairman to stay in constant contact with the disaster management authorities of the provinces and Gilgit-Baltistan for better and coordinated relief efforts.
The PDMA completed its delivery of aid and relief packages later today, having successfully sent 89 trucks to Buner, Bajaur, Swat and Shangla.
The relief supplies included 1,800 family tents, 1,000 winterisation tents, 3,100 mattresses, 3,500 pillows, 1,500 hygiene kits, 3,300 kitchen sets, 2,100 pieces of tarpaulin, 3,300 mats, 4,400 mosquito nets, 3,800 blankets, 1,000 jerry cans, 1,000 beds, 1,750 solar lamps, 10 de-watering pumps, 10 generators, 100 life jackets and 500 gas cylinders.
The goods were delivered “keeping in mind the basic needs of the victims”, a statement from the authority read. “These supplies will be helpful in the immediate housing, daily life and rehabilitation process of the people in the affected areas.”
 






The authority added that it released Rs800 million for the affected districts, with Rs500m of that sum released to Buner to compensate affected families.
“Clear instructions have been issued to the deputy commissioners to provide financial assistance to the affected families as soon as possible,” the statement added. “PDMA has also ensured that there is no hindrance during the relief operations.”
Meanwhile, focal persons were posted at the Provincial Emergency Operation Centre to ensure the timely exchange of information and effective coordination between institutions.
The PDMA director general was quoted as saying that the authority is ready at all times to provide aid.
Meanwhile, PTV News reported that under the orders of the army chief, the Pakistan Army has started distributing rations to people in areas affected by flooding.
“Despite [the] bad weather, Pakistan Army helicopters are engaged in rescue and relief operations in various areas of Buner, Shangla and Swat,” the broadcaster wrote in a post on X, adding that helicopters have delivered rations to the area of Khwar Banda.
The post added that the rations include flour, rice, pulses, milk powder, salt, tea leaves and cooking oil, further stating that Pakistan Army helicopters are also transporting injured people, women and children from remote areas to safe locations.
“Pakistan Army doctors have set up medical camps in the affected areas, where free medicines are being distributed,” PTV News added.
A video attached to the post shows personnel dropping sacks and boxes of rations from a helicopter.
 






Karakoram Highway reopened: GB government
Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq told Dawn.com that the Karakoram Highway, blocked four days ago due to floods in Kohistan, was restored and opened for all types of traffic today.
“The Karakoram Gilgit-Rawalpindi section has been opened,” he said. “With the restoration of the highway, vehicles, passengers and tourists stranded in Gilgit and Rawalpindi have left for their destinations.”
According to the spokesman, the Karakoram Gilgit-Hunza section of the Hassanabad Highway remains closed due to flood erosion and work to reopen the road is progressing rapidly.
Earlier in the day, the KP PDMA released an update on the death and injury toll across the province, as well as damage to infrastructure and loss of cattle.
Buner district alone has accounted for 209 deaths and 120 injuries, according to the report, with 36 dead and 21 injured in Shangla.
Mansehra recorded a total of 24 deaths and five injuries, with a similar toll of 21 deaths and five injuries in Bajaur.
According to the PDMA report, 16 men died in Swat while two were injured. Meanwhile, in Lower Dir, five people died due to thunder strikes and roof collapse, with three people injured. Thunder strikes also killed three people in Battagram.

A total of 159 houses have been damaged — 62 of them fully — while 57 schools across KP have also been partially damaged.
According to initial details from the Buner Deputy Commissioner’s Office, machinery has been deployed to the affected areas. “However, due to continuous heavy rainfall, it is currently impossible to reopen the causeway at Gadezai.”
District officials and rescue teams have already been dispatched to the affected locations in the Gokand and Pir Baba areas, per the report, which also noted that rescue teams have recovered the dead bodies at Daggar Village.
In Swat, two women and several school students were safely rescued by local authorities.
“The situation remains critical in certain areas, and necessary response and relief operations are underway,” the PDMA report quoted a statement from the additional deputy commissioner’s office.

KP Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told AFP that the operation to rescue people trapped under debris is ongoing.
“There is still concern that dozens of people may be trapped under the rubble… the chances of those buried under the debris surviving are very slim,” Faizi said.
He added that around 2,000 rescue workers were engaged in recovering bodies from the debris and carrying out relief operations across nine districts, where rain was still hampering efforts.
AFP journalists in Buner saw half-buried vehicles and belongings lying strewn in the sludge, with mud covering houses and shops. Flooded roads hampered the movement of rescue vehicles, as a few villagers worked to cut fallen trees to clear the way after the water receded.

Meanwhile, KP PDMA Director General Asfandyar Khattak told AFP that those missing in Buner “could be trapped under the rubble of their homes or swept away by floodwaters”.
He noted that in Shangla, dozens of people are also reported missing.
“There is no electricity or mobile signal in Buner, as power lines and mobile towers were damaged,” he added.
KP CM says govt will relocate people from flood-prone areas
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has said that the government will relocate people who are in flood-prone areas and also provide them with houses.
Addressing the media in Swat, he said, “We will provide them (flood victims) with houses, but will request them to move to safer areas and will establish new settlements as well.”
Speaking about encroachments along rivers, the KP CM said: “We will not tolerate encroachments. The most thorough operation was done against them in Dera Ismail Khan, and I call on other parties and parliamentarians to also work towards that.”
“I would make the claim that the manner in which this rescue operation was done in such a quick manner, there is no parallel in history,” Gandapur added while responding to a question.
He said that the rescue phase of the operation is over, and now the authorities will be moving onto restoration and then compensation, reiterating that the government will compensate all the personal losses of the people.
He also spoke about the introduction of new technology to prevent damage due to flooding, because of cloud bursts and landslides.
Over 850 rescued across Buner
More than 850 people have been rescued and shifted to safer places while 181 bodies have been recovered in Buner’s districts of Gaddizi, Bishoni, Malikpur, Balokhan and other nearby areas which were worst affected, according to an update from Buner Rescue 1122 issued today.
“Dozens of houses in different districts have been reduced to rubble; agricultural lands and infrastructure have been severely damaged, while reports of loss of life are also alarming,” the update said.
In Daggar, the capital of Buner, 30 people died in Gokand, Kot and other districts, while 202 people, including women and children, were shifted to safer places.
A total of 41 bodies were recovered from Chagharzai while 35 people were rescued in injured condition and taken to the Rural Health Centre Hospital Gulbandi.
Three bodies were also recovered from the Salmani area of Mandanr and shifted to the district headquarters hospital.
“Buner Rescue 1122 personnel are continuously engaged in search and rescue operations day and night in the affected areas,” the statement said.
“Rescue personnel and emergency vehicles from Swabi have also joined the operation, while special rescue teams from Peshawar are also participating in relief activities in the affected areas.”
Rescue teams and district officials are continuously present in the field and on high alert to provide timely assistance to the affected people, it added.
Flooding caused by climate change: Sherry Rehman
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman wrote in a post on X that the flooding in KP, GB and AJK was “obviously triggered by global climate change”.
The senator, who previously served as a climate change minister, noted that climate change was being fuelled by rising emissions and “local institutional indifference to building real resilience for communities and society”.
“The mega monsoon of 2025 has already claimed over 300 lives — most in KP — triggering landslides that wiped out villages, hampering rescue efforts with helicopter crashes … mass displacements,” Rehman wrote.
 






The senator wrote that forests act as a shield against excess flooding, reducing bare-ground heating and “blunting climate shock and slowing water cascades”.
“Deforestation in Pakistan is driven by illegal logging, wildfires, and the conversion of forest land for agriculture, commercial development, and mushrooming housing schemes,” she wrote. “Pakistan has the highest deforestation rate in South Asia and only retains five per cent forest cover.
“In the last 33 years, Pakistan’s forest cover has alarmingly shrunk by 18pc, falling from 3.78 million hectares in 1992 to a mere 3.09 million hectares in 2025,” Rehman added.
“This devastating loss is most acute in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s districts like Swat, Chitral, Dir, Kohistan, and Shangla, where the illegal timber mafia relentlessly exploits ancient pine and deodar forests despite government bans imposed since 2002 and 2017.”
The senator added that locals reported the destruction of 30 to 40pc of Swat’s forests, with the potential for losses of up to 70pc if deforestation continues unchecked.
Punjab PDMA orders restriction of tourists to Murree
The Punjab PDMA has ordered that tourists be restricted from travelling to Murree and other “disaster-vulnerable areas in view of the ongoing surge in monsoon activities, particularly in mountainous regions.”
A letter in this regard was sent from the Punjab Board of Revenue to the secretary to the Government of Punjab, Tourism Department, the Rawalpindi Division Commissioner and the Murree Deputy Commissioner.
The government authority asked to restrict tourist entry to vulnerable and hazard-prone sites until the current monsoon spell subsides, as well as to
coordinate with law enforcement agencies for restrictions under Section 144, wherever required.
The authority also asked to ensure wide public awareness through electronic, print and social media regarding safety advisories.
Meanwhile, the Lower Dir district administration, on the orders of the KP government, distributed compensation cheques to the heirs of the five people who died in a roof collapse incident due to rain in Maidan area’s Suri Pao village.
 






The monsoon season brings South Asia about three-quarters of its annual rainfall, vital for agriculture and food security, but also brings destruction.

The Oscar-nominated actor starred in films ranging from Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Theorem in 1968 and A Season in Hell in 1971 to The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert in 1994 in which he played a transgender woman.
The family said in a statement to Reuters that Stamp died on Sunday morning.
“He leaves behind an extraordinary body of work, both as an actor and as a writer, that will continue to touch and inspire people for years to come,” the family said. “We ask for privacy at this sad time.”
Born in London’s East End in 1938, the son of a tugboat stoker, he endured the bombing of the city during World War II before leaving school to work initially in advertising, eventually winning a scholarship to go to drama school.
Famous for his good looks and impeccable dress sense, he formed one of Britain’s most glamorous couples with Julie Christie, with whom he starred in Far From the Madding Crowd in 1967. He also dated the model Jean Shrimpton and was chosen as a muse by photographer David Bailey.
After failing to land the role of James Bond to succeed Sean Connery, he appeared in Italian films and worked with Federico Fellini in the late 1960s.
He dropped out of the limelight and studied yoga in India before landing his most high-profile role — as General Zod, the megalomaniacal leader of the Kryptonians, in Superman in 1978 and its sequel in 1980.
He went on to appear in a string of other films, including Valkyrie with Tom Cruise in 2008, The Adjustment Bureau with Matt Damon in 2011 and movies directed by Tim Burton.</p><small>2025-08-17 17:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/172024561f99e28.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931479/european-leaders-to-join-ukraines-zelensky-in-trump-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>European leaders to join Ukraine’s Zelensky in Trump meeting</strong></a><br><p>European leaders will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on a Monday visit to Washington to see United States President Donald Trump in a collective bid to find a way to end Moscow’s invasion, with the US offering security guarantees for Kyiv.
The meeting follows a summit in Alaska between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that failed to yield any breakthrough on an immediate ceasefire that the US leader had been pushing for.
Trump, who pivoted afterwards to say he was now seeking a peace deal, on Sunday posted, “Big progress on Russia, stay tuned!” on his Truth Social platform, without elaborating.
Trump’s Russia envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday that Trump and Putin had agreed in their summit on “robust security guarantees” for Ukraine.
But Zelensky, on a Brussels visit hosted by European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen today, rejected the idea of Russia offering his country security guarantees.
“What President Trump said about security guarantees is much more important to me than Putin’s thoughts, because Putin will not give any security guarantees,” he said.
Von der Leyen hailed the US offer to provide security guarantees modelled on but separate from Nato’s collective security arrangement, known as Article 5.
“We welcome President Trump’s willingness to contribute to Article 5 — like
security guarantees for Ukraine, and the coalition of the willing, including the European Union, is ready to do its share,” von der Leyen said.
Hopes for ‘productive meeting’
Trump’s pivot to looking for a peace deal, not a ceasefire, aligns with the stance long taken by Putin, and which Ukraine and its European allies have criticised as Putin’s way to buy time with the intent of making battlefield gains.
Zelensky also said he saw “no sign” the Kremlin leader was prepared to meet him and Trump for a three-way summit, as had been floated by the US president.
The leaders heading to Washington on Monday to appear alongside Zelensky call themselves the “coalition of the willing”. They include British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte and von der Leyen.
Also heading to Washington will be Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubbs, who get on well with Trump. They all held a video meeting today to prepare their joint position.
Speaking to US broadcaster CNN, Witkoff said: “I’m hopeful that we have a productive meeting on Monday, we get to real consensus, we’re able to come back to the Russians and push this peace deal forward and get it done.”
 


US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking to NBC on Sunday, warned of “consequences” — including the potential imposition of new sanctions on Russia — if no peace deal is reached on Ukraine.
 


Territorial ‘concessions’
European leaders have expressed unease from the outset over Trump’s outreach to Putin, who has demanded Ukraine abandon its ambitions to join the EU or Nato. They were excluded from Trump’s summit with Putin.
Witkoff, in his CNN interview, said the United States was prepared to provide “game-changing” security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a process that would involve territorial “concessions”.
 
 

According to an official briefed on a call Trump held with Zelensky and European leaders as he flew back from Alaska, the US leader supported a Putin proposal that Russia take full control of two eastern Ukrainian regions in exchange for freezing the frontline in two others.
Putin “de facto demands that Ukraine leave Donbas”, an area consisting of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions in eastern Ukraine, which Russia currently only partly controls, the source said.
In exchange, Russian forces would halt their offensive in the Black Sea port region of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine, where the main cities are still under Ukrainian control.
Several months into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia in September 2022 claimed to have annexed all four Ukrainian regions even though its troops still do not fully control any of them.
“The Ukrainian president refused to leave Donbas,” the source said.
Meanwhile, the conflict in Ukraine rages on, with both Kyiv and Moscow launching attack drones at each other on Sunday.</p><small>2025-08-17 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/17194143baa4f66.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931473/7-killed-in-kps-kohat-over-personal-enmity-police-official' target='_blank'><strong>7 killed in KP’s Kohat over ‘personal enmity’: police official</strong></a><br><p>Seven people were shot dead over a personal enmity in the Raigi Sheno Khel area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s district Kohat on Saturday night, police said.
According to the first information report (FIR) available with Dawn.com and lodged by an injured complainant, Zahid Noor at the City police station: “Seven people from two families were killed in the firing when they were returning from the picnic at Raigi Sheno Khel area of Kohat district.”
It said that they had gone for the picnic to Tanda dam and upon returning from it, they came under attack from two sides, resulting in the deaths of six people on the spot.
The FIR copy said that one of the injured succumbed to the injuries at the KDA hospital.
Kohat District Police Officer Dr Zahidullah told Dawn.com that upon investigation, police found that the incident was a result of old enmity, adding, ’’the ones who were targeted have a history of enmity.“
The DPO further added that the deceased went to Tanda Dam, where, on their return — they were attacked. “There were a total of 11 individuals, of whom seven were attacked,’’ Zahidullah added.
According to the DPO, the deceased and injured mainly belonged to Tehsil Sadda of Kurram district and had been residing in Mohammad Zai village of Kohat for a long time due to family enmity.
The DPO told Dawn.com that police have started an investigation.
The police have initially registered a case against unknown persons and started further investigation. Moreover, after the incident, the relatives wanted to protest by placing the bodies on Hangu Road, but the protest was cancelled due to the efforts of local elders and the assurance of the police that  the culprits would be arrested at the earlier.
The first information report was lodged under sections 302 (premeditated murder) and 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Last month, rivals shot dead two individuals and injured another over a murder enmity in the Miankhel Bazaar of Kohat city, police had said.
In June, the police arrested PPP leader and former provincial minister Malik Amjid Afridi in Islamabad in connection with the murder of former district nazim Engineer Malik Asad.

The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations.
Pakistan said it downed six Indian planes during the conflict, including advanced French-made Dassult Rafale jets. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
 
 

Addressing a seminar in Lahore today, Naqvi said he was involved in several matters surrounding the war with India and was privy to several key pieces on information.
“The army, air force, navy and government have all been acknowledged during the past month-and-a-half, but our intelligence agencies were doing important work behind the scenes,” he said.
“Our institutions had information on India’s (plans) well ahead of time. We knew whatever they (India) planned, what aircraft they would use. Our intelligence agencies’ role was so important, but they do not come forward. We need to acknowledge them.”
The interior minister said that when Indian planes were downed, the decision was made not to announce this without evidence.
“We had radar data, but we needed field evidence,” he explained. “Within minutes, we received video footage of all six planes which were shot down. We have this footage.”
Naqvi then outlined two incidents where seven Indian missiles struck a Pakistani base, adding that once they were launched, it became clear they were heading across the border.
“People got worried, we have important hardware at this base,” he said, not mentioning the base’s name or location. “Not a single missile hit that base. Some fell short, some hit outside the base.
“When we launched our missiles, we targeted military installations near populated areas, but made every effort to avoid civilian casualties,” Naqvi added. “We destroyed one of their biggest oil depots and there were no civilian casualties. That is when we knew that God was helping us.”
The interior minister added that Nur Khan Airbase near Rawalpindi, which was struck by Indian missiles, suffered no damage.
“We had damage at one base where a member of the air force was martyred, but that’s about it,” he said.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
In July, United States President Donald Trump said that five jets were shot down during the conflict. He made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, but did not specify which side’s jets he was referring to.
While describing Pakistan’s response to the Indian Air Force, PAF Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed on May 12 said the PAF’s response was based “on the time and place of own choosing”, displaying “bold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership”.
Last month, Chinese air force chief Lieutenant General Wang Gang lauded the “exemplary performance” during the aerial clash, praising the “decisive and measured response delivered by PAF pilots under the resolute leadership of the air chief”.</p><small>2025-08-17 14:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/17170354703579d.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931469/child-killed-parents-injured-as-ambulance-hits-motorcycle-in-kps-haripur' target='_blank'><strong>Child killed, parents injured as ambulance hits motorcycle in KP’s Haripur</strong></a><br><p>A child was killed while her parents were injured when a speeding ambulance hit their motorbike near Sikandar Pur in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur city on Sunday, police said.

“When we reached near Sikandarpur on the busy Chappar Road, a recklessly driven ambulance hit us from behind,” Yaseen was quoted as saying by Hasan Khan, spokesperson for the Haripur district police officer. “Fatima died instantly, and we both suffered minor injuries.”
Hadi Khan, an eyewitness, told Dawn.com, “The girl died instantly after being crushed under the tyres of the ambulance.”
The injured couple and the girl’s body were transported to the Haripur Trauma Centre, where the parents received emergency treatment and were later discharged from the hospital, according to the spokesperson.
It was the second road accident of a similar nature reported from Haripur.
“On Saturday evening, a one-month-old boy was also died and his parents were injured when their motorcycle collided with a motor car on Khanpur road,” the spokesperson said.
Earlier this month, a policeman escorting a foreign delegation was killed while six others, including a deputy superintendent of police, were injured when a van overturned near the Chechiyan interchange on Hazara Motorway, some four kilometres from Haripur city.
The incident, according to police, occurred when the front tyre of the escort van burst and the driver lost control, causing it to overturn.</p><small>2025-08-17 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/171441549351cec.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931461/one-dead-33-injured-after-four-coaches-of-a-karachi-bound-train-derail-in-punjabs-lodhran' target='_blank'><strong>One dead, 33 injured after four coaches of a Karachi-bound train derail in Punjab’s Lodhran</strong></a><br><p>At least one passenger died while 33 were injured after four coaches of the Karachi-bound train derailed and overturned late last night in Punjab’s Lodhran, Rescue 1122 said on Sunday.
According to a statement from Rescue 1122, the Awami Express train was travelling from Lahore to Karachi when the incident happened.
“Four coaches of the train suddenly derailed due to brake failure near the Lodhran Railway Station”, the statement said.
“The incident left one person dead while another 33 were injured, out of which 11 received medical assistance at the site of the incident, and the rest were immediately rushed to the District Hospital in Lodhran.”
It further said that two critically injured persons were transferred to a hospital in Bahawalpur.
Expressing grief over the loss of life, Minister for Railways Muhammad Hanif Abbasi vowed to take disciplinary action against those responsible for the incident.
He ordered an inquiry into the incident and directed authorities to submit a report within seven days.
“No one can be allowed to play with human lives under any circumstances. We have started reforms within the railways department, and people will benefit from it soon,” Abbasi said in a statement.
The minister directed the railway authorities to complete the restoration of the track, as trains scheduled to pass through the track were diverted.
Pakistan Railway Headquarters has called an emergency meeting for tomorrow, presided over by the railway minister. The minister said he will also visit the site of the accident.
The rest of the passengers were accommodated in an alternate train, according to the railway ministry.
The incident comes days after two coaches of the Peshawar-bound Awam Express derailed close to the Khanpur railway station near Rahim Yar Khan, leaving multiple passengers injured, while another Multan-bound Musa Pak Express also got off the track, raising questions about the safety of Pakistan railways.
Earlier this month, at least 29 people were injured as an Islamabad Express passenger train derailed near Kala Shah Kaku in Punjab’s Sheikhupura district.
The incident also caused massive damage to the rolling stock and a large portion of the track.</p><small>2025-08-17 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/171445066ea6699.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931462/modis-tax-overhaul-to-strain-finances-but-boost-image-amid-us-trade-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Modi’s tax overhaul to strain finances but boost image amid US trade tensions</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s deepest tax cuts in eight years will strain government revenues but are winning praise from businesses and political pundits who say they will bolster his image in an ongoing trade fight with Washington.
In the biggest tax overhaul since 2017, Modi’s government on Saturday announced sweeping changes to the complex goods and services tax (GST) regime which will make daily essentials and electronics cheaper from October, helping consumers and also companies like Nestle, Samsung and LG Electronics.
At the same time, in his Independence Day speech on Friday, Modi urged Indians to use more goods made domestically, echoing calls from many of his supporters to boycott US products after Donald Trump hiked tariffs on imports from India to 50 per cent as of August 27.
 
 

The tax cut plan comes with costs given GST is a major revenue generator. IDFC First Bank says the cuts will boost India’s GDP by 0.6 percentage points over 12 months but will cost the state and federal government $20 billion annually.
But it will improve weak stock market sentiment and bring political dividends for Modi ahead of a critical state election in the eastern state of Bihar, said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation.
“GST reduction will impact everyone, unlike cuts to income tax, which is paid by only 3-4pc of the population. Modi is doing this as he is under a lot of pressure due to US policies,” said Kidwai.
“The move will also help the stock market, which is now politically important as it has a lot of retail investors.”
India launched the major tax system in 2017 that subsumed local state taxes into the new, nationwide GST to unify its economy for the first time.
But the biggest tax reform since India’s independence faced criticism for its complex design that taxes products and services under four slabs — 5pc, 12pc, 18pc and 28pc.
Last year, India said caramel popcorn would be taxed at 18pc but the salted category at 5pc, triggering criticism about a glaring example of GST’s complexities.
Under the new system, India will abolish the 28pc slab — which includes cars and electronics — and move nearly all of the items under the 12pc category to the lower 5pc slab, benefitting many more consumer items and packaged foods.
Government data shows the 28pc and 12pc tax slabs together garner 16pc of India’s annual GST revenue of roughly $250 billion last fiscal year.
‘A brighter gift’ and politics
Bihar is a key state politically and goes to the polls by November. A recent survey by the VoteVibe agency showed Modi’s opposition has an edge largely because of a lack of jobs.
“Any tax cut has wide public appreciation. But of course, the timing is purely determined by political exigencies,” said Dilip Cherian, a communications consultant and co-founder of Indian public relations firm Perfect Relations.
“It seems to be an indication of some mixture of frustration as well as recognition that there is a broad public pushback against high and crippling rates of taxation.”
Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has seized on his tax announcement, posting on X that on the Hindu festival of lights, Diwali, “a brighter gift of simpler taxes and more savings is waiting for every Indian.”
 






Modi has vowed to protect farmers, fishermen and cattlemen, following Trump’s surprise tariff announcement on India, after trade talks between New Delhi and Washington collapsed over disagreement on opening India’s vast farm and dairy sectors and stopping Russian oil purchases.
The latest round of trade talks between the two nations set for August 25-29 has also been called off.</p><small>2025-08-17 09:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/17133424ef7727b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931457/salman-agha-to-lead-pakistans-asia-cup-squad-as-babar-rizwan-left-out' target='_blank'><strong>Salman Agha to lead Pakistan’s Asia Cup squad as Babar, Rizwan left out</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan left out Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan from the T20 squad named on Sunday for the Asia Cup and a warm-up tri-series beginning this month against Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates, according to a press release issued by the Pakistan Cricket Board.
Azam and Rizwan have been star performers in the shortest format in the past, but have not played since December, which head coach Mike Hesson put down to other players performing well while addressing a press conference.
 






“We know what a fine player Babar (Azam) is,” said Hesson.
“Babar has been asked to improve in certain areas, like taking on spin and in terms of his strike rate, and he is working hard on these things.
“The players we have are performing well and having a positive impact,” said Hesson.
Since Hesson took over as head coach in May, Pakistan have played three T20 series — winning 3-0 at home but losing 2-1 away to Bangladesh. They then beat the West Indies 2-1 in the United States.
“Our focus is to win the tri-series and the Asia Cup, and the aim is to peak from these pinnacle events,” said Hesson.
All-rounder Salman Agha will lead the side, which also sees the return of fast bowlers Mohammad Wasim and Salman Mirza.
Mirza took seven wickets in Bangladesh but was left out of the squad against the West Indies.
Opener Fakhar Zaman also returns after being injured for a one-day international series in the West Indies last week, which Pakistan lost 2-1.
The tri-series, which starts on August 29, and the Asia Cup from September 9 will both take place in the UAE.

• Punjab PDMA issues ‘red alert’ for multiple districts
• Tarbela Dam is 98pc full; India releases more water
RAWALPINDI/LAHORE: The authorities have been asked to remain on their toes amid a fresh spell of monsoon rains, set to start from today till the 21st, which will cause torrential downpours across the country along with thunder and windstorms.
The new spell coincides with a warning of heavy flooding in Punjab’s rivers due to an increase in water level on the back of the heavy monsoon rains and glacial melt in the northern parts of the country, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where over 200 people had died in a single day due to flash floods.
The Pakistan Meteorological Depart­m­ent (PMD) said widespread rain-wind/thu­­ndershower (with scattered heavy falls at times very heavy) is expected in Kash­mir (Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Ra­­walakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Have­­li, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, Mirpur) and Gilgit-Baltistan (Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche, Shigar) from August 17 to 19 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, widespread rain-wind/thundershower (with scattered heavy falls at times very heavy) is ex­­p­e­cted in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Sha­ngla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Waziristan, Tank, and Dera Ismail Khan from August 17 to 19.
 
 

In Punjab, widespread rain-wind/thundershower (with scattered heavy falls, at times very heavy) is expected in Islam­abad/Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Atto­­ck, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Wazir­ab­­ad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, Faisalabad and Sahiwal from Au­­g­­ust 17 to 19 with occasional gaps. Scat­tered rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) is also likely in Dera Ghazi Khan, Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan, Ba­­­­hawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rajanpur, and Rahimyar Khan from August 18 to 20.
In Sindh, rain-wind/thundershower (with scattered heavy falls at times very heavy) is expected in Mithi, Tharparker, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Sha­heed Benazirabad, Karachi, Thatta, Bad­in, Sajawal, Tando Allayar, Tando Muh­a­mmad Khan, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, and Jacobabad from August 17 to 22 with occasional gaps.

The PMD said the downpour may generate flash floods in local nullahs and streams in different parts of KP, Punjab, and Kashmir from August 17 to 19, while flash floods in the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and eastern parts of Baloch­istan from August 18 to 21 are also likely.
Urban centres, including Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar, and Gujranwala, may experience urban flooding from August 17 to 19, it said, adding that several cities in Sindh, including Karachi and Hyderabad, may experience the same from August 17 to 22 with occasional gaps. During the forecast period, landslides and mudslides may cause road closures in the hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Galiyat, and Kashmir.
Punjab floods warning
On the other hand, Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued red alerts for multiple districts and warned about heavy flooding in the coming days due to an increase in water levels in reservoirs and rivers.
The Indus River is swelling to medium levels at Kalabagh and Chashma Barrage, while low-level flooding is ongoing at Tar­bela and Taunsa Barrage. Sutlej River is experiencing low-level flooding at Ganda Singh Wala, with a water flow of 68,000 cusecs. Jhelum River is flowing normal at key points and adjoining streams. Chenab River’s flow is normal at key points, while low-level flooding persists in Nullah Palkho (Cantonment). Ravi River’s flow is normal at key points, while low-level flooding continues in Nullah Basantar.
Tarbela Dam is 98 per cent full while Mangla Dam is 68pc full. India’s water releases, meanwhile, have increased to 50,000 cusecs.
The PDMA urged citizens, especially those living near riverbanks, to immediately move to safer locations, cooperate with the authorities concerned in case of emergency evacuations, and refrain from recreational activities near the rivers during flood conditions.
The PDMA also warned of heavy rainfall in most districts of Punjab, particularly the northern districts facing risks of torrential rains and cloudbursts. The seventh spell of monsoon rains is relatively stronger, with forecasts of severe downpours, it added.
