In a post on X on Sunday night, Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on scoring a win in the final against the Green Shirts, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor — an operation that was launched against Pakistan during the four-day military conflict between the two countries in May.
“#OperationSindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he said.
 






In response to Modi’s post, Naqvi said, “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”.
“Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he said.
 






The exchange also follows the Indian cricket team refusing to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries.
“I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said on Sunday night.
PCB donates match fee to May 7 victims
Separately, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Monday that it would donate the team’s match fees to the civilians martyred during the May 7 Indian attack on Pakistan, after India’s SuryaKumar Yadav announced that he would donate his match fee to victims on the Indian side.
In a post on X, the the cricketing board said, “The Pakistan Cricket Team has dedicated its Asia Cup final match fees to the innocent victims martyred in the May 7 attack, in which civilians, including children, lost their lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families.”
 






India’s actions ‘disrespected cricket’: Salman Agha
Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Salman Agha said that India’s actions had “disrespected cricket” while speaking to reporters after the match, accroding to AFP.
“I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing,” Agha said.
“If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket.”
“What they did today, a good team doesn’t do that. Good teams do what we have done. We waited for our medals and took them.
“It’s been seen for the first time. I do not know where it will stop. What has happened in this tournament is bad for cricket,” he said.
Meanwhile, Yadav claimed that India was “denied” the trophy, but then went on to say that the team “took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy”.
“If you tell me about the trophies, my trophies are sitting in my dressing room — all the 14 players and support staff. They are the real trophies for me,” said Yadav.
‘Lack of sportsmanship’
Although the Pakistan-India matches went ahead despite calls from the Indian side to boycott them, all three were marred by controversy and high tensions between the two countries in the wake of their four-day military standoff in May.
India displayed consistent hostility towards the Pakistan team throughout each of their clashes, including refusing to shake hands with the players at the end of the games.
In addition, after the first victory against Pakistan on September 14, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was accused of politicising the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May, for which India blamed Islamabad without evidence.
Naqvi had expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” in a post on X and lodged a complaint with the ICC, which launched a probe into the remarks.
 






Further, during the September 21 match, when the rivals met for the second time, Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the match.
The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which killed more than two dozen people. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention. Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p><small>2025-09-29 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28204723aaf38a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945006/beyond-the-security-paradigm-what-pakistan-must-do-to-truly-leverage-the-defence-pact-with-saudi-arabia' target='_blank'><strong>Beyond the security paradigm: What Pakistan must do to truly leverage the defence pact with Saudi Arabia</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia’s Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA), signed at Al Yamamah Palace on Sept 17, is an inflection point for the bilateral relationship as well as the broader region.
The pact’s core commitment is unambiguous: an attack on one will be treated as an attack on both. That collective-defence clause matters in a region recalibrating its security architecture and hedging against external shocks.
But the real test of this agreement lies in how Islamabad and Riyadh can pivot from security symbolism to a joint economic mission anchored in reform, productivity and strategic integration across the security, industrial, and technological domains.
This requires Pakistan and Saudi Arabia working across multiple pillars to pursue economic, defence, and technological integration between the two economies. The strategy should be anchored in a clear economic agenda aligned with both countries’ need to reorient their economies.
 
 

On the Saudi side, this reorientation requires investments in building a competitive industrial and digital ecosystem, and on the Pakistani side, the goal is to generate economic growth through sectors that expand the country’s ability to sustainably earn foreign exchange.
Given this need, a Pakistani strategy that chases cheap loans, deferred oil payments or one-off discounts from Saudi Arabia in lieu of the SDMA would be futile and disastrous. The Saudis have clearly signalled that the era of handouts is over, and Pakistani policymakers should pay heed to this signalling.
The need of the hour therefore is to pursue a strategy that plugs Pakistan into Saudi Arabia’s investment, technology and supply-chain ambitions. This would require doing the hard work at home to direct Saudi capital into sectors that deliver mutually beneficial outcomes for both nations.
The big picture
Within this context, the defence track can be a bridge to industrial cooperation and economic integration. As Dr Jamal Al Harbi, the Saudi Media Attaché in Islamabad put it in a recent article, the pact “includes defence industry collaboration, with potential for technology transfer and co-production of military equipment, as well as capacity building and training, building on the longstanding tradition of Pakistani military personnel working with Saudi forces.”
This perspective points to a broader state of play between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and if pursued effectively, the SDMA is likely to lead to a strategic embrace that links security with industrial production, technology cooperation, and defence integration.
The first area of focus must be Pakistan’s energy markets, which remain trapped in a cycle of inefficiency, political paralysis, and circular debt. An ambitious deregulation programme to open the entire energy value chain, including oil, gas, refineries, and battery energy storage, would help attract Saudi capital under clear, rules-based frameworks.
For this to work, Islamabad would need to commit to time-bound reforms, ensure predictable contract enforcement, and empower regulators while disempowering the administrative state that insists on running the energy ecosystem, to disastrous effects. This initiative should also look at emerging technologies in energy, including electric vehicles, battery energy storage, and decentralised grids.
Such a programme would provide Riyadh the opportunity to acquire long-duration assets in Pakistan. It would also align with Vision 2030’s ambition to make Saudi Arabia an international investor in energy and industrial platforms, especially in emerging energy solutions.
For Pakistan, it promises stable supplies, reduced fiscal pressure, and a credible pathway for private capital to flow into a critical sector that is in dire need of reforms. In addition, Saudi capital can support Pakistan to build a future ready clean energy ecosystem paired with electric vehicles and large-scale battery energy storage capabilities.
Secondly, as articulated by Dr Al Harbi, the defence pact should evolve into industrial co-production. Aligning with Saudi Arabia’s defence-localisation targets, Pakistan can set up co-production hubs for drones, conventional platforms, secure communications, and cyber capabilities.
 
 

These facilities would need to emphasise local content, testing and qualification labs, and joint research and development. Other partners could also be plugged into this framework — some of this is already being signalled — creating a regional defence industrial ecosystem over the coming years that would allow for diversification of supply-chains and greater interoperability.
For Riyadh, this initiative would help diversify supply chains while advancing sovereign capabilities consistent with Vision 2030. For Pakistan, it provides industrial upgrading, skilled jobs, and technological gains that can spill over into other sectors and bilateral relationships.
The third pillar is investment, particularly through the Public Investment Fund (PIF). In addition to the energy sector, PIF investments can be directed into Pakistan’s emerging critical minerals sectors, including copper, gold, and rare earths, as well as initiatives for defence cooperation. Pakistan is already collaborating with the United States on critical minerals and mining, and bringing in PIF would further diversify interests and investments in Pakistan. As Barrick Mining’s flagship Reko Diq project becomes operational, its success can be leveraged to access PIF investment for processing and value-add capabilities in the mining sector.
For Saudi Arabia, such investments would help secure inputs for electric vehicles, defence systems, and clean-energy supply chains, while creating deal flow for PIF and companies like Ma’aden. For Pakistan, the flow of funds would lead to sustainable exports, adding to overall macroeconomic stability while lowering risk premium for finance and crowding in other investors. In addition, scaling up defence industrial capabilities would add to the country’s overall ability to defend itself and deter its rivals in the region.
The fourth opportunity lies in skills and technology. Both countries need to build their capacities when it comes to artificial intelligence, fintech, cybersecurity, and data processing at scale. This initiative could be led through joint startup accelerators in Riyadh, Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad, along with reciprocal seed funds to support founders building products for the region.
Such an initiative would help support Riyadh’s needs for securing access to a young and cost-effective talent pool that can power Vision 2030’s execution. For Pakistan, it would add further momentum to the country’s emerging information technology sector, creating middle-class jobs that earn foreign exchange while embedding the country’s technology firms in regional innovation.
Opportunities for fintech
The final pillar should seek to build joint capabilities around financial technology and inclusion. Pakistan is one of the largest recipients of remittances from Saudi Arabia, yet much of these flows remain expensive. A dedicated fintech vertical that is designed to cut financial friction within both economies, as well as in the flow of remittances, would be extremely impactful. In a world where Pakistani talent integrates with Saudi Arabia’s technology ecosystem, the increase in financial flows would require even greater investments in financial integration and innovation.
By linking Saudi fintechs and banks directly with Pakistani institutions, and integrating instant payments, shared e-KYC, and robust AML protocols, both countries could benefit.
 
 

Pakistan would see billions of dollars move into the formal economy, stabilising foreign-exchange reserves and improving worker welfare. Saudi Arabia would deepen its fintech ecosystem, while offering faster, more transparent channels for its expatriate community. The additional dividends through the development of credit histories for workers, wage-linked savings, and micro-insurance would create a virtuous cycle of financial inclusion.
All of this, however, will remain aspirational unless anchored in credible execution. What Pakistan needs is the discipline to turn this defence pact into an economic one that advances reform, productivity, and integration into regional value chains. If pursued with clarity, the SMDA could be remembered not just as a security commitment, but as the moment Islamabad and Riyadh truly began to reshape their economies together through integration. But if leveraged to secure access to cheap financial bailouts and discounted oil, the SDMA is likely to lead to disappointing outcomes.

The Pakistani government in June had decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” to end the India-Pakistan escalation in May. Relations between the two countries turned exceedingly sour after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, launched airstrikes in Pakistan, and faced retaliation.
Amid easing tensions following a ceasefire bet­ween India and Pakistan, Presi­dent Donald Trump claimed that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations.
Responding to a reporter’s question about Pakistan nominating Trump for the Nobel Prize during a press conference in London today, the PM said, “Mr Trump eased tension between Pakistan and India and has saved the region from major destruction.”
He emphasised that if Trump had not intervened in the Pakistan-India escalation, “there would be more destruction and loss of lives.”
The premier added that Trump has eased tension between Ethiopia and Egypt, and even in Ukraine.”

The court also issued notices to the respondents in the case as well as the attorney general of Pakistan and adjourned the hearing till tomorrow.
A complaint pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council (SKC) last year in July, while a petition challenging his appointment was filed in the IHC earlier this year. The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
On September 16, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri then challenged the decision in the SC, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside and suspended during the pendency of the petition, and for the division bench to be directed to hold back from proceeding further.
Today, a five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, and including Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan took up Justice Jahangiri’s petition.
Also present at today’s hearing were Justice Jahangiri himself, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kiani, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz.
Also present at the hearing was the Islamabad Council member Aleem Abbasi, who requested the bench to make him, the council and the District Bar Association respondents in the case.
To this, Justice Mandokhel asked if they were a respondent in the IHC case as well, stating that the main petitioner was Justice Jahangiri.
Justice Aminuddin Khan, responding to this, said that the “SC will follow its own standard procedure and fix the application once it has been numbered.”
For his part, Justice Jahangiri’s lawyer, Munir A. Malik, told the court that this was the first instance that “a two-member judge has prevented a judge of its own high court from judicial work”. He argued that order issued against Justice Jahangiri was in violation of the law while the requirements of justice were also not met.
He noted that a writ petition was filed against Justice Jahangiri on July 10, 2024. “More than a year has passed yet the objections raised by the registrar’s office are still pending,” he said.
He told the court that after the writ petition against Justice Jahangiri was filed, there were several incidents of note, including the “transfer of three judges to IHC, which five IHC judges contested, but it was later declared valid”.
He said that the judge who issued the Sept 16 order against his client was the one against whose transfer the plea had been filed in the SC.
He reiterated that the objections raised on the plea filed against Justice Jahangiri still remained and the other parties in the case had not yet been heard. “Sixteen months have passed [since the plea was filed] and the objections still remain,” he said.
He also highlighted a recent order issued by the SC’s Justice Mandokhail, which stated that judges cannot initiate contempt proceedings against their peers and established that only the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has the constitutional authority to probe misconduct allegations against the judges of both the apex and high courts.
Meanwhile, Justice Hassan wondered how the plea against Justice Jahangiri was fixed for hearing when objections were raised by the registrar’s office. He told the lawyers of both sides to prepare arguments in this regard.
The hearing was subsequently adjourned for tomorrow.</p><small>2025-09-29 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29114724f2aa0d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945426/hpv-vaccine-campaign-extended-for-3-days-in-punjab-to-maximise-coverage-health-minister' target='_blank'><strong>HPV vaccine campaign extended for 3 days in Punjab to maximise coverage: health minister</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Imran Nazir said on Monday that the province was extending the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaign until Wednesday, hoping to achieve a target of 100 per cent.
Earlier in September, Pakistan rolled out the HPV vaccine nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. However, vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities.
“Success rate in Punjab has been 72pc,” Punjab’s health minister said during an interview with Geo News show “Geo Pakistan”.
“But we have not ended the campaign; instead, we have extended it for three days.”
He added, “The primary reason is that if we administer this vaccine to our girls now, those aged 9 to 14 will get it for free. But after the campaign ends, people will have to pay money for it, and only 9-year-old girls will be able to get it free of charge.”
Referring to the attacks on women health workers while administering vaccines in Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin district, the minister said he has ensured the suspects were arrested and that security measures have been put in place to protect health workers.
In the latest incident this week, the HPV vaccination team was performing its duty in a non-formal education school in the village of Ratuwal, within the limits of Kathian Sheikhan police station, when a 55-year-old resident of the village entered the school and attempted to attack a female health supervisor.
He said the rate of refusals was greater at the beginning of the campaign, with only 250,000 girls receiving the vaccine on the first day. However, towards the end, the number of refusals dropped to 90,000 from 300,000 after counselling was provided through their teams.
“More than 5.2 million girls have been vaccinated; however, our target was 7.2 million, which we hope to achieve by Wednesday,” the minister said.</p><small>2025-09-29 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68d94c173316e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945229/digitising-balochistans-finance' target='_blank'><strong>Digitising Balochistan’s finance</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan records the weakest socio-eco­nomic indicators in Pakistan. As highlighted in the United Nations Development Programme’s Multidimensional Poverty Index Report, nearly 71 per cent of the province’s population lives in multidimensional poverty, the highest in the country.
Development outcomes in health, education, water, sanitation, and hygiene remain persistently poor, reflecting the province’s chronic underdevelopment and the urgent need for sustained policy attention. Poor management, especially Balochistan’s fiscal mismanagement, has perpetuated governance challenges, with inefficient fund allocation and under-utilisation hindering development despite increased federal transfers under the 7th National Finance Commission Award.
Balochistan has never seen full utilisation of funds in its history, except for the development budget 2024-25 when the province utilised 90pc of its funds. The federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP_ funds have unfortunately followed the same trend, wherein, historically, Balochistan has received approximately 8–10pc of the total federal PSDP allocations, often resulting in prolonged project timelines, slow releases and delayed completions.
Institutional incapacity, corruption and the province’s political economy, characterised by patronage-based politics and clientelism, have always hindered effective planning, timely execution of development initiatives and efficient service delivery.

If properly executed, the province’s digitalisation initiative could lead to increased transparency, data accessibility and resource management

In such a situation, Baloc­histan’s recent attempts at the digitisation of the system can be instrumental in putting the province on a path towards development and good governance.
Across the globe, digitisation of public administration has emerged as a foundation for enhancing efficiency, transparency, accountability and citizen-centric service delivery. Reco­nising this necessity, the Government of Balochistan has introduced the Digital Financial Management Information System, including the Finance GPT and E-Filing System. This initiative marks an attempt to transition towards digital governance along with the intent to reform.
Developed by the finance department under the Public Finance Management reforms, the initiative was formally launched by the Chief Minister of Balochistan Mir Sarfraz Bugti on September 16, 2025. This appears to be a potential positive step towards efficiency and regulation for development.
The initiative consists of e-filing and digital financial management aimed at streamlining financial systems and minimising bureaucratic delays and public oversight. The Finance GPT, obviously inspired by ChatGPT, is a take on the AI tool claimed to have been pioneered by the Balochistan government to understand and accordingly answer questions or prompts by individuals. The provincial public sector data, including human resources, budget, development projects and other related information, has been linked with the tool to provide a window for policymakers, officers and the common masses to seek any information they want.
This effort could be instrumental in minimising red tape bureaucracy and making civil servants accountable to the people. Above all, ease of business could become a reality for attracting investors to take part in Balochistan’s growth and development.
While the e-filing system, supported by the Finance GPT, represents a step toward e-governance, it will require continuous effort and time to fully mature; its potential to restructure governance and improve service delivery may be present, but unless decided effort is poured into the project, it may very well fall through.
However, if properly executed, the programme could display many benefits. By placing information directly in the hands of citizens, the initiative can foster greater public participation in policy formulation, budget processes, and accountability mechanisms. For policymakers, the system could become a powerful tool to collect data, conduct analysis, and make informed and evidence-based decisions in a province that otherwise suffers from a crippling lack of useable data.
In terms of monitoring and supervision, authorities could track human resource availability and performance in real time, identifying gaps and ensuring timely redressal. Furthermore, universities and research institutions could take advantage of this digital system to advance research, policy studies, and development initiatives.
The journey toward e-governance in Balochistan is not and will not be without hurdles. Scaling the system across all departments and down to the grassroots level will require overcoming deep-rooted inefficiencies, lack of capacity among lower-tier officials, resistance from segments of the civil bureaucracy and vested interest groups.
Added to this are intrinsic structural barriers such as the energy crisis and limited internet accessibility in the districts, which can slow down implementation. Addressing these challenges demands strong political will, administrative commitment, institutional strengthening, and continuous capacity building.
If pursued with consistency and determination, these reforms can transform Balochistan into a digitally enabled province where good governance, inclusive growth, and efficient service delivery can become a reality.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, September 29th, 2025</p><small>2025-09-29 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945226/there-goes-the-dollar-dream' target='_blank'><strong>There goes the dollar dream</strong></a><br><p>A steep hike in US visa fees for immigrant workers may affect remittance inflows from America, but with its share at roughly 10 per cent of Pakistan’s total remittances, the overall impact is likely to be limited. The strain will fall harder on families and firms dependent on US earnings, while higher costs may also push Pakistani youth seeking study and work opportunities abroad to explore alternative destinations.
President Donald Trump’s executive order last week imposed a steep $100,000 fee on new H-1B skilled worker visas, up from the earlier range of $1,500 to $5,000, depending on company size. The move has alarmed Pakistani professionals and businesses that rely heavily on US opportunities.
The steep visa fee hike is intended to curb system abuse and safeguard American workers. It is expected to discourage US companies from hiring foreign talent at the current levels, adding fuel to wider debate on remittances and labour market.
 
 

Confusion initially surrounded the scope of the new visa fee. Early interpretations, sparking alarm in the high-tech sector that relies heavily on foreign talent, suggested the $100,000 charge was annual. The White House later clarified it is one-time fee applied only at the submission of a new H-1B petition. The rule does not affect current H-1B holders or applicants who filed before Sept 21.

The new pricey H-1B visa may reshape skilled migration to the US, redirecting Pakistani professionals towards Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australia and even China

The US Department of Labour is reportedly updating prevailing wage rules to restrict H-1B visas to highly qualified foreign workers. At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security has announced that the H-1B lottery will prioritise higher-paid, high skilled applicants over lower-earning candidates, with further reforms to visa regime under review. The H-1B category was originally introduced in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush.
The critics of the ‘liberal’ H-1B regime argue it is being exploited by recruitment firms to import workers at wages below those paid to Americans, undercutting local jobs while gaming the system. Currently, the minimum annual salary for H-1B visa holders is $60,000, while a comparable American tech worker often earns $100,000 or more.
The top five beneficiaries of the H-1B skilled worker visa programme are Indians, Chinese, Filipinos, Canadians and South Koreans. US government data for 2024 shows Indians received 71pc of approved H-1B visas, followed by Chinese nationals with 11.7pc, Filipinos 1.3 pc, Canadians 1.1pc and South Koreans 1pc.
When it comes to employers sponsoring H-1B visas, the picture is more complex and reflects a shifting pattern. For years, Indian technology companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Cognizant, Infosys and Wipro dominated, consistently holding top four spots since 2009. In recent years, US tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon have also emerged as major recruiters of immigrant talent.

Currently, the minimum annual salary for H-1B visa holders is $60,000, while a comparable American tech worker often earns $100,000 or more.

Following President Trumps announcement, media reports said several companies and banks with large immigrant workforces issued memos advising employees not to travel abroad to avoid potential visa complications.
Pakistan may not be among the hardest hit, but has also long benefited from the H-1B visa programme, with its skilled workers employed in the US in fields of information technology, engineering, management, banking, and healthcare. The new steep visa fee could price many Pakistanis out, as US firms weigh costs against hiring locally. This shift may reshape skilled migration to the US, pushing Pakistani professionals to seek alternatives through L-1 or O-1 visas, or redirect them toward Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australia and even China.
The State Bank of Pakistan is reportedly assessing the potential impact on remittances and foreign exchange reserves. Its media department referred the query in this regard to the relevant wing, but a formal response was still awaited at the time of filing this report.
Pakistan’s workers’ remittances hit a record $38.3 billion in FY25, up 26.6pc from the previous year. While the overall figure is unprecedented, the exact contribution from the US for the full year was not readily available.
The United States has long been a significant source of Pakistan’s remittances, with its share in the recent years ranging between 8–11pc, below Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the UK, but steadily rising. In the early 2000s, the US share was considerably lower, closer to 5pc, but it increased significantly by the 2020s as more Pakistanis migrated and options for formal money transfer channels improved. A steep visa fee hike could slow new job placements in the US and eventually weigh on remittance growth from the US, though the effect is likely to be gradual, since most current flows come from established workers.
Senior finance and planning ministry officials and members of the government’s economic team were approached for comment, but no response was received before the filing of this article.
Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, September 29th, 2025</p><small>2025-09-29 06:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68d94c3512ff0.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945228/another-stab-at-circular-debt' target='_blank'><strong>Another stab at circular debt</strong></a><br><p>The government’s Rs1.225 trillion syndicated financing deal with 18 banks — the largest in Pakistan’s history — is being trumpeted as a landmark move to ease the power sector’s crippling circular debt. Tied to an existing surcharge on electricity bills, the cashflow-backed plan is touted as a step towards fiscal stability and energy sector reform. Yet critics and supporters warn that, without deeper structural changes, it could end up as just another costly rerun of past bailouts.
Under the deal, the government will use Rs565 billion in fresh financing to settle its unpaid dues to power producers while restructuring older loans worth Rs660bn, previously contracted at Kibor plus 2.5–4 per cent and parked with Power Holding Limited, a shell subsidiary of the power ministry. The six-year repayment will be made through the existing Rs3.23 per unit debt servicing surcharge on electricity bills. The government has already amended the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority Act through the Finance Bill 2025-26 to scrap a cap that had restricted such surcharges to 10pc of the base tariff.
 
 

The power sector’s circular debt — a recurring cycle of unpaid financial obligations across the energy supply chain — remains one of Pakistan’s most intractable challenges, undermining macroeconomic and fiscal stability. Its ripple effects extend to growth, inflation, the external account, and the financial sector. As of July 2025, the debt stood at Rs1.661tr. It rose by Rs47bn in just one month during July.
According to power minister Awais Khan Leghari, circular debt was reduced from Rs2.393tr last fiscal year by creating Rs780bn in fiscal space: Rs242bn through lower theft, system losses and better recoveries; Rs175bn from falling interest rates; and Rs363bn via revised power purchase agreements with Independent Power Producers, excluding Chinese and government-to-government projects under the Chine-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Officials also claim the latest deal will save consumers Rs377bn in late payment charges.

The earlier the debt is settled, the sooner the surcharge disappears and the quicker electricity prices decline

The fresh attempt to retire the so-called circular debt recalls a similar exercise in 2013, when the government injected Rs480bn to clear the sector’s outstanding dues. Since then, successive efforts to address the problem — largely through repeated tariff hikes or sporadic bailout and subsidy packages — have failed to deliver desired results, primarily because the underlying structural weaknesses and inefficiencies of the power sector have remained unaddressed.
The new financing arrangement is expected to generate significant savings for the government on markup payments, as banks have agreed to take a considerable hit on their earnings by accepting a floating rate set at Kibor minus 90 basis points — roughly 150 bps below the rate at which the loans are currently booked.
In addition, sovereign guarantees on both the restructured loans and the fresh financing have been withdrawn, while an effective cap has been imposed on the interest rate, limiting the government’s mark-up liability strictly to the amount recovered through the Rs3.23 per unit Debt Service Surcharge (DSS). In yet another concession, the banks have also agreed to forgo the usual requirement of a floor on the interest rate, which typically accompanies a cap, thereby offering even more favourable terms to the government.
A key feature of the facility is its structure, which allows the loan to be repaid ahead of the envisaged six-year schedule if interest rates fall further and grid electricity consumption increases. Should the plan unfold as anticipated, Mr Leghari says, consumers could benefit from the removal of the DSS, resulting in as much as a 10pc reduction in electricity tariffs. In essence, the earlier the debt is settled, the sooner the surcharge disappears and the quicker electricity prices decline. On the other hand, if borrowing costs rise and/or power consumption dips from current levels, the existing surcharge on consumer bills would need to be increased to ensure timely repayment of the loans.
Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA) chairman Zafar Masud described the initiative as a potential turning point for both the energy sector and the broader economy. “This deal proves that when interests align, execution becomes far easier. For banks, it means long-outstanding power-sector loans of Rs660bn will finally be repaid through the dedicated DSS stream. For consumers, there is no additional burden, while both old and new debt can be settled within four to six years, depending on the trajectory of interest rates.
“It is also a win for the government, as the sovereign guarantee freed up after the debt settlement can now be redirected towards priority sector financing in agriculture, SMEs, low-cost housing, and impact initiatives in education and health. Moreover, the transaction has enabled the government to secure better terms with power companies, resulting in savings of at least Rs1.1tr in late payment surcharges and penalties, a substantial relief for the public exchequer.”
Despite the positive spin, many fear that circular debt will continue to accumulate, forcing the government into another such exercise — or direct fiscal injections from taxpayers — within a few years. “We have travelled this path before. In 2013, the PML-N government wiped out the outstanding circular debt, but it soon resurfaced because the fundamental problems were left unresolved,” an energy sector expert cautioned.
In recent weeks, both the Washington-based Institute of International Finance (IIF) and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry have warned that such loans and fiscal injections are unsustainable in the absence of far-reaching structural reforms. Without cutting system losses, improving recoveries, and tackling the sector’s deep inefficiencies, they argue, Pakistan will find itself back in the same crisis cycle.
Another risk stems from the power sector’s exposure to exchange rate volatility, as acknowledged by the minister at his Friday press conference. “The power sector will remain exposed to exchange rate volatility for up to eight years because of dollar-indexed investments, especially those tied to Chinese projects. Power plants commissioned after 2015, mostly under CPEC, with a combined generation capacity of over 11,000 MW were financed in dollars and remain highly vulnerable to currency depreciation,” he noted.
The government has, to its credit, initiated some measures aimed at curbing leakages, strengthening governance, enforcing cash flow discipline, and ring-fencing funds to ensure sector debt is serviced. A key step in this regard has been the decision to channel the debt servicing surcharge exclusively towards repayment of sector liabilities, rather than allowing it to vanish into the general revenue pool.
According to the PBA chairman, “This time the reforms go beyond ad hoc bailouts. There is now a growing emphasis on plugging systemic leakages, ensuring timely payments throughout the supply chain, and rethinking the subsidy framework so that support reaches the most vulnerable without disrupting the entire revenue cycle.”
Yet he struck a note of caution: “The key challenge is to stop new flows from building up in the future.”

The five-day vaccination effort in May conducted by Emergency Operation Centre, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, recorded 17,136 children without getting oral polio vaccine (OPV), mostly due to parents’ reluctance due to misconception that the drops were not allowed in Islam or on the pretext that those were designed by western countries to render the recipients infertile and impotent and reduce the population of Muslims.
The first argument has been vehemently rejected by edicts issued by Islamic scholars from reputed universities and religious schools. The second plea advanced for non-vaccination has been rejected by laboratory scientists, saying these drops are safe and have played instrumental role in eradicating the crippling ailment worldwide.
However, the recently-concluded vaccination drive last week, shows that the number of refusals against polio drops has dwindled to 14,712, which the authorities attribute to the hard work of frontline vaccinators with strong backing of district administrations and district health officers.

Only 17,136 children remained unvaccinated in previous campaign

In May, the tally of children staying unvaccinated due to their non-availability during door-to-door visits by health workers was 64,328, which rose by less than 1,000.
 
 

Peshawar as usual remained atop of list of refusal cases by recording 5,977 unvaccinated children in September down from 6,812 recorded in May while Lakki Marwat occupied second spot with 2,128 refusal cases compared to 2,382 recorded by the district in September.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has detected 18 polio cases, the highest number recorded by any province in Pakistan this year so far. The total number of polio cases registered in the country in the ongoing year in 27.
The disease has crippled seven children in Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, four cases have been recorded in Lakki Marwat, Tank and North Waziristan each, three in Bannu, and one each in Torghar, Kohistan Lower and Dera Ismail Khan.
The disease is mostly prevalent in violence-stricken southern districts of the province where the number of refusals and non-available children is more than the rest of the province.
Except Peshawar, the situation in central districts and Malakand is not worrisome as the vaccinators do not have problems in reaching the target population but the southern belt is fraught with issues that have been hampering the smooth-sailing of the drive, making the dream of polio-eradication more difficult.
Officials at EOC say that Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, in his capacity as chairman of Task Force on Polio, is aware of the issues in southern districts and has been holding meetings with district administrations and issuing instructions to them before every drive to ensure that all children below five years receive anti-polio drops in every effort.
The last drive was conducted peacefully as no case of violence was reported but the problem of unvaccinated children remained the major task, they said.
“Our workers are reaching more than 99 per cent target children but less than one per cent children stay unvaccinated due to refusals or non-availability during the campaign. For getting polio eradication certificate, we need to ensure that all children are inoculated in every campaign for three consecutive years,” said officials.
They said that in every campaign, they missed very few children due to which eradication of the crippling disease was not possible.
There are known people, who are opposed to vaccination and they have been denying polio vaccination for years on flimsy grounds.
This vicious cycle continues to thwart the eradication efforts as well as loss of lives of policemen and health workers, who are killed by unidentified armed men during anti-polio campaigns in the province.

These soft-bodied beetles from the Lampyridae family, glow to attract mates, creating a natural spectacle like stars on the ground.
While no formal warning about fireflies’ extinction has been issued so far for Lahore, specifically, scientific observations and broader South Asian trends point to a severe reduction—potentially over 70pc in similar regions—driven by human activity, Deputy Chief Wildlife Rangers Dr Ghulam Rasool told Dawn on Sunday.
Mr Rasool says that older Lahore residents often recall abundant fireflies in gardens, parks like Jallo Park, and along canals in the 1980s and 1990s. They were so abundant that children would collect them in glass jars as “living lanterns”, as described in cultural narratives from Karachi. On rural outskirts or semi-urban spots, evenings used to lit up with these tiny flickering lights of nature, he adds.
He notes that firefly sightings are now sporadic and confined to less urbanised fringes, such as suburban lawns or areas near water bodies like the river Ravi or canals. A 2024 Reddit thread highlighted a Lahore resident spotting fireflies in his yard after years of absence, but many locals report they have not seen these glowing insects at all in the central areas. Their number has also plummeted in Punjab’s rural areas, with some experts warn of a “gradual extinction” due to habitat loss.
Rasool is of the view that Pakistan’s firefly hot spots like, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Murree, are also losing their populations, with urbanisation cited as the primary culprit. A 2025 nationwide census in India revealed a 76pc drop in the firefly counts in one year, from over 25,000 to just 6,139 individuals, signaling a regional crisis.
Globally, the IUCN estimates 20pc of the assessed firefly species (about 30 out of 150) face extinction risks, with South Asian species particularly data-deficient but vulnerable.
Lahore’s rapid urbanisation — now a metropolis of over 13 million—has amplified the threats that disrupt fireflies’ entire lifecycle (from glowing larvae in moist soil to adults needing dark, vegetated mating grounds).For instance, fireflies thrive in humid, low-light environments, but Lahore’s concrete jungle and 24/7 illumination create a “death trap” for them.
No species is officially listed as extinct locally, but populations may have retreated to isolated pockets. The IUCN’s Firefly Specialist Group warns that without intervention, urban fireflies could vanish within a generation, as seen in parts of Europe and India. In Pakistan, experts like Dr Maqsood Shah from the University of Agriculture, Peshawar, terms fireflies an “environmental indicators”, saying their absence signals broader ecosystem collapse.
He suggests that the plan to establish a firefly breeding centre at Jallo Park, proposed years ago, could be revived. He says that butterfly houses in Lahore already promote insect conservation.”Firefly tourism” in regions like rural areas of Punjab and Kaghan valley can draw visitors and fund habitat protection, he suggests and call for expanding it to Lahore’s outskirts. Dr Shah says that fireflies have not left Lahore entirely, but their magic is dimming.
“By addressing the threats, we can ensure that our future generations witness the firefly dance again. If you’re in Lahore, head to a dark, green spot this monsoon season; you may still catch a glimpse,” he concluded.

According to a statement issued on Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari has summoned the NA session at the Parliament House on Monday (today) at 5 pm. Before the sitting, a meeting of parliamentary leaders summoned by Speaker Ayaz Sadiq will be held at 4pm to finalise the agenda.
Another highlight of the session would be PML-N leader Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry thanking the president for his address to both houses on March 10. The NA meeting comes amid disagreements between the PML-N and PPP on flood relief measures. Parliamentary experts believe that both sides will again exchange barbs regarding the proposed use of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) to help flood victims — a move opposed by some in the government.
 
 

The issue of current tensions in AJK and a protest scheduled for today (Monday) by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee will also likely be discussed in the house.

Govt to table three bills; speaker calls meeting ahead of session to ‘finalise’ agenda

The government is also likely to take credit for its recent foreign policy achievements.
Three bills to be moved
The government is also expected to table three bills. On the first day, state minister for finance and revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani will move a bill for reforms of the regulatory regime applicable to business, trade and investment by removing complex regulatory requirements and to establish the Pakistan Regulatory Registry and Pakistan Business Portal (Asaan Karobar Bill, 2025).
Senator Ahad Cheema will seek amendments to the Civil Servants Act 1973 through the Civil Servants (Amendment) Bill 2025. Housing minister Riaz Hussain Pirzada will table the Pakistan Infrastructure Deve­lopment and Assets Management Authority Bill 2025 for the establishment of the assets management authority.
In a calling attention notice, MNA Riaz Fatyana will invite the attention of the minister-in-charge of the Cabinet Secretariat to the “poor performance” of the NDMA in Kamalia, Pir Mehal, Tandlianwala and Chichawatni in Toba Tek Singh during the recent floods. Likewise, MNA Anjum Aqeel Khan will invite the attention of the interior minister to the delay in payment to persons whose land was acquired by Islamabad CDA in sectors E-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16 and H-16.

The primary question is how does the advent of this particular technology change the way people learn, what is expected of young minds in school and universities, and what are the long-term impacts of accessing and consuming knowledge through LLMs.
The productivity impact of AI and LLMs is a separate debate and one that is already a source of much contention. Initial evaluation work shows that the technology helps raise productivity in lower level tasks, but has no discernible impact on higher-level and more complex tasks that involve multiple levels of human interface, reasoning, and analysis. It thus remains to be seen whether AI will in any way reverse the structural slowdown of growth rates that has plagued advanced capitalist economies since the late 20th century, and which the last big technological invention — the internet — failed to do in any meaningful way.
 
 

However, much like the internet, the social and cultural impact of AI is likely to be significant. I will concern myself here with its impact on one social domain: education and the fundamental task of ways and methods of learning and knowing.
From one vantage point, the early results are not encouraging. Essential aspects of learning — reading and writing — are likely to be stifled with a deepening reliance on LLMs. AI advocates frequently point out that these tools cut down the time required to do writing and reading tasks — by producing the output for you and by summarising content on particular issues. And, even as a sceptic, I have to recognise that it does this moderately well.

Merely proclaiming that devoting more time to the process of learning because of its abstract benefits isn’t necessarily a good pitch.

The problem, however, is that this approach ignores a fundamental fact about learning. Learning is not merely the quantitative production of output or the memorisation of summaries. Everything we know about it tells us that learning is a processual activity, which in turn tests and develops the ways we use our brain.
 
 

When we read text, we’re not just familiarising ourselves with the content (even if that is our primary task). The process of reading any one thing intersects with a range of thoughts, ideas, and past memories that we already have. This creates new content and new ways of understanding and thinking. The same process is in action when we sit down to write. It forces us to become clearer in our thoughts, to develop the capacity to reason and articulate, and to confront contradiction and inconsistencies that may exist in our minds. By outsourcing these tasks to an AI agent or chatbot, we remove the process part with all of its benefits, leaving behind mere output and a whole host of underutilised capacities.
Just on its own, this should be sufficient cause for scepticism and restraint, especially for children and young adults. If we equate learning with output, we run the risk of never developing essential neural capabilities in a large section of the population. But if one is looking for a more immediate reason for restraint, then the systemic hallucination problem — the creation or referencing of content that does not exist — is an important one as well. For a lot of output, AI agents may be producing passable content; but given the capacity to hallucinate, they cannot be relied on universally.
 
 

Some of these arguments that make points in general/ in the abstract are a hard sell for young people. We’re dealing with a generation that now consumes content in increasingly shorter forms (from text to video, and from video to short videos, and now finally to reels that last for a few seconds). Merely proclaiming that devoting more time to the process of learning because of its abstract benefits isn’t necessarily a good pitch.
We also don’t have the luxury of waiting for the lost value of the process to make a case for itself. The cost of the world finding out what it lost by outsourcing key aspects of the educational experience to a chatbot is far too high.
This is where institutional mechanisms and safeguards will be required. Universities and schools today are devoted to many pursuits (most of them commercial), but if they retain an interest in being organised sites of learning, they will have to place restrictions on AI use, at least in domains and stages where fundamental reading and writing skills are imparted.
At a more macroeconomic level, societies should also consider the implication of AI-reliance on two domains. The first is the obvious problem of reducing human skill and ability. Deskilled labour is replaceable, interchangeable, and ultimately discardable. It is also a fundamental erosion of the human experience.
The second domain is the prevailing quest for getting rid of human labour altogether. An obsession with AI is now the latest form of this quest. To be clear, a society where no one has to work, because of machines or technology, is a utopian ideal that remains worth pursuing. But the caveat is that this society has to be one where the gains/ outputs from such machines or technologies is shared among all.
 
 

Our societies do not feature such a model. Here the prevailing model is that any gains are appropriated by the private owners of machines and technologies. When you apply human labour-replacing technology on top of this model, you’re making humans redundant without any claim on the output (which they currently and imperfectly have in the form of a wage). The political and social implications of a large mass of redundant workers is hard to fathom at this stage, but one can assume they won’t be positive. This alone gives us a great reason to exercise restraint and rethink some key parameters of the utility and value of this technology in the long run.

The General Assembly’s high-level week was dominated by Palestine and the war in Gaza. This brought into sharp focus the UN’s failure to live up to its core mission and primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. True it is big powers who are to blame for the UN’s paralysis in stopping the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. But UN inaction and lack of activist diplomacy on issues of war and peace have left its reputation damaged.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres has repeatedly warned that trust in global institutions is at a breaking point with ailing multilateral organisations in need of urgent reform. The loss of faith in multilateralism, he has said, is because people see “broken promises, unmet commitments, double standards, and vast inequalities”.
Although multilateralism has been under stress for well over a decade President Donald Trump’s conduct has accelerated this trend and magnified the pressure. US disengagement from the UN is reflected in its exit from WHO, Unesco, UNRWA (UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees) and decision to stop funding and withdraw from the Human Rights Council. Trump’s unilateralist actions have also shown contempt for the principles of the UN Charter.
Other big states and regional powers have also played their part by acting in defiance of international law and violating the UN Charter. In a recent essay in The Economist co-authored with Helen Clark, former UNSG Ban Ki-moon wrote: “The UN is slipping into dysfunction as some of its traditional champions, notably the United States, retreat from multilateral cooperation, cut funding and disregard the rule of law when it suits them.”

At the heart of UN’s dysfunction lies the Security Council’s paralysis.

The contrast could not have been sharper during UNGA’s high-level week. Kicking off the debate, Guterres said the world needed the UN’s “unique legitimacy” and convening power. To no one’s surprise, Trump voiced his characteristic disdain for the UN. He lashed out at the world body on several counts and falsely accused it of funding migrants to ‘invade’ Western countries.
Just before he spoke, Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said multilateralism is at a new crossroads, with the ideals that inspired the UN’s founders under unprecedented threat. He lamented the UN’s weakening authority while calling on it to revive its role as a “promoter of equality, peace, sustainable development, diversity and tolerance”.
 
 

In fact, the common refrain in speeches at the debate was the UN’s ineffectiveness at a time when it is needed most to deal with multiple challenges. Many leaders condemned the resort to unilateralism by some and stressed the need to strengthen multilateralism. They also urged the UN to reclaim and reassert its authority.
Beyond these speeches, the widespread view across the world is that the UN has become increasingly irrelevant as it acts as a bystander in wars and crises. If the UN is seen as failing to deliver on its core goal of maintaining international peace and security, the rest of what it does (some of it quite well; say, on the development pillar of its mandate and humanitarian initiatives) fades into insignificance. It is on the peace and security pillar that the UN is judged by governments and publics everywhere and seen not to be ‘fit for purpose’.
That is the Security Council’s responsibility but deadlock and rivalry between the big powers — its five veto-wielding permanent members — prevents the Council from acting. Nothing illustrates this better than the two main wars of the moment in Gaza and Ukraine.
The US has been the obstacle in ending the war Israel imposed on Gaza, exercising the veto six times in the past two years to scotch ceasefire resolutions. This marks a continuity in Washington’s policy which over decades has seen it use the veto 51 times to shield Israel. On Ukraine, Russia has used the veto several times on resolutions against its 2022 invasion. This has left the Security Council completely logjammed.
In response to rising criticism of the UN and funding cuts, the secretary general announced the UN 80 reform initiative. This seeks to build on previous reforms in management, development and peace and security. It is aimed at streamlining mandates and making the UN leaner and more efficient. But this is unlikely to change much.
Driven by funding shortages, these reforms may be used to end mandates deemed as “inefficient” on politically motivated grounds and reflecting the priorities of big powers. This will make the reform process disputed.
In any case, what is consequential to the UN’s effectiveness and credibility is reform of the Security Council. What lies at the heart of UN dysfunction is the Council’s paralysis. As usual, calls for its reform were heard from world leaders during UNGA. Negotiations have been going on in the General Assembly for over 20 years but with little progress except agreement on expanding the Council. The veto continues to be a source of intense contention.
The principal disagreement is between countries that aspire for permanent seats for themselves and others who oppose more permanent members and, instead, propose enlarging the Council by adding more elected, non-permanent members. This has put the G4 — Germany, Japan, India and Brazil — at odds with the Uniting for Consensus (UFC) countries led by Italy and including Pakistan.
The UFC seeks a more representative, accountable and effective Council by adding elected members who can counter-balance the power of the veto-wielding P5 countries. It argues the Council’s chronic deadlocks are due to discord and clashing interests of the P5, which prevents it from playing its due role. Adding more veto-empowered permanent members will compound this dysfunction, not end it.
Even if the impasse is overcome, reform is a complicated process that requires amendment of the UN Charter. This involves the General Assembly adopting a resolution by a two-thirds majority, which then has to be ratified by at least two-thirds of the UN membership as well as the P5. This makes reform a remote possibility. It will be up to the General Assembly to mount pressure on the big powers to allow the Council to function. Unfortunately, the prospect of that too is not bright.

Where judgements once prompted debates about their implications for citizens, the focus today has shifted to the courts’ own crises. Instead of guiding the public, the judiciary seems locked in a cycle of controversy that has steadily eroded all confidence in its ability to dispense justice.
Recent decisions have done little to inspire trust or repair their reputation. In most of the political cases, the courts have increasingly appeared unconcerned about grounding their rulings in sound reasoning, as long as the outcome serves immediate ends. At other times, they have adopted an inexplicable passivity when proactive intervention was both warranted and constitutionally mandated. This was true of both the case pertaining to the military trial of civilians, as well as the petitions concerning the 26th Amendment.
The judiciary is expected to uphold the supremacy of the law and ensure the separation of powers. Yet in case after case, this solemn responsibility seems to have been abdicated.
Worse still, judges who have sought to defend their institution appear to have paid a steep price. A troubling example is that of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri of the Islamabad High Court, who was among the judges to formally complain of interference by intelligence agencies in a letter addressed to the superior judiciary in 2024.
Recently, Karachi University once again cancelled his law degree, declaring it tainted by “unfair means” he allegedly used four decades ago. The timing of this extraordinary step, coming just days after the judge, along with four others, petitioned the Supreme Court regarding alleged misdoings in the IHC, raises grave questions about how internal resistance to the judiciary’s perceived capture is being dealt with by powerful quarters.
If a high court judge can be discredited and penalised in this manner, what hope can an ordinary petitioner have? If the courts themselves cannot safeguard their own, how can they protect the rights of citizens? These are questions the judiciary must confront with urgency.
Unless it can restore its independence and reassert its commitment to fairness, it risks losing not only public confidence but also its relevance as a guardian of justice. It is disturbing to contemplate what would happen in that instance.
If powerful individuals and institutions begin writing and rewriting the laws based on their whims, and if a handful of people start deciding where the law applies and where it does not, society will devolve to a Hobbesian state. The judiciary is meant to safeguard the vulnerable and check those with totalitarian instincts. It cannot and must not avoid that responsibility. Pakistan and its people must not be abandoned to a punishing fate.

The report highlights that just $200 billion a year is invested in conservation, representing under one per cent of the global GDP.
The Third Global Report on “Harnessing Climate and SDG Synergy – Quantifying the Benefits,” by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA), warns that synergistic action is the only viable path forward.
With the annual financing gaps for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate action measured in the trillions of dollars, “synergistic action is not optional but the most efficient and impactful path forward”, the report says.
According to the findings, acting jointly on climate and sustainable development can deliver almost 40pc greater efficiency, freeing up resources and maximising benefits. The report, developed by the independent Expert Group on Climate and SDGs Synergies, states that the extra investment required to achieve the SDGs related to water, food, health and climate change is at least $4tr annually.
At least $500 billion more per year would be needed to tackle climate change. It also cautions that the cost of addressing biodiversity loss could double if action is delayed by a decade.
“Exposure to climate change risks could double between a global warming of 1.5 centigrade and 2 centigrade and double again between 2 centigrade and 3 centigrade, severely impacting multiple sectors,” the report says.  The analysis underscores the deep connection between the two agendas, noting that over 80pc of SDG targets are directly linked to climate change issues.
Estimates suggest that acting on climate and human development together can achieve up to 37pc greater efficiency in government spending compared to pursuing them in isolation.

He said US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law who was a Middle East envoy during his first term, were having talks with Netanyahu in New York ahead of the meeting at the White House.
“Were getting a very good response because Bibi wants to make the deal too,” Trump said in a telephone interview, using Netanyahu’s nickname.
 
 

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump earlier hinted at a breakthrough in the Middle East crisis. “We have a real chance for GREATNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST,” Trump said. “ALL ARE ON BOARD FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL, FIRST TIME EVER. WE WILL GET IT DONE!!!”

US envoy to Israel’s rare visit to Egypt postponed; 21 Palestinians killed as Israeli tanks thrust deeper into Gaza

When international leaders gathered at the United Nations in New York this week, the US unveiled a 21-point Middle East peace plan to end the nearly two-year-long war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.
That plan calls for the return of all prisoners, living and dead, no further Israeli attacks on Qatar and a new dialogue between Israel and Palestinians for peaceful coexistence, a White House official said.
A Hamas representative earlier said the group had not seen the US plan.
Trump on Sunday credited the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt and Jordan, among others, for helping in the process.
He said the deal would not only end the Gaza conflict but would work towards a broader peace in the Middle East. “Everybody’s involved,” he said. “Everybody wants it, and Hamas wants it, and one of the reasons is because everybody’s tired”.
Netanyahu, in an interview on Fox News channel’s “The Sunday Briefing,” said it is possible to have amnesty for Hamas leaders under terms of the agreement. “The details of this have to be worked out,” he said.
Meanwhile, a visit to Egypt by Washington’s top envoy to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has been postponed, a US official said on Sunday.
 
 

Huckabee was scheduled to visit Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials.
Egypt, along with the United States and Qatar, has been mediating between Israel and Hamas in efforts to end the war.
Cairo has criticised Israel’s ongoing air and ground assault in Gaza City, where the United Nations estimated a million people resided before the offensive began. Since the war broke out, Egypt has repeatedly warned that the fighting risks driving hundreds of thousands of Palestinians across its border into the Sinai Peninsula.
Israeli tanks thrust deeper into Gaza
In Gaza Israeli tanks moved deeper into Gaza City’s residential districts on Sunday, as local health authorities said they have been unable to respond to dozens of desperate calls, expressing concern about the fate of residents in the targeted areas.
Witnesses and medics said Israeli tanks had deepened their incursions in the Sabra, Tel Al-Hawa, Sheikh Radwan and Al-Naser neighborhoods, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.
The Civil Emergency Service in Gaza said late on Saturday that Israel had denied 73 requests, sent via international organisations, to rescue injured Palestinians in Gaza City.
Over the past 24 hours, the Israeli air force had struck 140 infrastructures what it described as ‘military targets’ across Gaza.
Medics reported 16 more deaths in strikes on houses in central Gaza, bringing Sunday’s death toll to 21. Israeli forces have already killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in past two years.
Meanwhile, Hamas asked the Israeli military to temporarily halt strikes as it tried to locate the two Israeli prisoners it said it had lost contact with. “The lives of the two prisoners are in real danger, and (Israeli) forces must immediately withdraw to the south of Street 8 and halt aerial operations for 24 hours starting from 18:00 today to allow attempts to rescue the prisoners,” wrote the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades in a statement.
In a previous announcement, the armed group said the loss of contact was due to Israeli military operations in two southern Gaza City neighbourhoods over the previous 48 hours.

As it turned out External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar spoke for India, stressing self-reliance, self-protection and self-confidence as his mantras. Mentioning all three in Sanskrit, Jaishankar insisted on using the name Bharat for India to stay with the fine point about Hindu nationalists.
There was no official explanation given for Modi skipping the UN session this year, but clear evidence does indicate that it had to do with US President Donald Trump openly switching his preference from India to Pakistan as a closer friend in South Asia.
 
 

The standard rule of Modi always meeting the US President during his visits to the UN was in jeopardy. It was not necessarily because Trump may have signalled disinterest in such a meeting, but it was more likely the optics of Pakistan’s prime minister and army chief appearing in cosy frames with the US President that was the last straw to deter the Indian PM from the visit.
Modi had, however, shown his preparedness to go around the cloud of tariffs and verbal invectives hurled at him by Trump. India has kept its trade talks open with the US in the hope that the alternative of New Delhi moving closer to Beijing would dawn on US policy makers as an avoidable risk. But this seems to have been overestimated by India.
The Indian prime minister spared no effort to signal the alternative scenario. His meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the SCO summit in Tianjin was not only warm but also effusive. Apart from the formal expression of gratitude for the hospitality, Modi spoke of their meeting in Kazan, saying: “We had very productive discussions, which gave a positive direction to our relations. After the disengagement at the border, an atmosphere of peace and stability is now in place. Our Special Representatives have also reached an agreement on border management. The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra has resumed. Direct flights are also being resumed between the two countries. Our cooperation is linked to the interests of 2.8 billion people of our two countries. This will also pave the way for the welfare of all humanity. We are committed to advancing our relations based on mutual trust, respect, and sensitivity.”
In his speech at the SCO summit, Modi did mention a thorny issue with China but without naming it.
“We believe that every effort towards connectivity must uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said.
“This is also enshrined in the core principles of the SCO Charter. Connectivity, that by-passes sovereignty, ultimately loses both trust and meaning.” The reference was clearly to the Karakoram Highway and the Shaksgam Valley that Pakistan ceded to China in 1962 and which India disputes.
Signalling a positive framework for working with China, Modi made a similar pitch with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “India and Russia have always stood shoulder-to-shoulder even in the most difficult situations. Our close cooperation is important not only for the people of both countries, but also for global peace, stability, and prosperity.”
He was looking forward to receiving Putin in New Delhi in December. Those are daring words if Trump is the audience. Modi added another challenge to the mix by mentioning India’s engagement with Iran’s Chabahar Port, which the US frowns on.
The twist in the tale, however, is that Pakistan is invested in flourishing ties with all three countries Modi is interested in, namely the US, Russia and China.

In a detailed set of objections to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), Aptma demanded a stringent reality check of the exaggerated demand forecasts based on population and GDP growth, allegedly without taking into account ground realities taking shape in the country and the power sector.
The association said it has “a fundamental issue with the demand-forecasting methodology, which undermines the credibility of the entire plan” and suggested a broader set of priorities for incorporation in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expa­nsion Plan (IGCEP 2025-35) “to realign energy planning with on-the-ground economic real­ities and critical need for affordability and competitiveness in power tariffs”.
 
 

It said the IGCEP employed an overly simplistic and rather incorrect statistical (regression) model that linked grid electricity consumption to GDP growth, population growth and similar macro variables. The underlying assumption is that as the economy and population expand, grid demand will rise proportionally.
However, this approach could not account for substitution effects arising from captive power (gas or furnace-oil generators), rooftop solar (or distributed solar), gas-fired boilers, solar water heaters, electric stoves, and other decentralised energy sources, which increasingly serve as alternatives to grid electricity.
“In omitting these, the model incorrectly absorbs their influence into the residual, attributing too much of the growth in economic activity to increased grid consumption. The result is a systematic overstatement of grid demand growth,” Aptma said.
Such a plan had econometric and statistical implications, it said, adding that the endogeneity problem with the model was that when substitutes are omitted, their effects get absorbed in the error term. Since GDP and population growth also drive adoption of captive and solar among other non-grid sources of energy, the error term becomes correlated with the regressors.
This endogeneity correlation also leads to biased and inconsistent estimates in the statistical sense of the terms, as the elasticity of grid demand with respect to GDP and population growth is exaggerated.
“In Pakistan’s context, where non-grid sources of energy are growing rapidly, the structural bias leads to a systematic overestimation of future grid demand,” it said, adding that this meant the forecast for grid demand was too high because the model ignored alternative energy sources.
“This upward bias encourages excessive generation additions, which in turn produce inflated capacity payments, stranded assets, and heightened financial stress in the system,” the association said, alleging that IGCEP’s demand forecast was upward-biased by design.
Moreover, the econometric issue of endogeneity meant that results were unreliable and, in practice, overestimated.
“This problem has been prevalent throughout the years, and its implications are visible in the massive stranded capacity on the grid and the resulting escalation of power tariffs”, Aptma said, adding that it was not a minor technicality but a fundamental flaw in the power sector’s demand forecast. The same “flawed methodology” is also used to estimate demand for consumer tariff determinations, meaning that those forecasts, too, are systematically flawed and biased.
This becomes even more perilous given the fact that IGCEP itself acknowledged that the energy and power demand forecast was the basis for all planning activities in the power sector. It is one of the decisive inputs for the generation planning (Planning Code (PC-4) of Grid Code 2023).
“This makes the flaw monumental because if the foundation is faulty, the entire edifice of planning collapses. A biased demand forecast, hence, makes the entirety of the subsequent planning exercise unreliable, leading to mis-investment, excess costs, and inflated tariffs,” it asserted.
Aptma observed that unless affordability was made the central organising principle of energy planning, the IGCEP will continue to reinforce the problems feeding to the runaway escalation of capacity payments, which had increased from Rs2 per unit to Rs17.06 per unit in about 10 years and now consume over half of the consumer tariff and cumulatively amount to more than Rs6 trillion over the past decade — exceeding the total fuel cost in the system.
“Such levels are clearly unsustainable in a country already constrained by weak fiscal space, dwindling industrial growth, and limited affordability,” Aptma said.
It demanded that “no new generation addition should be justified without first reducing this burden to below Rs5 per unit. This ceiling must become a binding benchmark in all future planning and approvals” to inject discipline into a planning environment long driven by megawatt targets, donor pressures, and short-term paradigms, often at the expense of consumer capacity to pay.
Aptma also pointed out that the country currently faced demand stagnation, overcapacity, and stranded risk, and the planning should address these challenges. It said the industrial demand in FY2025 declined by around 4pc, and agricultural consumption plunged by more than one-third as farmers turned to diesel and solar alternatives.
This meant the national demand growth was stagnant, yet the IGCEP projected an addition of nearly 20,000 MW in capacity. “This mismatch leads to more idle plants, steep fixed costs, and escalating circular debt,” it said.

• Punjab govt sets Oct 4 deadline to plug Sutlej breaches
• M5 still shut as over 200 villages inundated in south Punjab
• China airlifts tents, blankets for flood-hit families
HYDERABAD/DADU/ LAHO­RE: Kotri Barrage passed the peak of its medium flood on Sat­urday but remained in a medium-flood state through Sunday evening.
On Saturday morning, Kotri recorded 421,075 cusecs upstream and 393,560 cusecs downstream, easing to 412,965 and 386,650 cusecs by noon.
On Sunday, upstream flows were 387,808 cusecs with 362,253 cusecs downstream; some 25,555 cusecs were drawn for the barrage’s four canals. Flood peaks have already moved past Guddu and Sukkur barrages, where flows have normalised.
Meanwhile, high pressure persisted along the Indus at Nasri Bund, Lakhhat Bund, Mid Bangli Bund and Amri Bridge, leading to intensified rescue efforts.
Rescue 1122 Shaheed Benazirabad evacuated dozens of residents from Ali Khan Mari village to safer locations and helped move livestock and belongings.
Officials have termed the situation “alarming” and urged residents in vulnerable areas to remain vigilant and cooperate with rescue teams. Local authorities said they were monitoring embankments and stood ready to take further protective measures.
The Punjab government has set Oct 4 as the deadline to plug all broken embankments along the Sutlej to contain flooding that has submerged more than 200 villages across Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts. The villages of Multan’s tehsil Jalalpur Pirwala, Lodhran and Uch Sharif were submerged after Noraja Bhutta embankment at the Sutlej River broke due to extremely high water flow 15 days ago.
The floodwater passed from these breaches and rose around the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5) from Jhangra in the Bahawalpur district to Jalalpur Pirwala. The floodwater passed through M5 after breaching it at several points and created a 20km to 25km-long inland lake between Gilani Road and the motorway.
 
 

Due to the breaches, the motorway has been closed for traffic from Uch Sharif interchange to Jalalpur Pirwala for the last 15 days. The closure of all traffic between southern and central Punjab has disrupted supply chains and stranded thousands of vehicles and forced travellers onto perilous alternative routes.
The situation remains dire in the eastern areas of Jalalpur Pirwala, where villages, including Noraja Bhutta, Basti Lang, Kotla Chakar, Bahadurpur, Mouza Kanu, Kandeer, Jhaiyu, Deepal, Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur, Belaywala, Dunyapur, Jhangra, Muradpur Soiwala and Sabra are surrounded by eight to 10 feet of stagnant water. The relentless pressure has caused widespread destruction of homes and property.
Meanwhile, as the Punjab government earlier this week launched a survey to assess the losses caused by recent floods, the PPP urged PM Shehbaz to accept its demand for providing immediate relief to the flood-affected people through the Benazir Income Support Programme. The PML-N and the PPP — coalition partners at the Centre and in Punjab — have been at odds over how to help the flood victims, with the former’s government in Punjab insisting on using its own resources, while the latter is adamant about using BISP.
 
 

Punjab Minister for Irrigation Kazim Ali Pirzada said on Sunday that three out of seven breaches at the Noraja Bhutta embankment on the Sutlej River were plugged completely and they were carrying the work to plug two more breaches. He said that the largest breach was 3,300 feet wide, which, according to the latest updates, was reduced to 1,650 feet.
The minister said that the Irrigation Department was utilising all its capabilities and resources to ensure that the remaining breaches should be completely plugged by the evening of Oct 4.
He further stated that the water level in the area is gradually receding. A team of experts will conduct another technical review of the situation on Oct 6 to better plan future measures.
Earlier, Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said that the rehabilitation and relief activities for flood victims have been formally initiated. He said that as the river situation has normalised, affected people have started returning to their homes, while the administration continues to provide dry rations in the affected areas.
China sends relief flights
Two Chinese relief flights carrying 300 tents and 9,000 blankets landed at Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi on Sunday for families displaced by the floods.
Federal Minister Engr Amir Muqam, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik, Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong and officials from the Foreign Office and NDMA received the consignment.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Muqam thanked China for the timely assistance and said that China’s contribution is not only a humanitarian endeavour but also a reaffirmation of the everlasting Pakistan-China friendship.

South Africa were reeling early in their chase of 229 when pacer Diana Baig took two early wickets, leaving them 27-3 inside six overs.
Sune Luus and Anneke Bosch rebuilt the innings and added a 100-run partnership for the fourth wicket.
Chloe Tryon ensured there were no further hiccups for the Proteas Women after losing five wickets with 151 on board, guiding South Africa home with an unbeaten 45. sealing a comfortable win with almost ten overs to spare.
 






Pakistan, batting first, were bowled out for 229 in 46 overs.
Captain Fatima Sana top-scored with a terrific 64 laden with 8 boundaries and a six,
Batters Sidra Amin and Sidra Nawaz also made useful contributions at the top, being involved in crucial partnerships.
However, Pakistan struggled for momentum as wickets fell at regular intervals.
Ayabonga Khaka and Masabata Klass secured two wickets each for South Africa.
“The result will boost South Africa’s confidence heading into their opening clash against England on October 4, while Pakistan will take positives from Fatima Sana’s batting and Diana Baig’s fiery opening spell as they begin their World Cup campaign against Bangladesh on October 3,” The International Cricket Council said.

The Women in Green arrived in the Sri Lankan capital late on Tuesday as the tournament is set to start on September 30 in India’s Guwahati.
The eight-nation showpiece will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from Sept 30 to Nov 2. However, Pakistan — under an International Cricket Council (ICC) hybrid model decided by the ICC due to political strains between New Delhi and Islamabad — will play all their matches of the event in Colombo.
Their first warm-up encounter with Sri Lanka on September 25 was rained off.
Despite losing the recent one-day International (ODI) home series against South Africa, Pakistan were well prepared and had no extra pressure to face arch-rivals India in the forthcoming ICC World Cup, captain Fatima Sana said on Tuesday.
The Fatima-led team won the third and final ODI against South Africa in Lahore last week, but the tourists took the series 2-1.
Pakistan had qualified for the World Cup on the back of an unbeaten run in the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifiers held in Lahore in April of this year.</p><small>2025-09-28 22:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/290215533fb4b13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945354/politics-spill-over-again-in-cricket-as-india-refuse-to-collect-asia-cup-trophy' target='_blank'><strong>Politics spill over again in cricket as India refuse to collect Asia Cup trophy</strong></a><br><p>The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Asian Cricket Council chief Mohsin Naqvi, as politics continued to spill over the pitch.
India had earlier beaten Pakistan by five wickets in the last over after a close contest to win a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, but they caused the post-final formalities to be inordinately delayed due to their refusal to budge from their stance.
There were no customary handshakes between the teams after India refused, with tensions high from their previous two clashes in the competition, which witnessed political posturing and aggressive on-field behaviour.
 
 

The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Naqvi, who is also the Interior Minister, was supposed to present the winners’ trophy, but there were indications that India would resent that when their captain Suryakumar Yadav did not participate in the customary pre-toss photoshoot before the final.
“I have been informed by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said.
When asked about his refusal to collect the trophy at the post-match press conference and their actions leading to the politicisation of the game, the Indian skipper declined to answer the question.
 


The post-final ceremony saw Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha receive the runners-up trophy while Indian players Tilak Varma, Kuldeep Yadav and Abhishek Sharma collect their respective individual awards.
 
 

India’s refusal to collect the trophy from Naqvi marks a historic low in the cricketing relations between the neighbours, with the game having acted as a stage for diplomacy in the past.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a political reference in his post on X congratulating the Indian team. “Operation Sindoor on the game’s field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he wrote.
Suryakumar’s men had earlier capped a remarkable unbeaten run with their third victory against Pakistan at the Asia Cup.
Put into bat, Pakistan could not capitalise on an 84-run opening stand between Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) and were bundled out for 146 with five deliveries still left in their innings.
Pakistan lost their last nine wickets for 33 runs in a spectacular meltdown, with India’s left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (4-30) being the wrecker-in-chief.
The Green Shirts struck back to leave India reeling at 20-3 with their top 3, including captain Suryakumar Yadav, back in the dugout.
India lost their in-form opener Abhishek Sharma, also the tournament’s leading scorer, and the skipper inside the first 10 deliveries of their innings.
Varma and Sanju Samson (24) got to rebuilding the innings.
 
 

Even that recovery would not have been possible but for the reprieve Samson, then on 12, got when Hussain Talat dropped him in the deep.
Abrar Ahmed dismissed Samson to break the 57-run stand, but Shivam Dube (33) combined with Varma to take India closer to the target before falling in the penultimate over.
Needing 10 runs from the last over from Haris Rauf, Varma hit the second ball for a six to effectively seal India’s thrilling victory and triggering wild celebrations in the Indian camp.
“It’s a tough pill to swallow,” Pakistan captain Salman said at the presentation ceremony. “We could not finish well in the batting. Bowling, we gave everything. If we could have finished well, it would have been a different story.
“We could not rotate the strike properly, and we lost too many wickets. That was the reason we could not score what we wanted. We have to sort out our batting very soon. They bowled really well, outstandingly well. They needed 63 off six overs. I thought we had the game. The bowlers bowled really well; we have to give them credit, but the batting was a concern.
“We fought really well. We are proud as a team. So much to look forward to, we will improve and come back stronger.”</p><small>2025-09-28 22:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/282331083a76234.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945278/us-citizen-released-from-kabuls-custody-afghan-foreign-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>US citizen released from Kabul’s custody: Afghan foreign ministry</strong></a><br><p>Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on Sunday told a US delegation in Kabul that American citizen Amir Amiri had been released from prison, the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement.
United States President Donald Trump’s special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler, welcomed the decision to release the American citizen and called it a good moment for him, the statement read.
Muttaqi was quoted as saying, “The Afghan government does not view the issues of its citizens from a political angle and makes it clear that ways can be found to resolve the issues through diplomacy.”
He added that the step taken by his government to release the American citizen was a positive development and thanked the government of Qatar for its role in facilitating the release of the prisoner.
According to the statement, Boehler described the previous round of talks between Kabul and Washington as “constructive” and expressed hope that talks on the remaining issues would continue.
This was the second visit to Kabul by the American delegation.
The Afghan ministry said that during its last visit, the US delegation demanded the release of American prisoners; however, Taliban leaders had called for the release of Afghan national Mohammad Rahim, who is believed to be imprisoned in the Guantanamo Bay detention centre.
The US delegation had agreed in principle to free Rahim, who would be brought to Qatar and remain there. However, the Afghan Foreign Ministry statement did not mention whether Rahim would be released or not.
An elderly British couple detained in Afghanistan for almost eight months were released earlier this month, Taliban authorities said, after pressure built to free the pair due to fears over their health.
Taliban officials have refused to detail why Peter Reynolds, 80, and his wife Barbara, 76, were arrested in February as they were returning to their home.

Ali Hussain, station house officer (SHO) at Olandar police station, said that the incident occurred within the limits of Olandar police station in Damorai. According to the SHO, the boy was the girl’s mother’s nephew.
“My team and I visited the girl’s home, where her mother was reluctant to hand over the body to police for an autopsy,” SHO Hussain said. “We took the body to the Alpuri district headquarters hospital and conducted an autopsy.
The SHO added that the cause of her death would be determined once the medical report is received.
“We have confirmed that both the deceased and her spouse were underage,” SHO Hussain said. “The deceased was 12 years old and her husband was only 10.
“The marriage was illegal and the girl’s death is also suspicious.”
Police launched an inquiry under Section 176 (inquiry by magistrate into cause of death) of the Criminal Code of Procedure to determine the cause of the girl’s death.
Replying to a question, SHO Hussain said that after consultation with the district public prosecutor, a first information report would be lodged against the Nikah registrar and all witnesses present at the Nikah of both children.
The SHO said that both children’s parents would also be arrested and “justice would be ensured”.
Sahil’s ‘Cruel Numbers’ report reveals that a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country last year.
In the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported.

His brother, Riaz Ali, who is the complainant in the case, told Dawn.com on Sunday night that his brother had succumbed during treatment.
Saudabad police Station House Officer (SHO) Ateequr Rehman also confirmed the death of the journalist, as the incident took place in his jurisdiction.
“Police have registered a case against a man and his sons over the attack on the journalist,” the SHO said. “The incident was motivated by a land dispute in the town of Thul in Jacobabad. A hitherto little-known group claimed responsibility for the attack, but it lacked credibility.”
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed his regret over Mir’s death and directed the Sindh inspector general of police to arrest the killers immediately.
“The killers of Imtiaz Mir will be brought to justice,” CM Shah vowed, according to the statement. “The services of the late journalist to the media will be remembered and the government will take this case to its logical conclusion.”
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon issued a statement expressing grief over Mir’s passing, hailing the late journalist as “a hardworking and fearless journalist, who always highlighted public issues”.
“The Sindh government will leave no stone unturned to bring those involved in the attack on Imtiaz Mir to justice,” Memon said. “The Sindh government is committed to protecting the lives and property of journalists.”</p><small>2025-09-28 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28212146d70878a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945250/karachi-police-constable-suspended-over-allegation-of-sexually-assaulting-polio-worker' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police constable suspended over allegation of sexually assaulting polio worker</strong></a><br><p>A constable of Mithadar police in Karachi has been suspended over allegations of sexually assaulting a female polio worker, South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com on Sunday.
DIG Raza has directed the South senior superintendent of police to conduct a “transparent inquiry” of the case.
“The girl is an orphan and a polio worker,” the DIG said. “The suspended policeman was a part of the polio team.”
In her complaint, the victim stated that she is a divorcee and the mother of two children. She alleged that the suspect took her phone number from the team’s WhatsApp group and started sending her messages saying that he loves her and wants to marry her.
She alleged in the complaint that the suspect took advantage of her and took her to a guest house, where he sexually assaulted her. The victim added that she has become pregnant with the policeman’s child, but now he is refusing to marry her.
Earlier this week, the body of a seven-year-old boy who went missing was found in the Landhi area, while a post-mortem examination confirmed that he had been raped before being murdered. A police surgeon said the body was in an advanced state of decomposition and bore multiple bone fractures.
“The findings are consistent with anal sexual violence,” she said. The cause of death was determined to be massive head trauma inflicted by a hard and blunt object.
A few days later, two men confessed before magistrates to raping the boy and murdering him by strangling him with a shoelace and striking him in the head with a brick.</p><small>2025-09-28 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2818553915e31e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945208/pm-shehbaz-hopes-for-encouraging-results-of-trumps-moot-with-muslim-leaders-on-gaza-to-come-soon' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz hopes for ‘encouraging’ results of Trump’s moot with Muslim leaders on Gaza to come soon</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed on Sunday the hope for “encouraging” outcomes of US President Donald Trump’s meeting with Muslim leaders in Washington earlier this week where the American head of the state presented his plan to end Israel’s invasion of Gaza.
“We fully participated in the meeting on Gaza, and God willing, its encouraging results will come out soon,” he said, flanked by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar while addressing overseas Pakistanis at the High Commission in London.
According to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan, he also said that Pakistan was also part of Trump-led efforts to bring peace to Palestine and end oppression against the people of Gaza.
The premier also expressed distress over the situation in Gaza, which has been subjected to Israeli onslaught since October 2023, and prayed that the cruelty and barbarity being witnessed there ends soon.
Trump’s meeting with Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York had brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, and Indonesia.
Ahead of formal consultations, Trump told his guests: “We have to get the hostages back … This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world … so it’s an honour to be with you.”
Trump also emphasised the urgency of ending the conflict: “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started.”
 
 

According to reports from Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios, President Trump’s plan envisions an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages, both alive and deceased; phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza
Governance excluding Hamas but incorporating the Palestinian Authority; deployment of Arab and Muslim peacekeepers to secure Gaza and facilitate Israel’s withdrawal; and internationally supported reconstruction and transition programmes funded by regional contributors.
These details were reportedly shared with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though Israel did not draft the plan.
Dar, who also attended the meeting with Trump, also expressed the hope for positive outcomes of the meeting, saying that once these results materialised, “we will share them with the nation”.
He also said that follow-up communications after the meeting were going on until last night.
Earlier during the talk, PM Shehbaz also referred to his engagements in New York, where he led Pakistan’s delegation to the UNGA’s 80th session. He said his speech at the UNGA was a reflection of the sentiments of Pakistanis and that he fought the case of India-occupied Kashmir there.
The PM also touched upon his bilateral meeting with Trump in Washington during the recent US trip, saying that it was a “productive” and “constructive” engagement.
“It was held in a conducive environment,” he said, adding that he hoped it would help further strengthen Pakistan-US ties.</p><small>2025-09-28 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28174127c5582d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945198/un-arms-embargo-other-sanctions-reimposed-on-iran-over-nuclear-programme' target='_blank'><strong>UN arms embargo, other sanctions reimposed on Iran over nuclear programme</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations has reinstated an arms embargo and other sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme following a process triggered by European powers that Tehran has warned will be met with a harsh response.
Britain, France and Germany initiated the return of sanctions on Iran at the UN Security Council over accusations it had violated a 2015 deal that aimed to stop it from developing a nuclear bomb. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.
The end of the decade-long nuclear deal originally agreed by Iran, Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China is likely to exacerbate tensions in the Middle East, just months after Israel and the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites.
UN sanctions imposed by the Security Council in resolutions adopted between 2006 and 2010 were reinstated at 8pm EDT on Saturday. Attempts to delay the return of all sanctions on Iran failed on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the UN this week.
“We urge Iran and all states to abide fully by these resolutions,” the foreign ministers of France, Britain and Germany said in a joint statement after the deadline passed.
European Union (EU) foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas confirmed in a statement on Sunday that the bloc would “now proceed to implement the re-imposition of all previously lifted UN and EU nuclear-related sanctions without delay”.
Israel hailed the reimposition of sanctions on its arch foe as a “major development”, citing what it called Tehran’s ongoing violations over the nuclear programme.
“The goal is clear: prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. The world must use every tool to achieve this goal,” the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a post on X.
 






Tehran denounces ‘unjustifiable’ return of sanctions
Iran on Sunday condemned as “unjustifiable” the reinstatement of United Nations sanctions over its nuclear programme, after the collapse of talks with Western powers and Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear sites.
“The reactivation of annulled resolutions is legally baseless and unjustifiable… all countries must refrain from recognising this illegal situation,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran will firmly defend its national rights and interests, and any action aimed at undermining the rights and interests of its people will face a firm and appropriate response.“
Tehran had allowed UN inspectors to return to its nuclear sites, but Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said the United States had offered only a short reprieve in return for handing over its whole stockpile of enriched uranium, a proposal he described as unacceptable.
An 11th-hour effort by Iran allies Russia and China to postpone the sanctions until April failed to win enough votes in the Security Council on Friday, leading to the measures taking effect at 3:30 am in Tehran (5am PKT) on Sunday.
Germany, which triggered the return of sanctions alongside Britain and France, had “no choice” as Iran was not complying with its obligations, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.
“For us, it is imperative: Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon,” he told the UN General Assembly.“But let me emphasise: we remain open to negotiations on a new agreement. Diplomacy can and should continue.”
Iran calls in ambassadors
Tehran has warned of a harsh response to the reimposition of sanctions. Iran said on Saturday it was recalling its ambassadors to Britain, France and Germany for consultations. But Iranian President Pezeshkian said on Friday Iran had no intention of leaving the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Russia has disputed the return of UN sanctions on Iran.
“It is unlawful, and it cannot be implemented,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters at the UN earlier on Saturday, adding that he had written to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warning that it would be “a major mistake” for him to acknowledge a return of UN sanctions on Iran.
The European powers had offered to delay reinstating sanctions for up to six months to allow space for talks on a long-term deal if Iran restored access for UN nuclear inspectors, addressed concerns about its stock of enriched uranium, and engaged in talks with the United States.
“Our countries will continue to pursue diplomatic routes and negotiations. The reimposition of UN sanctions is not the end of diplomacy,” the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany said, urging Iran to “return to compliance”.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that President Donald Trump has been clear that diplomacy is still an option for Iran and a deal remains the best outcome for the Iranian people and the world.
“For that to happen, Iran must accept direct talks, held in good faith, without stalling or obfuscation,” Rubio said, adding that until there was a new deal it was important for countries to implement sanctions “immediately in order to pressure Iran’s leaders”.
Rial falls to record low
Iran’s economy is already struggling with crippling US sanctions reimposed since 2018 after Trump ditched the pact during his first term.
Iran’s rial currency continued to weaken over fears of new sanctions. The rial fell to 1,123,000 per US dollar, a new record low, on Saturday, from about 1,085,000 on Friday, according to foreign exchange websites, including Bon-bast.com.
With the return of UN sanctions, Iran will again be subjected to an arms embargo and a ban on all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, as well as any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
Other sanctions to be reimposed include a travel ban on dozens of Iranian citizens, asset freezes on dozens of people and entities and a ban on the supply of anything that could be used in the nation’s nuclear programme.
All countries are authorised to seize and dispose of any items banned under UN sanctions and Iran will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in any commercial activity in another country involving uranium mining, production or use of nuclear materials and technology.</p><small>2025-09-28 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/281646185b44806.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945191/shama-junejo-claims-pm-shehbaz-included-her-in-pakistans-un-delegation-as-adviser' target='_blank'><strong>Shama Junejo claims PM Shehbaz included her in Pakistan’s UN delegation as adviser</strong></a><br><p>The controversy surrounding the supposed inclusion of columnist and social media activist Shama Junejo in Pakistan’s delegation to the United Nations this week took a new turn on Sunday when she claimed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had included her among the delegates as an adviser.
The controversy had surfaced when photos from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s address at a UN Security Council session on artificial intelligence (AI) spread like wildfire on social media platform X, with users pointing to Junejo sitting in the background. Several of them also shared screenshots from her Twitter (now X) timeline from several years ago, expressing support for Israel — a position sharply at odds with Pakistan’s longstanding pro-Palestinian stance.
After social media furore, Asif said on X that only the Foreign Office could explain Junejo’s presence at the session. Later, the FO clarified that she had not been part of Pakistan’s accredited delegation.
Following that, Asif also spoke about the matter on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’. Asked whether he was “taken aback” by the FO’s statement, Asif emphatically said: “I was taken aback, rather I was a bit disturbed that such people could be with the delegation whom no one owns later.” He also denied Junejo having written PM Shehbaz’s speech for the 80th UN General Assembly session, further stating that as far as he knew, she did not have any official position, be it of an adviser or a special assistant.
However, Junejo claimed in a post on X today that she had been working for the prime minister for the past many months.
“My policy briefs, advice and points during the Pakistan-India escalation are all part of the record and preserved,” she said, further claiming that the premier had assigned her the task of “writing the UN speech”.
The London-based social media activist went on to claim that the PM himself had included her in the UN delegation as an adviser and that she was also issued a security pass.
“I worked with his team day and night. I travelled with him, stayed with his team in the same hotel and was also a part of his important meetings on the sidelines (of the UNGA session), such as the one with Bill Gates,” she said, adding that in another conference on climate on the UNGA sidelines, she was sitting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar behind the prime minister.
According to Junejo, after the session on climate, the protocol team escorted her to the session on AI, where she sat behind Asif alongside a man she identified as Bilal. In her post, she also shared a picture of herself with Asif and Pakistan Crypto Council Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib, as well as that of her UN card.
Junejo maintained that at the AI conference, Bilal continued to write a new speech and “we had tea together afterwards”.
“We sat together for 40 minutes waiting for the car, and returned to the hotel together in the same car. Khawaja Asif sahib sat with me on the backseat of the car,” she maintained.
Junejo claimed that she was also at the UN “with the others” when PM Shehbaz was delivering his speech. “There, Khawaja Asif was sitting in front of me, and we all applauded together for the prime minister.”
 






According to her, the PM’s “historic speech was not only written by her, but it was teamwork”. Junejo had claimed about being a part of the minister’s speech-writing team since April earlier as well.
In her post today, she claimed that her return flight was also booked beforehand, and the mission protocol team had dropped her at the airport.
She questioned, “Why is Khawaja Asif sahib issuing such statements now and under what agenda is he tarnishing a historic visit of his government?”
“The prime minister should ask him about this, as his authority has been challenged, not mine.”
In a similar post on X in English, she said Asif’s statements and the FO’s post “
have embarrassed Pakistan globally“.
She added, “If anyone attempts to malign my character or professional integrity, I reserve the right to pursue legal action in the UK.”
Minister passes the buck, FO distances itself
When the controversy had initially surfaced, Asif, facing a barrage of criticism, publicly distanced himself from Junejo’s appearance with the delegation and pointed the finger at the FO.
In a post on X, the defence minister had clarified that he had given the speech instead of PM Shehbaz at the UNSC session as the latter had other engagements.
 






“This woman or whoever sat behind me was and is at the discretion of the Foreign Office,” Asif said. “Who is this woman? Why is she with the delegation, and why was she seated behind me? Only the FO can answer these questions. It is not appropriate for me to respond on their behalf.”
Subsequently, the FO issued a clarification, stating: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has noted queries regarding the seating of a certain individual behind the defence minister at a recent meeting of the UNSC.
“To clarify, the individual in question was not listed in the official letter of credence for the Pakistan delegation to the 80th UNGA session, signed by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister.
 






“As such, her seating behind the defence minister did not have the approval of the deputy prime minister/ foreign minister.”
Official sources confirmed to Dawn that while the FO did not issue the required letter of credence, Junejo joined PM Shehbaz’s entourage from Britain, where she had been staying at the same hotel.
On arrival in New York, Pakistan’s mission to the UN was directed by “a senior political leader” to issue a note verbale for facilitating her accreditation so that she could attend meetings, including the UNSC debate, the Dawn report said.
It added that the leader’s argument was that though she wasn’t part of the official delegation notified by FO for the session, she was part of the entourage. Therefore, the mission was asked to get her accredited.
A source categorically told Dawn that the FO did not even have prior knowledge about Junejo’s inclusion in the entourage.
Junejo clarifies stance on Israel
Meanwhile, Junejo has also posted about her stance on Israel.
In a post on X today, she said that an impression of her being pro-Israel was created on the basis of a 2018 post on X. “Whereas, I have been writing against the massacre in Gaza and Netanyahu almost daily since 2023. But nobody sees that.”
She said her statements about Pakistan recognising Israel were given during Abraham Accords — a set of agreements that normalised ties between Israel and multiple Arab states — and that she had always condemned Israel’s atrocities since its invasion of Gaza. “I will keep doing so,” she added, referring to a video of Pakistani delegates walking out during the recent UNGA session.
 






At the UNGA, delegates from several countries had walked out, boycotting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech.
Earlier, Junejo had shared screenshots on X of previous posts where she had called out Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
The Dawn report from yesterday mentions that in her social media posts from London, Junejo had also said she was in possession of the ‘secret files’ raising questions about the security of such documents.
Junejo, in a post on X, also appeared to be clarifying this matter. She said: “There was a fire incident at the Churchill Hotel which left me panicked. I am disabled and was not assisted during evacuation. I carried hard copies of speech drafts and meeting notes — my personal intellectual property. These were sensitive but not state documents. I held no access to or custody of any official files beyond my remit.”
