“In yet another cowardly and ghastly attack planned and orchestrated by terrorist state of India and executed by its proxies in Balochistan, innocent school-going children’s bus was targeted today in Khuzdar,” a statement by the ISPR read.
“As per the initial reports, three innocent children and two adults have embraced martyrdom and multiple children have sustained injuries,” the press release added.
“After having miserably failed in the battlefield, through these most heinous and cowardly such like acts, Indian proxies have been unleashed to spread terror and unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the ISPR said.
 
 

“Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians,” the statement said.
It noted that India had “failed” in Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.
“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of [sic] basic human norms,” the ISPR said.
“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military vowed.
Pakistan Armed Forces, with the support of the brave Pakistani nation, stand “united to uproot Indian sponsored terrorism from Pakistan in all its manifestations”, the ISPR said.
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
He had detailed the arrest of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as “irr­e­futable evidence” of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind­ian military personnel.
On Monday, the ISPR said 12 terrorists of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Earlier today, Deputy Commissioner Yasir Iqbal Dashti had told Dawn.com that the blast occurred when the school bus was near the Khuzdar Zero Point.
The bodies and the injured were taken to the Khuzdar CMH, from where the seriously injured would be referred to medical facilities in Quetta and Karachi, the DC said.
Police, the Frontier Corps (FC) and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel have reached the site of the incident to collect evidence for an investigation.
While a probe was underway, the DC said preliminary findings indicated that the attack was a suicide blast.
Condemnations
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack on the Khuzdar school bus, describing it as a cowardly act.
“The attack on innocent children in a school bus by terrorists working under Indian patronage is a clear proof of their hostility towards education in Balochistan,” he said in a statement.
Expressing deep sorrow over the death of the children, PM Shehbaz said that the terrorists have “crossed all limits of barbarity”, vowing to bring them to their end.
“The sympathies of the entire nation, including mine, are with the families of these innocent children, who were victims of the brutality of terrorists.”
He directed the security forces to bring the perpetrators to justice, and showed support for the armed forces’ resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari termed the attack a “heinous and inhumane crime.” He vowed to expose this “Indian-backed terrorism” at an international level.
“These terrorists do not want to see Balochistan developed,” he said in a statement.
 






Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind denounced the attack as the “hideous face of Indian state-sponsored terrorism”, as well as a “cowardly and inhumane act”.
In a statement, Rind echoed the ISPR’s stance, saying that India was “creating instability in Balochistan to hide its failures”. He called India’s “state-sponsored terrorism a threat to world peace.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi strongly condemned the “explosion inside the bus near Khuzdar Zero Point”.
In a statement, he expressed deep sorrow and grief over the death of four children, and extended his condolences to their families.
“The beasts who target innocent children do not deserve any leniency. The enemy demonstrated barbarity by attacking innocent children,” Naqvi asserted.
“The attack on the school bus is a heinous conspiracy of the enemy to create instability in the country. With the unity of the nation, we will foil every conspiracy,” the interior minister vowed.
Naqvi also prayed for the speedy recovery of the wounded.
 






Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan also denounced the attack, saying that “terrorism against innocent children was the height of cowardice”.
 






Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti vowed that they will not only expose every terrorist operating in the province,  but also “eradicate them completely”.
“Following the success of Operation [Bunyanum Marsoos] and India’s disgraceful defeat, they have now resorted to cowardly and shameful tactics,” he wrote on X.
 






Later while talking to the media, Bugti said they had solid information that Ajit Doval, the Indian national security adviser, was planning something in Balochistan but did not expect him to target children.
“We had intelligence regarding this but to target innocent children, this is [India’s] cowardice.”
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) strongly condemned the “heinous” attack.
“The deliberate targeting of schoolchildren — innocent noncombatants in every sense — is a red line that must never be crossed. This act violates the most basic tenets of humanity and international humanitarian law,” the organisation said in a statement posted on X.
It said the “continued failure of the federal and provincial governments to prevent such attacks highlights serious and persistent lapses in providing security to common citizens”.
It added that the state had an “obligation to uphold law and order by strengthening civilian institutions and the rule of law — not through indiscriminate kinetic responses.”
The HRCP called for the “immediate identification and prosecution of the perpetrators and their enablers through lawful means”.
It also stressed the “urgent need for a meaningful political dialogue to address the deep-rooted problems of representation, governance and resource distribution in Balochistan”.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has decided to send a high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda“ in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India.
Bilawal has been entrusted to lead the delegation, comprising Senator Sherry Rehman, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Sabzwari, Tehmina Janjua, and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
The former foreign minister was speaking to the media after receiving an initial briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before he leads the high-level diplomatic delegation to world capitals to brief foreign leaders on India’s aggression and efforts to destabilise regional peace.
 






Bilawal said they received an initial briefing at the Foreign Office on the ceasefire, Kashmir, terrorism and the “attack” on the Indus Waters Treaty.
He said these briefings will be held for the next few days, and then as per the prime minister’s directive, they will visit different countries to present Pakistan’s stance that is based on peace.
He said Pakistan desired peace in the region that can be achieved by addressing the flashpoints, whether it was the Kashmir dispute or terrorism.
“Pakistan is one of the biggest victims of terrorism,” he noted.
Bilawal cautioned that the “new normal” which India is seeking is not in its favour either.
“We have seen how after a terrorist attack, both countries can come close to a nuclear war,” he added.
 


Bilawal said there was a need to hold dialogue and find solutions to the issue of terrorism. He said the people of both countries sought peace, which was not possible until the three main issues — Kashmir, terrorism, and water — were resolved.
He expressed grave concerns about India’s weaponisation of water and highlighted the need for Pakistan to inform the world about it.
He said that they will inform foreign governments and people that a conflict between two nuclear countries will have severe consequences beyond the region.
He also appreciated the efforts of the prime minister during the conflict, saying Pakistan demonstrated a ‘reasonable and rational role’ after India’s baseless accusations.
“Pakistan was not the aggressor, we defended ourselves,” adding the world is welcoming our stance as we stood with the truth, while India built a narrative on lies and falsehoods.
Bilawal, in a recent post on X, announced that he was appointed by the prime minister to “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.
“I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” he wrote.
In a similar development, the Indian government also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p><small>2025-05-21 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21110203051f156.jpg?r=113951' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912365/dar-meets-chinese-afghan-fms-as-they-agree-to-thwart-terrorism-in-region' target='_blank'><strong>Dar meets Chinese, Afghan FMs as they agree to thwart terrorism in region</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and agreed to extend the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan.
On Monday, Deputy PM Dar arrived in China’s capital of Beijing on a three-day official visit at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Yi amid regional tensions. The trilateral forum was established in 2017, with earlier meetings held in Beijing and the Afghan capital.
China said on Tuesday that it supports Pakistan in defending “national sovereignty and territorial integrity”, after a ceasefire ended four days of fighting with India over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
“Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar Member of the Communist Party of China Political Bureau & Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic of China Wang Yi, and Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Amir Khan Muttaqi, held an informal trilateral meeting in Beijing today,” the statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said.
 






“They agreed to deepen Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation and extend the CPEC to Afghanistan,” the FO added.
The three foreign ministers reaffirmed trilateral cooperation as a vital platform to promote regional security and economic connectivity, the statement continued.
“It was agreed that the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Meeting will be held in Kabul at an early, mutually convenient date,” according to the FO.
The foreign ministers discussed enhancing diplomatic engagement, strengthening communications, and taking practical steps to boost trade, infrastructure, and development as key drivers of shared prosperity.
The ministers underscored their shared commitment to countering terrorism and fostering stability and development in the region.
Dar posted a photo of himself with his counterparts, saying they stood together for regional peace, stability and development.
 






He also held a separate meeting with FM Muttaqi in which the two welcomed the positive momentum in bilateral ties, including enhanced diplomatic engagement, trade and transit facilitation.
“They agreed to work together to advance mutual interests, including in the domains of trade, transit, connectivity and security,” the FO said.
 






Earlier in the month, the Afghan government under the Taliban called for “mutual respect and constructive engagement” with Pakistan and China, according to a statement issued by its interior ministry.
The statement was issued after special envoys of Pakistan and China, Mohammad Sadiq and Yue Xiaoyong, met Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul.
On May 15, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar held a telephone conversation with the Acting Afghan FM Muttaqi, marking India’s first minister-level outreach to the Taliban administration in Afghanistan, the Hindu reported.
Air chief lauds China’s role in Pakistan’s defence capabilities
Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu has commended China’s role in assisting Pakistan’s defence modernisation and technological advancement, state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.
During a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong, who called on him in Islamabad, the air chief expressed his profound gratitude to China for its continued support and unwavering friendship.
He emphasised that the bond between both countries has only strengthened over the decades and will continue to deepen through future cooperation and partnership.
They held comprehensive and in-depth discussion on a range of matters including corporate-level engagements, defence cooperation and the evolving geostrategic environment in the region.
The dignitaries underscored the importance of cohesive and collaborative approaches in responding to emerging challenges, emphasising the necessity of maintaining peak operational readiness and swift coordination amidst the prevailing regional security dynamics.
They reaffirmed their pledge to institutionalise regular high-level exchanges through expanded joint operational exercises and exploration of multilateral frameworks that bolster collective response mechanisms to emerging threats.
In his remarks, the Chinese ambassador lauded the unmatched operational excellence demonstrated by PAF personnel during the recent standoff on the eastern front, terming it a reflection of PAF’s high standards and unwavering commitment to national defence.
The envoy acknowledged PAF’s operational effectiveness and strategic acumen in employing indigenous solutions and advanced systems to safeguard national interests and deter potential threats under the current leadership.
Reaffirming China’s enduring support, the ambassador assured full technical assistance to PAF in order to bolster its aerial defence capabilities.
He also lauded Pakistan’s commitment to self-reliance and emphasised that PAF’s investment in indigenous processes had begun to yield promising results. He stressed that continued focus on homegrown technological development would further elevate the country’s defence capabilities.</p><small>2025-05-21 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21143908d23ccfa.jpg?r=152553' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912385/jumbo-task-400-pills-a-day-for-elephants-with-tb-at-karachis-safari-park' target='_blank'><strong>Jumbo task: 400 pills a day for elephants with TB at Karachi’s Safari Park</strong></a><br><p>A team of doctors and vets has developed a novel treatment for the pair of elephants at Karachi’s Safari Park suffering from tuberculosis that involves feeding them at least 400 pills a day.
The jumbo effort by staff involves administering the tablets — the same as those used to treat TB in humans — hidden inside food ranging from apples and bananas to sweets.
The amount of medication is adjusted to account for the weight of the 4,000-kilogramme elephants.
But it has taken Madhubala and Malika several weeks to settle into the treatment after spitting out the first few doses they tasted of the bitter medicine, and crankily charging their keepers.
“Giving treatment for TB to elephants is always challenging. Each day we use different methods,” said Buddhika Bandara, a veterinary surgeon from Sri Lanka who flew in to oversee the treatment.

“The animals showed some stress in the beginning, but gradually they adapted to the procedure,” said Bandara, who has helped more than a dozen elephants recover from the illness in Sri Lanka.
Mahout Ali Baloch wakes early daily to stew rice and lentils, mixed with plenty of sugar cane molasses, and rolls the concoction into dozens of balls pierced with the tablets.
“I know the pills are bitter,” the 22-year-old said, watching the elephants splashing under a hose to keep cool.

From humans to elephants
Four African elephants — captured very young in the wild in Tanzania — arrived in Karachi in 2009.
Noor Jehan died in 2023 at the age of 17, and another, Sonia, followed at the end of 2024. An autopsy showed she had contracted tuberculosis, which is endemic in Pakistan.
Tests carried out on Madhubala and Malika also came back positive, and the city council, which owns the park, assembled a team to care for the pachyderms.

Bandara said it is not uncommon for elephants to contract the contagious illness from humans, but that Sonia — and now Madhubala and Malika — had shown no symptoms.
“It was surprising for me that elephants have TB,” said Naseem Salahuddin, head of the Infectious Disease Department at the Indus Hospital and Health Network, who was enrolled to monitor staff.
“This is an interesting case for me and my students — everyone wants to know about the procedure and its progress,” she told AFP.
The team of four mahouts wear face masks and scrubs when feeding the elephants to avoid contracting a disease that infects more than 500,000 humans a year.
Safari Park has long been criticised for the mistreatment of captive animals, including an elephant evacuated after a campaign by American singer Cher, but is hopeful its last two elephants will overcome the illness with a year-long treatment plan.</p><small>2025-05-21 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21123058dd2e97a.gif?r=123850' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912288/hbl-psl-2025-in-form-quetta-gladiators-face-islamabad-united-in-top-shelf-qualifier' target='_blank'><strong>HBL PSL 2025: In-form Quetta Gladiators face Islamabad United in top-shelf qualifier</strong></a><br><p> 

LAHORE: Players of Lahore Qalandars attend a training session on Tuesday.—M.Arif/White Star

LAHORE: High-flying Quetta Gladiators face defending champions Islamabad United in the first qualifier of the HBL Pakistan Super League X here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday.
Though United have won three PSL titles — in 2016, 2018 and 2024 — ever since the league was launched in 2016 while Gladiators have clinched the title only once (2019), the latter have shown great form and consistency in the ongoing edition to top the table with 15 points (seven wins, two losses, one no result) in the league stage of the six-team competition.
 


Moreover, Gladiators’ victories in both their league-stage games against United signify the Saud Shakeel-led squad’s profile ahead of the top-shelf clash.
Gladiators had to fight hard against United to win the first match in Lahore, they won their second duel in Rawalpindi by a massive 109 runs after amassing a record-equalling 263. So impressive was Gladiators’ recent form that they won six of their last seven league-stage matches while one against Lahore Qalandars was washed out at the Gaddafi Stadium.
For second-placed United (12 points; six wins, four losses), they must forget the past when they enter the field today.
In contrast, United started off in this edition like a true champion team winning the their first five games. Then they nosedived lose four matches on the trot, before returning to the winning ways in Rawalpindi where they crushed Karachi Kings by 79 runs.
Talking to media on Tuesday, Saud said that his team would try to maintain their form in the playoffs.
“We entered the playoffs stage after playing good cricket and we will try our best to maintain that momentum in this final stage of the league,” Saud said while talking to media after his team held a practice session at the LCCA Ground.
“Though there is always room for improvement, the priority in the playoffs stage is to make minimum mistakes as there are very few chances to bear the losses of mistakes.”
He said Khawaja Nafay and Hasan Nawaz got opportunities and they made the most of them. “With the return of Rilee Rossouw, out batting line-up has been boosted further.”
Saud further said that the playing XI would be decided after watching the pitch on Wednesday.
The Shadab Khan-captained United did practice on Tuesday, perhaps preferring to rest after playing their last league-stage match in Rawalpindi on Monday.
Mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed — with 15 wickets in the ongoing edition — is a potent weapon possessed by Gladiators who are reinforced by pacers Faheem Ashraf (14), Khurram Shahzad (12) and Mohammad Amir (10).
Players including Hasan Nawaz (317 runs), Rossouw (234), Saud (221) and Finn Allen form a strong batting line-up.
On the other hand, United’s bowling attack looks a bit more dependable in the presence of fast bowlers Jason Holder (15 wickets), Naseem Shah (nine wickets), Salman Irshad (five wickets), Ben Dwarshius (four), and spinners like Shadab (13) and Imad Wasim (12).
United formidable batting line-up includes the league’s top-scorer Sahibzada Farhan (394), Alex Hales, who replaced Colin Munro made a blistering 88 against Karachi Kings in the last match, Rassie van der Dussen, Shadab, Imad and Azam Khan.
Speaking to media after the last league match on Monday, Salman said that he was enjoying his time at United.
“This is my seventh PSL I guess. I have played a lot of games in this league. The team combination and environment of Islamabad United are nice. Moreover, there was no pressure from the captain or the coach as all our players got breaks [during the league stage] and got equal opportunities,” the pacer told reporters. “Therefore, I as a player enjoy the games.”
Answering a question on the impact of foreign players on United’s performance, Sal­man said that the return of the overseas professionals was certainly benefitting his team.
“[Alex] Hales played a fine knock in the only match he played so far [in this edition] plus Van Der Dussen is there. Our foreign players are very good and valuable for the team,” he said.
“[Moreover] we have the [team] combination which we wanted to form before the playoffs.”
Teams (from):
QUETTA GLADIATORS: Saud Shakeel (captain), Finn Allen, Rilee Rossouw, Hasan Nawaz, Khawaja Nafay, Faheem Ashraf, Khurram Shahzad, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Mohammad Amir, Usman Tariq, Danish Aziz, Abrar Ahmed.
ISLAMABAD UNITED: Shadab Khan (captain), Sahibzada Farhan,  Salman Agha, Azam Khan, Haider Ali, Imad Wasim,  Rassie van der Dussen,  Naseem Shah,  Jason Holder, Ben Dwarshius, Tymal Mills, Salman Irshad, Saad Masood.

Starlink Services, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is one of the most technologically advanced companies globally among those providing internet via low-Earth orbit satellites. Last month, the Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja announced that Starlink services are expected to be operational in the country by the end of this year.
The ambassador, accompanied by a delegation, was briefed on the collaboration efforts between Pakistan and SpaceX, particularly how Starlink’s low-Earth orbit satellite infrastructure and SpaceX’s commercial capabilities held “transformative” potential for Pakistan’s digital landscape.
The delegation was received at SpaceX Headquarters by the vice-president of Starlink global business operations and the director of global business development, and provided a guided tour of the space giant’s headquarters.
During the visit, the two parties discussed efforts focused on “expanding broadband access and strengthening national connectivity, particularly in remote and underprivileged areas”, as per the report.
Ambassador Rizwan Saeed reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment towards promoting innovation through strategic international partnerships, hoping that such engagement would result in tangible cooperation in space technology, digital infrastructure, and commercial innovation.
The engagement is part of a series of efforts focused on strengthening ties between the private IT sectors of Pakistan and the US.
Last month, the IT minister announced that a provisional licence has been granted to Starlink to provide satellite-based internet services in the country, and services were expected to be available in the country by the end of this year. She also announced that a Chinese firm — Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology — has also applied for a satellite-based internet licence, adding that, “the government is encouraging competition in the sector.”</p><small>2025-05-21 07:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21084544af3b971.jpg?r=084625' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912343/rabies-a-preventable-tragedy' target='_blank'><strong>Rabies: a preventable tragedy</strong></a><br><p>LAST month, a man from Qambar district in Sindh died a slow and agonising death — not from a rare or untreatable illness, but from rabies, which can be prevented with timely intervention.
After being bitten by a stray dog, he and his family searched frantically for an anti-rabies vaccine in their district, but their attempts were futile. By the time they reached Karachi, he had already developed the symptoms. It was too late. His death, like so many others, was the result of a systemic failure.
This tragedy reflects a growing public health crisis across Sindh. Rabies cases are on the rise amidst a critical shortage of life-saving vaccines and an increasing population of stray dogs.
According to reports, at least nine people have died from rabies since the beginning of the year, and more than 8,000 dog-bite cases have been reported at major hospitals such as JPMC, the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital and Indus Hospital.
 
 

Many rural areas face graver challenges, with some districts having no supply of vaccines at all. For residents in remote regions, accessing treatment often means travelling long distances — a logistical and financial burden few can bear. For too many, the delay proves fatal.
The increase in dog-bite incidents correlates with the growing number of stray dogs, especially in urban areas and on the outskirts of cities where urban and rural life intersect.
Public health officials cite the lack of effective dog population control programmes and insufficient vaccination campaigns as the main barriers to addressing the rabies threat. The disease is almost universally fatal once symptoms begin, making prevention the only viable strategy.
The Rabies Free Karachi initiative by Indus Hospital has demonstrated that coordinated vaccination and sterilisation campaigns can drastically reduce dog-bite incidents and rabies-related deaths. However, such initiatives remain limited in scale and coverage.
Pakistan’s struggle is in sharp contrast to the progress made by several other Asian countries. Sri Lanka, for example, once recorded over 300 rabies deaths per year in the 1970s.
Today, that number has dropped to fewer than 20 annually. This success is the result of sustained investment in mass dog vaccination, free human post-exposure prophylaxis and widespread public education.
Thailand has seen similar success. By 2019, rabies fatalities in Thailand had been reduced to fewer than five per year, thanks to long-term efforts under the Rabies Free by 2020 initiative, which included dog registration, mass vaccination, school-based education and effective cold-chain logistics even in rural areas.

Pakistan’s struggle against rabies is in sharp contrast to the progress made by several other Asian countries.

These examples show that the elimination of rabies is achievable. What successful countries share is not just a strategy but long-term commitment: sustained funding, interdepartmental collaboration and public engagement. Pakistan, however, continues to record an estimated 2,000 to 5,000 rabies deaths per year, according to the World Health Organisation — numbers that refl­e­­ct chronic neglect rather than a lack of solutions.
 
 

The Sindh government’s response has been inadequate. While there have been efforts to address the issue — such as the launch of DowRab, an anti-rabies vaccine developed by Dow University of Health Sciences in Karachi — these measures have fallen short of meeting the growing demand.
Despite the availability of this locally produced vaccine, shortages persist, and many district hospitals remain without the necessary supplies to treat dog-bite victims promptly.
The vaccine distribution system is fragmented and marred by bureaucratic hurdles, poor coordination between health departments and local governments, and logistical inefficiencies in maintaining cold chains. There is no province-wide emergency framework to ensure timely restocking or referral support for rural patients.
This situation calls for immediate and comprehensive action. Priority must be given to the procurement and equitable distribution of anti-rabies vaccines, ensuring their availability at all healthcare facilities, particularly in high-risk and underserved areas. In parallel, public health agencies must commit to coordinated, humane strategies to control the stray dog population — through sterilisation drives and dog vaccination programmes.
The current approach leans heavily on emergency treatment rather than prevention. By the time a patient arrives at a hospital showing symptoms of rabies, there is no cure. Prevention — through dog vaccination and sterilisation, prompt post-bite treatment and education — is the only effective strategy. Community awareness remains dangerously low.
Many victims still turn to traditional remedies or delay hospital visits due to misinformation. Public education campaigns must address this gap. Schools, mosques, media outlets and local councils can help spread accurate information. Rabies education should be integrated into school curricula and broadcast through local media in regional languages.
Another major shortfall is the lack of accurate data. Rabies cases are chronically underreported, which makes planning and resource allocation difficult. A centralised digital system to record dog-bite cases and vaccination status would allow health authorities to identify hotspots and deploy resources more effectively. Real-time data could become the foundation for a smarter, more responsive health strategy.
 
 

This crisis is not only about public health infrastructure, it is also a reflection of governance and collective priorities. Rabies is a disease we know how to prevent. Every death is a result of inaction. Solutions exist, not just in theory but in practice, in countries with similar economic and administrative challenges. What remains is for Pakistan to implement them with the urgency and seriousness they demand.
Every individual can make a difference by supporting local vaccination campaigns, promoting awareness within their community, and donating to organisations working on the ground. Civic engagement — whether through volunteering, advocacy, or financial contributions — can create momentum that drives institutional change. This public health challenge demands the combined efforts of policymakers, healthcare providers, and the public. Civic engagement can create a ripple effect that brings about lasting change.
Ending Sindh’s rabies crisis is a test of our political will, public responsibility and moral resolve. We cannot resurrect those who have already died, but we can prevent the next death. What we need is decisive, coordinated, and compassionate action.

HYDERABAD/NAWABSHAH: A protester was killed and over a dozen others, including a DSP and six other policemen, were injured during clashes in the Moro city of Naushahro Feroz — the home district of Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar — on Tuesday.
Mr Lanjar’s house was also attacked, along with two trailers on Moro bypass road.
Violence erupted when police attempted to disperse a protest reportedly organised by Sindh Saba against the proposed construction of new canals on the River Indus. The protesters had blocked the Moro bypass road to record their protest.
A similar programme was scheduled by Sindh Saba at the press club in Hyderabad, but police authorities did not allow it and cordoned off the main road leading to the club. Police also picked up two activists of the party.
In Moro, the protesters, armed with rods and sticks, raised slogans against corporate farming and the proposed canals. According to local sources, the protest site was about one kilometre from the residence of the provincial home minister.
When police tried to disperse the crowd, the protesters refused to move. Police then used force, resorting to baton charge and firing into the air, which injured several protesters and pedestrians.
One of the injured, Zahid Leghari, son of Allah Bachayo Leghari, who had sustained bullet wounds, later died at Nawabshah hospital. The injured were initially taken to Moro’s hospital and then shifted to Peoples Medical University in Benazirabad, the divisional headquarters.
 
 

According to Dr Yar Mohammad Jam­ali, medical superintendent at Peoples Medical University Hos­­pital Nawabshah, Zahid was brought dead at the facility. Others who suffered bullet injuries included Irfan Ali, Shah­meer, Mohsin Ali, Dilbar and Abdul Kha­lique.
Dr Jamali added that three policemen — Tahir Afzal, Abdul Khaliq and Samad Ali — were also brought to the hos­­pital, but did not have gunshot injuries.
Shaheed Benazirabad DIG Pervez Ahmed Chandio, SSP Shaheed Benazir­abad Shabbir Sethar, along with a heavy contingent of police from Nawabshah, Dadu and Matiari, reached Moro to control the law and order situation.
According to police sources, several protesters were later arrested. When contacted, the Naushahro Feroze SSP was unavailable for comment.
Reports from local official and private sources suggested that more than four dozen activists, said to be affiliated with the Sindh Saba Party under the leadership of Ashfaq Malik, had blocked the road to protest against corporate farming and the construction of new canals over the Indus. The situation escalated into a violent clash between the police and protesters, turning the area into a virtual battlefield.
Businesses were shut, and roads were deserted. Protesters set two trailers on fire and also damaged a police van.
After the news of Zahid Leghari’s death spread, the protest intensified. Protesters stormed the residence of Zia Lanjar, ransacked it and set fire to the parking shed and drawing room.  Activists from other nationalist parties also joined the protest.
The protesters chanted slogans against police brutality and held placards demanding accountability. The situation began returning to normal around 7pm.
Sindh IG Ghulam Nabi Memon confirmed that parts of the home minister’s house were attacked. “We are investigating whether it was preplanned or otherwise,” he said.
The Sindh police chief added that initially 50 to 60 people began a sit-in on the road and refused to clear the blockade when asked by police.
“They were armed and literally fought the police, beating them ruthlessly,” he claimed.
PPP Sindh Information Secretary Ajiz Dhamra condemned the incident in a statement, calling it a terrorist act. He said there was no ban on peaceful protest, but attacking the house of a political opponent reflected a conspiracy.
The home minister directed the Nau­shahro Feroz SSP to submit a detailed report of the incident.
He said no one would be allowed to challenge the writ of the state and instructed police to take ac­­tion against those disturbing the peace.

PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan has also hoped the incarcerated party leader, Imran Khan, will be “released in a week”, even though the government has dismissed reports of negotiations with the opposition party.
He called the former prime minister’s incarceration “unjustified” as the cases against him were “bogus and politically motivated”.
Speaking to reporters outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday after meeting Mr Khan, along with party leaders Salman Akram Raja and Ali Zafar, Mr Gohar said the jailed PTI leader had shut the door on talks with the government but not with the military establishment.
He said Pakistan managed to triumph over India in recent clashes due to national unity.

Hopes Imran will be released soon; govt denies negotiations with jailed PTI founder

“Now that we are at peace with global powers, there is hope of peace internally,” he said, referring to the local political situation.
He hoped that Mr Khan would be released soon. “We pray it happens this week,” he said, without elaborating how the jailed ex-PM could be released with appeals against his conviction pending in court.
‘No exceptions for Imran’
Meanwhile, the federal government has dismissed reports of talks with PTI for Mr Khan’s release. He said no individual could be granted special treatment and the only way to seek relief is through courts.
 
 

“If exceptions are made for one, we must equally address the plight of 90,000 others languishing in prisons awaiting justice,” PML-N leader Irfan Siddiqui said during a discussion on a private TV channel.
Mr Siddiqui added that the nation’s stability didn’t hinge on any single individual’s incarceration. “Our institutions remain functional, and the economy is on a recovery trajectory despite inherited challenges,” he claimed.
“There are no direct or backchannel talks going on with the PTI chief, and the reports are completely baseless,” he said.
He said the PTI “must abandon any illusion of external help, either from the IMF or foreign powers”. He accused the previous PTI government of political victimisation and misusing state institutions to fabricate charges against opponents.
On the report of a possible attempt by PTI to present a no-confidence motion against the prime minister or National Assembly speaker, Mr Sid­diqui said if the opposition party can secure the required numbers, “we will face it with grace and composure”.
PTI condemns India
Meanwhile, PTI has condemned India’s hawkish attitude and aggressive posture against Pakistan. In a statement, PTI leader Sheikh Waqas Akram said New Delhi seemed “hell-bent on weaponising water” flowing into Pakistan.
The “bloodthirsty” Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, not only categorically stated that water and blood cannot flow together but  also reportedly expedited the planning and execution of reservoir projects on Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers. He said the plan to double the Ranbir Canal’s length on the Chenab was a blatant violation of the Indus Waters Treaty. He urged the government to adopt a proactive strategic response to counter India’s violations of the treaty.

So depraved is Tel Aviv’s extermination war machine in the occupied Palestinian territory that even the UK, Canada and France — members of the Western bloc that have often rushed to Israel’s defence in the global arena — have termed the situation in Gaza “intolerable”.
And it appears that despite the murder of over 53,000 people by Israel, including women and children, since the slaughter began following the Oct 7, 2023, attacks, things may actually get worse. After all, Tel Aviv’s chief warmonger Benjamin Netanyahu has just said that Israel “will take control of all the territory” of Gaza.
It is clear that under the cover of rescuing hostages and avenging the Oct 7 events, Israel is carrying out the ethnic cleansing of Gaza to reoccupy the savaged Strip.
The on again-off again peace talks are going nowhere, and after starving Gaza since March 2, a trickle of aid has just been let in by Palestine’s occupiers. One UN official has described this delivery of aid as a “drop in the ocean”.
There are many within the Israeli political establishment that continue to call for mass starvation of Gaza’s people. Unfortunately, Israel has failed to realise that despite its monstrous crimes against Gaza’s population, the Palestinian people refuse to yield.
 
 

This is indeed a classic case of a native population resisting a ruthless occupier — a population that is willing to die rather than leave their land. History has proved that in many such cases, the occupiers have had to retreat in ignominy, while the people of the occupied land have succeeded in raising the banner of freedom. The price the Palestinian people are paying for their resistance is immense, but they have proven that even genocide cannot break their will.
Yet the fact that the Palestinians are resisting a brutal occupation does not absolve the international community of the responsibility of stopping Israel’s mass murder. Specifically, the US — Tel Aviv’s chief foreign patron — has a lot to answer for.
Donald Trump has in his second presidential term taken on the avatar of peacemaker. His intervention is believed to have been crucial in ending the recent Pakistan-India hostilities. He is working the phones to end the Ukraine war. He is even — despite some bluster — interested in a peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear dispute.
Now these peace-making tendencies must be extended to Gaza. The quickest way to stop the bloodshed would be for the US to immediately halt all military and financial aid to Israel. The world, particularly Gaza’s battered people, will be waiting for Mr Trump to do the right thing.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there is a benefit-cost ratio of five to one on national investments in mental healthcare.
In this regard, efforts to develop mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services directly align with UN Sustainable Development Goals’ targets 3.4 and 3.5, pertaining to the promotion and prevention of mental health and well-being, and the treatment of substance abuse.
They also implicitly align with targets 1.4 and 10.2, ensuring equal rights and access to services, and the promotion of social and economic inclusion.
 
 

Unfortunately, Pakistan’s existing mental health services remain under-resourced and inequitably distributed. Although access to evidence-based mental health services is a fundamental right, more than 80 per cent of those suffering from ill mental health lack adequate care.
A recent systematic review of factors that hindered access to services in Pakistan included financial, geographical and logistics constraints; stigma and poor mental health literacy; unsatisfactory outcomes of previous treatments; and reliance on religious leaders and faith healers.
Gaps in existing mental healthcare are not limited to a dearth of services, but also quality of care. In the public sector, psychiatric services are mainly biomedical in their approach, focusing on brief consultations exploring medical symptoms, followed by pharmacological prescriptions.
The pre-service training we are currently offering our medical graduates is inadequate due to outdated curricula, shortage of qualified faculty, and the lack of priority given to psychiatry as an essential subject.
As a result, primary care physicians are simply not trained to even identify mental disorders. This is evident from the health information system in KP which includes three mental disorders — depression, epilepsy, and drug dependence — but there is little reported data from primary care.
 
 

In addition, hundreds of clinical psychologists are working in NGOs, rehabilitation centres, and the private sector. Unfortunately, there simply aren’t enough opportunities or incentives for them to seek supervision or to strengthen their skills, as most work in project-based, short-term positions.
Pakistan has committed to providing universal health coverage and has endorsed the WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030; both aim at developing accessible services by integrating mental healthcare into primary care services. But the National Action Framework for non-communicable diseases and mental health (2021-2030) acknowledges that Pakistan currently lacks the resources and capacity to respond to the challenge.
Pakistan’s Ministry of Planning, Development & Special Initiatives (MoPD&SI) recognises that prioritising mental health and well-being in national policies is a critical step if Pakistan is to achieve its SDGs.
To prioritise mental health agenda in the national development portfolio, the strategic initiative of the 5Es Framework by the ministry, approved by the National Economic Council, envisions MHPSS as a key area that can ensure equitable access to mental health services under the fifth component, which addresses the fundamental issues of accessibility, inclusivity and social justice in healthcare delivery. It is also aligned with the government’s Uraan initiative, to build an equitable and inclusive society by directly supporting the initiative’s emphasis on equity, ethics and empowerment.

Gaps in mental healthcare are not limited to a dearth of services, but also quality of care.

 
 

Under its exclusive mandate and per a collaborative framework, the MoPD&SI has set up a Mental Health Strategic Planning and Coordination Unit to support a planning and coordinating mechanism at the national level, and to provide technical support to the federal and provincial health departments for effective implementation of MHPSS services.
To achieve this, a comprehensive multilayered, digital MHPSS model has been developed. This model focuses on building the capacity of a mental health workforce to offer MHPSS services; set up referral links; and collecting vital data to allow for the tracking of mental health needs — crucial for future policymaking and resource allocation. Last year, a part of this model was successfully tested by training primary care physicians across nine districts in KP.
This year, in collaboration with the KP Health Department and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, the MoPD&SI is providing technical support to pilot MHPSS services in two districts of KP.
To achieve this, 500 people in the community will be trained as Hamdard Force to help people access MHPSS services; a dozen clinical psychologists will be trained to support individuals experiencing extreme stress; and 80 doctors will be trained to manage common mental disorders; and coordinated care will help establish efficient referral pathway to specialist services.
It is estimated that at least 20pc of the population in KP may be at risk of suffering from a mental disorder. Yet, the province continues to face a critical shortage and uneven distribution of mental health services. For 40 million people, there are only 50 psychiatrists, half of whom are based in Peshawar.
 
 

In addition to existing psychiatric services in the capital city, there is a plan to shift the Sarhad Hospital for Psychiatric Diseases from the central jail’s premises to a newly constructed large psychiatric hospital in Hayatabad, to ‘upgrade psychiatric services in the province’. It is imperative that services are allocated uniformly across districts to promote inclusivity and equity.
It is also worth considering that the provincial government is currently spending around Rs190m each year to support a single Dadar Hospital at Mansehra. This hospital, spread over 72 acres, offers 100 beds for mentally ill patients. There are sanctioned posts to appoint a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist, which are lying vacant.
It is alarming that without any specialist supervision, the bed occupancy rate is more than 90pc across the five psychiatric wards. By scaling up the MHPSS model across the province, the same funds could be used to provide comprehensive evidence-based and rights-based services across all districts.
There is a critical opportunity for provincial policymakers and healthcare planners to equitably decentralise distant, urban-centered services into comprehensive mental health service across all districts.

• Field Marshal terms honour ‘tribute to the entire armed forces and the people of Pakistan’
• ACM Sidhu becomes first air chief to be given second extension
• Ex-generals foresee new role of vice chief of army staff for four-star general
ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday promoted Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‘strategic leadership and decisive role’ in defeating India in the conflict that started earlier this month following the Pahalgam inci­dent in India-occu­pied Kashmir.
“The Government of Pakistan has approved the promotion of General Syed Asim Munir (Nishan-e-Imtiaz, Military) to the rank of Field Marshal in recognition of his superior strategy and courageous lead­ership… (and) infli­cted a decisive defeat upon the enemy,” a statement read.
The elevation, first cleared by the federal cabinet and later communicated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to President Asif Ali Zardari, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Pakistan had a serving field marshal in 1959, when Ayub Khan, the-then military ruler, awarded himself the five-star title.
Shortly after the announcement, PM Sheh­baz posted on X, formerly Twitter, saying: “Under his command, our valiant armed forces staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity with unity, courage and the highest standards of military professionalism.”
 






Field Marshal Munir, who has been serving as the army chief since November 2022, accepted the elevation, saying, as per a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), that it was not a personal honour but a tribute to the entire armed forces and the people of Pakistan.
Second extension for air chief
The government also announced a second, open-ended extension in the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu.
His current extension, granted last year, expires in March. He becomes the first PAF chief to receive two extensions, a move that underscores the central role he played in the successful execution of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos from May 7 to 10. “The government has also unanimously decided to extend the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu upon the completion of his current term,” a statement by the PM’s Office said.
Implications for military hierarchy
Field Marshal Munir’s promotion has set off widespread speculation about its implications for Pakistan’s higher defence organisation (HDO), comprising the joint chiefs of staff committee (JCSC), headed by its chairman, and the three service chiefs (army, navy, air force).
While the five-star title is largely ceremonial, questions have also been raised about its impact on the civil-military balance, the operational command chain, and the defence leadership’s future.
 
 

In a symbolic gesture, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza issued a congratulatory message, which analysts viewed as signalling that he would continue in his current role, despite now being technically junior to a five-star service chief.
Among retired military officials and analysts, opinions are divided. Retired Lt Gen Naeem Khalid Lodhi, a former defence secretary and caretaker national security adviser, anticipated the creation of a long-proposed chief of defence staff (CDS) role, a concept first floated during Nawaz Sharif’s previous tenure. Under this structure, COAS Munir could serve both as COAS and CDS, further consolidating his authority, he believed.
Conversely, retired Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, also a former defence secretary, downplayed the prospects of any structural change. “The field marshal rank is ceremonial,” he said, adding that the COAS remained the most powerful operational position within the military hierarchy. “CDS is a coordinating role, not a command authority,” Mr Yasin noted, suggesting the existing setup would remain intact.
Both, however, foresee the creation of a position of the vice chief of army staff for a four-star general.
Legal and constitutional ambiguities
The promotion has also revived debates over the legal foundations of the field marshal rank in Pakistan, with some experts noting the silence of the Constitution and the Pakistan Army Act on such an appointment.
Article 243 grants the president the authority to appoint service chiefs on the advice of the prime minister, but it does not mention five-star ranks. The 2024 amendment to the Army Act extended the COAS’s tenure to five years and removed retirement age limits for four-star generals.
A Ministry of Defence notification, however, said that the promotion had been made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (Rules) 1998. The rules are classified, but according to a military source, the mentioned rule reads: “199-A. Promotion to field marshal. A general officer, whether serving or retired, may be promoted to the rank of field marshal by the federal government without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.”
Military law expert retired colonel Inamur Raheem, when contacted for verification of the secretive rules, confirmed the wording of Rule 199A.
A strategic signal
While the rank does not grant additional operational authority, its conferral during a period of heightened regional tension carries strategic and political symbolism. It may also bolster Field Marshal Munir’s standing both within the military and in political circles, particularly amid ongoing internal instability and civil-military friction.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, who previously headed the Senate defence committee, noted that “Field Marshal Asim Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure, more so, given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians. Even before May, which has become an inflection point for Pakistan, for India and for South Asia, all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.”
Columnist and political analyst Abbas Nasir, while commenting on the political angle of the promotion, said, “As far as its domestic impact is concerned, by jumping the gun without evidence after the Pahalgam terror attack, the Modi government gifted Pakistan a considerable amount of unity as the country rallied behind the armed forces, setting aside internal political differences, disappointments.”
“Let’s see if national reconciliation is possible as a result of this Godsend or whether the country will revert to square one,” he worried.
Mr Nasir, while commenting on the move, said, “One only hopes that the world governments and media, which appeared to hyphenate Pakistan and India after years of lining up behind India and ap­p­eared to buy Islam­abad’s view largely, do not consider this a non-serious, or worse still belligerent, move.”
Global context
Pakistan’s only precedent for this move is Ayub Khan, whose 1959 elevation to the field marshal rank occurred amid his presidency and did not restructure the armed forces. Likewise, COAS Munir’s promotion is not expected to alter operational command but serves as a symbolic acknowledgement of his wartime leadership.
The global precedent supports this view. In India, Field Marshals Sam Manekshaw (1973) and K.M. Cariappa (1986) were promoted purely for ceremonial reasons, with no changes to the army’s structure. Similarly, in the United Kingdom and the United States, five-star titles have historically honoured extraordinary service during major wars without altering command frameworks.

Wajid­ullah Nagri

GILGIT: Two Pakistani climbers have successfully summited Mount Everest — the world’s highest peak — and Kan­ch­enjunga, the world’s third-highest peak at 8,586 metres, located in Nepal.
According to Karrar Haidri, secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, Wajid­ullah Nagri from Gilgit-Baltistan reached the summit of Mount Everest on Monday. He stood at the highest point on Earth with the support of renowned mountaineer Ang Tashi Sherpa.
“This remarkable achievement is a testament to courage, endurance and the unbreakable human spirit,” Mr Haidri said and congratulated Mr Nagri on his accomplishment.
“It’s a proud moment for Pakistan and an inspiration to climbers everywhere.”
Mr Nagri, who hails from Nagar district, was part of a Pioneer Adventure expedition. He has previously summited K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gasher-brum-I and Gasherbrum-II.
Meanwhile, Dr Shehla Sheikh, a US- based Pakistani mountaineer, successfully summited Mou­nt Kanchenjunga on Sunday.
 

DR Shehla Sheikh

The peak, known for its technical difficulty and harsh weather, is among the most challenging of the world’s 8,000-metre mountains.
Speaking to Dawn, Dr Sheikh confirmed that she had safely descended and claimed to be the first Pakistani woman to climb Kanchenjunga.  She said she regularly visits Pakistan for adventure tourism.
“I first completed the K2 base camp trek in 2022. After that, I climbed Spantik and other peaks,” she said.
In a statement, Mr Haidri said: “We are thrilled to announce that Dr Shehla Sheikh, a US-based Pakistani mountaineer, has successfully summited Mount Kanchenjunga — the third highest mountain in the world, standing tall at 8,586 meters (28,169 feet) above sea level on Sunday.”
Mr Haidri noted that Dr Sheikh’s achievement reflects the growing presence of Pakistani climbers — especially women — on the global stage.  “As a physician and adventurer, Dr Sheikh continues to inspire with her commitment to science and exploration,” he added.

A high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday was briefed on the digital monitoring system, which will be installed at major highways across the country.
An official announcement said FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial briefed the meeting on the project. He said the system freight vehicles will be fitted with e-tags and digital devices for the monitoring of goods.
The system will enable the digitisation of the economy and significantly increase tax revenue. It will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, it will be launched in one city and later implemented across the country.

Production in tobacco, steel, cement industries being monitored

The meeting was informed that a system is being introduced for digital and automated monitoring of imports and exports at ports and airports.
This system will be linked to local and international databases and tax evasion and smuggling will be prevented by using artificial intelligence.
The meeting was also informed that FBR officials and other institutions have been deployed to monitor the production of tobacco, beverages, steel and cement, similar to the monitoring system implemented in the sugar industry. The meeting was briefed about the monitoring of sales tax in cement, hatcheries, poultry feed, tobacco and beverages.
The PM directed the officials to accelerate the implementation of tax reform measures. He said taxpaying individuals and businesses will be facilitated, but no concession will be given to tax evaders, who will face strict legal action.
The FBR has missed its collection target by nearly Rs831 billion in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, mainly due to a decline in import volume and lower-than-expected inflation, which hit sales tax collections. The tax body collected Rs9.3 trillion in July-April FY25 against the budgetary target of Rs10.13tr.

Over three million Afghans have returned from neighbouring countries, around one-third from Pakistan, since September 2023, according to the International Organisation for Migration.
These Afghans were either deported or left out of fear of arrest after the Pakistan government announced a plan to repatriate all illegal foreigners.
In 2025 alone, 780,000 Afghans are estimated to have returned, including 351,600 who were deported, according to the information released by UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Tuesday.

UN body says support to returning refugees drastically reduced

They return to a homeland that is “clearly unprepared to receive them”, with a UNDP report saying that three-quarters of the population in Afghanistan was barely surviving, with half the population in need of humanitarian assistance.
Many of the returning Afghans are preparing to leave the country again for Iran, Turkiye and Europe, the UN body added.
Arafat Jamal, the UNHCR representative in Afghanistan, said the organisation requires $216m to fund its response in Afghanistan this year, but has so far received just 25 per cent of that amount.
The “deeply troubling financial situation” was crippling the UNHCR ability to help the Afghans.
With funding reductions, the UNHCR has been forced to offer only the most basic humanitarian assistance. “It can help someone survive, but not effectively rebuild.”
The budget cuts are also inhibiting the UNHCR’s initiative to support those who help Afghan women and girls at risk.
 
 

The funds provided by the UNHCR “helped these courageous actors to protect and safeguard valuable female-oriented projects”. Cutting the assistance for these initiatives would mean “abandoning these people who stand against draconian conditions”.
Global support
The UNHCR said the international community has invested heavily in Afghanistan over the decades and called for continued support for stability and economic growth.
“We call upon neighbouring countries to pursue solutions, treat Afghans with dignity, and work regionally to foster safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable returns.”
The UN body urged the international community to “not abandon its investments, to stay the course, and to provide political and financial support” for dispersed Afghans to “return and build their futures”.
The UNHCR said that it has been a “dependable partner and supporter of the Afghan people” for around 40 years.
“We have supported the governments that have hosted them and we are with them now as many make the journey back.”

• Sanaullah Baloch argues ongoing insurgency in Balochistan rooted in unjust distribution of resources
ISLAMABAD: Dr Shezra Mansab Ali Khan Kharal, the minister of state for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, on Tuesday announced the country’s first climate-focused budget for the fiscal year 2025–26 under which 30 per cent of all public development projects would undergo a Climate Public Investment Management Assessment (CPIMA).
“It is a significant shift towards integrating climate considerations into national economic planning,” the minister said.
The announcement was made during the Pre-Budget Dialogue 2025, titled “Rethinking Economic Policy for a Just Energy Transition,” organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in collaboration with the Policy Research Institute for Equitable Development (PRIED). The event brought together key policymakers, economists, parliamentarians, and energy experts to discuss aligning fiscal strategies with climate resilience and sustainability goals.
Dr Kharal highlighted the multifaceted challenges Pakistan faces, including increased vulnerability to climatic risks affecting agriculture, India’s suspension of the Indus Water Treaty exacerbating water scarcity, and the constraints imposed by the IMF’s austerity programme limiting development expenditures. She noted that the energy sector’s inefficiencies and circular debt continue to strain the national budget, necessitating a transition to sustainable energy solutions.
Malik Amin Aslam, former special assistant to the prime minister on climate change, highlighted that Pakistan cannot circumvent the impacts of climate change, which could force the country to spend 9pc of its GDP on resilience efforts. He advocated for the implementation of carbon taxes to ensure that revenues collected are invested in climate resilience initiatives.
MNA Arshad Abdullah Vohra of MQM-P emphasised that climate change and energy transition are two distinct subjects. He highlighted that energy and power are federal subjects, while climate change has become a provincial responsibility following the 18th Constitutional Amendment. Addre­ssing urban resilience, he revealed that four million people in Karachi live in non-resilient housing, including 1 million registered slum dwellers.
Sanaullah Baloch, former senator and current member of the Balochistan Assembly, delivered a presentation on “Balochistan, Energy Justice, and Economic Development”. He argued that the ongoing insurgency and conflict in Balochistan are rooted in the unjust distribution of its resources.
He recalled that Pakistan was among only five countries in the world that discovered natural gas in 1955, and Balochistan’s gas contributed to $200 billion in value. He asserted that the industrial revolution across Pakistan was driven by Balochistan’s gas, likening energy to the bloodstream of a nation. He lamented the lack of energy access in Balochistan, which hampers development, with only 20pc grid access compared to Punjab’s 95pc, Sindh’s 85pc, and KP’s 80pc.
Barrister Danyal Chaudhary, Parliamentary Secretary for Information and Broadcasting described nursing crops under a scorching sun, students in Balochistan studying by candlelight, and mothers in Punjab praying for affordable electricity as vivid examples of how energy issues translate into dignity and survival.
Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, the executive director of SDPI, emphasised the economic imperatives driving the energy transition. He pointed out that rising fuel prices and the liberalisation of the second-hand automobile market could accelerate the adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles, thereby promoting energy efficiency and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
Shahid Hafeez Kardar, former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, stressed the need for economic policies that prioritise long-term sustainability over short-term stabilisation. He advocated for shifting from reactive subsidies to proactive investments.
Khalid Mansoor, senior fellow at the Pakistan Regional Economic Forum and former special assistant to the prime minister on CPEC affairs, highlighted the transformational phase of CPEC, focusing on energy transition, smart agriculture, value-added textiles, and digital transformation.
Dr. Sajid Amin Javed, deputy executive director of SDPI, pointed out that Pakistan’s economic policy has been primarily focused on stabilisation, often neglecting sustainability goals. He advocated for the imposition of carbon taxation and petroleum levies to achieve revenue targets while promoting green energy transition as a solution to macroeconomic problems.
Shah Jahan Mirza, managing director of the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB), noted that Pakistan has already achieved 47pc clean energy generation in its current energy mix, calling for encouraging local development of solar energy panels and equipment.
Dr Khaqqan Najeeb, senior economist, emphasised that energy issues in Pakistan are rooted in governance and management challenges rather than just energy costs or inefficiencies. He called for a unified and authoritative energy regulator.
Afia Malik, an economist, cautioned that petroleum levies directly impact the poor, suggesting that carbon taxes on emitting energy sources would transfer the burden to final consumers, including the middle class. Shiraz Shah, head of resilience, environment, and climate change at UNDP, underscored that energy transition is a governance issue requiring a multi-sectoral approach.

• Economy size swells to $411bn, agriculture grows just 0.56pc and LSM contracts 1.5pc
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income increased in dollar terms at a modest pace in 2024-25, reflecting a sustained recovery in the country’s overall output compared to the previous year, the government said on Tuesday.
It was announced on Tuesday that the country’s economy is expected to grow by 2.68 per cent in the current fiscal year, a revision from earlier projections of 3.6pc, suggesting that Pakistan will fall short of its GDP target.
The leading global financial institutions’ estimates also show that Pakistan’s economy is expected to grow between 2.6 and 2.8pc in FY25, a slower-than-expected recovery with challenges in agriculture, industrial output, and external financing weighing on economic momentum. The lenders have already revised downward their earlier GDP projections for Pakistan.
The IMF revised the growth forecast to 2.6pc, citing weaker economic performance. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimate a slightly higher growth rate of 2.8pc, reflecting cautious optimism.
The 113th National Accounts Committee (NAC) meeting, chaired by Planning Commission Secretary Awais Manzur Sumra, approved revised GDP growth rates for Q1, Q2, and Q3 of FY25, along with final figures for FY23 and revised estimates for FY24. The provisional GDP growth for FY25 stands at 2.68pc compared to 2.51pc in FY24, a marginal increase.
The size of the economy went up to $410.96 billion in FY25 from $371.66bn in FY24, mainly driven by growth in the services sector, followed by industry and livestock. Higher public and private sector investments, stable exchange rates, moderating inflation, and rising per capita income supported growth.
The per capita income slightly increased to $1,824 in FY25 from $1,680 in FY24. However, it was $1,551 in FY23, $1,766 in FY22 and $1,677 in FY21. This suggests the deterioration of the standard of living and well-being of almost all segments of society with no tangible increase in personal incomes.
It may lead to decreased disposable income, limiting individuals’ ability to afford goods and services, save, or invest.
Agriculture sector
The agriculture sector will post a modest growth of 0.56pc in FY25. This indicates that the agriculture sector faced setbacks, with important crops contracting by 13.49pc in FY25 compared to a healthy increase in important crops last year.
Important crops dipped due to a decline of 8.91pc in wheat production this year. The provincial crop reporting services estimated that wheat production may fall to 28.98 million tonnes from 31.81m tonnes last year. Maize production fell 15.4pc to 8.24m tonnes from 9.74m tonnes last year, rice production fell 1.38pc to 9.72m tonnes, from 9.86m tonnes, sugarcane by 3.88pc to 84.24m tonnes from 87.64m tonnes and a 30.7pc in cotton production to 7.08m bales from 10.22m bales last year.
Despite a 16.6pc reduction in the production of grams, other crops posted a provisional growth of 4.78pc. The production of potatoes saw an increase of 11.5pc to 9.40m tonnes from 8.43m tonnes, onion by 15.9pc from 2.30 to 2.67m tonnes, mango by 26.7pc from 2.09 to 2.65m tonnes and sesame by 44.7pc from 0.30 to 0.44m tonnes. While cotton ginning and miscellaneous components declined by 19.03pc, livestock, fores­t­­ry and fishing posted provisional growth rates of 4.72pc, 3.03pc and 1.42pc.
Industrial sector
The industry provisionally demonstrated a growth of 4.77pc in 2024-25. Despite a 2.84pc rise in coal production, the mining and quarrying sector experienced a contraction of 3.38pc. This decline is attributed to lower production of natural gas, which fell by 7.05pc, crude oil, down by 14.72pc, and other minerals.
 
 

The Large-Scale Manufacturing, as indicated by the Quantum Index of Manufacturing (QIM) for the first nine months of FY25, experienced a decline of 1.53pc, reflecting a mixed trend in the production across different groups. The electricity, gas and water supply sector witnessed a notable growth of 28.88pc, primarily attributed to the low-base effect from FY24. The construction sector recorded a rise of 6.61pc, which was attributed to heightened expenditures on construction-related activities by both the private sector and the general government.
Services industry
The services sector also grew 2.91pc in 2024-25, bolstered by favourable contributions from all its components. The wholesale and retail trade sector experienced a slight increase of 0.14pc, which was attributed to a deceleration in output growth within the agriculture and manufacturing industries.
The transport and storage sector has seen a rise of 2.20pc, which is attributed to the growth in output across water, air, and road transport. The information and communication sector grew 6.48pc driven by a notable increase of 24pc in the output of computer programming and consultancy activities.

• UN relief agency says ‘everything is empty’ in Gaza
• Israeli ground operation threat to peace efforts, Pakistan says
LONDON: Britain paused free trade talks with Israel on Tuesday, summoned its ambassador, and announced further sanctions against Jewish settlers in occupied West Bank after Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was horrified by the military escalation in Gaza.
After the Israeli military’s new operation last week, Prime Minister Netanyahu said Israel would take control of the whole of Gaza.
Israel has blocked the entry of medical, food and fuel supplies into Gaza since the start of March and international experts have warned of looming famine.
British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the offensive was not the way to bring remaining prisoners home, called upon Israel to end the blockade of aid and condemned “extremism” in some sections of Israel’s government.
“We cannot stand by in the face of this new deterioration. It is incompatible with the principles that underpin our bilateral relationship,” David Lammy told lawmakers.
“Frankly, it’s an affront to the values of the British people. Therefore, today, I’m announcing that we have suspended negotiations with this Israeli government on a new free trade agreement.
“We are demonstrating again that we will continue to act against those who are carrying out heinous abuses of human rights,” Lammy said.
France, Canada, UK horrified
Britain, in a joint statement with France and Canada, condemned the expansion of Israel’s military operations in Gaza and called for restrictions on aid to be lifted.
The trio said they would take “further concrete action” should Israel’s fresh offensive not cease.
“I want to put on record today that we’re horrified by the escalation from Israel,” Starmer told parliament earlier on Tuesday.
“We repeat our demand for a ceasefire as the only way to free the hostages (Israeli prisoners), we repeat our opposition to settlements in the West Bank, and we repeat our demand to massively scale up humanitarian assistance into Gaza.”
French Foreign Minister Barrot told French radio there was a growing call from some countries to review a long-standing association agreement with Israel.
50 killed in Israeli strikes
Israeli air strikes killed about 50 Palestinians in Gaza on Tuesday, local medics said, as Israel continued its bombardment despite mounting international pressure to stop military operations.
The strikes fell across Gaza, and medics in the territory said that among the sites hit were two homes where women and children were among the 18 dead, and a school housing displaced families.
‘Everything is empty’
The conflict has strained Israel’s relations with much of the international community and those with its closest ally, the US, now appear to be wavering.
After Israel imposed a blockade of food and other supplies, Gaza has also been facing a critical risk of famine.
On Monday, Israel allowed nine trucks into Gaza. The UN has long said Gaza needs at least 500 trucks of aid and commercial goods every day. Throughout the conflict, trucks with aid have waited weeks and months the border to enter Gaza.
Louise Wateridge, a spokesperson for the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, said there was little food left. “Everything’s empty. The warehouses, the distribution centres, they’ve been empty for weeks,” she said.
Meanwhile, Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of staff of Israel’s military, said in a radio interview that Israel risked becoming a ‘pariah state’.
“A sane country does not engage in combat against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not pursue goals of population expulsion,” he said.
FO slams Israeli threat
Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the expansion of Israeli ground operations in Gaza, as well as its plan to “take control of all” of the territory, posed a grave threat to efforts aimed at achieving regional peace.
FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan condemned the Israeli aggression in Gaza, deliberate targeting of hospitals and mass evacuation orders. “In addition, Israel also continues to deliberately obstruct critical humanitarian aid from reaching millions in dire need, which amounts to the imposition of collective punishment on the besieged Palestinian people,” he said.
“Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and calls for the establishment of an independent, viable and contiguous Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders,” the FO added.

In a late-night determination sent to the federal government, Ogra worked out the average revenue requirement for Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) at Rs354bn for the next fiscal year and determined its prescribed price at Rs1,659 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) or about Rs104 per unit reduction from Rs1,762 per mmBtu in FY25.
Conversely, the regulator worked out the revenue requirement for Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) at Rs535bn for FY26 and set its prescribed price at Rs1,895 per mmBTU, about Rs117 per unit higher than the current year’s Rs1,778 per unit to cover an estimated revenue shortfall of Rs43bn next year.
The average consumer gas prices currently stand at Rs1,770 per unit, which means the government would have to increase consumer gas rates by Rs125 per unit or about 7pc to Rs1,895 with effect from July 1.
Under the practice in vogue, the government has to adopt higher per unit cost of the gas company for uniform consumer-end tariff i.e. in this case Rs1895 per unit for SNGPL. The difference between the applicable consumer rate and lower determined prescribed price of the other gas company then becomes the gas development surcharge – a source of revenue for provincial governments based on their quantum of gas production.
Ogra stated that SSGCL and SNGPL determinations have been sent to the federal government for category-wise natural gas sale price advice as required under Section 8(3) of the Ogra Ordinance. The government has the right to change the consumer rates recommended by Ogra in a manner that it did not affect the revenue requirements worked out by the regulator.

The police attempted to disperse the protesters in the city of Moro to restore traffic on the motorway by-pass road but faced resistance. Consequently, the police resorted to a baton charge and gunshots were also fired.
Peoples Medical Hospital Medical Superintendent Haider Jamali told Dawn.com that one protester was killed and brought to the hospital, while three others and two pedestrians were injured. DSP Ghulam Hussain Dahiri was also injured after being beaten with sticks.
The protesters allegedly turned violent and set two trailers on fire after news of the death reached the site of the protest.
They also barged into the house of Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, ransacked it and set some portions of it on fire, while some motorcycles were also torched.
Traffic remained suspended on the road leading to Moro.
A police statement said Benazirabad Deputy Inspector General of Police Pervez Chandio and Naushahro Feroze Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Sanghaar Malik rushed to the spot while personnel from different stations were also called to bring the situation under control.
PPP Sindh Information Secretary Ajiz Dhamra condemned the incident, terming it a terrorist activity in a statement.
He said that there was no ban on protests by people, but attacking the house of a political opponent was reflective of some conspiracy.
The Sindh home minister also released a statement and asked the Naushahro Feroze SSP to submit a detailed incident report.
He said nobody would be allowed to challenge the writ of state, adding that police should take action against those who disrupt peace.
Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz inaugurated the ambitious Cholistan project to irrigate south Punjab’s lands on February 15 amid public uproar and strong reservations in Sindh. The Sindh Assembly also passed a unanimous resolution against the project in March.
The past few months have seen nationwide protests from political parties, including the ruling coalition ally PPP, and residents against the proposed project.
In response, amid tensions from India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty after the Pahalgam attack, the government last month announced that it was halting the contentious project until a consensus on the issue was reached in the Council of Common Interests.
However, the legal fraternity decided to continue their sit-ins across Sindh till they receive a “clear” notification regarding the permanent cancellation of the plan.</p><small>2025-05-20 19:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/20223338f8291b3.jpg?r=223558' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912198/sindh-wildlife-department-opposes-proposed-relocation-of-illegally-imported-exotic-monkeys-to-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh Wildlife Department opposes proposed relocation of illegally imported exotic monkeys to Lahore</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Wildlife Department (SWD) has formally opposed the proposed relocation of illegally imported exotic monkeys from Karachi to Lahore, calling on the federal government to withdraw its May 8 recommendations and instead follow legal procedures and scientific guidelines.
According to sources, the customs staff had confiscated 26 monkeys — tufted capuchins and marmosets — in January at Karachi airport, being imported by M/s Khayal Enterprises on an alleged fake no-objection certificate (NOC) from South Africa.
In March, the illegal consignment of monkeys, two of which died at the airport while in the custody of customs officials, was handed over to the animal rights organisation Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation (ACF) for want of coordination among government departments.
Per a statement issued by the SWD today, “The department formally opposed the proposed relocation of illegally imported exotic monkeys, urging the government to reconsider the recommendation issued and to instead adhere to due legal process and scientific standards.”
The statement said that in a high-level virtual meeting in April, a technical committee was constituted by the federal secretary of the Ministry of Climate Change to assess the situation and propose recommendations grounded in legality, science, and animal welfare.
The joint report, submitted by the SWD and WWF-Pakistan (Karachi), concluded that relocating the animals to Lahore would “not only be harmful to their health and welfare but would also defy sound scientific reasoning and established legal frameworks,” the statement said.
However, MoCC recommended the transfer to Lahore without consulting the notified committee or reviewing its findings at the agreed forum, it said.
The statement said the SWD expressed serious concerns over the decision, noting that no intimation of the recommendation was provided to the trial court.
“The department emphasised that all wildlife located in Sindh, regardless of origin, enjoys full legal protection under Section 21 of the Sindh Wildlife Protection Act 2020,” the statement said.
“On scientific grounds, the department strongly opposed the transfer of these highly sensitive tropical primates to a facility that lacks adequate species-specific care.”
“The report highlighted that the Lahore-based facility recommended by the federal ministry has previously documented failures in primate care, including inadequate hygiene, poor animal husbandry, limited behavioural enrichment, and a record of animal stress and mortality,” it said, adding that any further relocation would impose another traumatic episode upon the primates and could result in additional fatalities.
“Moreover, there remains an unresolved public health concern as the monkeys were imported through illegal channels and may carry undiagnosed zoonotic pathogens, making their further movement without comprehensive screening a biosecurity risk,” it said.
A study in 2018, compiled through undercover surveys of 55 markets in 23 cities across Pakistan, revealed that a majority of species/animal derivatives on sale at these markets were listed within the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red List of threatened species.
The study found that Karachi hosted the highest number of markets and shops dealing in illegal wildlife, followed by Peshawar. The consumption of the dried meat of the Indian cobra and sand lizard was recorded to be widespread in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.</p><small>2025-05-20 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/20203827291465c.jpg?r=203908' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912194/4-suspects-involved-in-allegedly-raping-mentally-challenged-minor-in-lahore-arrested-police' target='_blank'><strong>4 suspects involved in allegedly raping mentally-challenged minor in Lahore arrested: police</strong></a><br><p>The police on Tuesday said they had arrested four suspects involved in an alleged gang rape of a mentally-challenged minor in Lahore earlier this month.
According to a first information report registered today, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the victim, aged 14, was taken to a washroom of a mosque on May 9 where the four suspects allegedly raped her.
“They threatened the mentally challenged girl, telling her that if she told anyone about the incident, they would kill her,” the FIR said, adding that the suspects later dropped the girl outside her house.
According to the complainant, the girl was upset and scared since the incident, eventually narrating the events to her parents a day ago.
In a post on social media, the Punjab Police said that action was taken on the complaint, and all four suspects were taken into police custody.
Separately, the Prosecutor General of Punjab, Syed Farhad Ali Shah, took notice of the incident and summoned the investigating officer on May 22 along with the record.
The provincial prosecutor general declared the case a “high-profile one”, stating that strict legal action will be taken against the suspects.
“A special prosecution team will be deployed to follow up the case,” Shah said.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
Earlier this month, Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Sahil’s data revealed that a total of 3,364 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country in the year 2024.
In the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported.48 cases of pornography after sexual abuse were also recorded.
Last month, Punjab police arrested five suspects for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of a child in Muzaffargarh.
In March, two suspects were arrested in connection with an alleged gang rape on the Faisalabad motorway. In a separate case that month, Punjab police also arrested three suspects for allegedly gang-raping a woman in Lahore.</p><small>2025-05-20 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/20181857456f277.jpg?r=182215' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty' target='_blank'><strong>China says it backs Pakistan in defending ‘sovereignty’</strong></a><br><p>China said on Tuesday it supports Pakistan in defending “national sovereignty and territorial integrity”, after a ceasefire ended four days of fighting with India over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said China welcomed the two countries “handling differences through dialogue” as he met Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar in Beijing.
Wang called Pakistan an “ironclad friend” and vowed to deepen the “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership” between the two countries, a readout from China’s foreign ministry said.
Likewise, Dar appreciated China for firmly supporting Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The Foreign Office said Dar met his Chinese counterpart for in-depth discussions during his visit to discuss regional stability.
“Both sides exchanged views on evolving situation in South Asia, future trajectory of Pakistan-China friendship and CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) 2.0.
“Hailing all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and ironclad friendship between Pakistan and China, both leaders expressed satisfaction at the commonality of views on all issues of mutual interest and expressed their firm resolve to continue bilateral cooperation for regional peace, development and stability,” the FO said.
 






Earlier, Dar met Minister of International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Liu Jianchao.
The FO said both leaders agreed to deepen linkages between the political parties of Pakistan and the CPC. Liu reiterated that as “all-weather strategic cooperative partner” and “ironclad friend”, China would continue to prioritise its relations with Pakistan.
 






Dar arrived in Beijing yesterday on a three-day official visit on the invitation of his Chinese counterpart amid regional tensions, state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.
The visit comes as tensions remain high in the region following the ceasefire between Pakistan and India after a tense military standoff over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan without evidence.
On May 6–7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down five Indian jets. After drone interceptions and airbase strikes, US intervention on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Pakistan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue.
Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is also expected to be in Beijing and participate in the talks to disc­uss regional peace and security.
Prior to his departure, Dar told the media that China was a major trading partner of Pakistan and that both countries enjoyed an iron-clad close relationship, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Dar said that his meetings with the Chinese leadership would mark discussions on political, local, regional and global issues, besides the recent tensions between Pakistan and India.</p><small>2025-05-20 14:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/20191451f37d339.jpg?r=205016' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912155/sc-upholds-zahir-jaffers-death-sentence-in-noor-mukadam-murder-case' target='_blank'><strong>SC upholds Zahir Jaffer’s death sentence in Noor Mukadam murder case</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer for the gruesome murder of Noor Mukadam nearly four years ago that had shaken the nation.

A three-member bench, led by Justice Hashim Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi, presided today over the third hearing of Zahir’s appeal against his death sentence.
The bench upheld Zahir’s death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
However, it converted the IHC’s decision of a second death penalty over rape charges into a life sentence . The high court had turned Zahir’s 25 years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 376 of the PPC into a death sentence.
The 10-year jail term for kidnapping in order to murder under Section 364 of the PPC was reduced to one year. The trial court had also imposed a fine of Rs100,000 in February 2022.
The apex court maintained the earlier orders to Zahir to pay Rs0.5 million to Noor’s legal heir.
The appeals of two co-accused — watchman Mohammad Iftikhar and gardener Jan Mohammad — against their 10-year sentences were also taken up by the SC.
The watchman and gardener’s sentences were reduced, with the bench deciding their detention so far was sufficient.
“Therefore, by virtue of that, both will be released,” said Advocate Shah Khawar, the lawyer for Noor’s father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam.

Zahir’s counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, concluded his arguments today, while Khawar also presented his.
A short order on today’s hearing is yet to be issued. It is expected to detail the court’s decision on an appeal by Shaukat against the acquittal of Zahir’s father, Zakir Jaffer.
During the course of the trial, judges made demeaning comments about Noor for spending time alone with Jaffer, with Justice Kakar on Tuesday adding that it was “against our values”, according to AFP.
Farzana Bari, a women’s rights activist who attended the hearing, said the comments imply “that the man has some legitimate right to detain her, which is a harmful and regressive notion”.
“Such judicial attitudes contribute to a long and exhausting struggle for justice, often leading victims to lose hope and give up along the way,” she told the outlet.
Meanwhile, Shafaq Zaidi, a childhood friend of Noor, told AFP outside the court: “This is a victory for all the women of Pakistan. It shows that our justice system can deliver justice and should give women more confidence in the legal process
“This was our last resort, and it’s hard to put into words what this outcome means to us.”
Human rights defender, Tahira Abdullah, in a statement, said: “It is a milestone achievement in Pakistani women’s ongoing struggle for justice — and also against entrenched patriarchy, sexism and misogyny, openly expressed in court by the defence legal team today as well.”
During the previous hearing, the accused’s lawyer contended that no medical board was formed to assess his client’s mental state. Justice Kakar had observed, “A daughter was mercilessly murdered.”
In October last year, Noor’s father had urged the SC to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.
The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Zahir’s counsel contended that any evidence against his client “must be beyond doubt”, arguing that the court could not “go beyond the footage presented in the court”.
He said the prosecution presented the footage on a USB at the IHC, but it could not be played.
At this point, a lawyer for the two co-accused presented his arguments briefly. He detailed their sentences, recalling that the watchman and gardener were accused of “stopping the victim from fleeing”.
Justice Najafi observed, “If the suspects had not stopped the victim, then the situation would have been different.”
 
 

The lawyer asserted that the two co-accused had “no crime other than being present in the house” at the time of the murder.
“What was the need to work more than [what] the salary [is paid for]?” Justice Kakar remarked.
When the hearing resumed in the afternoon after a break, the counsel of Noor’s father presented his stance.
In his arguments, Khawar asserted that all evidence against the accused was part of the case record. “Noor Mukadam was kept in abduction for 40 hours.”
To this, Justice Kakar inquired, “How can you prove it was an abduction? It could be termed unjust confinement.”
Upon Justice Ibrahim asking the counsel to detail the DNA reports, Khawar said the assessments proved the charges. “Blood samples were taken, and the report of the dagger also came positive,” he said.
Shaukat’s lawyer then opposed Zahir’s appeal and concluded his arguments.
 
 

Here, the state lawyer came to the rostrum and said, “There should be no forgiveness for this heinous crime. This case should be made exemplary.
“The state views this crime very seriously. This is a very sad tragedy and the state wants such criminals to be punished as per law.”
Subsequently, the bench annoucned it decision, dismissing Zahir’s appeal and reducing the sentences of his two household staff to what they have served so far.
Case history
Noor was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. An FIR was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested at the site of the murder.
In February 2022, a district and sessions judge sentenced Jaffer to death for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, had been indicted by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later acquitted by the court.
Six officials of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents. According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.
 
 

In March 2023, the IHC, dismissing Zahir’s appeal, not only upheld the death sentence but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction.
The next month, Zahir approached the SC against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and that the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR.
Brutal murder
After an FIR was registered in the case and Zahir was arrested, his parents and household staff were also taken into custody by police on July 24, 2021, over allegations of “hiding evidence and being complicit in the crime”. They were made a part of the investigation based on the statement of Noor’s father but were later acquitted.
In his complaint, Shaukat had stated that he had gone to Rawalpindi on July 19 to buy a goat for Eidul Azha, while his wife had gone out to pick up clothes from her tailor. When he had returned home in the evening, the couple found their daughter Noor absent from their house in Islamabad.
They had found her cellphone number switched off and started a search for her. Sometime later, Noor had called her parents to inform them that she was travelling to Lahore with some friends and would return in a day or two, according to the FIR.
 
 

The complainant said he had later received a call from Zahir, whose family were their acquaintances. Zahir had informed Shaukat that Noor was not with him, the FIR said.
At around 10pm on July 20, the victim’s father had received a call from Kohsar police station, informing him that Noor had been murdered.
Police had subsequently taken the complainant to Zahir’s house in Sector F-7/4 where he discovered that his “daughter has been brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”, according to the FIR.
Shaukat, who identified his daughter’s body, had sought the maximum punishment under the law against Zahir for allegedly murdering his daughter.
Police later said that Zahir had confessed to killing Noor, while his DNA test and fingerprints also showed his involvement in the murder.
