JERUSALEM: As Israeli authorities barred the imam of Al Aqsa Mosque from entering the compound, 93 states — including the eight-nation Muslim bloc — slammed Tel Aviv’s move to designate lands in the occupied West Bank as so-called “state land”.
Last week, the Israeli cabinet approved measures that would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory.
Israeli NGOs have also raised alarm over the government’s settlement plan, which they say would mark the first expansion of Jerusalem’s borders into the occupied West Bank since 1967.
According to a statement, issued by the Palestinian mission to the United Nations, 85 nations as well as the European Union (EU), Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and Arab League called for the immediate reversal of the Israeli annexation of the West Bank.
States who signed up to the latest statement include Algeria, Andorra, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chad, China, Colombia, Cuba, Cyprus, North Korea, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Liberia, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, South Korea, Russia, San Marino, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tajikistan, The Gambia, Turkiye, Uganda, UAE, Tanzania, UK, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Yemen and Zimbabwe.







An earlier statement from the foreign ministers of the eight-nation Muslim bloc also condemned Israel for approving procedures for the registration and settlement of land ownership across extensive areas of the occupied West Bank.
“This illegal step constitutes a grave escalation aimed at accelerating illegal settlement activity, land confiscation, entrenching Israeli control, and applying unlawful Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and undermining the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” said the statement.
“This step reflects an attempt to impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land, thereby undermining the two-state solution, eroding the prospects for the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian State, and jeopardising the attainment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region.”
Warning by NGOs
The planned development, announced by Israel’s Ministry of Construction and Housing, is formally a westward expansion of the Geva Binyamin, or Adam, settlement situated north-east of Jerusalem in the West Bank.
But the area to be developed lies on the Israeli side of the separation barrier built in the early 2000s, while Geva Binyamin sits on the West Bank side of the barrier, and the two are separated by a road. In a statement, Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now said there would be no “territorial or functional connection” between the area to be developed and the settlement.
“The new neighbourhood will be integral to the city of Jerusalem,” said Lior Amihai, Peace Now’s executive director.
“What is unique about that one is that it will be connected directly to Jerusalem, but it will be beyond the annexed municipal border. So it will be in complete West Bank territory, but just adjacent to Jerusalem,” he said.
Imam barred from Al Aqsa
Sheikh Muhammad Al-Abbasi, a senior imam of the Al Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem, said on Tuesday that Israeli authorities had barred him from entering the compound, just days before the start of the holy month of Ramazan.
“I have been barred from the mosque for a week, and the order can be renewed,” he said, adding that he was not informed of the reason for the ban.
On Monday, Israeli police said they had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.

Speaking at the session, industry specialists noted that while AI offers significant opportunities to improve governance and service delivery, its integration into the civil bureaucracy will not be immediate.
It was highlighted that digital contributions account for more than 50 percent of GDP in China, whereas the share remains very low in Pakistan, underscoring the need for adoption across all sectors.
The session was held for media professionals and digital activists at the head office of Huawei Pakistan, which also serves as a global back office for Huawei.

Strong local cloud presence essential as data sovereignty, AI sovereignty fast becoming matters of national security, says Huawei official

Experts argued that AI tools could help streamline public services, support evidence-based decision-making, and reduce delays in administrative processes.
Kashif Iqbal, a technical expert at Huawei, said Pakistan has a strong IT workforce, noting that Pakistanis form the second-largest group of employees at Huawei after Chinese nationals.
More than 20,000 students participate annually in global competitions organised by Huawei, and Pakistani participants have consistently secured positions among the top three, outperforming competitors from around the world.
Although basic infrastructure already exists in Pakistan, including in the public sector, the digitisation of data is essential for AI systems to function effectively.

 

“AI is the right direction for transforming the public sector, but it will take time for senior executives and government officials to fully understand and effectively use these technologies,” said Ahmed Bilal Masood, CEO of AI and Cloud Business at Huawei Pakistan.
He highlighted that Huawei is a key supplier of AI equipment used in establishing cloud services and ICT solutions in Pakistan.
“Data sovereignty and AI sovereignty are becoming matters of national security globally, which is why a strong local cloud presence is essential,” Mr Masood said, adding that despite the challenges, AI is a critical driver for reforming Pakistan’s public administration. Embracing artificial intelligence, he said, could help modernise outdated systems and improve public service delivery.
“AI is being adopted in all fields, from traffic management to enhancing the performance of hospitals and educational institutions.” However, he cautioned that successful implementation would depend on the enactment and enforcement of cyber laws, including data protection legislation, as technology alone cannot drive change.
Faisal Ameer Malik, Huawei’s Chief Technology Officer for the Middle East and Central Asia region, said the concept of AI was introduced in 1956, with a major breakthrough occurring in 2011 by Google. However, the concept gained widespread prominence during and after the Covid era.
He noted that between 2012 and 2022, AI was largely applied to small data models, but due to widespread digitalisation, current AI systems are based on large data models.
He added that around 170 countries have released national digital strategies, while 60 countries have elevated AI to the level of a national strategy. Pakistan has already approved its National AI Policy in 2025.

DEMONSTRATORS protest in front of New York’s Trump Tower.—Reuters

• Hillary accuses Trump of orchestrating ‘cover-up’• Los Angeles mayor calls for 2028 Olympics chief to resign• Hyatt boss steps down
SANTA FE: Lawmakers in the US state of New Mexico passed legislation on Monday to launch the “first full investigation” into what happened at Zorro Ranch, where the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is accused of trafficking and sexually assaulting girls and women.
A bipartisan committee will seek testimony from survivors of alleged sexual abuse at the ranch, located about 50 kilometres south of Santa Fe, the state capital. Legislators have urged local residents to testify.
Meanwhile, former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton accused President Trump of orchestrating a ‘cover-up’ over the Epstein files.
“Get the files out. They’re slow-walking it,” the former first lady said in an interview with the BBC.
In other developments, the mayor of Los Angeles called upon Casey Wasserman, the chief organiser of the 2028 Olympics committee, to resign after his name figured in the Epstein files.
Thomas Pritzker, the chairman of the Hyatt chain of hotels, said he had decided to leave his position after emails revealing his ties to Epstein came to light.
Truth commission
The “truth commission” named by New Mexico, comprising four lawmakers, seeks to identify ranch guests and state officials who may have known what was going on at the 7,600-acre property, or taken part in alleged sexual abuse in its hacienda-style mansion and guest houses.
The Democratic-led investigation adds to political pressure to uncover Epstein’s crimes that has become a major challenge for President Donald Trump, weeks after the Justice Department released millions of Epstein-related files that shed new light on activities at the ranch.
The files reveal ties between Epstein and two former Democratic governors and an attorney general of New Mexico.
The committee started its work on Tuesday, and will deliver interim findings in July.
“He was basically doing anything he wanted in this state without any accountability whatsoever,” said lawmaker Andrea Romero, a Democrat.Testimony to the committee could be used for future prosecutions, she said.
Victim advocates applauded the move, saying Zorro Ranch had been overlooked by federal investigations that focused on Epstein’s Caribbean island and New York townhouse.
“Many of the survivors had experiences in New Mexico, and as we’ve learned, you know, there were local politicians and other people that were aware of what was happening in New Mexico,” said attorney Sigrid McCawley, whose law firm has represented hundreds of Epstein survivors.
Hillary Clinton slams ‘cover-up’
“Get the files out. They are slow-walking it,” Clinton, who is due to testify before a Congressional committee on the issue next week, told the BBC in Berlin.
Former president Bill Clinton features regularly in the files, but no evidence has come to light implicating either of the two in criminal activity.
The couple has been ordered to give closed-door depositions before the House Oversight Committee, which is probing the deceased financier’s connections to powerful figures and how information about his crimes was handled.
“We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public,” Hillary Clinton told the BBC. “I just want it to be fair,” she said. “I want everybody treated the same way.”
Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has called on Casey Wasserman, whose name was also mentioned in the Epstein files, to step down as chief organiser of the 2028 Summer Olympics.
Bass told CNN it was “unfortunate” the Olympic organisers were supporting Wasserman after revelations he exchanged flirtatious emails with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. He said: “My opinion is that he should step down. That’s not the opinion of the board.” She said that “we need to look at the leadership” of LA28.
Hyatt CEO resigns
The executive chairman of the Hyatt hotel chain also stepped down after emails revealing his ties to Jeffrey Epstein came to light.
Businessman Thomas Pritzker maintained contact with Epstein well after the latter was convicted in 2008.

WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrives here on Wedne­sday (today) to attend the global summit of the Boa­rd of Peace (BoP) hosted by US President Donald Trump, stepping into a forum that seeks to go beyond Gaza in restoring global peace and stability.
The summit’s immediate focus is expected to be threefold: consolidating a ceasefire in Gaza, mobilising financial pledges for the BoP — with Washin­gton announcing an initial commitment of $5 billion — and finalising the contours of a proposed global forum that Trump hopes can achieve what the United Nations could not.
Participants are also likely to discuss the proposed International Stab­ilisation Force (ISF), tas­k­ed with securing reconstruction zones and supporting a post-conflict governance arrangement in Gaza.
For Pakistan, the question of contributing troops to the ISF has assumed particular importance after it reportedly figured in discussions between Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Diplomatic sources say several Muslim countries are open to participating in a stabilisation mechanism but are reluctant to accept any combat role that could place their forces in direct confrontation with Hamas. They are also seeking a clear political horizon for Palestinian statehood and opposing Israeli moves towards ann­e­x­ation in the West Bank.
The institutional design of the BoP — a compact, leader-driven body with an operational arm in the form of the ISF and a dedicated financing pool — reflects Washington’s preference for coalition-based mechanisms operating outside the slower multilateral framework of the United Nations. This has raised questions among diplomats and scholars about both effectiveness and legality.
Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the United States, Britain and the United Nations, was unequivocal in her assessment. “The jury is out on whether the Board of Peace can deliver peace. The absence of any Palestinian representation on the Board raises questions about its legitimacy,” she said. “If the principal party to the issue is excluded, how is this going to advance the peace process or carve out a post-conflict future for the people of Gaza.”
Dr Lodhi warned that externally imposed governance arrangements risk reproducing older power hierarchies. “Externally controlled governance arrangements make this a colonial-style project,” she observed, adding that “at least half of the countries invited to be members didn’t join the body as they had reservations about its role, legality and effectiveness as well as Trump’s pretension of turning this into a parallel body to the UN Security Council”.
She also questioned Islamabad’s early decision to sign on. “Pakistan should not have joined the Board in such haste and should have waited to see what exactly it will do, especially given the widespread view that it can end up becoming an instrument for continuing Israeli occupation.”
For PM Shehbaz, the visit is not only about Pakistan’s potential role in a new stabilisation architecture but also about navigating a complex web of domestic and external pressures, according to Akbar Ahmed, Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at American University.
“PM Shehbaz Sharif faces as sticky a wicket as can be imagined when he arrives in Washington for his meetings with President Trump,” Prof Ahmed said. “He is bringing with him two sets of dilemmas: an internal one and an external one.”
On the domestic front, he noted, the prime minister must manage a difficult civil-military balance amid rising security challenges. He added that Shehbaz Sharif also faces a politically sensitive decision regarding the continued incarceration and health of former PM Imran Khan.
Externally, the challenge is even more complex. “On the one hand, he must continue his newly formed amiable relationship with President Trump, which gives him access to American military and economic structures, and on the other, the consistent and immeasurable support that China has provided,” Prof Ahmed said, pointing to tensions on both the eastern and western borders as factors that make this balance unavoidable.
“With both the western border with Afghanistan and the eastern border with India heating up, Shehbaz Sharif cannot ignore this balance between America and China. His performance will be watched carefully and his words weighed. He will need all his legendary skills of survival.”
In that sense, the Washington visit is as much about testing the contours of Pakistan’s evolving relationship with the United States as it is about Gaza. For the Trump administration, the summit is expected to secure troop commitments for the ISF, financial participation in reconstruction and political endorsement for a US-led stabilisation model.
For Muslim and Arab countries, participation is tied to a permanent ceasefire, a credible pathway to Palestinian statehood and a non-combat mandate for any multinational force.
How PM Shehbaz positions Pakistan between these competing expectations — while coordinating with like-minded states and maintaining strategic equilibrium between Washington and Beijing — will determine both the immediate diplomatic outcome of the summit and the longer trajectory of Pakistan’s role in the emerging post-conflict framework for Gaza.
Published in Dawn, February 18th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-18 02:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18073550554bfd6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974022/robust-demand-fuels-auto-loans' target='_blank'><strong>Robust demand fuels auto loans</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Robust demand further pushed outstanding auto loans for the 14th consecutive month to Rs328 billion in January, up from Rs319bn in December 2025.
The State Bank of Pakistan data revealed that consumers opted for more loans in January due to the change of model year and registration, as the growth in December 2025 was slightly slower than in November 2025.
Auto financing has been struggling to beat the peak of Rs368bn recorded in June 2022 when annual car sales volumes were around 240,000 units.

 

Auto sector expert Mashood Ali Khan said that the current trend shows consumers are increasingly leveraging bank financing to purchase vehicles, contributing to a gradual recovery in automobile sales despite prevailing economic challenges. This is a strong indicator that consumer demand still exists, and it only needs supportive policy to accelerate further.
The growth momentum comes primarily under the State Bank’s existing Rs3 million auto financing cap, enabling a large segment of middle-income consumers to access vehicle ownership. “I believe that the auto sector holds significantly greater potential if financing limits are revised upward to Rs6 to Rs7m.”
By doing this, the auto market will witness a substantial expansion, particularly in the sedan and mid-range vehicle segment, which remains largely inaccessible to financing-dependent consumers under current limits, he added.
“If financing ceilings are increased and interest rates continue to ease, Pakistan’s annual auto sales could potentially cross 200,000 units a year again,” he emphasised.
He said the small-car segment remains the primary beneficiary of financing due to its alignment with the SBP financing cap. A segment of consumers is also seeking to access sedans through partial financing combined with personal savings, highlighting the demand gap created by the current financing ceiling.
Banks are offering more flexible financing options, including comparatively lower markup rates, reduced down-payment requirements, and easier repayment structures. “This has supported recovery, but policy alignment is essential to unlock the sector’s full potential,” he said.
Raising financing limits, while supporting consumers, would also generate broader economic benefits, including industrial production growth, employment generation, vendor development, and increased government revenues through taxes and duties, he said.
He said continued interest rate moderation could further strengthen financing activity in the coming months. “I stress that revising financing limits remains the single most impactful policy intervention to accelerate growth,” Khan said.
Sales are likely to remain upbeat in view of a 137pc increase in imports of semi- and completely knocked-down kits by the local assemblers to $1.144bn in 7MFY26 from $706m in the same period last fiscal year.

During the almost two-week visit ending March 11, the engagements would be of greater significance as both sides would also discuss budget proposals based on performance this year and set broad contours of the upcoming budget (for the fiscal year 2026-27), particularly those relating to provincial finances.
The programme’s performance as of end-Dece­mber 2025 — the period for review — has mostly been up to the mark, alb­eit with a revenue shortfall, which authorities bel­i­eve could be reduced following a recent super tax ruling by the Federal Cons­t­ituti­onal Court that went in the government’s favour.
The power sector would also remain under added scrutiny given volatile policymaking in the recent months, including those relating to the industrial sector, residential fixed cha­rges and so on, altho­ugh circular debt numbers are within the target range.
On the positive side, Pak­istan has met almost all quantitative performa­nce criteria for end-Dece­mber 2025. However, it is lagging behind in indicative targets and structural benchmarks, which could affect future programme implementation.
Given the biannual reviews of the $7bn EFF and the $1.1bn RSF, the two sides will have to agree on past performance as well as forward-looking implementation plans.
Upon the successful completion of the review, Pakistan will be eligible for the disbursement of about $1bn (760 million Special Drawing Rights) under the EFF and another $200m under the RSF by the end of April.
Meanwhile, Topline Research said it expected Pakistan to meet nearly all quantitative performance criteria (QPCs).
“As per our calculation, Pakistan is likely to meet nearly all seven QPCs; however, data for one indicator is not known yet,” it said, referring to the floor on targeted cash transfers, which it said was missed in the previous review by Rs1bn.
However, it perhaps missed the point that the slippage was only technical in nature, as lower spending was not related to beneficiaries but to lower administrative expenses.
Topline also observed that net international reserves were likely to remain below at around $6.7bn against the $7bn benchmark for September 2025 and below $6bn for December 2025 against the $6.5bn benchmark.
“The net domestic assets (NDA) of the SBP are likely to remain in the range of Rs12.5-13.5tr vs the ceiling target of Rs14.9-15.1tr for September and December 2025,” it said.
It said that as per the State Bank, foreign currency swaps stood at $2.2bn for September 2025 and $1.86bn for December 2025, compared to ceiling targets of $2.25bn and $2bn, respectively. It also estimated primary surplus figures of Rs3.5tr and Rs4.1tr for September and December compared to targets of Rs460bn and Rs3.2tr.
“The government guarantees and floor on cash transfer spending are also likely to be met as per our channel checks. Similarly, the new tax return target is also expected to be achieved,” Topline said.
It added that the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) indicative criteria were missed by Rs336bn but hoped that a portion of this missed target could be collected through the super tax verdict, though the collection would still remain below the annual target.

The incident sparked concern among the fellows of  the student when they found her in a pool of blood and immediately  alerted the college management. 
The student (F) was a resident of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and living in the government hostel of the FJMU. 
According  to reports, the student suffered multiple head and neck injuries  besides the bone fractures. She was rushed to the emergency  ward of the attached Sir Ganga Ram Hospital from where she was shifted  to the operating theatre after initial assessment. 
According to FJMU Vice Chancellor Prof Khalid Masood Gondal, her condition was very critical. She underwent a major neuro surgery by a team of senior doctors, but she succumbed to her injuries.
Prof Gondal said the incident occurred at the FJMU girls hostel wherein she accidentally fell from the building. “We  have constituted a medical board comprising senior doctors,” the FJMU  VC said adding that he has also formed another five-member fact-finding  panel of senior doctors and other experts to probe into the matter and  submit a report within 24 hours. 
Prof Bilquis Shabbir, the Dean Undergraduates, was made the head of the committee. 
The VC said she may have fallen accidentally from the building. However,  the eyewitnesses and some sources in the institute claimed that she  jumped from the building in an attempt to end her life. Immediately, no reason for her extreme step was available. 
Earlier, two students, including a female student of a private university in Raiwind, had also jumped from the building.

Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka restrained police from arresting the PTI founder in the said cases and also extended the pre-arrest bail of Bushra Bibi in one related matter. The hearing was adjourned till Feb 18.
During the proceedings, the PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were represented by their legal team. However, despite earlier directions, the former prime minister could not be produced before the court through a video link. Owing to his absence and the unavailability of his counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, arguments on the acquittal application could not be advanced.
The court subsequently directed that the PTI fou­nder must appear at the next hearing either personally or via video link.
The cases against the PTI founder stem from the May 9 incidents and incl­ude charges of attempted murder, submission of fake receipts and other offences. A separate case has also been registered against Bushra Bibi for allegedly submitting fake receipts.
Also, Additional Distr­ict and Sessions Judge Amir Zia extended the interim bail of Bushra Bibi in a case related to the November 26 protest.
Meanwhile, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra deferred indictment proceedings in the Sangjani Jalsa case due to the non-appearance of the accused PTI lawmakers.

Meanwhile, the alleged move continues to draw criticism.
On Monday, it was claimed by an X account, The Stratcom Bureau — which mainly shares defence- and security-relates news — that the “government of Punjab, Pakistan has acquired a new, 2019-manufactured Gulfstream GVII-G500 aircraft for their VIP transport role”.
In a separate post by the same account, it was claimed that “the registration number of the luxury plane is N144S” and its “old Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) registration would be changed to Pakistani registration soon”.
The post also said that the approximate asking price for the aircraft was $38 million to $42m.
Meanwhile, the US FAA registry shows that the aircraft is currently owned by TVPX Aircraft Solutions Inc. Trustee, which, as per its website, commonly acts as the registered owner for aircraft trusts, facilitating the buying, selling, and leasing of planes, particularly for non-US citizens or for privacy reasons.



According to flight tracking service Flight Radar, the aircraft has been flying between various airports in Punjab since at least February 12.
Dawn reached out to several officials for a confirmation of the purchase’s claims, but they remained tight-lipped on the matter.
Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman and Additional Chief Secretary Ahmad Raza Sarwar did not respond to calls and text messages to clarify the Punjab government’s position.
Punjab Additional Secretary (Welfare) Waseem Hamid, however, denied the claims of the aircraft’s purchase before abruptly disconnecting the call.
Dawn also tried to contact Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, but she, too, did not respond to any calls or the query sent to her as a text message.
Amid this silence by the officials, the reported purchase of the aircraft continues to draw criticism, including by former finance minister Miftah Ismail and ex-Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair.
Sharing the Stratcom Bureau’s post on X, Miftah juxtaposed the reported purchase of the aircraft with the recent hike in petroleum prices by the government.
“So while Pakistanis are supposed to tighten our belts and sacrifice, Punjab’s entitled VIPs are fastening their seatbelts for taking off in luxury private jets,” he said.







Similarly, Zubair posted on X: “Such a beautiful plane worth more than 1,000 crore, which has been bought by the Punjab govt for the use of its CM and party’s elite.”
He questioned whether a nation facing economic difficulties, with 45 per cent of the people living below the poverty line and amid record unemployment — afford this luxury.
“The Punjab government may issue a denial if not true,” he said about the claims of the aircraft’s purchase.

In separate reports, the publication said that Wednesday (Feb 18) would be the first day of the holy month in both countries.
The official Saudi Press Agency also said on X that Wednesday would be the first day of the holy month in the kingdom.







Tolo News, meanwhile, also announced that Ramazan would begin on February 18 in Afghanistan.
“In a statement issued by the Supreme Court, it said that in the provinces of Parwan, Kandahar, Helmand, and Zabul, a large number of people sighted the crescent moon of Ramadan and reported it to the Sharia courts,” it said in a post on X.







Saudi Arabia’s Gulf neighbours Oman, Qatar and the UAE also made similar announcements.
Last week, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said that the first day of Ramazan in Pakistan “likely to fall” on February 19 (Thursday).
However, the agency said the final announcement regarding the beginning of the Islamic holy month will be made by the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, “which is the sole competent authority, based on credible witness testimonies from across the country”.
It is worth mentioning that a meeting of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee will be held tomorrow at the Auqaf Department building in Peshawar.
According to a notification issued by the religious affairs ministry, zonal and district committee meetings will also be held at their respective headquarters.
“The chairman Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee will announce the decision of moon sighting or otherwise subsequently on the basis of information received to this end,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-17 19:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17162141b1fbbd9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973904/former-cricket-captains-including-indias-gavaskar-and-kapil-issue-humanitarian-appeal-for-jailed-imran' target='_blank'><strong>Former cricket captains, including India’s Gavaskar and Kapil, issue humanitarian appeal for jailed Imran</strong></a><br><p>Indian cricket greats Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev joined a dozen other former international captains on Tuesday in demanding better prison treatment for “one of the finest all-rounders” of the game, former prime minister Imran Khan.
Cricketer-turned-politician Imran, 73, has been in jail since August 2023, convicted in a string of cases that he says were politically driven following his ouster in a 2022 parliamentary vote.
Imran’s lawyer, Salman Safdar, told the Supreme Court last week that the former premier had lost a significant amount of vision in his right eye while in custody. On Monday, a medical board said the swelling had reduced after treatment, and his vision had improved.
On Tuesday, former India captains Gavaskar and Kapil signed a petition expressing “deep concern” about Imran’s treatment and prison conditions.
Former Australia captain Greg Chappell, his brother Ian Chappell and compatriots Allan Border, Steve Waugh, Belinda Clark and Kim Hughes have signed the petition.
England’s Mike Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Mike Brearley and David Gower have also signed, alongside Clive Lloyd from the West Indies and John Wright from New Zealand.
The campaign is led by Chappell, a former Australian captain and contemporary of Imran. Meanwhile, the office of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told AFP it had not yet received the captains’ statement.
“Many of us competed against him, shared the field with him, or grew up idolising his all-round brilliance, charisma, and competitive spirit,” they said in the petition.







“Recent reports concerning his health — particularly the alarming deterioration of his vision while in custody — and the conditions of his imprisonment over the past two and a half years have caused us profound concern.
“As fellow cricketers who understand the values of fair play, honour, and respect that transcend the boundary rope, we believe that a person of Imran Khan’s stature deserves to be treated with the dignity and basic human consideration befitting a former national leader and a global sporting icon.”
The cricket greats “respectfully” urged the Pakistan government to ensure immediate and adequate medical attention, dignified treatment, and unhindered access to legal processes for Imran.
“Our shared history on the field reminds us that rivalry ends when the stumps are drawn — and respect endures. Imran Khan embodied that spirit throughout his career.”
Separately, former Indian cricketer Mohammed Azharuddin posted on X that he was “deeply saddened to hear about Imran bhai”.
“Cricket has given us many shared moments, and as a fellow sportsman who has shared the platform and learned from him, I sincerely appeal that he be treated with dignity. Praying for his good health and strength for his family,” he said.







Meanwhile, the PTI issued a statement on its X account, thanking the international cricketers for raising “their voices against the injustices being committed against” the former premier.
The party expressed the hope that cricketers “will continue to extend their full support to Imran Khan until justice and fairness are achieved”.
PTI also called on the current and veteran cricketers around the globe to speak in favour of the incarcerated leader and against “this injustice”.
“One of cricket’s greatest legends is currently languishing in prison as the victim of a political vendetta and injustice, where he is being deprived of basic human rights and essential medical facilities,” PTI added.







Last week, Pakistan’s cricketing community had also voiced concern about the health of the former captain and called on authorities to ensure he received the best possible care.
Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram — who was part of the 1992 squad which won the World Cup — said it was “heartbreaking” to learn that Imran was facing health issues.
Former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar said he was “deeply saddened” to hear the news about Imran losing vision in his eye.</p><small>2026-02-17 19:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1720145317b5916.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973874/tarique-rahman-sworn-in-as-bangladeshs-pm-after-landslide-election-victory' target='_blank'><strong>Tarique Rahman sworn in as Bangladesh’s PM after landslide election victory</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Tarique Rahman was sworn in as Bangladesh’s prime minister on Tuesday, marking a decisive political shift in the South Asian nation after his party’s sweeping parliamentary election victory.
Rahman, 60, son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and assassinated President Ziaur Rahman, takes office facing urgent challenges, including restoring political stability, rebuilding investor confidence, and reviving key industries such as the garment sector after the prolonged turmoil that followed the Gen Z-led uprising that toppled Sheikh Hasina’s government in 2024.
An interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus ran the country through the transitional period leading up to the election.

 


Breaking with tradition, the swearing-in ceremony was held under the open sky at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, the national parliament building, instead of the Bangabhaban, the president’s official residence, where such events are usually organised.
President Mohammed Shahabuddin officiated as Rahman and his cabinet took their oaths in the presence of senior political figures, diplomats, civil and military officials, and representatives from invited countries, including China, India and Pakistan.
Rahman’s BNP secured a commanding two-thirds majority, returning to power after nearly two decades. The Jamaat-i-Islami, contesting its first election since a 2013 ban was lifted following Hasina’s ouster, won a record 68 seats.
Hasina’s Awami League party was banned from contesting after its registration was revoked by the Election Commission.
Jamaat and its allies, including the National Citizen Party, led by youth activists who played a prominent role in the movement that toppled Hasina, will form the opposition.

 

Rahman’s elevation caps a long and turbulent political journey. He returned to Bangladesh last year after 17 years of self-imposed exile in London, arriving shortly before his mother’s death.
Rivals have long criticised his political record, pointing to corruption allegations he denies, but his return energised party supporters and reshaped the BNPs campaign.
In his first remarks after the election, Rahman urged calm and restraint, saying: Peace, law and order must be maintained at any cost.
He called on supporters to avoid retaliation, warning: We will not tolerate any kind of chaos.
Earlier today, Rahman and lawmakers were sworn into parliament on Tuesday, becoming the first elected representatives since a deadly 2024 uprising.
The lawmakers, who promised loyalty to Bangladesh, were sworn in by the Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin.



‘Peaceful opposition’
Rahman’s win marks a remarkable turnaround, with the BNP coalition winning 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance.

 

Jamaat, which secured more than a quarter of seats in parliament — a four-fold increase on its previous best — has challenged results in 32 constituencies.
But Jamaat leader Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has also said the party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.
Only seven women were directly elected, although a further 50 seats reserved for women will be allocated to parties according to their share of the vote.
Four members of minority communities won seats, including two Hindus — a population that makes up roughly seven per cent in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.

 

Despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has so far responded to the results with relative calm.
“If the BNP can do a good job with the economy, it will make everything else easier for the government,” Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean said.
“It will help to create a level of stability, to tackle the many other challenges beyond the economy.”
Pakistan congratulates Rahman
After Rahman’s oath-taking, President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated him on becoming the prime minister and his party on its “decisive victory” in the elections.
A post by the President’s Secretariat on social media platform X said Zardari also appreciated the interim government’s role “in a peaceful [and] fair election” and conveyed “best wishes for stability and prosperity”.
The president “hopes for stronger Pakistan-Bangladesh ties and regional peace”, the post said.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended warm felicitations to Rahman.
“I look forward to close and meaningful engagements with my brother, to further strengthen our bilateral cooperation across mutually beneficial areas and to deepen the historic ties between our two countries,” he said.







Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who was visiting Dhaka for the swearing-in ceremony, conveyed best wishes and prayers for Rahman in “steering the country towards new heights of progress and development”.
“It was an honour to witness and be part of this historic moment in the history of Bangladesh on behalf of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the people of Pakistan,” he said.







Iqbal also met Rahman after the latter’s oath-taking, with a PID press release stating that the Pakistani minister conveyed “warm congratulations on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan” to the new prime minister.
He extended best wishes for the peace, progress and prosperity of Bangladesh under Rahman’s leadership, the press release said, adding that during the meeting, Iqbal also conveyed a formal invitation from the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Rahman to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date.
“The two leaders discussed avenues to reinvigorate bilateral relations and enhance regional cooperation,” the press release further stated.
It said Iqbal emphasised the need to revive SAARC to promote regional connectivity and advance a shared geo-economic vision for South Asia.
He noted that South Asia has remained one of the least integrated regions due to historical conflicts, and underscored that Pakistan and Bangladesh, through mutual collaboration, could help pave the way for a more integrated and economically vibrant South Asia.
Highlighting the importance of knowledge partnerships, Iqbal proposed the establishment of a “Pakistan–Bangladesh Knowledge Corridor” to strengthen academic, research and technological collaboration, the press release said.
He informed Rahman that the Chairman of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan would be directed to visit Bangladesh to explore twin-university agreements and promote student and faculty exchange programmes.
Iqbal stressed that youth exchange “is crucial for building long-term partnerships” and announced enhanced academic cooperation, including scholarship opportunities. He said that 500 scholarships had been allocated for Bangladeshi students, with 75 students already proceeding to Pakistan for higher education.
Both sides also discussed collaboration between institutions including the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), and their Bangladeshi counterparts to exchange expertise in data systems, digital governance, and institutional capacity building.
Iqbal further highlighted opportunities for cooperation in SMEs and cottage industries, noting that by leveraging their combined populations, Pakistan and Bangladesh could secure a greater share in global markets for technology-enabled services, manufacturing, and production of goods.
Expanding direct flight operations and improving connectivity were also discussed as important steps to facilitate trade, tourism, business-to-business engagement, and people-to-people contacts, the press release said.
It said Iqbal also proposed the revival of the Iqbal Academy and suggested joint celebrations of the 150th birth anniversary of Allama Muhammad Iqbal next year, as a symbol of shared intellectual and cultural heritage.
Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties and working together for regional peace, stability, and shared prosperity, according to the press release.
Earlier, the minister had met with Mohammad Yunus, who was serving as the country’s interim leader.
“I warmly congratulated Professor Yunus and the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of elections and the historic democratic transition. I conveyed Pakistan’s sincere good wishes for continued stability, progress, and prosperity for Bangladesh under its new leadership,” he said.







He further said that the discussions focused on “opening a new, forward-looking chapter in Pakistan–Bangladesh relations”.
“I expressed appreciation for the positive momentum in bilateral ties, including growing trade engagement, revival of direct air connectivity, and renewed people-to-people contacts. We agreed that the current regional and geopolitical environment demands greater economic cooperation, connectivity, and collaboration between our two countries,” Iqbal said.
He also acknowledged Yunus’s global contributions to social entrepreneurship and inclusive development.
“I extended an invitation for him to visit Pakistan so that we may further institutionalise cooperation in areas of shared interest, particularly youth empowerment, innovation, and sustainable development,” he said.
“Pakistan and Bangladesh share deep cultural, historical, and social affinities. It is time to transform these affinities into structured economic partnerships, academic exchanges, and regional cooperation. Our future lies in building connectivity, expanding trade, empowering youth, and shaping a stable and prosperous South Asia together,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-17 19:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17132938fbfbe4c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973882/phc-orders-reopening-of-kp-roads-blocked-by-pti-supporters' target='_blank'><strong>PHC orders reopening of KP roads blocked by PTI supporters</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and police to ensure the reopening of roads blocked by PTI supporters and protesters in recent days.
The protesting PTI workers have blocked KP’s entry and exit points for the past five days, demanding that the federal government move incarcerated party founder Imran Khan from jail to a hospital for medical treatment.
A two-member bench headed by Justice Ijaz Anwar and including Justice Farah Jamshed took up the set of petitions filed by MPA Sobia Shahid, lawyer Tariq Afghan, Swabi resident Yousaf Ali and Shaoor Khan.
Upon the bench summoning them, KP Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed, Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah and Advocate General Shah Faisal Utmankhel appeared in court.
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Anwar inquired about how many days it had been since the roads were blocked.

 

“The roads have been shut for the past three days. Initially, 14 points were blocked, and now protests are underway at six points,” the KP IG replied.
Justice Anwar wondered whether shutting roads was not a violation of the law, pointing out that lawyers for six cases were unable to reach the PHC from Islamabad.
He remarked, “Such is the security situation in the province that even today, 14 have been martyred. These are the conditions, but despite this, there are protests and roads are closed.”
The judge highlighted that the laws guaranteed citizens the right to freedom of movement, but they were still “facing difficulties”. He inquired about the number of first information reports (FIR) registered over the road blockades.
“The traffic situation in Peshawar is the worst in the entire country. In fact, there is no traffic system in this province,” Justice Anwar observed, at which IG Hameed expressed his strong agreement.
“We are now trying to streamline this, and are initiating e-challans,” the police chief assured the court.
Justice Anwar quipped, “When the police want to take action against someone, they do. When they do not want to, then this happens.”
At one point during the hearing, Justice Anwar said it was “unfortunate that the ruling party here is protesting [and] hurting the province’s people”.
Utmankhel assured the bench that “no one would defend any wrong act.”
IG Hameed sought two days for the police to “fix the situation”, but Justice Anwar declined the request, ordering that the roads be opened today.
“Begin today, and do not let anyone block the roads,” he stressed. “The entire country is open, but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is shut. This is against our own people.”
“The motorway should not be closed off under any circumstances,” he added, noting that people could not leave their houses due to the blocked routes.
Protesters had blocked the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway (M-1) at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway.
“Reopen the roads and ensure the same,” Justice Anwar ordered, telling the KP IG and the chief secretary to submit their reports regarding the matter by tomorrow.
Subsequently, the bench adjourned the hearing till Wednesday.

 

Following the court directives, the provincial police chief issued instructions for all regional and district police officers for reopening the roads, a statement by KP police said.
“Instructions have been issued to start the process of reopening the blocked roads across the province on the PHC’s directives,” the statement read.
The closure of M-1 — the main artery connecting Peshawar with the rest of the country — has put the GT Road, the other major road, under immense strain as the neglected highway is unable to cater to the traffic diverted from the motorway.
Also, the GT Road is facing closures by PTI activists, causing massive inconvenience to people travelling to attend urgent business meetings and exams, take international flights from Islamabad airport and seek treatment.
The businessmen, whose supplies have got stuck along the road, are also distressed.
Roads reopen in DI Khan
Hours after the court’s directives, District Police Officer (DPO) Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmed said that all highways in Dera Ismail Khan had been cleared and traffic flow had been restored.
The protesters would remain at certain points “symbolically”, they would not obstruct vehicular movement, he said while speaking to the media.
The reopened road links include the Dera–Darya Khan bridge that connects KP with Punjab.
DPO Ahmed said that its closure had caused significant hardship for the public, particularly daily commuters, patients and members of the business community.
“Public convenience is our priority, and traffic has now been fully restored,” he said, adding that police personnel had been deployed at key locations to maintain law and order.
KP CM reacts
Reacting to the developments regarding sit-ins in KP, Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said in a post on social media platform X that PTI workers, who had been staging a sit-in of their own accord, “have just one demand: the best treatment for Imran Khan sahib in the presence of his personal physicians and family members”.
He added: “In my opinion, the respected court should also enquire about the issue before issuing an order.”
The CM went on to allege that “the KP IG’s response to the court directives is clear proof that the khaki uniform’s directives are behind the black uniform”.







He added that police IGs were representatives of the Centre. “When top police officials, brought to a terrorism-affected province from outside, and the province’s chief executive are brought face-to-face, in which direction are the conditions being pushed?”
CM Afridi said the PTI did not want to politicise the matter of Imran’s health and “we … have been patient despite immense difficulties”.

The hope, however, did not materialise.
In the afternoon, an X account of the PTI said that a vehicle carrying Imran’s sisters was stopped at the Chakri Interchange while on its way to the Adiala jail.







Later, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also claimed in a post that “we were stopped at the Chakri police post by the police. When we informed them that we intended to leave and proceed to Islamabad, they unlawfully blocked us and detained us there for the next four hours”.
“We have now been released and are on our way to Islamabad,” she added.







PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Secretary General Salman Akram Raja also sought to meet Imran today but were told by the Adiala jail administration that the meeting could not be allowed.
Speaking to the media on the occasion, Raja said Imran’s medical report released on Monday indicated that he had an eye ailment. He added that the court had also issued directives for meetings with Imran and yet, his associates and family members were not being allowed to meet him.
Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the Supreme Court’s (SC) intervention last week led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which quoted Imran as saying only 15 per cent vision was left in his right eye.
This prompted a strong response from the opposition alliance, which began a sit-in at the Parliament House for the fulfilment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination.
Raja said Safdar, in his report submitted to the Supreme Court after meeting Imran, “clearly stated that Imran Khan told him he could not see him with his right eye”.
The PTI leader demanded that Imran’s long-time personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf and the former premier’s sisters should be allowed to meet him at the Adiala jail.
“We want to hear from Imran Khan that he is fine, and this should be conveyed by a person we can trust,” Raja said.
Meanwhile, family members of Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, were allowed to meet her at the Adiala jail, sources told Dawn.
According to the sources, three of her family members, including her daughter, met her for around 40 minutes.
Earlier in the day, TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai had told Dawn that as Tuesday was supposed to be a meeting day with Imran, two of the sit-in participants — Raja and Gohar — would be going to Adiala jail, as their names had been included in the list of those to meet the PTI founder.







“Moreover, we are hoping that the meeting of all sisters or at least one of the family members will be allowed today,” he had said. “It will end the rumours about the health of Imran Khan, as they will directly hear from him and will share Khan sahib’s views regarding his health.”
Responding to a question, Yousufzai said that the government should allow the meeting as it may help defuse the current tensions if the medical report regarding Imran was correct.
“It is a fact that during the last two years we have been deceived a number of times, due to which the level of trust has been reduced,” he said.
The spokesperson further said he met Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi last night, where it was decided to hold an evening meeting to determine the next course of action.

 

The opposition on Monday decided to extend their sit-in at the Parliament House, which began on Friday, for another day to “see the government’s response” to their demand for access to the former premier, whose health has recently been called into question by a medical report following his examination at the Adiala jail on Sunday.
After Imran was not allowed visits today, the TTAP held an “emergency meeting” at the Parliament House to discuss the course of action pertaining to Imran’s “deteriorating health and the government’s negligence, non-serious attitude and lack of transparency in the information being provided on the matter”.
A statement by the TTAP said that the “future course of action, joint strategy and probable constitutional and parliamentary measures” were discussed in the meeting.







After the meeting, the alliance released a list of demands, calling for Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan to be provided immediate and “confidential” access to Imran so that they could “independently” examine Imran.
The TTAP also demanded the provision of copies of all medical test, diagnostic and x-ray reports, scans and laboratory tests of Imran to his personal physicians.
Moreover, the “personal physician should be allowed to develop an independent medical opinion in the absence of the medical board or any pressure”.
The TTAP also demanded permission for Imran’s personal physicians to conduct his follow-up examinations regularly.
The government should also clarify the delay in Imran’s treatment, diagnosis and the provision of medical treatment to him, the TTAp demanded, also seeking assurance that such negligence would not be committed in the future.
CM Afridi and MPAs also continued their demonstration outside the KP House in Islamabad on Tuesday.







Imran’s party, family ‘reject’ medical report
Imran’s party and family have rejected the report issued by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday, sticking to their demand that he be taken to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital in the presence of his personal doctors.
In a post on X, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram referred to the statement by Imran’s longtime personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf, who had spoken to the doctors currently treating the ex-prime minister.
Akram noted that Dr Yusuf said “that he neither met Khan nor could he talk to him nor could he examine him or take care of him, therefore he can neither confirm nor deny” the report prepared.
He stated that the PTI “rejects this report and strongly demands that Imran Khan sahib be immediately met by his family and personal physician and that he be immediately treated and examined at Al-Shifa International”.
“To issue such a report by having doctors of one’s choice examine him shows that something is definitely being hidden and the only solution to avoid all this is to immediately have Imran Khan examined at Shifa International on the recommendation of his family and personal physician,” Akram contended.







In her statement posted hours earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said: “We categorically REJECT all the medical reports circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan.”
“[…] as Dr Asim Yousuf stated in his video, there is NO way for us to verify any of this,” she highlighted.
“Now we are even more concerned and worried and our demand remains unchanged: Imran Khan must be urgently transferred to a proper medical facility (Shifa International Hospital Islamabad) where he shall be examined by qualified specialists under Dr Asim Yousuf’s supervision and in the presence of his family,” Aleema demanded.
She added that she and others will be at the Adiala jail at 1:30pm today to attempt to meet Imran.
“We expect the authorities to allow us to meet Imran Khan as this is his legal right,” the sister said.

Chasing 171 for victory, Nepal looked in trouble at 98-3 in the 14th over before Airee took the initiative in his 23-ball knock as his team achieved the target with four balls to spare in Mumbai.
Airee put on 73 runs with Gulsan Jha, who made 24 not out, as Nepal earned their first win after three losses in Group C.
Nepal’s fans erupted with joy at the Wankhede Stadium after seeing their team win for the first time in the tournament since 2014.
“I want to thank the fans who came from Nepal and supported us, that gives a lot of motivation to all of us,” said player of the match Airee.
“And in the last World Cup, we didn’t win a single match. So that’s why this win is very important for us.” It was Nepal’s first victory in the T20 World Cup since they beat Hong Kong and Afghanistan in the opening stage 12 years ago.
Nepal had given England a mighty scare in their opener before losing by four runs and then went down in the next two games.
Put in to bat, Scotland posted 170-7 after a 45-ball 71 by opener Michael Jones
Nepal pace bowler Sompal Kami stood out with figures of 3-25.
Nepal started strongly with Kushal Bhurtel scoring 45 as he put on 74 runs with fellow opener Aasif Sheikh, who made 33.

The TTAP particularly accused Naqvi of attempting to “distort” facts to “cover up the deteriorating health and treatment meted out to” the former prime minister.
The allegations came in response to a press conference by Naqvi earlier in the day, who asserted that the government did not want to “politicise” the matter of PTI founder Imran Khan’s health and blamed the opposition for doing the same.
The opposition, PTI and Imran’s family have voiced concerns over the former prime minister’s health after his eye ailment came to light late in January.
Addressing the media in Lahore, Naqvi referred to the recent medical report prepared by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday.
“The medical report also came forward yesterday and everything is clear as per it. Neither we nor the government want to politicise this,” he said, adding that there were certain “requests” which the authorities allowed but were not suitable to publicise at the moment.
“Putting up such a show is extremely inappropriate, especially misleading people,” the minister said.

 

“Still, we picked our best government and private doctors because it had been three days and the checkup had not taken place,” he insisted.
Naqvi said he then invited PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan to reach Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday to witness Imran’s checkup but the former refused, citing party consultations.
Detailing the communication between the authorities and the opposition, Naqvi said Gohar was given the time of 2:30pm. “We kept on waiting for an hour but Gohar sahib replied in the negative, that he has consulted with his party and would not be able to come.”
“Our intention was that the checkup be performed in front of everyone,” he asserted, adding that the doctors were at the Adiala jail for about 1.25-1.5 hours for the examination.



Naqvi stated that Gohar, along with the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders — Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai — and their preferred doctors, was then invited to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad.
There, the doctors who examined Imran briefed the opposition leaders as well as spoke on the phone to the “two doctors” named by the PTI, with each conversation lasting for about 45 minutes. “They asked each and everything,” Naqvi said about the PTI-recommended doctors.
“Excellent. This is the best treatment. Even if we had to provide treatment, we would have done the same,” he quoted the doctors as saying.
According to Naqvi, the opposition representatives also expressed satisfaction over the treatment and said they would inform their supporters about it.

 

Asked about former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s claims that Naqvi made unmatched efforts for Imran’s release, the minister said, “One thing, which is not new, is that I have believed from the first day that dialogue is the solution to everything.
“This is not my personal opinion; the prime minister has also said what I say, and we are following those instructions. […] If you ask about my personal view, I always say talks are the [answer],” he said.
Responding to another question, he said there were “sensible people” in every party and if they had been listened to, the “PTI would not have been in the current situation, nor would have done the May 9 things”.
On whether any action was being taken against the former Adiala jail superintendent whom the PTI holds responsible for aggravating Imran’s health issue, Naqvi stated: “We will check with the Punjab government what they are doing on it. But they are on it.”
‘Politicians onboard but Aleema vetoed everything’
However, the minister claimed, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum told the PTI that the “issue would die down” if the opposition accepted the government’s arrangements.
“The medical checkup could not take place for three days just because of her. On one hand, they claim to have great empathy, relation and everything. On the other hand, politics has been done to the utmost over this.”
The interior minister then questioned why roads were being blocked despite all the steps taken for Imran’s treatment.
“If your intention was good, then you would have agreed on the first day. Almost all political leaders used to be on board but Aleema Khan sahiba vetoed them. She used to reject everything,” Naqvi said.
“The problem is they want to cash this matter,” he contended.



During his media talk, Naqvi recalled how the issue of Imran’s eye ailment came to light after the government confirmed that the PTI founder was taken to Pims for a minor procedure.
He noted that the treatment was merely an injection that needed to be administered.
The minister pointed out that “as a precaution, so there are no germs”, Imran was taken to the hospital, even though doctors suggested it could be done in jail.
“I will tell you very clearly that when any prisoner needs treatment, it is our duty,” he affirmed, questioning whether all thousands of prisoners were accorded the same facilities as Imran was being provided.
The interior minister said he believed that journalists should be provided with a tour of prisons so they could witness the facilities available there.
Naqvi quipped that if the aim was political vendetta, then the first step would be to adopt a strict demeanour and restrict their facilities to what is provided to an ordinary prisoner as per the jail manual.
“If we wanted to exact political revenge, the first step would be to [tighten] him,” he said.
On the topic of the ongoing road blockades due to PTI protests, the minister said: “Our duty is to tell people to be aware of whatever cells in your party that are doing this; they are enemies of your people that have different objectives and want to do their own politics.
“[…] It is now clear to me about at least some individuals that they are more worried about their politics than his (Imran’s) health.”
The interior minister affirmed that the government would ensure the implementation of the recent Peshawar High Court (PHC) order that has directed the KP government and its police to reopen the roads.
Demand for 1-week hospital admission
Recalling previous contacts between the government and the opposition with the mediation of NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Naqvi asserted: “We made one thing very clear that in the matter of treatment, we will provide whatever facility is available to any incarcerated person as per the Constitution and the law.”
He stated that the government had sought the name of a “non-political” eye specialist for examining Imran, but the other side refused and insisted on a family member accompanying the doctor, which was also agreed to.
“I am saying all this as it is on record and you can ask the PTI leaders about this,” the minister affirmed. He further said that the name of Kasim, who he said was a cousin, was also given by the party to come along, which was allowed.
“When both things had taken place, they said ‘no, not like this, you must admit him to a hospital for a week and we will not accept anything else’,” Naqvi claimed.
The minister said the authorities would “100 per cent” have Imran hospitalised for “even two weeks” given that the doctors recommended it.
“But if the doctors do not recommend, then how can we have him admitted?” he asked. “It is not possible that just on your recommendation we admit him to hospital for one week.”
Separately, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry posted on social media platform X that Imran would be administered an injection in the next few days, and a second injection would be administered after a month.
The minister said this was expected to lead to further improvement in Imran’s condition, adding: “His (Imran’s) treatment will continue at the best hospital of Islamabad/ Rawalpindi and under the supervision of expert doctors.”







Chaudhry asserted that Imran’s family was taken into confidence at every stage.
He further said: “The government clarifies that no negligence will be committed. All prisoners are equal for us and their health is the state’s responsibility.
“Politicisation should be avoided on this matter, and baseless doubts should not be spread.”
The minister alleged that the PTI was “giving a political colour to this sensitive matter to hide its internal divide”.
TTAP terms Naqvi’s presser contrary to facts
Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) termed Naqvi’s press conference “blatantly misleading and contrary to the facts”.
In a statement, the opposition alliance said that the government was attempting to “distort” facts and create a “fabricated narrative to cover up the deteriorating health and treatment meted out to” the incarcerated former premier.







“Concealing the facts from the nation is unacceptable,” the TTAP said. It added that the “distrust of government doctors and demand for the presence of Imran’s personal physician during the medical examination was not an act of stubbornness but rather a unanimous decision taken by his family, the leadership of PTI and the TTAP”.
It said that only the incarcerated leader’s family “has the right to make a decision regarding his health”.
The opposition alliance reiterated its demand for Imran’s personal physicians to be present, stressing that inviting the political leadership “was just a facade”.
It also claimed that the “prolonged solitary confinement in which Imran has been kept comes under the category of torture, as per international human rights standards”.
It recalled that Imran last met his personal physician in November 2024, while meetings with family “have remained suspended for two-and-a-half months”.
It added that under such circumstances, “claiming that he was being given the best of facilities was a mockery of truth”.
The TTAP warned the government “against attempts to suppress the truth, distort facts, and cover up rights violations”.
Imran’s sisters dispute Naqvi’s account
Separately, Imran’s sisters — Aleema, Uzma Khanum and Noreen Niazi — also disputed Naqvi’s account while addressing a press conference in Islamabad.
First to speak among them, Aleema, said the daughter and sister-in-law of Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, had conveyed a message by the former premier after they met the latter at the Adiala jail today.
Aleema said Imran had complained about the condition of his eye and asked for his reports to be shared with his personal physicians, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf.
“Imran Khan has also said that his blood tests should be conducted and that the results be shared with his personal physicians,” Aleema added. “I ask why he is saying so,” she added, without further elaborating on the remark.
She further said that Imran had stated that his vision had been perfect but he began facing problems around three months back. “He said he conveyed to the jail superintendent that he was unable to see, but no one bothered to provide him medical treatment for three weeks.”
Aleema said Imran had also suggested initiating a case of criminal negligence against the jail superintendent.
She maintained that “we had demanded that Imran be moved to Shifa International Hospital, and the government initially agreed to it. But, they suddenly said later that he would be moved to Al Shifa Eye Hospital”.
Moreover, she continued, they had also shared the names with the government of the doctors they wanted to examine Imran. “But we were told that we should change the names, so we changed the names. Later, we suggested that Dr Nosherwan Barki be allowed to meet Imran Khan, but we got the message that it was not possible,” she claimed.
Aleema also claimed that before leaving for a visit to Sri Lanka, Naqvi had given them the guarantee that Imran would be treated at Shifa International Hospital, but the commitment was not fulfilled.
“They (government) said that [Imran’s] sisters will not be allowed to meet him. We accepted it and suggested that doctors should be allowed to meet Imran Khan, but that suggestion was also rejected,” she said.
Aleema went on to say that if Naqvi was not afraid of Imran, he should allow moving the PTI founder to Shifa International.
“They are scared of Imran Khan,” she asserted, urging “all Pakistanis” to raise their voice for the former premier.
Speaking after Aleema, Uzma claimed she had received a “call from the government” and was informed that Imran’s cousin, Qasim Zaman, could be allowed to visit him.
“I replied that Dr Barki and Dr Yusuf should be sent instead,” she said, further claiming that she was told that it was “not acceptable”.
Uzma went on to claim that she was later informed that while Imran’s family would not be allowed access to him, Dr Yusuf could visit him. But, even he was not allowed, she added.
She accused the doctors who had signed Imran’s medical report of “derailing their credibility”, saying that the report neither detailed any diagnosis nor any treatment plan.
Uzma further maintained that “we have received messages from doctors from around the world that the report was not prepared by doctors. That is why we were demanding that at least one doctor of our choice be included in the medical board [for Imran]”.
She also said that “an injection cannot be administered in jail”.
“We do not know what kind of injection was administered to Imran. Was it an injection of poison?” she asked, adding that during her last meeting with Imran, he had expressed the fear that he would be killed in jail.
PTI takes exception to minister’s remarks
Meanwhile, the PTI took exception to Naqvi’s remarks regarding Imran, wherein he said that if the government wanted to harm the former premier it would have done so at the jail.
“Given credible reports of vision loss, this statement is deeply alarming. A senior official openly implying deliberate worsening of custody conditions raises serious concerns about hidden mistreatment,” the party said on X.
“Public threats on national TV make it legitimate to question humane treatment in prolonged solitary confinement without independent medical oversight, family contact or transparency,” the party said.







“Prolonged solitary confinement is internationally recognised as harmful, especially with pre-existing conditions. Combined with deteriorating eyesight and treatment secrecy, the threat to ‘tighten’ conditions becomes far more sinister,” it said.
“This is not mere rhetoric; it concerns actual custodial reality. A state claiming rule of law must prove it through actions, not threats. When power lacks transparency and such insinuations are normalised, the risk of custodial abuse becomes urgent and credible,” it added.</p><small>2026-02-17 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17145141e475855.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973895/rainfall-hail-lashes-parts-of-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Rainfall, hail lashes parts of Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Four people were killed as rainfall, including hail, was reported in several areas of the metropolitan city on Tuesday.
According to officials, multiple vehicle crashes occurred on the M9 motorway due to slippery roads.
Motorways Police Additional Inspector General Munir Ahmad Shaikh told Dawn that six vehicles were involved in the incident as the M9 was slippery near DHA City in Gadap.
He said that due to the slippery road, there was a chain of accidents involving a passenger bus, two trailers, a van, a dumper truck and a Mazda truck.
He said that six injured people were shifted to the hospital. A spokesperson for the Edhi Foundation said that four of the injured succumbed to their injuries during treatment. He added that the bodies were moved to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
Rainfall accompanied by hail was reported in Gulistan-i-Johar, Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Askari IV and other parts of the city.
According to the Met department data till 8pm, the highest amount of rainfall, 20.8 millimetres, was recorded at Jinnah Terminal, while 12mm was recorded in old airport area and 8.5mm was recorded in Nazimabad.
Further, 6.9mm was recorded in Saadi Town, 5.8mm at Met Complex, 5.4mm at Orangi Town while 2.3mm was recorded at North Karachi.
Bahria Town received 2mm of rainfall, while Surjani Town received 1mm.
Earlier in the day, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) in a weather forecast said that “a westerly wave is affecting the central and upper parts of the country”.

 


It predicted partly cloudy weather with “chances of light to moderate intensity rainfall with thunderstorm” on Tuesday, with the maximum temperature expected to remain between 25-27 °C, while the minimum temperature is expected to fall to 18.6 °C.
According to the forecast, Wednesday (February 18) and Thursday (Feb 19) would be “sunny days”.
For the rest of the province, PMD said, “thunderstorm/rain of light to moderate intensity may occur in Dadu, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Jamshoro, Sukkur, Larkana, Kambar Shahdadkot, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Ghotki, Kashmore, Khairpur districts”.
“Gusty/dust-raising winds [are] also likely during the period,” PMD added.</p><small>2026-02-17 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/171943598ce78c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973912/iran-fm-says-agreed-with-us-on-guiding-principles-for-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Iran FM says agreed with US ‘on guiding principles’ for deal</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday the latest talks with the United States saw them agree on “a set of guiding principles” that would pave the way for a deal.
“Ultimately, we were able to reach broad agreement on a set of guiding principles, based on which we will move forward and begin working on the text of a potential agreement,” Araghchi told state TV.
“I can say that, compared with the previous round, fully serious discussions were raised and the atmosphere was more constructive,” he added.
Tehran and Washington held on Tuesday a second round of negotiations — which began earlier this month — after talks last year collapsed following Israel’s attack on Iran in June, which triggered a 12-day war.
That war saw the United States briefly join Israel with strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites.
The latest talks were held after Washington deployed an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East following Iran’s deadly crackdown last month on anti-government protests, first sparked by economic hardships.
During the interview with state TV, Araghchi said the two sides have begun a path towards an agreement, but noted that “this does not mean we can reach a deal quickly”.
“We hope this process can be completed as soon as possible and we are ready to devote sufficient time to it,” he added.
He acknowledged that it “will take time to narrow” the gap between the positions of both sides, “but at least we now have a set of guiding principles and a clearer path to move forward on”.
Khamenei says US ‘will not succeed’ in destroying Iran
Separately, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump would not succeed in destroying the Islamic republic.
“In one of his recent speeches, the US president said that for 47 years America has not succeeded in destroying the Islamic republic … I tell you: you will not succeed either,” Khamenei said in a speech.
During his speech, Khamenei warned that the US warship deployed in the Gulf could be sunk.
“We constantly hear that they have sent a warship towards Iran. A warship is certainly a dangerous weapon, but even more dangerous is the weapon capable of sinking it,” he said.
Khamenei expressed skepticism over the outcome of the negotiations with the US.
“If there are to be negotiations — because there is no real room for negotiation — determining the outcome of the negotiations in advance is a mistake and madness,” he said, referring to US calls for Iran to abandon its nuclear programme.
“The statements of the American president, at times threatening and at times dictating what should and should not be done, reveal a desire to dominate the Iranian nation,” Khamenei said.</p><small>2026-02-17 14:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1718504603ee008.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973913/hrcp-calls-for-judicial-inquiry-into-deaths-resulting-from-operations-by-punjabs-crime-control-department' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP calls for judicial inquiry into deaths resulting from operations by Punjab’s Crime Control Department</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A fact-finding report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has called for an urgent high-level judicial inquiry into deaths resulting from operations conducted by Punjab’s Crime Control Department (CCD), alleging that the department has adopted a “deliberate policy of staged police encounters leading to extrajudicial killings”.
Last year, the Punjab government formally approved the establishment of the CCD to curb organised crime and protect life and property in the province. However, human rights advocates and civil society members have been voicing their concerns about the alleged encounters and the number of casualties.
According to the HRCP, based on press accounts, at least 670 CCD-led encounters were carried out across Punjab over eight months in 2025.
These operations reportedly resulted in the deaths of 924 suspects, while only two police officials were killed during the same timeframe, it said.







The HRCP noted that the sharp disparity in casualties — averaging more than two fatal encounters per day — alongside similar operational patterns reported across districts, pointed to what it described as an “institutionalised practice” rather than isolated incidents of misconduct.
The commission’s findings highlighted the “systematic violations” of domestic law and Pakistan’s international human rights obligations.
It stated that the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act 2022 required the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to investigate every custodial death under the supervision of the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR).
However, the HRCP said there was no evidence that such mandatory procedures were consistently followed in the cases examined. In one instance, the commission said, a court had to direct the FIA to initiate an investigation.
Additionally, the commission said that magisterial inquiries required under Sections 174–176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were not conducted in several cases reviewed.
The commission’s findings also expressed concern that neither the Punjab government nor CCD and police officials responded to its request for meetings during the course of the inquiry, describing the lack of engagement as indicative of institutional reluctance to address serious human rights allegations.
It also documented what it described as a “climate of fear among affected families”.
In one case, the commission said, relatives of the suspect alleged they were pressured by police to bury the deceased immediately and warned of further harm if they pursued legal action. The HRCP termed such actions as criminal intimidation and a direct obstruction of justice.
Citing international standards, the commission stated that CCD operations appeared inconsistent with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, which require that lethal force be used only when necessary and proportionate, and that accountability mechanisms be enforced in cases of misuse.
It observed that CCD press releases and first information reports followed a nearly identical narrative pattern — alleging suspects fired first, police acted in self-defence, and those killed were “hardened criminals” — raising concerns about coordinated messaging rather than independent operational outcomes.
The HRCP emphasised that sustainable public safety cannot be secured through “lethal shortcuts” that bypass investigation, prosecution and judicial oversight.
Among its recommendations, the commission called for an immediate province-wide moratorium on all encounter operations until comprehensive legal safeguards and independent oversight mechanisms are established.
It further urged that all encounter-related deaths be investigated by the FIA under NCHR supervision, the formation of an independent civilian police oversight commission, and mandatory compensation for the families of those killed in such operations.
Last year in October, the HRCP had reported a “sharp and deadly” surge in police encounters across Punjab. It had warned that such practices eroded public trust in legal institutions and set a dangerous precedent for state-sanctioned violence.
However, the Punjab police had filed a report in the Lahore High Court in January, claiming that the establishment of the CCD led to a significant decline in serious crime across the province.
Furthermore, the police had also rebuffed all the claims of fake encounters and extrajudicial killings.</p><small>2026-02-17 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/171548285d7e2cb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973902/pm-reaffirms-pakistans-support-for-iaeas-role-in-promoting-responsible-use-of-nuclear-technology' target='_blank'><strong>PM reaffirms Pakistan’s support for IAEA’s role in promoting responsible use of nuclear technology</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) role in the promotion of responsible use of nuclear technology during an official visit to Vienna.
According to a handout issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Tuesday, PM Shehbaz met IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi at the Vienna International Centre.
“The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for IAEA’s role in the promotion of responsible use of nuclear technology in areas such as cancer diagnosis and treatment, agriculture, nuclear power generation and industrial applications,” the statement said.
“He praised the strong partnership between Pakistan and the IAEA, while observing that Pakistan was not only a beneficiary of the IAEA’s technical cooperation programme but was also contributing to the work of the IAEA through the provision of its experts and conducting international trainings for IAEA member states,” the press release said.
The handout added that the IAEA director general acknowledged Pakistan’s “experience and expertise in the peaceful uses of nuclear technology and the high quality of its engineers, scientists and technicians”.
“Among other things, he appreciated Pakistan’s contribution to the work of the IAEA in the areas of nuclear safety and security,” the statement said.
It said that Grossi further said that Pakistan was “well placed” to help other member states in the “peaceful applications of nuclear technology”.
He also looked forward to Pakistan’s “active participation” in the Nuclear Energy Summit being organised by France in March 2026, the statement said.
Later, an agreement was signed on the designation of the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology (INMOL) in Lahore as an IAEA collaborating centre.
The statement said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who was also present, and Grossi signed the agreement.







In a post on X, Dar said it was “good catching up” with Grossi.
“We discussed the vital role of the IAEA in advancing peaceful uses of nuclear technology and strengthening global nuclear safety and security,” he said.
“Conveyed my best wishes for his continued efforts in promoting peaceful uses of nuclear technology and sustainable development,” he added.







Grossi said in a post on X on Monday night that he was honoured to welcome PM Shehbaz.
“His visit underscored Pakistan’s commitment to the safe and responsible use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes,” he said.
He further said that he was proud to designate INMOL as an IAEA collaborating centre as “we strengthen our cooperation to expand cancer care, radiopharmaceutical production and nuclear medicine services, among others”.







‘Development must be inclusive and equitable’
Later in the day, PM Shehbaz addressed an event titled “Sustainable Development: Pathway for Global Peace and Prosperity”, calling for development to be inclusive and equitable.
The premier called for a renewed global commitment to sustainable and inclusive development.
He maintained that a renewed commitment was the “only viable pathway to durable peace and shared prosperity in a world facing intertwined crises”.
The prime minister said the world stood at a crossroads where geopolitical hostility, climate stress and technological disruption were converging into a single destabilising force.
“The defining danger of our time is not any single threat, but the combination of many,” he said, warning that poverty, debt distress, mass displacement and unresolved political conflicts were intensifying global instability.
The prime minister further emphasised that sustainable development must be inclusive and equitable, leaving no one behind.
“Development cannot be called sustainable if it excludes millions from the promise of a better life,” he added.
Highlighting the “disproportionate burden” borne by developing countries, he said nations contributing least to global emissions were paying the heaviest price in terms of climate change, economic volatility and debt distress.
The prime minister said Pakistan contributed less than one per cent to global emissions but remained among the most vulnerable to climate-induced disasters.
He also recalled the devastating floods of 2022 that claimed over 1,700 lives, destroyed crops and infrastructure, and displaced millions, adding that subsequent floods had compounded the challenges.
“These disasters erode human security at its core,” he said, stressing that sustainable development must be anchored in equity, justice and fair play.
Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the prime minister said the government had integrated them into national development planning, focusing on human development, education, healthcare, food security and social protection, particularly for women and youth.
He said that Pakistan’s large youth population presented both a challenge and an opportunity, underscoring the need for investment in skills, digital transformation and institutional strengthening to harness their potential.
The prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s advocacy for dialogue, diplomacy and multilateralism as the only viable means to resolve disputes and prevent conflict, despite facing aggression and violations of international commitments.
He stressed the need to reinforce and reform the United Nations system to enable it to effectively serve as a pillar of global peace and cooperation.
Highlighting Vienna’s unique role within the UN system, he said the city hosted key institutions dealing with counter-terrorism, crime prevention, industrial development and the peaceful uses of nuclear technology and outer space.
Pakistan, he said, greatly valued its constructive engagement with IAEA, United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and other Vienna-based entities and remained committed to supporting their mandates.
He also underscored the importance of capacity building, knowledge sharing and technology transfer to ensure that emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology benefited all humanity rather than a privileged few.
“Unaddressed digital divides will soon become entrenched development divides,” he warned, urging the international community to address the root causes of global challenges instead of merely managing their consequences.
Later, the prime minister attended a ceremony for the signing of the UNIDO Programme for Country Partnership (PCP) Pakistan 2025–2030, the UNODC Country Programme Pakistan, and a cooperation agreement between the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology Lahore (INMOL) and the IAEA.
Grossi also attended the event, during which he said he had visited different nuclear facilities in Pakistan, including the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Unit, which he said was quite impressive.
He expressed commitment to continue collaboration with Pakistan, which he said will continue and strengthen.</p><small>2026-02-17 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17180419bc5378a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973908/how-gastritis-affects-fasting-during-ramazan-and-what-helps' target='_blank'><strong>How gastritis affects fasting during Ramazan, and what helps</strong></a><br><p>For people living with gastritis or peptic ulcer disease, Ramazan fasting can require extra care. Common causes of this ailment include bacterial infection, smoking, long-term use of painkillers, overeating, and frequent consumption of spicy, fatty, or acidic foods.
Symptoms often include stomach pain, heartburn, bloating, burping, acid reflux, and a burning or aching sensation in the upper abdomen. These symptoms tend to worsen when the stomach remains empty for long hours, making fasting during Ramazan particularly challenging for some individuals.
What to consider during fasting
Whether a person with gastritis or an ulcer can fast during Ramazan depends on the severity of the condition. Skipping meals, especially sehri, can significantly increase stomach acidity and should be avoided.

Sehri should include slow-digesting carbohydrates to help sustain energy and reduce gastric irritation during fasting hours. If appetite is low, light but nourishing foods such as milk, dates, and sufficient water are recommended.

Tea and other caffeinated beverages at sehri should be avoided, as they increase urine output and lead to loss of essential mineral salts, potentially worsening dehydration and acidity.
Breaking the fast gently
Breaking the fast gently helps prevent a sudden surge in stomach acid. Dates and water are commonly used to break the fast and are generally well tolerated. Soups or mild fruit-based drinks can also help ease digestion.
Meals at Iftar should be balanced and moderate, including carbohydrates, protein, fruits, and vegetables. Fried, spicy, salty, and sugary foods should be avoided, as they can aggravate gastritis symptoms and cause discomfort.
Things to avoid
Fasting can increase stomach acidity, making certain foods especially problematic for people with gastritis. These include fried, greasy, and fatty foods, spicy and acidic foods, and citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruits.
Moreover, processed and canned foods, particularly tomato-based products, foods high in sugar and refined carbohydrates, can cause significant discomfort.
Smoking is strongly linked to gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, and Ramazan offers an opportunity to quit and reduce further irritation to the stomach lining.
Foods that are better tolerated
Some foods like dates and bananas are gentler on the stomach and may help reduce discomfort, as they are easy to digest, rich in potassium and provide energy along with fibre and minerals. Furthermore, almonds can be a good source of protein.
Oven-grilled or baked foods instead of fried items should also be taken into account. Eating smaller portions and avoiding overeating at both sehri and iftar are key to keeping symptoms under control.
Importance of hydration and medication
Adequate hydration between Iftar and nighttime is important to help the body regulate fluid levels during the next fasting day.
Water and non-acidic drinks are preferable. Prescribed medications for gastritis or ulcers should be taken as advised by a physician, usually at sehri.
Observing Ramazan with comfort
While fasting is obligatory for Muslims during Ramazan, those with gastritis or peptic ulcers must be especially mindful of their eating habits.
A diet that is mild, balanced, and low in spice, fat, and acidity, combined with moderation, hydration, and proper meal timing, can help ease symptoms and allow the holy month to be observed with greater comfort and care.

In a statement, the FO said that the meeting will be chaired by the United Kingdom’s foreign secretary as president of the UNSC.







The statement said that during the briefing, Dar will reaffirm Pakistan’s “principled and consistent position on Palestine”.
“He will reiterate Pakistan’s strong opposition of Israel’s recent illegal decisions to expand its control over the West Bank, emphasise the need for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, full implementation of Security Council resolution 2803, scaled-up humanitarian assistance, and the early commencement of Gaza’s recovery and reconstruction,” the statement said.
“The deputy prime minister will also underscore Pakistan’s continued engagement with international and regional partners, including the group of eight Arab and Islamic countries and the United States, in support of a just and lasting peace, anchored in international law, leading to the realisation of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent, sovereign and contiguous Palestinian State based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” the statement added.
Separately, on the margins of the visit, Dar will hold bilateral meetings with counterparts to discuss matters of mutual interest, it concluded.
The development comes as the foreign ministers of eight Muslim nations, including Pakistan, condemned the Israeli move to claim land in the occupied West Bank as “state property”.
It should be mentioned that the same eight countries had worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan last year to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza.
On Monday, Pakistan had released a separate statement condemning the Israeli move, calling on the international community to reject its actions.</p><small>2026-02-17 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/171744038e4842f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973907/australia-ireland-out-of-t20-world-cup-as-zimbabwe-qualify-after-washout' target='_blank'><strong>Australia, Ireland out of T20 World Cup as Zimbabwe qualify after washout</strong></a><br><p>The 2021 champions Australia were knocked out of the T20 World Cup on Tuesday, with Zimbabwe qualifying for the Super Eights after their match against Ireland was washed out without a ball being bowled in Kandy.
Zimbabwe joined Sri Lanka as qualifiers from Group B and will move on to face the West Indies, India and South Africa in the next phase. Ireland were also eliminated.
Persistent drizzle all day at the Pallekelle stadium kept the covers on and the umpires finally called it off at 5:30pm local time (1200 GMT) with no prospect of beginning the minimum five-over match before the 6:10pm cut-off time.
Australia, who had been beaten by Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, needed an Ireland victory to keep their hopes alive.
Zimbabwe are now on an unassailable five points with a game to still to come, while Ireland are third on three points.
Australia, on two points, have one game remaining against Oman on Friday, but cannot overtake Zimbabwe.
Australia had a shambolic build-up to the tournament They lost leading pace bowlers Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood to injury, while captain Mitchell Marsh missed the first two games after being hit in the groin in training and suffering testicular bleeding.
Test great Steve Smith was left out despite being in terrific form top of the order in the Big Bash League and his expertise in playing against spin bowling.
He flew in as cover last week and was formally added to the Australia squad at the weekend.
But then he was left out for the must-win game against Sri Lanka on Monday which saw an Australia middle-order collapse as they lost by eight wickets.
Zimbabwe captain Skiander Raza hailed his side’s achievement in reaching the last eight, but warned there were tougher battles to come.
“We have come this far. We will celebrate but we have a game against Sri Lanka to come,” said Raza.
“This is only a tick in the box and this is not the only thing that we set out for. Everyone loves an underdog story.”
Ireland skipper Lorcan Tucker was downcast after his side did not get to play.
“Obviously very disappointed to go out in this fashion, but completely uncontrollable,” said Tucker.
“Our batting failed. There were big moments in the tournament, particularly against Sri Lanka, when we dropped so many catches.
“Hopefully, we will handle these tough situations differently moving forward.”</p><small>2026-02-17 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/171509399c03080.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973896/8-muslim-nations-including-pakistan-condemn-israeli-move-to-claim-west-bank-land-as-state-property' target='_blank'><strong>8 Muslim nations, including Pakistan, condemn Israeli move to claim West Bank land as ‘state property’</strong></a><br><p>Eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, on Tuesday condemned the Israeli move to claim land in the occupied West Bank as “state property”, saying that the step reflected an attempt to “impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land”.
Al Jazeera reported on Sunday that the Israeli government had approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property”, for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of international law that states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
Israel’s foreign ministry claimed the measure, approved late on Sunday, would enable “transparent and thorough clarification of rights to resolve legal disputes” but the move drew strong condemnations from across the globe for its violation of international law.
In a joint statement issued on Tuesday, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar strongly condemned the Israeli move.







“This illegal step constitutes a grave escalation aimed at accelerating illegal settlement activity, land confiscation, entrenching Israeli control, and applying unlawful Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and undermining the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” the joint statement said.
“The ministers affirm that these measures represent a flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as a violation of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, foremost among them Resolution 2334,” they said.
“The decision also contradicts the advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice concerning the legal consequences arising from Israeli policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which underscored the illegality of measures intended to alter the legal, historical, and demographic status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the obligation to end the occupation, and the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force,” the joint statement added.
The ministers added that this step reflected an attempt to “impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land, thereby undermining the two-state solution, eroding the prospects for the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian State, and jeopardising the attainment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region”.
It should be mentioned that the same eight countries had worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza.
On Monday, Pakistan had released a separate statement condemning the Israeli move, calling on the international community to reject its actions.
Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said this new measure was destabilising and unlawful, according to a statement by his spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan had also separately criticised the move as illegal while the European Union had called on Tel Aviv to reverse the move.
The Ramallah-based Palest­inian Authority called for inte­r­national intervention to prevent the “de facto beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state”.</p><small>2026-02-17 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17173202cb3028e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973903/pakistani-repatriated-from-india-via-wagah-border-after-spending-17-years-in-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani repatriated from India via Wagah border after spending 17 years in jail</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A Pakistani national was repatriated to his home country from India on Tuesday after spending 17 years in jail on charges of spying.
“Muhammad Shahid Iqbal Bhatti, a Pakistani citizen imprisoned in India, was repatriated to Pakistan via the Wagah-Attari border today,” Pakistan’s High Commission in India said in a post on X.







Separately, an official told Dawn that Bhatti was a resident of Kasur and was handed a 17-year sentence by an Indian court after he was accused of spying for Pakistan.
Quoting Indian media reports, he said Bhatti was arrested in August 2008 by police in Indian Punjab. While in custody, he was interrogated for living in India allegedly without legal documents, the official said, adding that the then-chief manager of the State Bank of India had filed a complaint against him in November 2008.
“Subsequently, Bhatti was sentenced by a court and sent to jail on charges of spying. He spent nearly 17 years of his life in prison,” the official said.
He further said that as Bhatti’s prison term completed, Pakistani and Indian authorities held correspondence for his repatriation. “After the completion of legal formalities, he was escorted to the Wagah border, where he was handed over to Pakistani officials on Tuesday.”
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s High Commission in India expressed its resolve to “continue to work towards the release and repatriation of all Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails”.
Bhatti’s repatriation follows that of another three Pakistani prisoners from India in late November 2025.
Among them, a man identified as Ramzan was arrested in 2010 by India on charges of illegally crossing the border and possessing narcotics. After receiving consular access, his status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in February 2011.
Meanwhile, Muhammad Idrees from Narowal was arrested in 1995 for allegedly crossing the border illegally and was awarded 16 years of imprisonment. He was verified as a Pakistani national in 2005, 10 years after his arrest.
Asghar Ali from Sadiqabad was arrested for allegedly crossing the border illegally in 2002. His status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in 2006.</p><small>2026-02-17 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17113355bb41234.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973877/bears-dominate-as-kse-100-loses-over-1300-points-on-tuesday' target='_blank'><strong>Bears dominate as KSE-100 loses over 1,300 points on Tuesday</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, closed in the red on Tuesday, down 1303.52 points from its previous close of 174,453.93 points.

This result was higher than expectations due to higher-than-expected gross margins. MTL ended the day in green, up 3.32pc to Rs548.91.
The brokerage house also noted that Pakistan State Oil Company (PSO) announced its 2QFY26 results on Tuesday, reporting an unconsolidated profit of Rs2.7 billion.

Today’s market result follows a turbulent trading session on Monday, when the index lost over 5,000 points or 2.87pc, which analysts at Topline Securities noted was driven by foreign outflows and escalating political noise that further dampened investor confidence, intensifying the bearish momentum.</p><small>2026-02-17 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/171528375e19534.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973899/usman-tariq-confident-pakistan-can-bounce-back-after-india-drubbing-in-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Usman Tariq confident Pakistan can bounce back after India drubbing in T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Spinner Usman Tariq said on Tuesday he was confident that Pakistan can bounce back from their T20 World Cup drubbing against India and seal qualification for the next round.
India’s 61-run romp means Pakistan must beat Namibia in their final match in Colombo on Wednesday to qualify for the Super Eights.
A defeat would eliminate Pakistan, who are third behind the USA on net run rate in Group A.
It would also leave an outside chance for the Netherlands to qualify, but they would need a big win over co-hosts India in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.
“Lifting the team is only difficult when you don’t work on your mistakes committed in the last game,” Tariq told reporters.
“We have worked on our mistakes, so I think it will not be a tough task. “We have a resolve not to commit the same mistakes again.”
Pakistan were criticised for asking India to bat then folding meekly for 114 in 18 overs chasing a stiff 176 target.

 

“We can feel their (fans’) disappointment because the match is watched by the whole nation,” Tariq said.
“So we feel their pain, but I am sure when we play them (India) next, we will put up a better show.”
Tariq dismissed rumours that batting star Babar Azam and pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi could be dropped against Namibia after poor performances against India.

 

“Both Azam and Shaheen have won many matches for Pakistan, so if they did not perform well in one game, we should not write them off,” said Tariq.
Pakistan have faced Namibia only once before in a T20 international.
“Whoever we play, we have the confidence to beat them, and our goal is to play the final and win the cup, which we will try our best to achieve.”
Namibia have lost all three of their group matches.</p><small>2026-02-17 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17131755b923211.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973888/ssgc-assures-uninterrupted-gas-supply-in-karachi-during-sehr-iftar' target='_blank'><strong>SSGC assures ‘uninterrupted’ gas supply in Karachi during Sehr, Iftar</strong></a><br><p>
KARACHI: The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) has issued a gas supply schedule for Karachi and the surrounding areas for the holy month of Ramazan.
The announcement by the utility said that gas would be available from 3am to 9am for Sehr and from 3:30pm to 10:00pm for Iftar, with the supply expected to be suspended outside these hours to manage overall demand.
“To ensure improved gas pressure, SSGC would be carrying out gas pressure profiling from 9am to 3:30pm,” it said, “and then during nighttime from 10pm to 3am during Ramazan,” said the utility.
The SSGC added that “an approximate 10 percent annual decline in the country’s gas reserves has widened the gap between gas demand and supply”.
The announcement said that timings had been worked out for providing convenience to people for food preparations for Sehr and Iftar.
SNGPL proposes supply from 3am to 10:30pm
The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) has also proposed providing gas from 3am to 10:30pm daily during the upcoming holy month across Punjab.
“We have recommended an uninterrupted gas supply in Punjab from 3am to 10.30pm daily throughout Ramzan,” SNGPL Managing Director Amir Tufail told Dawn.
“However, the final approval will be given by the petroleum division,” he added.
To a question about whether or not the supply would be for cooking hours alone, he said the company will make efforts to ensure supply from 3am to 10.30pm daily during the month of Ramazan.</p><small>2026-02-17 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/171321063dba3de.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973886/11-security-personnel-martyred-in-terrorist-attack-on-checkpost-in-bajaur-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>11 security personnel martyred in terrorist attack on checkpost in Bajaur: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A terrorist attack, involving an explosive-laden vehicle, on a checkpost in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On February 16, a cowardly terrorist attack was attempted on security forces and law enforcement agencies’ joint check Post in Bajaur District by Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The statement added that 12 terrorists were eliminated after security forces retaliated and “engaged the fleeing khwarij with precision”.
“In their desperation, the attackers rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. Due to the blast impact infrastructure at check post collapsed resultantly eleven brave sons of soil, rendered the ultimate sacrifice and [embracing] martyrdom.”
ISPR elaborated that the blast affected residential buildings in the area as well, “leading to the martyrdom of one innocent young girl”.
Another seven people were injured, including women and children, the ISPR said.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as a relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement added.
“The sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further reinforce our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs,” the statement concluded.
President, PM condemn attack
President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack and extended condolences to the families of martyrs, according to a statement issued via PPP’s media cell.
“The sacrifice made by the martyrs for the country’s defence further strengthens our resolve,” the president was quoted as saying.
He vowed that the complete elimination of terrorists operating in the country with external support remained the state’s “topmost priority.”







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed sorrow at the loss of lives and condemned the attack in the “strongest terms,” state broadcaster PTV reported.
He extended condolences to the families of the martyrs and prayed for the recovery of the injured, PTV said.
“The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in this war against terrorism,” the premier was quoted as saying.
He said the country remained determined to “root out terrorism from the country”.
Noting the elimination of 12 terrorists, the prime minister lauded the security forces for their “timely action”.
“Under the vision of Azm e Istehkam, security forces are gaining major success in the fight against terrorism,” the premier said.







The attack comes days after an additional station house officer was martyred as terrorists attacked a police station in the War Mamund tehsil of Bajaur district.
In December 2025, a major-ranked officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the district.
KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.</p><small>2026-02-17 09:25</small></div><hr>
