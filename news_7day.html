Officers were called to the incident at the mosque in the south coast town of Peacehaven late on Saturday.
No one was injured, but the blaze caused damage to the mosque’s front entrance and a vehicle parked outside.
According to a statement from Sussex Police, emergency services were called to the fire at the building in Phyllis Avenue at about 9.50pm UK time on Saturday (1:50am PKT, Sunday).
“This is a fast-moving investigation, and we are urging anyone with relevant information to report it to us. This includes anyone with CCTV, Ring Doorbell, dashcam, and mobile phone footage in the area at the time,” Sussex Police Detective Superintendent Karrie Bohanna said in the statement.
“We understand the concerns this has caused within the community, and the impact that will be felt by the Muslim community as a result.
“There is already an increased police presence at the scene, and there are also additional patrols taking place to provide reassurance at other places of worship across the county.”
Bohanna added that the Sussex Police had a “zero-tolerance approach to hate crime”, adding there was no place for hate across the county.
A volunteer working at the mosque, who chose not to be named, told the BBC that “two people tried to enter through the front door, only to find it locked.”
“They then poured a liquid at the entrance and near a car parked outside, which was set alight. It could have been murder,” the man said.
He added that two people inside the mosque managed to escape, per the report.
The fire follows Thursday’s attack on a synagogue in northern Manchester in which two people died and three others were seriously injured.
British police later they accidentally shot a victim, as well as one of the survivors, as they attempted to stop an attacker who appeared to be wearing an explosive belt.
The attacker, shot dead by officers at the scene, was not carrying a firearm, said Greater Manchester Police chief constable Steve Watson, though one of those killed suffered a gunshot wound.</p><small>2025-10-05 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0515143367c30e8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946768/pakistan-opt-to-field-in-womens-world-cup-clash-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan opt to field in Women’s World Cup clash with India</strong></a><br><p>

Over 8 — India 45/0
Mandhana survives an lbw appeal as the review shows that the ball was pitching outside leg, she has finally found her touch after hitting Diana for two boundaries in the over.

Over 7 — India 36/0
There was a stoppage in play due to Fatima feeling a bit of discomfort in her ankle. She had been struck on the knee in the previous series against South Africa but it doesn’t seem anything serious. Fatima ends the over well, just runs off it as the Indian opener Mandhana struggles for runs.
The crowd is slowly building up at the R Pramedasa Stadium, with Indian fans outnumbering the Pakistani ones so far.

Over 6 — India 34/0
Diana follows up a good over by the skipper with a decent one of her own. Just one run came off that over as the Green Shirts put the brakes on a good Indian start in the earlier part of the powerplay. The Pakistani pacers have good their lengths now and are inducing false strokes from the Indian batters.

Over 5 — India 33/0
Skipper Fatima ends a good over to stem the flow of runs. India get just three off her over as the Pakistani pacers are finally finding their lines and lengths.

Over 4 — India 29/0
Diana returns with a better over to the Indian openers, beating them and inducing false strokes in the first five balls, but Mandhana ends it with a boundary to build further on India’s decent start.

Over 3 — India 25/0
Pakistan skipper Fatima Sana is into the attack, and is welcomed with a boundary by the Indian opener Rawal. India are off to a quick start as the pitch seems to be a true surface for batting.

Over 2 — India 20/0
Pakistan’s inform pacer from the first match, Diana Baig, starts off with an expensive over as Indian opener Pratika Rawal hits her for three back-to-back boundaries.

Over 1 — India 8/0
Sadia Iqbal has started the bowling effort for Pakistan. Weather conditions are overcast, and the new ball can move around in the air as a result. India end the over with their first boundary as the in-form Smriti Mandhana gets off the mark in style.

Pakistan have opted to bowl first, with Sadiq Iqbal opening for the Green Shirts as they face India in the cricket field yet again on Sunday, this time in the Women’s World Cup 2025.
While India is hosting this year’s tournament, Pakistan will play all their matches of the 50-over World Cup in Sri Lanka under a hybrid model decided in November after India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy.
 






Fatima Sana is leading the Green Team, while Harmanpreet Kaur is captaining the Women in Blue. The game will begin at 2:30pm PKT at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.
As of 2pm (Sri Lanka time), ESPNcricinfo reported that the weather was “dry, although there are dark clouds hovering over the stadium”.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) had said “fans have free entry to all” the World Cup matches being played in Colombo.
 
 

As the rivals meet for a fourth consecutive Sunday on the cricket field, tensions from the recent men’s Asia Cup may spill into the ongoing event as well.
Ahead of all the chatter on the issue of handshakes in Asia Cup, Sana made it clear that her side’s focus was solely on cricket.
Earlier this week, a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official said there was “no assurance” that India and Pakistan players would shake hands during their fixtures.
The semi-finals are scheduled for October 29 and 30, before the final takes place on November 2.</p><small>2025-10-05 10:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05134854a270b1a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946766/taking-our-cover-to-settle-own-issues-with-pm-sharjeel-memon-accuses-punjab-govt-of-conspiring-against-centre' target='_blank'><strong>‘Taking our cover to settle own issues with PM’: Sharjeel Memon accuses Punjab govt of conspiring against Centre</strong></a><br><p>The latest accusation in the ongoing rift between the PPP and PML-N came from Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon on Sunday when he alleged that the Punjab government was taking his party’s cover to “target” the federal government.
Memon’s PPP and the PML-N, who are coalition partners in the Centre, have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government.
As the row continues between the two sides, Memon alleged while addressing a press conference in Karachi that on the face of it, the Punjab government was “indirectly targeting” the PPP, but their “actual target is the federal government”.
“They are taking our cover to settle their own issues with the prime minister or the federal government. Or they are trying to create an environment to [compel] us not to support the federal government, which would create problems for the federal government,” he claimed.
Clarifying that the PPP was supporting the federal government on specific issues and to keep the country’s “political system running”, he asserted that the circumstances that the Punjab government tried to create spoke of their intentions of creating a rift between the allies in the Centre.
“But we will not let this conspiracy of the Punjab government against the federal government succeed,” Memon asserted.
“I do not know why they have these jealousy factors,” he quipped, highlighting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army chief’s recent “successful” visits to Saudi Arabia and the United States. “A person thinks that ‘maybe this should have come in my share, why is it going to the prime minister’.”
The PPP leader further said that while the chief ministers of Sindh and Balochistan usually receive the premier whenever he visits the provinces, “his own Punjab administration neither receives him nor gives him any protocol”.
“If you have any issues with the prime minister, please keep them among yourselves. Do not bring the PPP into it,” Memon said.
Regardless, the Sindh minister said, the focus at the moment should be on providing relief to the flood-hit people. “Even if you had blacked out the news from some places, but if you look on the ground […] especially in southern Punjab, the condition of the people is very bad.”
Memon went on to allege that the Punjab government “staged another drama to divert from this entire matter, which is extremely unfortunate, damaging, and I think it was handled in a very childish manner”.
He recalled that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had asked the Centre to issue an appeal for international assistance and that his party had demanded that immediate flood relief be provided through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
He pointed out that the appeal was towards the federal government but it was the Punjab government that was reacting negatively to them, while the Centre “even gave reassurances”.

On Friday, Hamas said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan — which was announced on Monday after a meeting between the US president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and seek further negotiations. While the Trump administration worked with eight Muslim countries last month to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end, reservations have been expressed from that latter’s side that the plan unveiled by the White House was not the one originally agreed upon.
Nevertheless, they see Hamas’s partial agreement to the plan as an opportunity for a ceasefire in Gaza after an onslaught of around two years.
 
 

“The Foreign Ministers of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Republic of Turkiye, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Qatar and the Arab Republic of Egypt, today welcomed the steps taken by Hamas regarding US President Donald Trump’s proposal to end the war on Gaza, release all hostages, alive or deceased, and the immediate launch of negotiations on implementation mechanisms,” a FO statement said.
The foreign ministers also welcomed Trump’s call on Israel to immediately stop the bombing in Gaza and begin implementation of the prisoner-hostage exchange agreement, it added.
“They expressed appreciation for his commitment to establishing peace in the region. They also affirmed that such developments represent a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire, and to address the critical humanitarian conditions facing people in Gaza Strip,” the FO statement read.
According to the FO, the foreign ministers also welcomed the announcement by Hamas of its “readiness to hand over the administration of Gaza to a transitional Palestinian Administrative Committee of independent technocrats”.
They also emphasised the need for the immediate launch of negotiations to agree on mechanisms to implement the proposal and address all of its aspects.
“The foreign ministers reiterated their joint commitment to support efforts towards the implementation of the proposal to work for the immediate end of the war in Gaza and achieve a comprehensive agreement that ensures unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of the Palestinian people, that no measures are taken that threaten the security and safety of civilians, the release of hostages, the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank, reaching a security mechanism that guarantees the security of all sides in a manner that leads to the full Israeli withdrawal […] the rebuilding of Gaza and that […] a path [is created] for just peace on basis of the two-state solution,” the statement said.

Leo, the first US pope, told thousands of pilgrims celebrating Mass in St. Peter’s Square that immigrants should not be treated with “the coldness of indifference or the stigma of discrimination”.
The pope, who did not single out any country for its treatment of migrants, called on Catholics to “open our arms and hearts to them, welcoming them as brothers and sisters, and being for them a presence of consolation and hope.”
Pope talks of ‘new missionary age’
Leo had criticised the Trump administration’s immigration policies on September 30, questioning whether they were in line with the Catholic Church’s pro-life teachings, in comments that drew heated backlash from some prominent conservative Catholics.
On Sunday, the pope said the global Church was experiencing “a new missionary age” in which it was tasked with offering “hospitality and welcome, compassion and solidarity” to migrants fleeing violence or searching for a safe place to live.
“In the communities of ancient Christian tradition, such as those of the West, the presence of many brothers and sisters from the world’s South should be welcomed as an opportunity, through an exchange that renews the face of the Church,” he said.
Elected in May to replace the late Pope Francis, Leo has shown a much more reserved style than his predecessor, who frequently criticised the Trump administration and often spoke in surprise, off-the-cuff remarks.
Leo spoke on Sunday from a prepared text. He was addressing a weekend event during the Catholic Church’s ongoing holy year that was specially organised for migrants, which the Vatican said had attracted more than 10,000 pilgrims from some 95 countries.</p><small>2025-10-05 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05140554390a921.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946767/boy-hospitalised-in-thailand-after-attack-by-escaped-lion' target='_blank'><strong>Boy hospitalised in Thailand after attack by escaped lion</strong></a><br><p>A lion kept at a private home in Thailand got loose and attacked a young boy, leaving him in hospital, the wildlife department said Sunday.
The lion attacked the child, who was hospitalised with unspecified injuries, while he was walking on a public road Saturday night in western Kanchanaburi province, about a two-hour drive from the capital Bangkok, the department said in a statement.
Local media said the boy was on his way home from playing with other children when the big cat pounced on him.
Lion ownership is legal in Thailand, where the captive population has exploded in recent years, with nearly 500 registered in zoos, breeding farms, petting cafes and homes.
But experts have warned the trend endangers animals and humans, and likely fuels illicit trade domestically and abroad.
The lion’s owner, who the wildlife department identified only as Parinya, was charged with violating wildlife protection laws and faces up to six months in prison and a 50,000 baht ($1,500) fine if convicted.
The lion was seized by authorities, the department said, adding that a wildlife breeding centre had prepared a new home for it.
Parinya told local TV he was “shocked” when he learned of the attack, saying the female lion got loose after it was removed from its cage while it was being renovated.
“I apologise for what happened, it was an accident,” he said, adding that he will pay compensation and for the boy’s medical treatment.
In its statement, the wildlife department urged people who “keep wild animals to be aware of the potential dangers, as all animals have a ferocious instinct”.
“Any unforeseen incident that affects the life and property of others will be punished and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” it added.
Since 2022, Thai law has required owners to register and microchip lions, and inform authorities before moving them, but there are few enclosure or welfare requirements.
Last month, a zookeeper was mauled to death by several lions at a safari park on the outskirts of Bangkok, raising scrutiny of the facility, which offers lion- and tiger-feeding trips for about $40 per person.</p><small>2025-10-05 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05130439e250ba1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946764/first-of-3-supermoons-to-be-seen-on-tuesday-night-suparco' target='_blank'><strong>First of 3 supermoons to be seen on Tuesday night: Suparco</strong></a><br><p>A supermoon will be visible in the night sky late Tuesday evening (Oct 7), the first of three supermoons set to occur in 2025, according to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco).
A supermoon occurs when the moon reaches its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, causing it to appear unusually large and bright — up to 14 per cent larger and nearly 30pc brighter than a typical full moon.
According to an official statement by a Suparco spokesperson, the first supermoon will occur at 8:47pm PKT on Tuesday, rising in the east just after sunset and setting in the west just before dawn.
“This year, the October 7 supermoon will be at a distance of 224,599 miles (about 361,457 kilometres) from Earth, making it 6.6pc larger and 13pc brighter than an average full moon,” the statement said.
This supermoon will appear close to the planet Saturn, which can be spotted west of the Moon on Monday and Tuesday evening.
It added that the brightest supermoon of the year is expected to occur in November, when the moon will be 221,817 miles (about 356,980 km) away.
The phenomenon will be visible not just in Pakistan but across the globe, offering a “breathtaking sight” in the night sky. Following this, two more supermoons will be visible on November 5 and December 5.
In September, a rare blood moon — a total lunar eclipse — eluded Karachi stargazers as heavy cloud cover blocked the view.
In August of 2023, a once-in-a-decade “super blue Moon” lit up the sky, with “blue” simply referring to a full moon seen twice in the same month.</p><small>2025-10-05 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0510251864fb375.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946655/pakistan-india-meet-again-this-time-at-womens-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India meet again, this time at Women’s World Cup</strong></a><br><p>COLOMBO: It’s the fourth consecutive Sunday of a Pakistan-India cricket encounter; the only difference being that the hot and arid climate of Dubai has been replaced with the humid and rainy weather of Colombo, and of course, the gender of the players on the field.
However, the differences are starker once a person starts to peel back the surface of the women’s game in both countries.
On one hand, we have players from across the border who have opportunities like the Women’s Premier League available, where compensation reaches upwards of $400,000 for the highest-paid players.
On the other hand, barring a few players in the national side and those who make it to final rosters of a handful of cricket leagues worldwide — Pakistani domestic women cricketers’ monthly retainers were even less than the government-mandated minimum wage this year.
To say that the gulf in resources available to both teams is large would be an understatement of the century.
 






Furthermore, in yet another familiar scenario at the start of an ICC tournament, the Indian team is going into the encounter with a win against co-hosts Sri Lanka, while Pakistan have lost to Bangladesh in their opening encounter — a side they had beaten with ease in the Qualifiers in April.
However, the Pakistan skipper was at her usual jovial best at the pre-match press conference on Saturday, seemingly putting last match’s result behind her.
Ahead of all the chatter on the issue of handshakes in men’s Asia Cup encounters from last month, she made it clear that her side’s focus was solely on cricket.
“Obviously, our main goal is to play, and when we come here, our focus is only on the game … whatever comes in the spirit of the game, we try to maintain that,” Fatima said.
 






She also touched upon moments of camaraderie between the two sides, like the last World Cup encounter in New Zealand, where Indian players had playfully interacted with Bismah Maroof’s newborn baby, Fatima.
The Indian skipper, Kaur, however, could not give her take as the Indian management chose to send the bowling coach Aavishkar Salvi to the pre-match presser.
When asked about the bitterness from the men’s encounters disrupting the relationships of the players here as well, Salvi never got the chance to answer as the question was deemed too political for the presser.
Pakistan’s chances of making it to the next stage might have been further hampered by Saturday’s result in Colombo, where a rained-out fixture meant both Sri Lanka and Australia shared a point each.
 
 

This would make Fatima’s aim of finishing in the top four more difficult, as the extra point that Sri Lanka got in this match could be the difference between making the cut or not.
The square, which has remained under the covers throughout the day with rain pouring down means both sides’ pacers will be rearing to go early in the innings.
Bowlers to look out for would be Pakistan’s Diana Baig, who goes into the encounter with decent bowling rhythm, and Indian off-spinner Sneh Rana who is the second-highest wicket-taker in ODIs this year.
“Everyone knows that she’s one of our best players. She’s a good bowler and also a very good fielder. So it definitely boosts our team as well,” Fatima said of Diana’s encouraging performance in the opening encounter.
Echoing her remarks after the Bangladesh loss, Fatima said the toss or conditions would not be that important as the pitch remained the same for both sides throughout.
“The pitch doesn’t matter much; all we have to do is play good cricket after assessing the conditions.”
With rain predicted for Sunday as well, there is a glimmer of hope for the Green Shirts as a washed-out encounter or one curtailed by the downpour could tip the odds in their favour.
Their record against India across 11 One-day Internationals is an unenviable one — never once winning a tie, but across T20Is, there is still a better record to boast about.
The women’s side have beaten India on three occasions in the format — with their first win in a World Cup coming back in 2012 — nine years before the men’s side achieved that feat.
Speaking about the ODI record, the Pakistani skipper said: “Records are meant to be broken, we won’t go on past histories, but will take the match on the day and try to execute our plans.”
Fatima and co. would have to channel their best in the field to add another win to that tally — and maybe the rain clouds in the Sri Lankan capital might have a silver lining for the Women in Green.

The Pakistan-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) is emblematic of changing geostrategic dynamics and shifting alignments that are reshaping the regional landscape, and can contribute to the emergence of a new security architecture in the Middle East.
It has been forged in the backdrop of unprecedented volatility and violence in the region, with Israel’s two-year genocidal war having claimed over 65,000 Palestinian lives and wrought massive devastation and an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.
Israel’s attack on Qatar [on September 9] shook the entire region. It was the sixth country to face Israeli military aggression but the first Gulf state, and also a non-Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) ally of the US. This intensified growing doubts about the value and reliability of the American defence umbrella with the US unable or unwilling to restrain an unbound Israel.
 
 

The SMDA is a consequence of the eroding trust of regional states in an unpredictable US, whose blind support for Israel has heightened the security threat they face. Negotiations for the security agreement took place months before the strike on Qatar.
But the timing of its signing suggests the attack on Qatar and Israel’s unchecked aggression hastened its finalisation, with Riyadh seeking to diversify its security partnerships and Pakistan expanding its options. Under the deal, both countries would consider an attack on one as “an aggression against both.”
Details of the pact are not yet public, but it could shift the regional balance of power. It reflects a hedging strategy by Riyadh in turning to Pakistan for “joint deterrence against any aggression.” There has been much discussion about whether this has a nuclear dimension and involves extended deterrence. Pakistan has preferred to maintain strategic ambiguity, to give itself flexibility. Saudi officials, however, are cited as saying, “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.”

Eos asked six foreign policy experts for their initial assessments of the recent Pak-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) and Pakistan’s potential role in US President Donald Trump’s proposed plan for Gaza. Their analyses of these developments are presented below…

While the deal may bring Pakistan much-needed financial assistance to help its fragile economy, there are also real risks for Islamabad. The pact injects Pakistan into a volatile region and may involve commitments that may be difficult to fulfil if it is expected to become a net security provider to the region. These risks have to be mitigated if Pakistan is to avoid overextending itself, given its own internal and external security challenges.
Other risks and challenges may also emerge if Pakistan is asked by Washington to be part of a mostly Muslim multinational security force envisaged for Gaza under US President Donald Trump’s ‘peace plan.’ Trump shared his Gaza proposals with Pakistan and seven other Muslim countries in a meeting in New York, but what was announced was different from what was agreed between them. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had intervened to change many elements of the plan.
 
 

The announced plan is vague and has no timeline on withdrawal. It has no guarantee of a complete Israel pullout from Gaza. It also doesn’t guarantee a permanent ceasefire. It says nothing about a Palestinian state or two-state solution and only talks vaguely about a pathway to statehood after the Palestinian Authority has carried out major reforms. It seeks to install a transitional authority headed by Trump and including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. This has already provoked controversy and been likened to Iraqi-style direct occupation.
Without a deal between Israel and Hamas, the plan can’t take off. The plan has also been framed without consulting the Palestinians. It advantages Israel, which is why many Palestinians see it as a document of surrender. And it is why Netanyahu said at the joint press conference that Israel’s war aims are achieved by the plan: for Hamas to be disarmed, Gaza demilitarised and no future Palestinian state to be established.
 
 

Despite the cautious welcome the plan has received from across the world, doubts are intensifying whether it will lead to an agreement, be implementable and usher in lasting peace. In view of these uncertainties and the plan’s fundamental flaws, Pakistan must exercise caution and not rush in to offer troops for the stabilisation force without being sure it doesn’t get dragged into Middle East turmoil, or become an unwitting accessory to Israeli occupation of Palestine.

The tragic truth is that the Trump plan reflects raw US power calculus. It seeks to bury the Palestinians’ rightful struggle for their stolen homeland.

The timing of the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) is important, as it was signed in the context of escalating Israeli aggression, with the most recent attack on Qatar, the sixth Muslim-majority nation to fall victim to Israel’s targeted strikes. The US has failed to protect its Muslim allies in the Gulf, although it has military bases in the area — as also evidenced by the 2019 Saudi oil facility attack.
Pakistan’s ability to successfully defend itself and defeat Indian aggression in May 2025 has enhanced its regional image and military credibility. The agreement is a continuation of Pakistan’s history of providing security assistance, including the combat missions of Pakistan Air Force in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and the security services provided during the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar. 
The SMDA is of much significance as it is the first defence pact between two brotherly Muslim countries. Therefore, it is a “plus” for Pakistan’s key role in Middle East security. It sees Pakistan return to the Middle East as a net security provider after almost five decades. The formalisation of the SMDA can be attributed to primarily two decision-makers: Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This historic defence agreement recalls the close camaraderie between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia since the Lahore Islamic Summit of 1974, which Saudi Arabia and Pakistan jointly hosted. 
 
 

The agreement has been welcomed all over the Muslim world, Egypt and Iran included, as a demonstration of Islamic solidarity, with the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian crediting it as a “step towards a comprehensive regional security system with the cooperation of Muslim states.” The SMDA enhances inter-Muslim military collaboration and weakens the Indo-Israeli military axis. It demolishes the Biden-Modi strategy of the India-Israel-Middle East Corridor (IMEC), which Biden and Modi announced during the G20 summit in Delhi in September 2023, thus burying the IMEC under the debris of the Gaza genocide and, now, the sands of Arabia.
This agreement creates a new template of regional security, which combines the military power of Pakistan and the economic power of Saudi Arabia. It makes Pakistan a major Muslim middle power and its military capabilities and influence in diplomacy are now evident in the world’s most strategic region.
This agreement is a recognition of the respect and credibility of the Pakistan military’s professionalism and prowess, and capability to deliver, both for the homeland, as well as regional friends. It shows that, in the changing geopolitical landscape of the Middle East, with declining Western credibility in the aftermath of Israel’s Gaza genocide, regional countries are now looking at new strategic security options within the Muslim world. 
Pakistan is also a frontline candidate for any serious initiative for sending peacekeeping forces into Gaza, after a potential ceasefire, as a major Muslim country that is also a member of the UN Security Council and a key, longstanding contributor to UN peacekeeping missions through the past several decades.
But any country seeking a peacekeeping role in Gaza must meet the following criteria: 1) It should preferably be a non-Arab Muslim country; 2) It must enjoy credibility among Palestinians; and 3) It should have the confidence of the international community.

The signing of the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) on September 17, 2025 is an unprecedented upgrade in bilateral relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The two countries have always maintained cordial relations, including substantial defence and security cooperation dating back to the 1970s. Pursuant to a 1982 protocol, Pakistan’s forces have also engaged with the Saudis in training and advisory roles.
What distinguishes the SMDA from all previous cooperative endeavours is the provision that foreign aggression against one will be treated as aggression against both. This provides formidable strategic depth to Pakistan against possible aggression from India, and to Saudi Arabia against potential aggression from Israel. The agreement, thus, is a win-win for both countries and for the region.
Much of the details of the agreement are yet to be worked out. However, it appears that the agreement would be mainly operationalised in peace-time through sharing of intelligence and information, trainings and joint exercises, the exchange of expertise, boosting each other’s conventional defence capabilities, access to each other’s technological base, and possible cooperation in defence procurements and manufacturing. This multifaceted engagement would enhance the deterrence regime of both countries. Seen in this context, the SMDA can provide the much-needed stabilising effect for a region that has lately witnessed incessant violence and wars.
The concern that the agreement might pitch Pakistan against Israel and Saudi Arabia against India is not valid, as the agreement is essentially defensive in nature. Likewise, any apprehensions about Pakistani nuclear weapons being transferred to Saudi Arabia are totally misplaced, as the primary motive for Pakistan’s nuclear capability is to deter India’s aggressive designs against Pakistan.
The chatter of this agreement becoming a forebearer of a Muslim military bloc is also not realistic, given the diversity of the Muslim world. It is noteworthy that neither the US nor China have expressed any reservations on this agreement thus far. Iran has also welcomed the development, as it is likely to help bring in peace and stability to the region.
On September 29, 2025, President Donald Trump announced his 20-point plan to secure an end to the war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians in the past two years. The leadership of Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and the UAE, as well as Israel and the Palestinian Authority, have welcomed the plan as it would help end the war in Gaza.
If a ceasefire comes into force, doors will open for unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to flow in and the reconstruction of Gaza. Israel has also committed to a phased withdrawal from Gaza. The plan does not envisage any role for Hamas in the future governance of Gaza, which will be the responsibility of a technocratic, apolitical committee made up of Palestinians and international experts to be overseen by a ‘Board of Peace’ led by Trump himself.
It appears that, under the circumstances, the Trump peace plan is the best available option to prevent further bloodshed in Gaza. It meets a key demand of the Arab countries that the Palestinians would not be displaced from their lands and the West Bank would not be annexed. Israel would also have to give up its controversial intent to create a ‘Greater Israel’, at least for now.
However, it is not yet clear whether the US and Israel would recognise the state of Palestine. Unless that happens, there might not be any forward movement towards expanding the Abraham Accords, a stated goal of the Trump administration. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has rightly remarked on X that the implementation of the two-state solution is “essential” to ensure lasting peace in the region.

Historically, Islamabad’s major partnerships, with the US, China and Saudi Arabia, began with security ties before economic or diplomatic links followed. That history came full circle when Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA). For Pakistan, this is a strategic leap. It reclaims the country’s earlier high-profile role in Middle Eastern security.
Early signs are promising — Qatar, Egypt and Turkey are already exploring similar agreements with Islamabad. For Saudi Arabia, the benefits are equally clear. It diversifies security partnerships, no longer relying solely on the US. This time, Riyadh’s partner is a nuclear-armed Pakistan with proven strategic capabilities.
Pakistan‘s comprehensive re-entry into the Middle East security zone is significant within the context of the changing global and regional environment — especially in the aftermath of the Middle East ‘peace plan’ proposed by US President Donald Trump. While there are questions about Pakistan contributing its forces to the international peacekeeping force given in the plan for Gaza, Pakistan is now finding a highchair for itself within the diplomatic realm at many important regional and international forums.
While what policy Pakistan finally formulates on what is an already controversial ‘peace plan’ will be important for its credibility within the Muslim world, Pakistan has a place amongst the states engaged with Trump on the proposed plan. Hard power is central to global politics, and Pakistan has emerged as both militarily formidable and diplomatically credible.
But the SMDA also raises pressing questions. One: will Pakistan provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella? Given Islamabad’s doctrine of ‘offensive defence’ and Israel’s repeated aggression, the answer is a likely yes. But for now, given strategic sensitivities, it is one that won’t get a clear answer from either party. Two: does this replace US-Saudi defence ties? No. It supplements them, giving Riyadh more options while retaining American backing. Three: could this be the seed of a regional military alliance with Pakistan at the core? Quite possibly. The region’s threat environment makes it more than likely.
Four: did Washington approve? Both Riyadh and Islamabad seem to have kept Washington, Tehran and Beijing informed. Five: What will be China’s role? While not yet formalised, it will be hard to ignore. With deep ties to both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and China’s cutting-edge defence technology, Beijing is well-positioned to become a partner in this evolving security arrangement.
As for the Gaza plan on the other hand, Palestinians, ceaselessly guillotined by Israel, are promised humanitarian aid and a battered semblance of statehood under the Trump plan. Crucially, this ‘state’ would not emerge under binding UN resolutions but only as Trump and Netanyahu dictate. The plan hands Israel veto power over every future step toward Palestinian statehood — rewarding Netanyahu while absolving him of responsibility for genocide and starvation.
Despite Palestinian courage and self-belief, the absence of strong allies — hesitant Arab states, distant Muslim friends and China’s calculated reticence — enabled this outcome. Fear and pragmatism on one side, and Israel’s bullying on the other, underwritten by Washington, ensured that no alternative plan survived. All other ceasefire efforts were bullied out of the fray.
Trump now brands his proposal an “eternal peace plan”, though, in reality, it reads as an eternal victory plan for Israel: entrenching Zionist ambitions, rejecting UN resolutions, disarming Hamas, legitimising indefinite Israel Defence Force (IDF) presence and staying silent on illegal settlements. It borders on a surrender document. Gaza itself is to be placed in the hands of Trump and former UK PM Tony Blair — the Iraq war criminal. Significantly, during the meeting with Trump in New York, Arab-Muslim leaders, though critical, could offer no alternative to Blair.
The tragic truth is that the Trump plan reflects raw US power calculus. It seeks to bury the Palestinians’ rightful struggle for their stolen homeland. Yet, the Palestinians’ heroic resistance in the face of the genocidal onslaught in Gaza proves that the Palestinian spirit will endure — long after the games of statist politics fade and long after their enemies imagine they have silenced it.

The latest 20-point Gaza plan is nothing more than a document of surrender for the Palestinian resistance against a brutal occupation. The Israeli genocidal war in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and has devastated the entire enclave. Given Israel’s bellicosity, the prospect of any ceasefire deal remains remote. The Israeli prime minister’s speech at the UN General Assembly session shows no flexibility in Tel Aviv’s hard-line position.
Although Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s special envoy for the Middle East, appears highly optimistic of a ceasefire deal, there is still no convergence of views over the long-term solution to the crisis that threatens the entire region. America’s plan for Palestine, which is said to be broadly supported by regional leaders, is similar to that of the plan for a Palestine state set out in the New York declaration endorsed by the UN general assembly a week earlier. It calls for an immediate ceasefire by Israeli forces, release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas and withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territory. It has also presented a plan for a future administration in Gaza, minus Hamas.
The US plan was apparently presented during the meeting between President Trump and leaders of eight Muslim and Arab countries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th session, which envisages a two-state solution of the Palestinian crisis. The US plan was tacitly approved by the Muslim leaders, but it seems highly improbable that it will be implemented, as Israel has rejected the establishment of a Palestinian state and leaving its control over Gaza.
The development of an International Stabilisation Force (for maintaining law and order, and for providing support to newly formed Palestinian police forces in Gaza) to be deployed in Gaza would comprise troops from various Muslim countries. According to some reports, the main bulk of the troops would come from Indonesia and Pakistan, the two largest Muslim-majority nations. It may be the reason for Trump’s adulation of Pakistan’s prime minister and army chief. It is evident that Pakistan was taken into confidence on the plan by Trump.
Soon after Trump’s statement that he would not allow Israel’s annexation of the occupied West Bank, an Israeli ultra-right cabinet minister declared that the process of annexation will not be stopped. Israel’s military actions against other Arab countries have made peace extremely difficult.
Meanwhile, the mutual defence treaty signed between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan last month reflects the changing security dynamics in the Middle East, caused by Israel’s military escalation that threatens regional security. Not only has the Zionist state continued its genocidal war in Gaza, but it has also launched military strikes in half-a-dozen Arab countries. The most recent air strike was in Qatar, which houses the largest US military base in the regional countries.
Most Gulf and Arab countries have been depending on US security guarantees — America has 19 military bases in the region — but the unqualified support for Israeli aggression by the Trump administration has compelled these countries to think about an alternative defence arrangement. America’s refusal to condemn Israel for its unprovoked attack on one of the strongest US allies in the region has reinforced the sense of insecurity among these countries.
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have a long history of defence cooperation that goes back to the 1960s. Pakistan has some 20,000 troops already based in the Kingdom, for internal and external security. Pakistan has also been providing training to Saudi military officers. The latest pact has formalised the security cooperation. The details of the agreement are not available, but the most significant clause is that an attack on any of the two countries would be considered aggression against both. The pact has cemented the existing defence cooperation between the two countries. However, it’s too early to say that other Gulf countries will join this treaty.

The Pak-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) has no text that can be flyspecked and analysed. Most commentary has flowed from the joint statement, focusing on the qualifier “strategic” and the unambiguous declaration that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both [emphasis added].”
The commentary has elicited two types of responses: hyperbole and scepticism. Hyperbole about how significant it is and how it changes the rules of the game in the region and beyond (a Bloomberg analysis called it “the first concrete indication of what a post-American world might look like”) and scepticism over what it means and how much it encompasses.
I believe that the text might not be available anytime soon or, if and when it is made available, would contain only some general clauses. This is because the two sides could either want to keep certain specific provisions under wraps (I’ll just come to that) or use this more for the purpose of signalling and manipulating perceptions than identifying specific areas of cooperation.
Some comments have likened it to Article 5 of the Nato charter. This is convenient but lazy. Article 5 is not wedded to automaticity. Also, the line about mutual defence is cloaked in greater certitude than Nato’s collective defence clause. Once again, we don’t have the fine print, but it would be safe to say that there’s more assuredness here in words than there’s likely to be in action.
The term “strategic” combined with “joint deterrence” in the statement has brought into the picture “extended deterrence”, which is a technical term for a nuclear umbrella. This flies in the face of Pakistan’s traditional nuclear policy and needs to be clarified.
The timing is important, coming as it did eight days after the illegal Zionist strike at a house in Doha and two days after the extraordinary joint session between the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The strike showed the hollowness of United States security guarantees to its Gulf partners, at least if such a strike were conducted by the Zionist entity, and the lacklustre response by the extraordinary session to the idea of a multilateral security arrangement. Saudi analysts say that Riyadh decided to expedite the formalisation of the agreement for these two reasons.
While Riyadh has long sought external security guarantees, including from the US, the region has become more volatile and, at the very least, it would want to hedge its bets. From the US perspective, if such an agreement leads to burden-sharing and is not inimical to US interests, it might even be welcome.
This brings us to another development, which increasingly seems to have some connection to the SMDA: US President Donald Trump’s so-called Gaza Plan. Among other provisions of the plan, which is largely unworkable, is a peacekeeping force drawn from Arab/Muslim countries. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif stated on X that it is in line with Pakistan’s official policy. He is wrong. My suspicion is that meetings at the White House were about Pakistan’s acceptance of this plan, which again seeks to prescind the Palestinians. Interestingly, in 2020, Sharif had tweeted to say that Palestinians were right to tear up the then Trump plan.
Pakistan’s endorsement of a plan rejected by Gazans lands us in a treacherous terrain that hasn’t been mapped out. One can go line by line to identify the perfidy built into the plan, but that is outside the scope of this brief. Corollary: the government must begin a debate in parliament on both the SMDA and the Trump plan, to rid the policy of its opacity and avoid leading the country into a morass. Or worse, by doing so, make Pakistan complicit in the US-Zionist genocide.

The cryptocurrency reached $125,689, shooting above its previous August record of around $124,500.
Bitcoin has enjoyed a strong upward momentum, with investors cautious about the United States’ government shutdown.
Gains in US shares have also supported bitcoin’s rise, while investors have looked to safe haven assets while US lawmakers negotiate over funding the federal government, Bloomberg News said.
US President Donald Trump and his family have also been big promoters of cryptocurrencies and are involved in various crypto endeavours that have inflated his wealth.
 
 

Trump’s embrace of digital assets has reversed years of US government scepticism towards the crypto industry under his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, with the US House of Representatives passing three landmark cryptocurrency bills in July.
These regulatory changes have seen the value of bitcoin soar.
“With many assets including equities, gold and even collectibles like Pokemon cards hitting all-time highs, it’s no surprise Bitcoin is benefiting from the dollar debasement narrative,” Joshua Lim, co-head of markets at crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX, was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying.</p><small>2025-10-05 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05112004525f1ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946752/failed-attempt-at-restoring-lost-reputation-khawaja-asif-reacts-to-indian-military-political-leaderships-statements' target='_blank'><strong>Failed attempt at restoring lost reputation: Khawaja Asif reacts to Indian military, political leadership’s statements</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Sunday reacted to statements made by the Indian military and political leadership, terming them a “failed attempt” to restore their “lost reputation”.
While he did not specify any particular statement that he was reacting to, his remarks follow recent aggressive comments from the Indian side, mentioning terrorism and warning of action. India has long accused Pakistan of cross-border terrorism, an allegation that Islamabad has repeatedly refuted and termed baseless.
“The statements made by the Indian army and its political leadership are a failed attempt to restore its lost reputation,” Asif said on X.
 






He also referred to a four-day escalation between India and Pakistan in May, during which Islamabad says it downed at least six Indian jets.
Asif said India faced a “decisive defeat with a score of 6-0” in the escalation,  and “if they try again [to go to fight], God willing, the score will be much better than the last time”.
“The way the public opinion in India turned against the government after the worst defeat in history, and the way [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and his group have lost their reputation, it is apparent from their statements that they [are feeling] the pressure,” Asif added.
 
 

“This time, God willing, India will get buried under the rubble of its own jets,” the minister asserted.
‘Cataclysmic devastation’
Asif’s remarks come a day after the military warned that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and Pakistan would “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”.
The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) came in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in case of a fresh round of hostilities.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,” the ISPR said.
Indian media outlet NDTV reported on Friday that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion.
 
 

The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed, without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.”
In response, the ISPR said in its statement that the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”.
It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia.
The ISPR concluded its statement, saying: “Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.”
May conflict
The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
 
 

In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command, that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India.
The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army.
The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines. The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger.</p><small>2025-10-05 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0508060254a336e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946705/14-terrorists-killed-in-khuzdar-operation' target='_blank'><strong>14 terrorists killed in Khuzdar operation</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Security forces killed 14 terrorists of the Indian proxy group Fitna al-Hindustan in an operation conducted in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district on Saturday.
The state designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Security officials said the forces launched the operation on the basis of intelligence reports about the presence of the group’s militants in the mountainous area of Zehri tehsil.
According to the officials, the area was cordoned off before the action was launched. Heavy firing took place between the security forces and the terrorists, which continued for several hours.
“As many as 14 terrorists were killed in the gun battle, while 20 others were injured,” the officials said, adding that a large quantity of arms, ammunition, and other equipment was seized from their possession.
The Zehri operation, they added, was carried out days after security forces killed seven India-sponsored terrorists in an intelligence-based operation in Sherani district of Balochistan.
 
 

They said several hideouts established by the militants in the mountainous terrain were destroyed during the operation.
“Residents of the Zehri area praised the operation, acknowledging the efforts of the security forces in restoring peace and order to the region, which had been disturbed for a long time,” the officials said, adding that the terrorists had been harassing and blackmailing local residents.
Officials reaffirmed that the security forces remain fully committed to elimina­ting the remaining milita­nts of Fitna al-Hindustan.
On Oct 1, security forces had killed 13 other alleged terrorists in separate operations in Quetta and Kech districts of Makran.
The operation in Aghbarg, on the outskirts of Quetta, was conducted a day after a car suicide attack on the headquarters of Frontier Corps (North) that claimed 10 lives, including four security personnel, and left 33 others injured.
Security forces foiled the attackers’ attempt to enter the FC headquarters and killed all five terrorists.
FIR registered
Meanwhile, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Balochistan Police has registered an FIR against the terrorists involved in the car suicide attack outside the FC headquarters and has lau­nched an investigation.
Official sources said the CTD has identified two terrorists who were killed by security forces as they attempted to enter the FC headquarters.
According to CTD sources, one of the terrorists belonged to the Mazai Adha area of Qila Abdullah district, bordering Afghanistan, and was identified as Sharifullah. The other terrorist was a resident of Chagai district, but his name has not yet been established.
 
 

Sources said CTD officials, along with other investigators, have been questioning Sharifullah’s family members. “The terrorist from Mazai Adha was also wanted by security forces in Karachi for his involvement in a previous terrorist attack there,” an official said.
Investigators have also approached the family of the other terrorist from Chagai. Security officials said the CTD identified both terrorists with the help of Nadra’s fingerprint records.
“The remains of the other terrorists killed in the gun battle with security forces have been sent to the Punjab Forensic Laboratory in Lahore for analysis,” the official added.
 
 

Meanwhile, security forces have sealed the area where the FC headquarters is located. Buildings badly damaged by the powerful explosions have also been sealed, and no one is being allowed to enter to access their offices.
The offices of Daily Mashriq and the private TV channel HUM were among those badly damaged and have been sealed by security forces.
Heavy traffic congestion was reported on several key roads due to the closure of routes passing near the FC headquarters.

Those detained by Israel also include former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan.
“Through the diplomatic channels of a friendly European country, we have confirmed that former senator Mushtaq Ahmad is in the custody of the Israeli occupying forces and is safe and in good health,” the FO statement said.
It added, “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.”
 






The FO said it had previously, too, coordinated the safe return of individuals who disembarked earlier. “In this context, we express our profound gratitude to the brotherly countries that assisted in the repatriation of our citizens.”
It further stated that the government “remains committed to the protection of all its citizens abroad and anticipates the completion of this repatriation process within the coming days”.
Several pro-Palestinian activists, former senator Mushtaq and Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thun­b­erg, were captured by Isra­eli troops that intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla on Wednesday night.
 
 

Detained Pakistanis also included Mazhar Saeed Shah, Wajahat Ahmad, Dr Osama Riaz, Ismail Khan, Syed Aziz Nizami and Fahad Ishtiaq, according to an earlier statement by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
In a telephone conversation with JI chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman on Friday, PM Shehbaz had assured him that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including the ex-senator.
Flotilla’s interception and detainees ‘mistreated’
The Global Sumud Flotilla had begun its journey last month, with Mushtaq leading the Pakistani delegation on the voyage.
As the fleet moved closer to the territorial waters of Gaza, Israeli forces began intercepting it on the night of October 1, halting over 40 boats part of the flotilla by the next day.
The Israeli troops were filmed boarding and holding activists from several vessels at gunpoint. The flotilla’s organisers had equipped each boat with cameras livestreaming every minute of their voyage as a security measure against just such an occurrence.
After intercepting the flotilla, Israel said it would deport the activists to Europe, without specifying which countries they would be sent to.
The Israeli action drew condemnations from across the globe, with countries whose citizens were detained expressing concern.
According to a report by The Guardian, Thunberg told Swedish officials she was subjected to harsh treatment in Israeli custody after her removal from the Global Sumud Flotilla.
 
 

As per an email sent by the Swedish foreign ministry to people close to Thunberg, and seen by The Guardian, an official who visited the activist in prison said she claimed she was detained in a cell infested with bedbugs, with too little food and water.
At least four flotilla activists also said Thunberg was mistreated during her detention, with two members saying she was forced to hold an Israeli flag.</p><small>2025-10-05 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0512055814d0a68.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946750/pm-shehbaz-departs-for-malaysia-eyes-comprehensive-talks-on-economic-engagement' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz departs for Malaysia, eyes ‘comprehensive’ talks on economic engagement</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement as he departed for Malaysia on Sunday.
“I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.
Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.
 






Later, a post by the PM Office’s official X account confirmed the premier had departed from Lahore for the three-day official visit.
 






The Foreign Office earlier said PM Shehbaz would be accompanied by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other federal ministers and senior government officials on the trip.
Sharing details of the visit in a statement, the FO said talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”</p><small>2025-10-05 07:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0507525727444e2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946699/activists-say-israel-mistreated-greta-thunberg-137-flotilla-detainees-arrive-in-turkiye' target='_blank'><strong>Activists say Israel mistreated Greta Thunberg; 137 flotilla detainees arrive in Turkiye</strong></a><br><p>ANKARA: A total of 137 activists detained by Israel for taking part in the flotilla seeking to deliver aid to Gaza arrived in Turkiye on Saturday after being deported, with two alleging that Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg was mistreated during her detention.
Israel did not immediately comment on the latest allegation, but its foreign ministry earlier described reports that detainees had been mistreated as “complete lies”.
The 137 activists who landed at Istanbul Airport included 36 Turkish nationals, as well as citizens from the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Morocco, Italy, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Switzerland, Tunisia and Jordan.
Two of them, Hazwani Helmi, a Malaysian citizen, and Windfield Beaver, an American, said at the airport that they had witnessed Thunberg being mistreated, saying she was shoved and forced to wear an Israeli flag.
 






“It was a disaster. They treated us like animals,” said Helmi, 28, adding that detainees were not provided with clean food or water and that medication and belongings were confiscated.
Beaver, 43, said Thunberg was “treated terribly’’ and “used as propaganda”, describing how she was pushed into a room as Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir arrived.
 
 

Israel has faced international condemnation after its military intercepted all of about 40 boats in the Gaza-bound aid flotilla and detained more than 450 activists.
Its foreign ministry wrote on X that all detained activists were “safe and in good health”, adding it was keen to complete the remaining deportations “as quickly as possible”.
 






Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said 26 Italians were on board the Turkish Airlines flight, with another 15 still held in Israel and set to be expelled over the next few days.
“I have once again given instructions to the Italian embassy in Tel Aviv to ensure that the remaining compatriots are treated with respect for their rights,” Tajani wrote on X.
A first group of Italians from the flotilla — four parliamentarians — arrived in Rome on Friday.
 






“We were brutally stopped … brutally taken hostage,” said Benedetta Scuderi, one of the parliamentarians.
‘Zip-tied for five hours’
According to Adalah, an Israeli group offering legal assistance to flotilla members, some detainees were denied access to lawyers, water and medications.
They were also “forced to kneel with their hands zip-tied for at least five hours, after some participants chanted ’Free Palestine’,” Adalah said.

The video’s thumbnail stated that an “Islamic army” was to take control of Gaza.
Indeed, one of the suggestions made by various countries to US President Donald Trump is to convince Israel to withdraw its forces from Gaza and allow an international peacekeeping force to be stationed there. In fact, this suggestion is already part of the ‘peace plan’ that Trump is offering to Israel, the Palestinians and their respective allies. 
If all goes to plan and the hawkish Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, actually agrees, there is every likelihood that a peacekeeping force will replace the Israeli forces that have flattened Gaza and killed tens of thousands of men, women and children there — both Palestinian Muslims, as well as non-Muslims.
The peacekeeping force will most likely be made up of military personnel belonging to Muslim-majority countries. Therefore, it will be a Muslim force. Calling it an “Islamic army” is not only problematic but largely incorrect as well. Let me explain.

The constant interchangeable usage of the terms ‘Islamic’ and ‘Muslim’ in public discourse has resulted in an inability amongst most to understand the important difference between the two

In Pakistan, the words ‘Islamic’ and ‘Muslim’ in most cases are used interchangeably, or as if one were the synonym of the other. At least from the early 20th century, on political and social levels, the word ‘Islamic’ often carries clear ideological connotations, whereas the word ‘Muslim’ is almost entirely about cultural identity. 
So, in this context, not all Muslims are ‘Islamic’ as such. There are numerous men and women who identify with Islam due to their family background, heritage or the social environment in which they were raised. But they don’t adhere to or agree with the politics and practices associated with what is usually perceived as ‘Islamic’. 
They remain Muslim, though. However, they often view the word ‘Islamic’ as an outcome of mixing religion with politics. Some may be entirely secular and even dismissive of contemporary laws shaped by particular interpretations of the faith’s scriptures by certain governments, yet they identify themselves as Muslim and follow the basic doctrinal tenets and cultural practices of Islam.
So what is ‘Islamic’? Transmitting the Quran through art (calligraphy) is correctly understood as Islamic art. Architecture and design that are presented as visual representations of God’s infinite nature are also Islamic. A conference in which Muslim theologians discuss the dynamics of Islam’s scriptures can be termed as an ‘Islamic conference’ as well. But a conference that is framed to generate discussions about the political and economic standing of Muslim-majority countries is certainly not an ‘Islamic conference.’ It is a meeting of political representatives of Muslim-majority countries.
The confusion in this regard only deepened when political gatherings of Muslim leaders began to be labelled as ‘Islamic summits’ or when sports events involving athletes from Muslim-majority countries are labelled as ‘Islamic games.’ There is nothing ‘Islamic’ about them, unless the summits were discussing the complexities of Islamic theology or, in the latter’s case, sporting events were reshaped by putting them in the context of the sharia [Islamic teachings]. 
Returning to the case of Pakistan, the bulk of literature produced during the height of the Pakistan Movement in British India speaks about Muslim nationalism. For example, the All India Muslim League (AIML), which became India’s largest Muslim-interest party, treated the Muslims of the region as culturally distinct from India’s Hindu majority. 
Muslim nationalism even presented India’s Muslims as an overarching ethnic community within which lay different Muslim ethnic and sectarian/ sub-sectarian groups. Therefore, the Hindu majority began to be viewed by AIML as an ethnic, cultural and political ‘other’.
Muslim nationalism encapsulated the ethnically diverse Muslims of India as a cultural whole but one with different ethnic, sectarian and sub-sectarian groups. Therefore, the AIML’s purpose was to create a Muslim-majority country with Muslim nationalism at its core. Had the AIML been leading an ‘Islamic’ movement, it would have struggled to address and regulate multiple interpretations of Islamic theology held by different sets of Islamic sects and sub-sects. In fact, according to the political scientist Muhammad Waseem, the concept of Islam in different ethnic groups among India’s Muslims too differed from each other on various theological points.  
This is when ‘Islamic nationalism’ entered the picture. Though slightly older than Muslim nationalism, Islamic nationalism’s purpose was to regenerate colonised Muslim societies through a revival of a global caliphate and universalised sharia laws, but it struggled to compete with the more regional, specific and ‘modernist’ Muslim nationalism. 
However, whereas Muslim nationalism succeeded in producing a separate Muslim-majority country in South Asia, it could not come to terms with the ethnic and sectarian fissures that intensified once the country was created, and the Hindu ‘other’ became a minuscule minority in the new country. 
So, starting from 1956, but more intently from 1973 onwards, an Islamic nationalism was introduced. This allowed the entry into the Constitution of various laws and rhetoric derived from a majoritarian interpretation of Islamic theology. From then onwards, everything began being termed as ‘Islamic’ — even though the Constitution still contained a large chunk of secular laws. 
 


According to the political scientist Ahmet T. Kuru, Islamic nationalism is a complex and often contradictory idea. It combines religious identity with nationalist aspirations. It is distinct from secular nationalism, which separates national identity from religion. Muslim nationalism lies somewhere between the two. It also combines religious identity with nationalist identity but keeps theology in the private sphere, to avoid theological complications between sects and sub-sects, and to mitigate any possibility of these complications mutating to give birth to a theocracy. 
But after 1973, the Pakistani state saw Islamic nationalism as a more robust tool to manage sectarian/ sub-sectarian and ethnic complexities. The term Muslim nationalism transcended to mean Islamic nationalism and then simply vanished. The question is: did Islamic nationalism resolve the complexities? No. It made them even more complex and, indeed, it did begin to mutate and give birth to a theocracy.
So far, this tendency has been mitigated by the state to settle for a volatile variant of ‘theo-democracy’ with an ‘Islamic constitution’ or, for that matter, ‘Islamic’ everything, even when much of this is anything but. 
So, to the journalist anticipating a peacekeeping force in Gaza made up of soldiers from various Muslim countries, it is an “Islamic army.” But the truth is, it will be just a Muslim army — unless its core purpose will be evangelical in nature and jihadist in intent, which will never be the case. 
One has to be extremely careful in how one uses the words ‘Islamic’ and ‘Muslim’ in the highly divisive and dangerously polarised world that we live in today.

The incident occurred during a protest by journalists and demonstrators from Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), some of whom were reportedly fleeing from police action when officers stormed into the club.
A joint action committee has been formed that includes all key media associations and various factions of the NPC.
In its first meeting headed by the acting NPC president Ehteshamul Haq, the action committee was given the mandate to prepare a charter of demands.
The chairmanship of the committee was unanimously handed over to NPC President Azhar Jatoi, while Nayar Ali was given the responsibility of its secretary.
 
 

The committee members include President PFUJ Afzal Butt, President RIUJ Tariq Virk, President PFUJ (Dastur) Haji Nawaz Raza, President RIUJ (Dastur) Rana Kausar Ali, President PFUJ (Workers) Sadia Kamal and Javed Malik, Secretary General PFUJ (Rana Azeem Group) Shakeel Ahmed, President RIUJ (Rana Azeem Group) Tariq Usmani, President Azad Group Shakeel Qarar and Mehboobur Rehman Tanoli, President Parliamentary Reporters Association M.B. Soomro and General Secretary Naveed Akbar.
The members of the committee will forward their suggestions for preparing a charter of demands against the police action on the press club, so that no such act takes place in future.
Meanwhile, the acting president NPC said that they were discussing the situation with other press clubs and with their coordination a strategy will be devised.
“The most important point is that we do not want any such action at any press club anywhere in the country,” he added.
The leader of Azad Panel Shakeel Qarar said: “We have suggested that a notification be issued to the federal and provincial governments that in future the police or any law enforcement agency will not be allowed to enter any press club even after prior permission.”
He added that an inquiry should be conducted by an officer of interior ministry and people from the ruling and opposition parties.

Hamas may have accepted some of the terms set forth for a ceasefire but uncertainty remains regarding further developments. US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has called for an end to the Israeli bombing — just days ahead of the Nobel Peace Prize announcement.
Rewind to a few days earlier when Trump announced the Gaza peace plan and said he’d agreed with eight leaders of the Muslim world. When he made public the details, murmurs of discontent started among some of these states that had agreed to the draft. The deceit was laid bare.
Qatar and Pakistan said more or less publicly that this wasn’t really what was agreed to. And that they were unhappy with what was announced. However, it was also leaked to the media that Qatar would continue to insist in private to the US that some sections of the original draft be restored, while lauding it in public. (All eight governments endorsed the deal in a joint statement.)
 
 

It then emerged that the agreed draft was ‘edited’, in effect mutilated, by Israel’s psychopathic prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, during the six hours he spent ‘negotiating’ with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — both seen as personal friends of Netanyahu and the apartheid state, and both of whom have often backtracked on their positions to harmonise it with Israel’s.

Of the nearly 500 activists that set sail to deliver essential supplies to Gaza, only 30pc were Muslims.

These changes were made with the twin purpose of enabling Netanyahu to claim victory at home in order to appease his far-right coalition partners, namely Ben Gvir and Smotrich — both evil incarnate like himself.
At the same time, it was aimed at making it very difficult for Hamas to accept it because it excluded key Israeli Occupation Forces timelines for withdrawal, and dramatically cut the number of Palestinian hostages to be swapped for Israelis in Hamas captivity. It also excluded Palestinians from a top role in governance.
Bizarrely, the great and the good of the Muslim world — those with trillions of dollars in their sovereign wealth funds invested in the US; a Nato member boasting immense military power; another with a military powerful enough to have retaken territory lost to the apartheid state; and a nuclear-armed ummah state — were so helpless that three of them — Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye — were said to have put pressure on Hamas to accept the plan. That may have been why Hamas conditionally accepted it — or perhaps it had reasons of its own.
When the discontent among his key Gulf, Nato and newfound South Asian allies became apparent, it was leaked to the media that Trump was so unhappy with Netanyahu, as the negotiations proceeded, that he told him: “Take the deal or leave it. And if you leave it, we’ll walk away from you.”
Now, in the AIPAC-bought controlled political space in the US and the AIPAC-steered decision-making, if anyone wants you or me to believe for a moment that a US president, who has received hundreds of millions of dollars from supporters of the apartheid state had the leeway to ‘walk away’ from Israel, then you’d believe and so would I that this columnist is wealthier than Elon Musk.
This was one window to the world of lies we live in, and another is the one which tells us that Canada, France, Australia and the UK have ‘recognised the State of Palestine’. Their key Middle East ally Israel says there will never be a Palestinian state, so what they recognise is immaterial.
These democratic Western powers have time and again called for an end to the Gaza genocide and have, of late, taken to calling it abhorrent and unconscionable, but will not impose sanctions to force Israel to alter its conduct. For, that would mean putting their money where their mouth is and hurting the apartheid state.
 
 

These are the Western nations whose governments are still paying lip service to the Palestinian cause but whose people have taken to the streets in their millions to say enough is enough; they are calling for a boycott and blockade, of the apartheid state.
From the UK to Spain, from Belgium to Italy to Germany where police brutality, reminiscent of the SS of an era long gone is trying hard but failing to suppress the protest — it seems that all, from the Greens to the conservatives, have decided that the Palestinians have to atone for the sins of Nazi Germany, Holocaust being the worst. Almost as if to say one genocide has to pay for another.
Despite the fact that many governments in the Muslim world take unkindly to street protest, thousands of young Moroccans are out in the streets, battling the police to question their pro-Israel monarch’s polices. Turkiye has seen demonstrations too.
But then there is the other view. The humanitarian flotilla, with nearly 500 activists from around the world trying to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza and deliver baby food, milk, diapers and women’s sanitary supplies and more, was intercepted by the apartheid state’s forces. Many of the activists were kidnapped by the Israeli Occupation Forces from beyond occupied Palestine’s territorial waters. Of these activists, a mere 30 per cent belong to Muslim countries. The rest belong to countries and societies and cultures that many among us in Muslim states feel so superior to. Tens of thousands are still pouring into the streets in Madrid, Rome, Brussels, Mexico City, Bogotá … the list is endless.
Many of us in the Muslim world are like our governments — docile and scared and unwilling to annoy the US — while many people in the much-derided West have taken to the streets, challenging their governments to do more. Here is hoping their humanity triumphs, for there lies hope.

It remains to be seen when and if the promises are fulfilled. Had the government made good progress on earlier demands, the region might have been spared the recent tumult.
In fact, the pattern so far shows that the government, in other parts of the country too, engages in negotiations with protesters merely to pacify the immediate situation, rather than look for permanent solutions to honour its commitments. In some cases, voices of protest fall on deaf ears.
For instance, just days before the JAAC protest, the families of Baloch missing persons once again ended their sit-in and returned from the federal capital. The peaceful families of the missing persons were not fortunate enough to receive even minimal attention from state institutions.
One must move beyond dealing with such situations through force, temporary negotiations and eventual disregard for the demands once ‘normalcy’ is restored. This modus operandi is a relic of colonial times. Many Commonwealth states inherited this pattern, but Pakistan is among the few that appear to have stuck to the old line, without distinction or reform. Regrettably, this is the approach the government took when the JAAC launched its protest this time and earlier in Azad Kashmir.
There have been many protest movements in the country, including the Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Action Committee, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement, the Haq Do Tehreek in Gwadar, the Sindhu Bachao Tehreek, and the Baloch Yakjehti Committee. Their demand has been simple: constitutional, economic and political rights, and most importantly, the right to live with dignity. What is common to all such rights movements is that they are essentially anti-elite and challenge entrenched political and economic privileges. The state, however, responds with force against dissent.

The issue of elite capture has come to dominate rights struggles.

Protest can also be seen from a global perspective and applied locally. What took place in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal were anti-elite protests that were confronted by state repression. We have seen similar disaffection with elite privileges here as well, its most recent iteration being in AJK.
Yet the authorities in Pakistan, like those in India, have an advantage: the country’s ethnic, racial and religious diversity ensures that movements in the peripheries seldom capture the attention of the mainstream public discourse. The state tends to exploits this by ensuring that such movements remain disconnected from one another and do not reach the heartlands or urban centres where public opinion truly matters.
The recent incident at the National Press Club in Islamabad, where police brutally beat Kashmiri protesters, stormed the premises, and tortured journalists, is part of this same tactic: keeping rights movements, especially peripheral ones, away from the mainstream. The government and state elements not only deploys strong-armed measures but also manipulates narratives on both mainstream and social media. News is censored, and smear campaigns are launched against these movements, which are termed as foreign-funded conspiracies.
Half-page advertisements in the national media and TV screenings by the information ministry have recently been ‘warning’ that a new war is being fought in our minds. They are, in fact, a reflection of the state’s own mindset regarding justifiable dissent, which it reframes by overplaying the theory of hybrid warfare.
Dissenters are tagged as foreign agents and include NGOs, freelancers and media persons who ask critical questions. The public is warned not to share secret information with anyone. It is not certain what kind of sensitive information an ordinary citizen in the country can possess. However, the authorities insist it is a part of narrative warfare and try to create a barrier between areas where the protests take place and the rest of the country.
The recent protests can be seen as a continuation of a rights struggle that began several years ago. The protests were directly linked to promises the state made to the protesters in 2023, pledges that have remained unfulfilled. Meanwhile, the wealthy elite continue to thrive, aligned with power centres in the mainland. Ordinary people believe that privilege and fortune come only through corruption and collusion with these elites, a conviction that fuels their grievances.
The recent deadlock in talks between the government and JAAC, before resumption, centred on the issue of elite capture. Forced by the stalemate, the JAAC proceeded with its protest plan. At the core of JAAC’s 38-point charter was the elimination of elite privileges, especially the 13 reserved seats for Kashmiri refugees. The JAAC views these seats as a source of corruption and political manoeuvring, and thus playing a decisive part in forming governments in AJK.
The comparison with the (former) Fata seats in Pakistan’s parliament is evoked aptly to voice concerns regarding horse-trading and government-making and unmaking at Islamabad’s whim. The government counters that abolishing these seats would weaken Pakistan’s Kashmir case, as India also reserves seats for AJK and GB. It argues that removing them would signal acceptance of India’s Aug 5, 2019, abrogation of Kashmir’s special status.
The JAAC dismisses this claim. It insists that reserved seats have nothing to do with UN resolutions and do not affect Pakistan’s legal stance. Both AJK and GB want constitutional rights as citizens. Instead, critics assert, the state imposes taxes and removes subsidies but does not give them the constitutional cover that would allow citizens to benefit fully, without undermining UN resolutions.
Most of the JAAC’s demands were essentially municipal-level issues, including health, education and sanitation. Yet Pakistan’s ruling elites, particularly in the provinces, have destroyed the local government system, retaining revenues for themselves and spending like monarchs.

• MP Iqbal Mohamed defends such marriages as culturally significant, urges genetic screening over bans
LONDON: Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) has found itself at the centre of a political and cultural row after a government-backed education programme published — and then quietly removed — online guidance describing the potential benefits of first-cousin marriage.
UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the advice “shocking” and demanded an apology, saying first-cousin marriages are “high-risk and unsafe.” MP Iqbal Mohamed, however, defended such unions as culturally significant for many families.
Speaking in the Commons, he acknowledged health risks but said many families see such unions as positive for building bonds and financial security, urging genetic screening instead of a ban.
 
 

The document, published by NHS England’s Genomics Education Programme last week, stated that consanguineous unions can bring “stronger extended family support systems and economic advantages” even as it acknowledged the increased risk of certain genetic conditions among children of related parents.
Tory MP Richard Holden, who has proposed legislation to ban cousin marriages, condemned the document, calling on the NHS to “stop taking the knee to damaging and oppressive cultural practices.” Holden also linked cousin marriage to immigration and women’s rights, saying the practice “should be ended for good.”
By Monday September 29, the guidance appeared to have been taken down from the NHS website.
New YouGov research shows that three quarters of Britons (77 per cent) say first cousin marriage should not be legal, with only 9pc thinking the law should remain as it is. Prohibiting first cousin marriage is popular across the main parties, with 76-77pc of Labour, Lib Dem and Tory voters opposed to the practice, as well as 82pc of Reform UK voters.
The study
The Genomics Education Programme which is run by Health Education England aims to improve the “genetic literacy” of healthcare professionals and the public. Its 22 September blog post titled “Should the UK Government Ban First-Cousin Marriage?”, stressed that while children of first cousins do face a higher risk of certain inherited disorders, the increase is small and should be tackled through education and voluntary screening rather than bans.
The document emphasised that first-cousin marriage remains legal in the UK under the Marriage Act 1949 and that the government has “no current plans” to change this.
It noted that while the risk of a child being born with a genetic condition rises from about 2–3pc in the general population to 4–6pc for children of first cousins, “most children of first cousins are healthy.”
The guidance also cited research from Bradford suggesting that “endogamy” (marrying within a tight-knit community) may be a more significant factor in genetic risk than cousin marriage itself.
It further warned that stigmatising the practice can deter couples from seeking help, with the British Society for Genetic Medicine instead advocating premarital genomic testing, targeted education and voluntary counselling as more effective ways to reduce risk.
In February this year, a BBC investigation showed how cousin marriage plays out on the ground. Its reporting from Bradford, which is home to one of the UK’s largest Pakistani communities found that first-cousin marriage remains “fairly common” but is slowly declining.
The Born in Bradford study, tracking over 13,000 children, found that about one in six had parents who were first cousins. Researchers found that children of first cousins were more likely to have speech and language problems (11pc versus 7pc for unrelated parents); that they were less likely to reach a government benchmark for “good development” at age five (54pc versus 64pc); and they visited primary care doctors more frequently i.e. about four times a year on average compared to three for unrelated-parent children.
Professor Sam Oddie of Bradford Teaching Hospitals told the BBC “I’ve seen fatal skin conditions, fatal brain conditions, fatal muscle conditions”.
He said such conditions were notably more common in Bradford, recalling families who lost several children to the same genetic disorder — “deeply upsetting and hard to comprehend.”
But the same BBC story underscores that many health professionals, including Prof Oddie, argue it is “an oversimplification” to blame cousin marriage alone. Endogamy, not just direct blood ties, can cluster genetic variants.
Endogamy is not unique to Pakistani communities in the UK. It is an issue too in the UK’s Jewish community and globally among the Amish and also French Canadians.
Prof Oddie said it’s simplistic to blame co­usin marriage alone, noting that shared ge­­n­­es within close communities — or endoga­­my — play a major role in inherited disorders.
BBC interviews found more young women choosing “love marriages” as education and social exposure grow, with cousin marriages among Pakistani-origin mothers in Bradford falling from 40pc to 27pc in a decade.

• India may release over 150,000 cusecs of water into Punjab rivers within 48 hours
• PDMA warns of potential flooding in some regions
• Survey of flood damage in 69 tehsils likely to be complete by 27th
LAHORE: The Punjab government on Saturday approved financial assistance of Rs20,000 per acre for compensation of crop losses, with the provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) warning of potential flooding in some regions amid rain forecast for many districts and expected release of over 150,000 cusecs from India into the Chenab, Sutlej and Ravi rivers within a day or two.
While chairing a meeting in Multan to review the condition of cotton, rice, sugarcane and other standing crops, Punjab Agriculture Secretary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo said about 2,000 teams were conducting surveys of flood-related damages, though Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had already approved financial assistance of Rs20,000 per acre to compensate for crop losses.
He said a comprehensive action plan had also been prepared to achieve wheat sowing target, noting that measures aimed at boosting cotton production had yielded encouraging results. So far, he said, 2.65 million bales equivalent of seed cotton (phutti) were picked this year as compared to 1.846m bales obtained during the same period last year according to Crop Reporting Service statistics.
 
 

Earlier, the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued an alert for rains in Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan over the next 12 to 24 hours, specifically in the upper catchment areas of Jhelum, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.
On the other hand, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia told a presser that the country was bracing for a shift in the weather, with rains expected over the next few days which may worsen the flood situation in Punjab.
Light to heavy rains are expected in various districts of Punjab from Rawalpindi to Lahore over the weekend, followed by showers on Monday in south Punjab. In the upper regions of Punjab, up to 100mm of rainfall was expected, he added.
Rising level of river waters
At Head Marala, Mr Kathia said, the Chenab River is carrying 20,000 cusecs, with an additional 100,000 cusecs expected from India in the next 48 hours. Marala’s current outflow is 23,000 cusecs. Considering that 900,000 cusecs water passed through Head Marala on Aug 26, he said it was not as big a challenge.
Besides, the Sutlej River may receive 50,000 cusecs from India, and 35,000 cusecs of water are expected to enter the Ravi River from the Thein Dam, he said.
On the other hand, Mangla Dam reported high water levels, though Jhelum may not face a massive flood situation.
Survey in 27 districts
The PDMA DG said a survey for flood damage assessment was underway in 27 districts of Punjab, with as many as 11,000 people being engaged in the exercise. A joint survey team includes officers from the Pakistan Army, district administration, and various other departments, he said, adding that a total of 2,213 teams were in the field.
With real-time monitoring through an online dashboard, survey is being conducted by the joint teams in 27 districts, he said. The exercise would be completed in 69 tehsils by Oct 27, he added.
 
 

Mr Kathia said the Bank of Punjab would establish counters in each tehsil to ensure provision of maximum facilities to flood victims. He said that flood survivors could receive Rs50,000 immediately after receiving cards.
Complaint resolution
For complaints related to the survey, he said, the PDMA in collaboration with Punjab’s IT Board had formed a platform, which would resolve complaints within seven days.
The DG recalled that there were over 350,000 flood victims in 2010, 38,196 in 2012, 359,000 in 2014 while a total of Rs14 billion was distributed among them.
Again in 2022, he said, 56,000 people affected by floods were provided a sum of Rs10 billion compensation.
He said that over the past 15 years, Rs51 billion was distributed among flood victims but the damage from the current flood was bigger than all previous floods.
Weather advisory
Meanwhile, NEOC issued the weather alert, warning that rains have been forecast for Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Islamabad, Punjab and southern part of Sindh, with the possibility of landslides in mountainous areas.

The meeting that took place at their Jati Umra residence covered governance issues, including the ongoing acrimony with the PPP-led Sindh government over flood and canal issues.
“The premier told the PML-N president that the PPP was its coalition partner and for smooth functioning of the government bickering between the two parties should not linger on,” a source privy to the meeting between the two brothers told Dawn.
The source said PM Shehbaz wanted his elder brother to speak to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and convince her “to let go and reconcile with the PPP”. He said the premier “urged Nawaz Sharif to ask Maryam Nawaz to adopt a reconciliatory approach and end the ongoing acrimony with the PPP leadership over flood and canal issues.

Shehbaz, Dar to leave for Malaysia today

“Nawaz Sharif was also briefed on the PPP’s grievances over administrative and development-related matters, with both leaders agreeing that unity within the coalition was essential to sustain the government’s stability.”
However, in its official statement, the PML-N said the prime minister briefed the party chief on his recent foreign visits and provided a detailed update on the situation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including the outcome of successful negotiations with the protesters.
The war of words between the two coalition partners began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River (six canals issue).
Maryam Nawaz told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself, while the latter had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sessions to protest her diatribe and demanded apology from her.
However, CM Maryam declared she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst over flood and canal issues.
As the tensions escalated further, the PPP publicly repeated Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) allegations that Maryam Nawaz did not represent the people of Punjab stating that her government was a “by product of Form 47”.
PPP’s central information secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan said Maryam Nawaz, who called those raising public issues ‘the enemies of Punjab’, was herself the real problem of Punjab.
“The CM Punjab is demonstrating racist thinking to hide her failure to save the people from floodwaters,” he remarked.
PM’s Malaysia visit
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz would leave for Malaysia for a two-day visit at the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim from Oct 5 to 7, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday.
The FO said PM Shehbaz, Foreign Minister and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, federal ministers and senior government officials will depart for Malaysia on Sunday. “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” it added.
A PML-N statement said Mr Ibrahim had also extended an invitation to party chief and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif to visit Malaysia, but he said he would consider the visit at a more suitable time.

• Dozens arrested in London after protesting against ban on a pro-Palestinian group
CAIRO: Over 60 people were killed in Gaza on Saturday as Israel went ahead with its bombardment in defiance of US President Donald Trump’s demand it stop bombing in response to a declaration by Hamas that it was ready to free prisoners under his plan to end the two-year-old conflict.
According to witnesses on the ground, 11 people died in sporadic incidents, while 10 people, including children, were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli strike on a house in Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City. The attack damaged several other buildings nearby.
The Gaza health ministry said in a morning update that Israeli fire had killed at least 66 Palestinians across the enclave over the past 24 hours.
Despite the Israeli action, President Trump said “I appreciate Israel has temporarily stopped the bombing”, and he urged Hamas to move quickly on his plan “or else all bets will be off”.
“I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST. Everyone will be treated fairly!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
 
 

Hamas had drawn a welcoming resp­onse from Trump on Friday by saying it accepted certain key parts of his 20-point peace proposal, including ending the conflict, Israel’s withdrawal and the rele­ase of prisoners, both Israeli and Palestinian.
In Washington, a White House official said Trump was sending his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Egypt to finalise technical details regarding the release of Israeli prisoners and discuss a lasting “peace deal’.
Egypt’s state-affiliated television channel Al QaheraNews said Palestinian and Israeli delegations would also be present for “indirect talks” on the Trump plan.
Hamas’s response to the plan drew a chorus of optimistic statements by world leaders, who urged an end to the conflict.
Another possible boost to hopes came with a supportive statement from the Iran-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which is smaller than Hamas but seen as more hardline. The group, which also holds Israeli prisoners, endorsed Hamas’s response — a move that could help pave the way for the release of Israelis still held by both parties.
‘Immediate implementation’
Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli prisoners following Hamas’s response.
Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce “offensive activity” in Gaza. Trump has invested significant political capital in efforts to end a conflict that has left Israel increasingly isolated on the world stage.
Dozens held in London
Police arrested an unspecified number of protesters for supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group at a demonstration in London on Saturday which went ahead despite requests to call it off after a deadly attack at a synagogue in Manchester two days ago.
Two people were killed in the attack in the north-western English city on Thursday and police shot dead the suspect, a British man of Syrian descent.
Organisers refused requests by police to call off Saturday’s demonstration, which had been announced before the Manchester attack, to protest the banning of pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws.
Calling for calm on X, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “I urge anyone thinking about protesting this weekend to recognise and respect the grief of British Jews.
“This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain. It is a time to stand together.”
 






Police arrested protesters at Trafalgar Square, in central London, as they wrote slogans on placards declaring support for Palestine Action, which was proscribed in July after its members broke into an airbase and damaged military planes.
Hundreds gathered for the protest, applauding and cheering those arrested as they were carried through the crowd by police without resisting. Onlookers chanted “shame on you” at officers.
“I’m disgusted by the police actually, they shouldn’t be arresting non-violent protesters here,” said Angie Zelter. “We have a right to protest and Palestine Action is not a violent organisation, should never have been proscribed in the first place.”
The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests, during which hundreds have been arrested for defying the ban which makes it an offence to show support for Palestine Action. Police said Saturday’s protests would draw resources away from security they have tightened around synagogues and mosques following the attack in Manchester.

However, different countries have implemented various strategies to balance consumer demand, environmental concerns, and industrial priorities.
Experiences from India, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines provide practical insights. Measures such as age limits, pre-export inspections, phased implementation, fiscal incentives, and administrative controls can guide Pakistan in maintaining quality, safeguarding the environment, and balancing consumer access with industrial protection.
As per a report of the Institute of Cost and Management (ICMA), Pakistan’s average import of used cars per year stood at 34,000 units followed by 21,802 by Thailand, 532 by Vietnam and 235 units by India.
Bangladesh permits the import of used cars under specific conditions to balance consumer demand with quality control and revenue generation. As of June 2025, vehicles must be no more than four years old, imported directly from the country of origin, and accompanied by a previous registration or de-registration certificate. The importation process involves customs duties, VAT, and mandatory inspections to ensure compliance with national standards.

Neighbours curb influx of old vehicles through age caps and safety checks

Sri Lanka lifted its five-year ban on private car and motorcycle imports in February 2025, allowing personal use vehicle imports under specific conditions. Individuals are permitted to import one vehicle per year, provided they use a registered vehicle importer. This phased reopening aims to stabilise the market and manage foreign exchange reserves while meeting consumer demand.
India enforces stringent regulations on the importation of used vehicles to protect its domestic automotive industry and ensure compliance with safety and environmental standards. As of 2024, used vehicles must be under three years old, right-hand drive, and meet specific engine capacity restrictions. The import ­process involves extensive documentation, high import duties (up to 125pc for used cars), and mandatory compliance testing. Additionally, a minimum ­roadworthiness period of five years is required from the date of ­importation.
Kenya has implemented a controlled liberalisation approach to used car imports, aiming to balance affordability with environmental and safety considerations. As of July 2025, only vehicles manufactured from July 2018 onward are eligible for import, effectively enforcing a rolling seven-year age limit. This policy is designed to improve air quality, reduce reliance on older vehicles, and support local vehicle assembly. Importers must comply with pre-export inspection requirements and domestic roadworthiness certification.
South Africa restricts used car imports to protect its domestic automotive manufacturing sector. Importation is generally allowed only under specific circumstances, such as for returning nationals or immigrants with permanent residence status.
These individuals may import one vehicle per family, subject to compliance with import duties and VAT. The importation process requires obtaining a permit and adhering to documentation requirements.
Nigeria has tightened its used vehicle import regulations to reduce the influx of older, potentially polluting cars. As of May 2025, only vehicles manufactured in 2015 or later are eligible for import without facing punitive duties. Vehicles older than 10 years are either barred or subjected to heavy import penalties. The import process requires specific documentation, including a bill of lading, bill of entry, marine insurance, and evidence of VAT payment.
 
 

In the Philippines, only qualified individuals may import used vehicles, and they must secure a Certificate of Authority to Import (CAI) from the Fair-Trade Enforcement Bureau (FTEB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) before the actual importation. Imported vehicles are subject to a 40pc customs duty, 10pc VAT, and an ad valorem tax ranging from 15pc to 100pc, depending on the vehicle’s piston displacement.
In the early 1990s, commercial imports of cars were largely prohibited to protect local assemblers. This resulted in fewer cars in the market, higher prices, and limited options for buyers.
In the early 2000s, growing demand for affordable cars led the government to allow imports under special schemes such as the Gift Scheme, Baggage Scheme, and Transfer of Residence Scheme, mainly for overseas Pakistanis. While these cars were meant for personal use, many entered the local market through dealers. Consumers gained more choice and prices dropped slightly, but local carmakers protested, saying these imports hurt their sales and investment.
In 2,005, the government reduced duties, making it easier to import used cars. Consumers accessed small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars, and imports rose quickly. By 2,008, local carmakers lobbied for tighter restrictions, leading to increased duties and a lower age limit for imports. This reduced imports and strengthened local manufacturer protection.
In 2012, the maximum age of imported used cars was cut from five years to three years, sharply reducing inflows. Simultaneously, the Automotive Development Policy (ADP) encouraged investment in local assembly. Some new entrants joined, but car prices remained high and choice limited.
During 2012-2020s, ongoing push and pull consumers continued to complain about high prices, limited choice, and lower safety standards than regional peers. Industry groups warned that too many imports could reduce local investment, slow parts production, and increase pressure on foreign exchange. The government alternated between relaxing and restricting imports, creating a cycle of
policy shifts.
In September 2025, the federal government had allowed commercial imports of used cars up to five years old. Duties will be reduced gradually.
The policy aims to protect local manufacturers, offer consumers more affordable choices, and ensure imported cars meet safety and environmental standards. This is a key step toward a more balanced automotive market.
Passenger vehicles under five years old can be imported commercially until June 30, 2026. A 40pc regulatory duty applies in the first year, reducing by 10pc each year until it reaches zero by FY30.
This phased approach helps balance consumer benefits with protection for local manufacturers. All imported vehicles must meet safety and emission standards, ensuring that older, unsafe, or inefficient vehicles do not enter the market.

A two-member bench, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barech and Justice Sardar Ahmed Halimi issued the order while hearing a petition filed by Advocate Munir Ahmed Kakar on Saturday. Advocate Kakar contended in his petition that despite the passage of considerable time, the Bostan Special Economic Zone had yet to be completed and made fully operational.
During the hearing, Saadullah, Chief Finance Officer of the Industrial Estate Development and Management Company of BSEZ, informed the court that the zone has already become partially operational.
He said that three factories were currently functioning in the zone, while 12 others were under completion and would soon begin operations.

He further informed the court that upon completion, these projects would create 15,520 jobs, marking the start of a new era of industrial development in Balochistan.
He further said that all necessary facilities, including water and power supply, were being ensured. 
The BHC bench, after hearing arguments from both sides, directed the authorities concerned to expedite the remaining work and make the Bostan Special Economic Zone fully operational by Dec 15 deadline.
Officials said that a large number of industrialists were ready to set up industries in the Bostan Special Economic Zone once it became fully functional.
Appellate courts
Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barech has also taken an important administrative step to ensure the effective, timely, and transparent hearing of inheritance cases by designating two special appellate courts in Quetta.
According to an official notification, under the directive of the Chief Justice, the courts of Additional District and Sessions Judge-VIII, Quetta, and Additional District and Sessions Judge-X, Quetta, have been assigned to exclusively hear and decide inheritance-related cases.
As per the decision, all pending inheritance cases previously under other Additional District and Sessions Judges in Quetta will now be transferred to these two designated courts.

He said Balochistan’s identity is built on mutual respect and traditions that uphold justice, and  values of honour, courage, and hospitality.
 
 

IG Tahir said that the people have rendered great sacrifices for peace, and the history written by the martyrs through their sacrifices is commendable. “The forces we are confronting may have deep roots, but we are determined to uproot them completely,” he added.
He emphasised that Balochistan is a bouquet of diversity, and its beauty lies in upholding the rule of law. “It is essential to distinguish between criminals and ordinary citizens, as in this age, the real strength lies with the people,” he stated.

Unlike commodity exports, services exports have recorded positive growth since the beginning of FY26. In July, services exports rose by 18.27pc year-on-year.
According to data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the growth was primarily driven by telecommunication, computer, and information services in July FY26.
In August, services exports reached $671.98 million, up from $619.94m in the same month last year. However, on a month-on-month basis, services exports declined by 7.30pc.

Trade deficit widened amid rising imports in 2MFY26

In rupee terms, exports increased by 9.85pc to Rs189.662 billion in August FY26, compared to Rs172.651bn in August FY25. This indicates a steady upward trend in services exports during the current fiscal year.
During the first two months (July-August) of FY26, services exports totalled $1.396bn, showing an increase of 11.73pc from $1.250bn in the same period last year.
In FY25, Pakistan’s services exports grew by 9.23pc to $8.39bn from $7.68bn a year earlier.
The services sector has shown consistent growth since February 2024, largely due to a surge in IT and other business services exports. However, there was a 6.50pc decline in August 2024.
According to State Bank of Pakistan data, exports of telecommunications, computer, and information services rose to $691m in July—August FY26 from $584m in the same period last year, reflecting a growth of 18.32pc.
Exports of other business services increased by 16.66pc to $301m in 2MFY26, compared to $258m last year. However, transport services exports fell by 4.62pc to $124m from $130m.
Travel services exports declined sharply by 18.91pc to $90m in July–August FY26, compared to $111m in the corresponding period last year.
On the import side, services imports surged by 13.36pc to $1.108bn in August FY26, compared to $978.19m a year ago. Month-on-month, imports rose by 11.43pc.
In the first two months of FY26, services imports reached $2.104bn, up 13.43pc from $1.855bn during the same period last year.
Transport services imports declined by 7.03pc to $766m in 2MFY26, down from $824m last year. In contrast, travel services imports more than doubled, reaching $735m in 2MFY26 from $361m — a growth of 103.6pc.
As a result, the services trade deficit widened by 16.94pc to $707.23m in 2MFY26, compared to $604.79m in the same period last year.

KHUNJERAB Top sees season’s first snowfall, blanketing area near Pakistan-China Gate.—Courtesy GB tourist police

GILGIT: The upper areas of Gilgit-Baltistan on Saturday received the first snowfall of the season, which is seen as a positive sign after years of delayed snowfall linked to climate change that has disrupted the fragile ecosystem and worried local communities.
The lower areas rec­eived scattered rain on Friday and Saturday, bringing a noticeable drop in temperature. According to locals, the areas situated above 12,000 feet, including Khunjerab Top and Babusar Top, received the first snowfall of the season. The snow-covered landscape pushed temperatures below freezing.
 
 

Tourist police said traffic at Babusar Top had been closed at night due to fears of slippery conditions. The Babusar Road, which usually remains open from June to November, is a key route for tourists and local passengers travelling between Gilgit-Baltistan and other parts of the country.
Similarly, the Khunjerab Top area also received up to three inches of snowfall, disrupting travel for vehicles moving between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass. Many areas of Gilgit, Hunza, Nagar, Diamer, Astore and Baltistan divisions received scattered rain, forcing residents to wear warm clothes and make heating arrangements at homes.
 
 

Gilgit-Baltistan experienced devastating floods this summer caused by rapid glacier melt, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), cloudbursts, and landslides. Over 50 people, including tourists, lost their lives, while infrastructure, agricultural land, forests, and private properties worth billions of rupees were destroyed.
In July, temperatures in Chilas soared to 48.5°C — the highest since July 17, 1997, when it reached 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature hit 46.1°C, the highest since 1971. Experts believe that the region, one of the most environmentally sensitive in the world, has been experiencing severe climate change impacts in recent decades. Over the past decade, snowfall in GB has been delayed until late December or even March.
Experts warn that this shift in weather patterns prevents snow from compacting into stable ice, and with the onset of heatwaves, unstable snow melts rapidly, triggering flash floods and Glof events.
Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn that climate change has severely affected the fragile ecosystem of GB, home to over 8,000 glaciers, 30,000 glacial lakes, countless mountains, and vast pastures.
He said unplanned development, rapid tourism, and construction in forested and green-belt areas are damaging the region’s environment. He stressed GB’s vulnerability to climate change and its crucial role as Pakistan’s “water tower,” feeding the Indus River, which supports 70 per cent of the country’s agriculture and 40pc of its hydropower.

According to a notification issued by the cabinet division, Mr Sadiq will perform the functions of the acting president under Article 49(2) of the Cons­titution. He will continue to discharge these responsibilities until the president and Senate chairman return to the country.
After taking charge, Mr Sadiq welcomed the successful negotiations between the government’s negotiation committee and the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee in AJK.
He described the agreement between the two sides as a positive and constructive development, stressing that the restoration of peace and normalcy in the region was a matter of great satisfaction.
Mr Sadiq said that with the successful negotiations, all baseless rumours and conspiracies against Pakis­tan had been laid to rest.
He commended both the government’s negotiation team and the committee for their responsible and result-oriented approach.
The acting president reiterated that public welfare and peace remain the government’s top priority. He urged all stakeholders to focus on unity and national development rat­her than giving attention to unfounded rumours.
“Pakistan and Kashmir are inseparable. The protection of the rights of the Kashmiri people will always remain our foremost priority,” he added.
