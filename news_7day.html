Mahathir, leader of the Southeast Asian nation for more than two decades, has a history of heart problems and has undergone bypass surgeries. He has been hospitalised repeatedly in recent years, most recently in October for a respiratory infection.
He was under observation at the National Heart Institute in Kuala Lumpur for fatigue-related issues on Sunday, his office said. “Mahathir has been allowed home as of 4:45pm (0845 GMT, 1:45pm PKT),” it said in a statement.
A physician who was a member of parliament until 2022, Mahathir drove himself on Sunday to the celebration, which also marked the 99th birthday of his wife, Hasmah Mohd Ali, a day earlier, local media reported.
The reports said he cycled for an hour before appearing tired. His birthday was on Thursday.
Mahathir was prime minister for 22 years until 2003. He returned as premier in 2018 after leading the opposition coalition to a historic win, but his government collapsed in less than two years due to infighting.</p><small>2025-07-13 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/131616297404d29.jpg?r=164404' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923930/sindh-police-form-special-investigation-team-to-probe-into-death-of-humaira-asghar' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh police form special investigation team to probe into death of Humaira Asghar</strong></a><br><p>Police have formed a special investigation team to investigate the death of actor Humaira Asghar Ali, it emerged on Sunday.
On Friday, Humaira was laid to rest in the Model Town Q Block graveyard in Lahore after a sparsely-attended funeral, days after her body was discovered at her apartment in Karachi.
An autopsy report by police surgeon Summaiya Syed, seen by Dawn.com, confirmed that the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition” and at least eight months old.
According to the notification, available with Dawn.com issued by South Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mahzoor Ali, “A special team comprising of the following officers/officials is hereby constituted under the supervision of Deputy Superintendent of Police Imran Ali Jagrani (Clifton Division Acting Superintendent of Police) in connection with recovered dead body of Humaira Asghar Ali in the jurisdiction of Gizri Police Station.”
The team will be headed by Defence Sub-Divisional Police Officer Aurangzaib Khattak with South Assistant Superintendent of Police Nida Junaid, Gizri Station House Officer (SHO) Muhammad Farooq, Sub-Inspector Muhammad Amjad and IT Branch Police Constable Muhammad Adeel as its members.
The notification directed the team to inquire into the facts and thoroughly investigate the death of Humaira to ascertain the cause of death, whether natural, accidental, suicidal or murder, by utilising all available resources and submit a progress report to the SSP’s office on a daily basis.
The autopsy report was released to the police, but the coroner could not determine the actor’s cause of death due to the level of decomposition.
Police had earlier said that when approached, her family in Lahore — particularly her father — refused to take the body for burial, triggering shock across the entertainment industry.
On Thursday, her brother Naveed Asghar arrived in Karachi to take the body to Lahore for burial. Police had stated that the actor’s body would be handed over to her brother after DNA matching.
Speaking to journalists, Naveed said, “The body was in police custody. The police had kept the body for investigation before calling us (the family) to claim it.”
He said that for the last three days, the family was in contact with Chhipa and the police.
 
 

“According to the guidelines, we were [eventually] going to receive the body and perform the rites,” he said.
Besides being a theatre, film and TV artist, Humera was also a visual artist who studied at Punjab University’s Fine Arts Department and did a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in painting. During her university days, she had interaction with theatre groups such as Natak, led by Dr Ahmed Bilal, which was a university-based theatre group consisting of students.
She had interactions with Amjad Islam Amjad, Qavi Khan and other senior actors who used to visit the university for lectures. In her early years of performing art, she did about four or five Pakistan television plays. She also extensively did socially relevant and objective theatre those days.</p><small>2025-07-13 11:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/131304554715319.png?r=134031' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923918/pti-shows-willingness-to-talk-but-demands-accountability-from-institutions' target='_blank'><strong>PTI shows willingness to talk but demands ‘accountability’ from institutions</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Saturday called on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI, but demanded that they hold themselves accountable.
Gandapur and the PTI’s top leadership are on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a movement to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 — marking two years since the ex-premier was imprisoned.
Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, which he claims are politically motivated, his party’s relationship with the government and the establishment has turned exceedingly sour. The PTI has held several protests over the last year, most of which escalated into violence after facing state repression.
Addressing a press conference flanked by PTI’s Punjab leadership, CM Gandapur said: “We have to correct our institutions ourselves. Come, sit together, own your mistakes and move forward.”
He recalled that Imran, despite his wife also being imprisoned in a graft case, had repeatedly said he was ready to talk for the sake of the country.
 


Imran was jailed on Aug 5, 2023 in a case related to state gifts, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million graft case and faces pending trials related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
In the wake of the nationwide May 9 protests, which saw important military installations come under attack, thousands of PTI workers and almost the entire top-tier leadership were rounded up, with many still facing court proceedings under serious charges.
The military considers the PTI the “planners and architects” of the May 9 riots and has demanded an apology from Imran, who in turn claimed that the army owes an apology to him since he was “abducted” by the Rangers on May 9. However, days later, he offered to apologise on the condition that the involvement of PTI supporters in the violent protests was proved through CCTV evidence.
At today’s press conference, Gandapur was accompanied by PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja, Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar, KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati and MNA Latif Khosa.
“Come and talk, acknowledge and correct your mistakes,” Gandapur reiterated today, noting that it was everyone’s collective responsibility to think about Pakistan’s future.
“The state institutions, whose duty is not to engage in politics, are playing every role in forming, running and overthrowing governments,” the PTI leader alleged. “And when you ask, they reply with delight that ‘we are non-political’.”
 
 

Gandapur, stressing that he was a soldier’s son and brother, said: “My military is being defamed due to a few wrong people and their decisions.”
“The state institutions have ignored their duties which are stated in the Constitution and are instead doing other work, due to which terrorism has [risen] in the country,” he said, adding that the security situation in KP and Balochistan had worsened because “those responsible for guarding the borders were chasing the PTI instead”.
The KP CM quipped: “Where are those who imposed martial laws? They are not in Pakistan today. Who is suffering? My Pakistanis.”
The chief minister called for a dialogue “based on reasons”, saying he was ready to be punished severely if it was proven that he “conspired”. “Whoever’s mistake there is, they will admit it […] we are ready if they punish us, but if the matter comes to punishment, then every person [responsible] will be punished.”
Asked if the PTI would hold a dialogue with the military establishment or politicians, Gandapur said that decision was up to Imran, noting he has previously stated that talks must be held with “decision-makers” but there was no objection to government officials being included in the process.
The PTI leader urged “those who are the beneficiaries of this system and those who have hijacked it” to hold talks, stressing that they are “answerable” and “must bear the burden” for the country’s economic situation and heightened terrorism.
Gandapur also assailed the 26th Amendment passed in October last year, saying the judiciary had been “handcuffed” through it.
 
 

Gandapur called on the political parties in the ruling coalition to go into the public, which he said had “rejected” them.
He cautioned that those parties will then face the consequences later on of the “culture” they had developed. Addressing their supporters, he said, “They (leaders of other political parties) will flee abroad. You have to stay here.”
He asked if it was “right as a human and a Muslim” if a PTI leader’s home was raided and their privacy was violated. “If you are silent on this, then if this happens to you tomorrow, then no one will raise a voice for you either.”
‘90 days to decide whether to continue politics’
Speaking about the PTI’s new movement, Gandapur referred to a “90-day announcement” made yesterday by his party, saying that they had begun from today.
He said the PTI has given itself 90 days to decide on its future. He detailed: “On August 5, we will take the movement to its peak through political means while following the laws and the Constitution.
“[…] We have set our targets that we have to decide within 90 days whether we should even do politics in this country […] if politics do not lead to a result, then we will let you know about our plan of action that will come forward.”
“Hum aar ya paar karein gain (We will either do or die),” the KP CM said, adding there was no use of politics in the country as “there is no politics”. He called the public to let the system continue as is if they wanted to remain “slaves” or join the PTI’s movement if they wanted “freedom”.
 
 

Responding to a query, Gandapur said that Imran was “leading the movement himself”.
Thanking PTI workers, leaders, its lawmakers and overseas supporters, Gandapur vowed to organise a grassroots movement upwards from the streets, towns, and cities.
A caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as MPA Bhachar, reached Lahore via G.T. Road yesterday evening. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign seeking Imran’s release.
The PTI in the northern Punjab region has decided to rely on its grassroots workers to galvanise its support — a move which contrasts with its earlier practice of depending on heavyweights to drum up support for its protests.</p><small>2025-07-13 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/13161703ac1e89e.jpg?r=161923' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923928/iranian-president-lightly-injured-in-israeli-strike-during-war-last-month-report' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian president lightly injured in Israeli strike during war last month: report</strong></a><br><p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained minor leg injuries during an Israeli strike that targeted a meeting of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council during the war between both countries last month, the Fars News Agency reported.
According to the report on Saturday, the missile attack occurred on June 17 as top Iranian leaders, including the heads of the three branches of government, were meeting in a secure lower level of a building in western Tehran.
The strike involved six projectiles that hit the entrances and exits of the building, an approach similar to an assassination operation on Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Fars said.
Officials managed to evacuate using a pre-planned emergency hatch, the agency reported, noting that Pezeshkian was “injured during the evacuation but was able to exit safely”.
 
 

The report also said Iranian authorities suspect a possible internal leak, citing the accuracy of the strike.
Fars criticised Western and Israeli-affiliated media outlets for ignoring a “blatant act of state terrorism” while condemning Iranian leaders’ religious rulings against figures like US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
A 12‑day armed conflict between Israel and Iran erupted on June 13 after Tel Aviv launched airstrikes on Iranian military, nuclear and civilian sites, killing at least 606 people and injuring 5,332, according to Iran’s Health Ministry.
Tehran launched retaliatory missile and drone strikes on Israel, killing at least 29 people and wounding more than 3,400, according to figures released by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
The conflict came to a halt under a US-sponsored ceasefire that took effect on June 24.</p><small>2025-07-13 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/131437140a4807c.jpg?r=144035' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923921/people-downstream-tarbela-dam-warned-of-water-release-as-spillways-to-be-opened' target='_blank'><strong>People downstream Tarbela Dam warned of water release as spillways to be opened</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority ((PDMA) on Sunday issued a warning for people downstream to stay away from the banks of the Indus River ahead of the Tarbela Dam’s spillways being opened.
A PDMA alert issued today said the spillways would be opened at 2:30pm on Sunday, with the water level likely to reach 160,000 to 260,000 cusecs due to the release of water from the dam.
It cautioned that flooding is likely in the Indus River and its tributaries and canals.
“The PDMA directs the district administration to keep the local population alert,” the notification said, urging the public to avoid going near rivers and canals.
It also cautioned parents that children should not go near canals.
“Fishermen and livestock keepers should move to safer places,” the advisory said. Tourists and locals were urged to heed the advisory.
 
 

“In case of any untoward situation, the public should call 1700,” the PDMA said.
A similar warning was issued earlier this month, with sources telling Dawn that the spillways of the Tarbela Dam were likely to be put into operation for the first time in the flood season 2025.
On Friday, the National Emer­gencies Operation Centre (NEOC) of the National Disa­ster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a weather alert warning that moderate to heavy monsoon rains are expected to affect multiple regions of the country for a three-day period commencing from July 13 (Sunday).
The forecast indicates moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall across various regions of Pakistan, as a result of which substantial rises in river flows were expected — most notably in the Indus, Kabul, Jhelum (upstream of Mangla), and Chenab rivers.
The advisory stated that Tarbela, Taunsa, and Guddu barrages were currently at low flood levels, while Kalabagh and Chashma were at medium flood levels.</p><small>2025-07-13 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1313592569d3398.jpg?r=155617' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923920/north-koreas-kim-offers-russia-full-support-on-ukraine-in-lavrov-talks' target='_blank'><strong>North Korea’s Kim offers Russia full support on Ukraine in Lavrov talks</strong></a><br><p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un offered Moscow his full support for its war in Ukraine during talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Pyongyang state media said on Sunday.
Lavrov’s visit to North Korea was the latest in a series of high-profile trips by top Moscow officials as both countries deepen military and political ties amid Russia’s offensive against Kyiv.
Pyongyang sent thousands of troops to Russia’s Kursk region to oust Ukrainian forces and has also provided the Russian army with artillery shells and missiles.
Moscow said Lavrov’s talks with Kim were held in a “warm comradely atmosphere”.
Lavrov expressed “sincere gratitude to Pyongyang” for its role in Kursk and support of Russia’s operation, the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
 
 

Moscow also said the two sides “agreed” that the West was to blame for “the growing tension” on the Korean peninsula.
The ministry earlier posted a video on Telegram of the two men shaking hands and greeting each other with a hug.
It said the talks were held in Wonsan, a city on North Korea’s east coast where a massive resort was opened earlier this month — one of leader Kim’s pet projects.
Kim told Lavrov that Pyongyang was “ready to unconditionally support and encourage all the measures taken by the Russian leadership as regards the tackling of the root cause of the Ukrainian crisis,” the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
The North Korean leader also expressed a “firm belief that the Russian army and people would surely win victory in accomplishing the sacred cause of defending the dignity and basic interests of the country”.
He lauded Putin’s “outstanding leadership”, the report said.
The two men otherwise discussed “important matters for faithfully implementing the agreements made at the historic DPRK-Russia summit talks in June 2024”, KCNA said, referring to North Korea by its official acronym.
Lavrov told Kim that Putin “hopes for continued direct contacts in the very near future”, according to Russia’s TASS news agency.
He left Pyongyang and landed in Beijing on Sunday to attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Foreign Ministers’ Council, TASS reported on its Telegram account.
 


Invincible alliance
Ahead of Lavrov’s recent visit, Russia announced that it would begin twice-a-week flights between Moscow and Pyongyang.
Lavrov lauded Wonsan as “a good tourist attraction”, adding: “We hope it will be popular not only with local citizens, but also with Russians.”
KCNA also issued a statement today on the meeting between Lavrov and his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui, held a day earlier in the coastal city, saying that bilateral ties were becoming an “invincible alliance”.
Moscow “expressed its firm support for the DPRK side in its just efforts for defending the security of the state” during the meeting, KCNA said.
In return, Choe demonstrated “full sympathy and support for all the measures taken by the Russian government to remove the root cause of the Ukrainian conflict”.
TASS earlier reported that Lavrov thanked the “heroic” North Korean soldiers who have been deployed to aid Russia during the ministerial meeting.
 
 

Around 600 North Korean soldiers have been killed and thousands more wounded fighting for Russia, Seoul has said.
North Korea only confirmed it had deployed troops to support Russia’s war in April, and admitted its soldiers had been killed in combat.
Both sides “emphasised their determination to jointly counter the hegemonic aspirations of extra-regional players, which are leading to escalating tensions in Northeast Asia and throughout the Asia-Pacific region”, Russia’s foreign ministry said.
The two heavily sanctioned nations signed a military deal last year, including a mutual defence clause, during a rare visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Pyongyang.</p><small>2025-07-13 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/13132804ee4e137.jpg?r=132949' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923917/4-members-of-womans-family-killed-by-husband-his-relatives-in-kps-nowshera-police' target='_blank'><strong>4 members of woman’s family killed by husband, his relatives in KP’s Nowshera: police</strong></a><br><p>Four members of a woman’s family were shot dead a day ago in the Tatara area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Nowshera district, allegedly by her husband and in-laws over a domestic dispute, police said on Sunday.
Nowshera police spokesperson, Turk Ali Shah, told Dawn.com that a first information report (FIR) has been lodged at the Akbarpura police station under section 302 (intentional murder) and section 324 (attempt to commit murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of the woman, whose parents, brother, and uncle were killed in the attack allegedly by her husband, his two brothers and father.
According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the complainant, a mother of two, said she married her husband a few years ago, but since then had been facing domestic issues and was living with her parents for the last four months. She stated that she had been pursuing a court case seeking a separate residence from her husband, refusing to continue living with her in-laws.
“The court recently asked my husband for a patch-up with me on the issue. He came to my parents’ home for reconciliation but started arguing with my family,” she said in the report.
The complainant said her brother-in-law, who was standing outside her parents’ house armed with weapons, came inside and opened fire at her parents and brother, killing them instantly.
Police spokesperson Shah said, “Efforts were underway to arrest the suspects who had fled the scene after the incident.”
Domestic disputes are not uncommon in Pakistan, often triggered by financial issues, inheritance, or family interference. In some cases, these escalate due to a lack of conflict resolution mechanisms, weak legal enforcement, and deeply rooted patriarchal norms.
Nowshera Police last month arrested the prime suspect in the murder of three children, with the alleged killer revealed to be the victims’ grandmother, according to a statement issued by Nowshera police.
On June 6, a man allegedly shot dead his son and daughter-in-law following an argument in the Tangi area of Charsadda district, police said.
In March, a man allegedly shot his elderly mother and two siblings dead in Nowshera district, a police spokesperson said. Rescue 1122 spokesperson said the suspect allegedly opened fire on his 82-year-old mother, brother and sister after a heated argument over power supply lines.</p><small>2025-07-13 10:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/131317461d21859.jpg?r=132004' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923916/farm-worker-dies-after-us-immigration-raid-on-cannabis-farm-in-california' target='_blank'><strong>Farm worker dies after US immigration raid on cannabis farm in California</strong></a><br><p>A farm worker has died after being injured during a raid by US immigration agents on a legal cannabis farm in California, his family said on Saturday.
Raids on agricultural sites on Thursday resulted in the arrests of 200 undocumented migrants, as part of US President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging anti-immigration crackdown, and clashes between law enforcement officials and protesters.
The farm worker’s family had started a page on the fundraising platform GoFundMe to help support his relatives in Mexico.
On Saturday, the page posted an update to say he had “passed away.”
Trump campaigned for the presidency on a harsh anti-immigration platform, likening undocumented migrants to “animals” and “monsters,” and since taking office he has delivered on promises to conduct a massive deportation drive.
On Friday, he called demonstrators involved in attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents “slimeballs” and said they should be arrested.
The chaotic raid on the cannabis plantation in Ventura County, about 90 kilometres from Los Angeles, saw the worker who later died being chased by ICE agents, his family said.
“My uncle Jaime was just a hard-working, innocent farmer,” said a post on the GoFundMe page. “He was chased by ICE agents, and we were told he fell 30ft (9 meters).”
The page described his injuries as “catastrophic.”
Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman, said he was never in custody.
“Although he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a green house and fell 30 feet,” McLaughlin said.
“(Customs and Border Patrol) immediately called a medevac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.”
DHS said 200 undocumented migrants were arrested during raids on marijuana growing sites in Carpinteria and Camarillo on Thursday and 10 children were rescued “from potential exploitation, forced labor, and human trafficking.”
Glass House Brands, which owns the farms, said in a statement that it has “never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors.”
DHS said more than 500 “rioters” had attempted to disrupt the operation and four US citizens are facing charges for assaulting or resisting officers.
Tear gas was used against the protesters, some of whom were seen in television footage throwing projectiles at law enforcement vehicles.
The department said immigration agency vehicles were damaged and a $50,000 reward was being offered for the arrest of an individual who allegedly fired a gun at law enforcement officers.
American dream ‘no longer’
In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he had watched footage of “thugs” throwing rocks and bricks at ICE vehicles, causing “tremendous damage.”
Trump said he was authorizing law enforcement officers who are “on the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these SLIMEBALLS, using whatever means is necessary to do so.”
“I am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public,” he said.
Trump has been involved in a showdown over immigration enforcement with Democratic-ruled California for weeks.
The Republican president sent thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles last month to quell protests against round-ups of undocumented migrants by federal agents.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.
The cannabis farm in Camarillo was calm during a visit by an AFP reporter on Friday, as workers waited in line to collect their belongings and paychecks.
“We’ve been here since six this morning asking questions but they’re not giving us any information,” said Saul Munoz, a 43-year-old Colombian whose son was detained on Thursday.
“I just want to know how he’s doing,” Munoz said. “Bring him back to me and if it’s time for us to leave, we’ll leave.
“The truth is the American dream is no longer really the American dream.”</p><small>2025-07-13 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1311404607e34b5.png?r=135256' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923882/ptis-five-jailed-leaders-demand-fresh-election' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s five jailed leaders demand fresh election</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s five senior leaders incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat Jail have demanded fresh, free and fair general elections in the country, while learning lessons from the 1970 debacle, otherwise India will go ahead with its nefarious designs.
In an open letter on Saturday, PTI vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Dr Yasmin Rashid and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed stated that Pakistan’s two provinces, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, were undergoing the worst kind of terrorism, turmoil and instability.
They said both provinces were geologically important for having natural and mineral reserves, and the world was also eyeing those resources.
“Those rare earth materials had become significantly important for the outside world,” they highlighted.
The PTI leaders said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been a peaceful province during the PTI’s rule owing to former premier Imran Khan’s balanced policy but before and after Khan, the province remained a hub of terrorism that destroyed the economy and the society.
 
 

They said Islamabad’s relations with Kabul were strained for the past three years and on the other hand, Russia had accepted Taliban’s government in Afghanistan.
“The Afghan nation that continued calling Pakistan as its second home, is not only annoyed but opposing Pakistan,” the letter stated and added that friends had turned into foes and enemy’s proxies were attacking Pakistan from the land called ‘strategic depth’.
The PTI leaders said the federal government’s non-cooperation with the people-mandated KP government was a failed policy and asked how shunning dialogue was a wise approach.
Speaking about Balochistan, the party’s jailed leaders said the province had become a hub of anti-state elements and the law and order was so precarious that dozens of terrorism incidents had been reported during the past two weeks or so.
 
 

They regretted that both federal and Balochistan province governments had no idea about the gravity and seriousness of the situation.
“Both the governments, making tall claims, using state power and arresting Baloch leaders, were actually further deteriorating law and order instead of curbing terrorism in the province.”
The PTI leaders said Balochistan’s position required a serious situation analysis as the foreign infiltration and local issues needed to be tackled separately.
They regretted that the Balochistan government too was a fake-mandated Form-47 government and was contributing to increasing problems rather than resolving issues.

According to the PTI, a top official of the Pakistan government has said that the national team will not be sent to India if there are security threats to them.
Pakistan are scheduled to participate in the Asia Cup being held in Rajgir, Bihar, from Aug 27 to Sept 7, for which the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has sought clearance from the government. Pakistan are also due to feature in the FIH Junior World Cup, to be staged in Chennai in November-December this year.
Rana Mashhood Khan, who is the chairman of Prime Minister’s Youth Development and Sports Programme, said that the Pakistan teams would travel to India for the said events if the government was totally satisfied with the security situation in the neighbouring country.
Also on Saturday, a report by AFP news agency citing government sources said that Pakistan will not travel to India for upcoming hockey tournaments over “security” concerns, potentially jeopardising their place in next year’s World Cup.
The nuclear-armed neighbours traded the worst violence in decades during a four-day conflict in the month of May that killed 70 people.
“After the recent war the security and safety of our hockey players will be at risk,” said a Pakistan sports ministry source, who asked not to be identified.
Pakistan will also not participate in the Junior World Cup in India, the source added.
Once a top force in international hockey, with three Olympic gold medals and four World Cup titles, Pakistan in recent decades have slumped to 15th in the world rankings.
Not featuring in the Asia Cup will likely cost Pakistan a place in next year’s senior World Cup to be held in the Netherlands and Belgium.
A second government source also confirmed the decision to AFP.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office did not respond to AFP’s request for comment.
India stalled all bilateral sporting ties with Pakistan in the wake of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which it blamed on militants based across the border.
Cricket since then has been the most affected sport, with the two countries only meeting each other in multinational events abroad.
India refused to visit Pakistan earlier this year when it hosted the ICC Champions Trophy, forcing the final — featuring India — to be staged on a neutral venue in Dubai.
In a tit-for-tat move, Pakistan will also not send its women’s cricket team to India for the 50-over World Cup later this year and the T20 World Cup in 2026. They agreed instead to play their matches in Sri Lanka.
Pakistan’s hockey team last toured India for the 2023 Asian Champions Trophy, finishing fifth amongst six teams.

The individual, identified as Irfan from Dera Ghazi Khan, was mistakenly presumed dead due to a mix-up in the identification of bodies.
Commandant Border Military Police Dera Ghazi Khan Asad Chandia (who had supervised transportation of bodies from Balochistan border to their native areas in Punjab) told that Irfan was among the 12 passengers who were forcibly offloaded from the bus by armed assailants. However, Irfan managed to escape execution.
The commandant said following his escape, Irfan did not return to the passenger coach but instead took an alternative vehicle to reach his native village, Wasti Buzdar, tehsil Taunsa Sharif. At present he is in a state of shock according to his family, Chandia said.
 
 

One Kashif, who is an employee of 1122 and hails from the same village, told Dawn that Irfan successfully escaped execution by hiding his mobile phone and identity card.
Due to his absence from the passenger list during the recovery process, authorities mistakenly identified the body of another victim, Sheikh Majid, as that of Irfan.
The confusion was cleared when local administration contacted Irfan Buzdar’s family to identify the body and they confirmed that Irfan had returned home safely but was not ready to give detail of his ordeal.
This revelation raises questions about the accuracy of initial reports and identification processes.
The Loralai attack, allegedly carried out by militants linked to the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), resulted in the deaths of nine passengers. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation and renewed concerns over passenger safety in the region.
Talking to Dawn, DGK Deputy Commissioner Usman Khalid said the district administration does not allow public transport to enter Balochistan at night in order to prevent any untoward incidents. However, the recent fatal attack, which occurred in broad daylight, has raised serious concerns about the safety of commuters who prefer to travel during the day to avoid such threats.
 
 

In December 2023, Dera Ghazi Khan had received bodies of six barbers from Waziristan and three from Balochistan in January 2024.
Heirs of six barbers had also received compensation from government but the families of three truckers Ahmed Rasheed Zuhrani (23), two brothers Syed Ali Haider (16) and Syed Kumail Haider (25) could not get financial aid despite the fact that the DGK district government had officially requested and wrote to the provincial government for the compensation.

It is pertinent to mention that the people of three union councils were affected with the construction of 11.80 megawatt Karora Hydropower Project. The jirga was led by the renowned political and social figure, Nawaz Khan Shangla and advocate Naeem Sahib.
The negotiations were attended by the provincial minister for energy, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Mr Tariq Sadozai, Deputy Commissioner Shangla, Mr Fawad Khan, and CEO PEDO, Mr Irfan Wazir, along with a high-level government delegation.
The government expressed readiness to resolve the public issues after advocate Naeem and Nawaz Khan Shangla briefed the jirga in detail about the problems being faced by the people and their legitimate demands.
The agreement led to an additional public welfare package, which included schools, infrastructure development, and water supply schemes, while the energy minister assured full support for protecting the rights of the people of the three union councils at every forum.
New micro and mini hydel projects for the three union councils were also approved, and it was also agreed that the installation costs of new electricity meters will be collected from the public in easy installments, and the matter would be taken up with the Pesco. They also agreed on a formula to provide electricity at lower rates for the benefit the local population.
Furthermore, a committee has been constituted under the supervision of the deputy commissioner Shangla to ensure construction of transmission lines, costing Rs48.5 crores. This committee will include representatives from the jirga and the Pesco.
Moreover, the energy minister assured that people from the three union councils and Shangla would be given priority for jobs at all levels.

The police produced suspect Hashir Umar before the court on completion of his four-day physical remand.
The investigating officer informed the court that the process of determining the suspect’s exact age was still underway and that a co-suspect was yet to be arrested. He sought remand of the suspect for further investigation.
However, the magistrate turned down the request, sending the suspect on judicial remand.
 
 

The magistrate noted that no significant progress had been made in the investigation during the previous remand of the suspect. He said a mere claim of requiring more time for age determination or arresting a co-suspect was insufficient to justify extending physical remand.
He further noted that the report regarding the suspect’s age can be submitted at the time of filing the challan (charge sheet).
“It is settled law that physical remand cannot be given mechanically,” the magistrate said in his order.
Rejecting the request for the remand, the magistrate directed the police to produce the suspect again on July 26.
According to police, the underage driver was driving a black SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle) at over 120kph on a road leading to a village in Shahdara when he hit at least three motorcycles.
Malik Amin died on the spot while his brother Malik Farid was among the injured persons who were shifted to a local hospital. Initial investigation reveals the SUV belongs to the owner of the house where the boy lives along with his maternal grandmother.

“The use of Article 63(2) [of the Constitution] will not only constitute a misapplication of Constitutional provisions but will also set an unrestrained and troubling precedent, potentially affecting the sanctity of legislative forums across the country,” Mr Swati noted in a letter to Speaker of the Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan.
On June 27, the Punjab Assembly’s speaker ordered the suspension of 26 opposition MPAs for 15 sessions after their protests disrupted the speech of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and caused chaos in the house.
Days later, he filed a disqualification reference against them with the Election Commission of Pakistan. Of those MPAs, 17 were listed as members to the Sunni Ittehad Council, which the PTI-affiliated election candidates joined last year after their party was deprived of its election symbol of cricket bat. However, at least eight others were declared PTI lawmakers.

Insists invoking Article 63(2) of Constitution can undermine legislative autonomy

In the letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Mr Swati said that he had come to know that in exercise of powers conferred upon the speaker under Rule 210(3) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997, read with Rule 223 of the ibid Rules, an order was issued on June 27 to suspend 26 members of the Punjab Assembly from the opposition benches for 15 sittings of the assembly.
“It has also been reported in print and electronic media that the treasury benches have filed a disqualification reference under Article 63(2), read with Article 113, of the Constitution before your good office against the said 26 members, and proceedings to that effect may be initiated subsequently,” Mr Swati formally told his counterpart in Punjab.
He insisted that Rule 210(3) of the rules served the vital purpose of maintaining order and decorum within the house, and compliance with rules of procedure was essential for upholding constitutional governance.
“However, to invoke Article 63(2) in this context raises serious constitutional concerns. The disqualification clause should not be used as a punitive measure for conduct within the legislative chamber, particularly when such conduct has already been addressed through suspension under the Assembly’s Rules of Procedure,” he said.
Mr Swati said that invoking Article 63(2) against the opposition lawmakers risked undermining the autonomy and dignity of elected assemblies.
“Proceedings within the house and the privileges of its members are protected under Articles 66 and 69, read with Article 127 of the Constitution. These provisions affirm the inviolability of legislative proceedings and guard against external interference in the conduct of business within the House,” he noted in the letter.
The KP Assembly’s speaker said the moment called for the promotion of democratic norms and culture at all levels of governance.
He said that it was imperative that all elected representatives, along with political leadership across party lines, adopted a constructive and statesmanlike approach.
“We must work to reduce political polarisation, foster reconciliation and reinforce the credibility of our democratic institutions, such action, vis-a-vis the constitutional mandate and disciplinary authority of the provincial assembly, would set an unprecedented and unconstitutional precedent, with far-reaching implications for the future functioning of legislative assemblies across the country, to be reconsidered hopefully,” he noted in the letter to the Punjab Assembly’s speaker.

The new air service will help facilitate commerce, reduce travel time and costs for traders, and strengthen bilateral ties, said Ali Reza Rajai, Iran’s acting consul general in Quetta.
The announcement was made at a ceremony organised by the Pak-Iran Joint Chamber of Commerce.
The flights are intended “to facilitate trade and travel between Pakistan and Iran,” Rajai said, stressing the need for stronger cooperation.
Top officials from the airline, including Iran Air Chief Agha Karimi and Deputy Chief Agha Ismail, were also in attendance.
Mr Rajai said the new service would be critical for enhancing port-to-port cooperation between Pakistan’s Gwadar Port and Iran’s Chabahar Port.
He called for bureaucratic hurdles to be removed to improve bilateral business, including streamlined visa processes and affordable fares.

A bench consisting of Justice Wiqar Ahmad and Justice Sadiq Ali observed in a verdict that the existence of an alternate remedy — filing appeal under the Army Act — was not an absolute bar to exercise constitutional jurisdiction of the high court.
Referring to the May 7, 2025, short order of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench in the military courts cases, the bench pointed out that the apex court had held the same remedy (appeal under Army Act) to be inefficacious and for that reason, the federal government was directed to make necessary legislation for providing a right of appeal before the respective high courts.
“Additionally, it has already been clarified that individual cases/writ petitions if pending or filed before the High Courts for challenging vires of orders passed by Anti-Terrorism Court allowing transfer of cases or custody of an accused for military trial should be decided by the High Courts on its own merit,” the bench observed.

Declares convicts have right to court martial records

The bench issued the order while declaring a petition jointly filed by three convicts of a military court, who were sentenced to 10-year rigorous imprisonment for attacking military places during the May 9-10, 2023, violent protests in Mardan district.
It sought comments within a fortnight from the respondents including the federal secretaries of defense and interior and the relevant Field General Court Martial (FGCM) through its chairperson and the concerned brigadier commander.
The petitioners, including Adnan Ahmad, Rehmatullah and Shakirullah, have requested the court to set aside their conviction and sentences awarded by the FGCM and its confirmation by the concerned brigadier commander, as the same was unconstitutional and arbitrary.
The petitioners claimed that without recourse to the basics of the Constitution and inherent safeguards stipulated within the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 and Pakistan Army Act Rules, 1954, they were tried by the FGCM at Peshawar from Oct 6 till Dec 30, 2023, and consequently they were convicted.
A deputy attorney general Atif Nazir had contended that the petition was not maintainable and may be dismissed by the court. He contended an alternate forum was available to the petitioners, but they had failed in filing an appeal within the required 40 days.
Barrister Amir Khan Chamkani, representing the petitioners contended that the said remedy of filing appeal before Chief of the Army Staff had already been held to be inefficacious by the SC in its order of May 7, 2025. He stated that regarding individual cases/ writ petitions pending or to be filed before a high court, the same were to be decided by the high court on its own merit.
The bench observed that the remedy of appeal under section 133 (B) of Pakistan Army Act was time bound and the same was no longer available after expiry of the limitation period of 40 days.
The bench quoted several paras from the May 7 judgement of the apex court in support of its order.
The bench ruled that this court as a constitutional court couldn’t abdicate its jurisdiction particularly when such jurisdiction had also been held to be available in cases such as convictions in the case “Brigadier (retd) FB Ali versus The State.”
Record of FGCM Proceedings: In its six-page detailed order, the bench also discussed the issue of non-provision of record of proceedings to the petitioners, observing that under Rule 130 of the Pakistan Army Act Rules, every person tried by a court martial had been declared entitled to obtain a copy of proceedings against payment of prescribed fee.
The petitioners had requested for them to provide them with records of FGCM proceedings, including summary of evidence, in their cases as well as order of conviction.
“Only one exception has been provided i.e., where in the opinion of the Chief of Army Staff, supply of any proceedings or part thereof may be prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State,” the bench observed.
It pointed out that the DAG could not produce any order from the COAS that he had withheld delivery of copies to petitioners in the present case for the reason of same being prejudicial- to the safety or interest of the State.
The lawyer for petitioners claimed that his clients had been tried for civil offence and not in offence relating to security of Pakistan.
The bench ruled that it was also constitutional right of petitioners enshrined in Articles 4, 9,10-A and 19-A of the Constitution, that they be allowed copies of proceedings of the trial where-under they had been convicted.
It directed the respondents to annex all such records with their comments, where petitioners would be allowed to obtain copies.

• Gohar says leadership will also take up suspension of 26 MPAs
LAHORE: The PTI top leadership arrived in Lahore on Saturday to devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on Aug 5 to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur describing the Lahore visit as the formal launch of the movement.
Before their departure, the party leaders held a meeting in Islamabad to discuss several issues, including the potential disqualification of the party’s Punjab Assembly lawmakers who had been suspended by the speaker.
In the evening, a caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar reached Lahore via G.T. Road. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign ahead of the two-year anniversary of Imran Khan’s imprisonment on Aug 5.
 






PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party’s parliamentarians were going to Lahore for a meeting and added they would discuss the issue of 26 MPAs, suspended by the Punjab Assembly speaker. “The Punjab government has been unleashing fascism for the past two years, and now it is time that common sense should prevail,” he stressed.
Though there were reports that the Punjab police could block PTI parliamentarians’ entry into Lahore, the leaders had said they would stage a sit-in at the blocked point. However, the parliamentarians, led by CM Gandapur, made a smooth entry and camped at a farmhouse in Raiwind, Lahore.
The police, however, did raid party leaders and workers’ homes throughout the day and even went to the Shahdra Morr – Lahore’s entry point on G.T. Road – and took into custody five leaders, including Yasir Gillani from among those gathered to welcome the PTI caravan.
At a late-night party meeting in Raiwand, CM Gandapur told parliamentarians that they had reached the ‘political hub of the country’ to launch their protest campaign. “Any campaign launched from Lahore earns success and this too will be successful across the country,” he asserted.
Asserting that party leader Imran Khan is in jail for no valid reason, CM Gandapur advised party leaders to move forward through consultations and plans in respective jurisdictions to step up the protest campaign. “All the provinces should prepare their protest plans and implement them in line with their local issues and take the protest campaign to its peak by Aug 5,” he asserted.
He said the establishment had been ruling the country for decades and imposed multiple martial laws as part of different experiments, destroying the country. “The establishment this time has imposed a new kind of martial law, which is not official, but wielding every kind of power and pressure,” he observed and added that it destroyed the country but the perpetrators were not even showing any remorse.
At the meeting, Mr Bhachar said Punjab could not warmly welcome CM Gandapur because a “fascist government” was ruling Punjab that even lacked parliamentary as well as social norms. Mr Bhachar said the party’s 11 MPAs were suspended after Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz came to the assembly and her second visit led to the suspension of 26 members. “This clearly shows the level of fear the Punjab government is facing from PTI’s 107 tigers in the Punjab Assembly,” he asserted.
“Though the PTI leaders and workers are facing thousands of FIRs, the party is all set to launch a massive protest campaign aimed at the release of Imran Khan, his wife and all political leaders,” he added.
While the PTI parliamentarians have camped in Lahore, the party’s Punjab chapter, led by Aliya Hamza Malik, had already mobilised party workers across the province and assigned duties to step up the protest campaign and take to its pinnacle on August 5.
Before leaving for Lahore, the party’s interim chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, while talking to media persons, said that the party had already sent a letter to the provincial government stating that it would hold a meeting in Lahore. However, he made it clear that the party was not planning to hold any rally or public meeting in the provincial capital.

The KPCIP, funded jointly by the Asian De­­velopment Bank (ADB), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the KP government, is aimed at improving urban infrastructure and municipal services in key cities, including Peshawar, Abbottabad, Kohat, Mardan and Mingora. 
Concerns regarding serious procurement violations, non-compliance with engineering and tax laws, and suspected corruption were formally brought to the PAC chairman by some members of the provincial assembly, including Sajjad Ullah of JUI-F, Taj Muhammad, Muhammad Riaz and Munir Hussain Lughmani (independents), and Muhammad Arif of the ruling PTI.
According to a formal complaint, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the joint venture awarded multiple contracts under the KPCIP — comprising Zahir Khan and Brothers and Turkish firm T.T. Sh-Insaat LLC — was allegedly not registered with the FBR, KP Revenue Authority, or Pakistan Engineering Council at the time of bidding. 

Payments allegedly made despite negligible on-ground work

The complaint alleges that not only was the awarding of contracts unlawful, but undue financial favour was extended to the firm, resulting in the disbursement of Rs32bn, despite minimal on-ground physical progress. 
The complainants suggest that false progress certifications, weak oversight, and collusion among consultants and project staff may have enabled the payments.
Taking notice of the allegations, the PAC chairman and KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati has convened a special meeting on July 17.
‘Replies to all allegations’
Kashif Jan, Project Director of Zahir Khan and Brothers, while speaking to Dawn said that he was aware of the allegations made by the MPAs.
“We have been preparing a detailed presentation, for the PAC, in which there will be replies and clarifications to all the allegations. It is not correct that Turkish firm T.T.Sh-Insaat LLC is not registered or contract has been awarded against the rules. 
“Moreover, we have been working transparently and have ensured quality of work in all projects. Zahir Khan and Brothers is a well-reputed firm and we never compromise on quality,” he said. 
Replying to a question, Mr Jan hoped that the PAC will reject the allegations as he has all the relevant documentation.

Speaking to the media in Lahore, Syed Asif Ahmed, General Manager Marketing Division at MG Motors, welcomed the policy as a step in the right direction but criticised the local hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) market for remaining largely unaffordable and inaccessible to the average consumer.
“HEVs in Pakistan have become a luxury item for a niche market,” he said. “Despite policy support, the real benefits have not trickled down to car buyers.”
Mr Ahmed noted that the most expensive hybrid-electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) in the country — a seven-seater — carries an ex-factory price tag of Rs16 million, while five-seater variants are priced between Rs9.6m and Rs12m.

Plug-in hybrids better suited for urban Pakistan, says auto executive

“The industry must seriously consider affordability,” he stressed, adding that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are a better alternative for urban mobility, offering practical electric range alongside hybrid versatility.
The NEV Policy, unveiled by the Ministry of Industries, introduces official classifications for electric vehicles (EVs), PHEVs, and hydrogen-powered vehicles as “New Energy Vehicles”, aligning Pakistan’s regulatory framework with global standards.
Mr Ahmed also criticised earlier tax incentives that allowed traditional hybrids to be classified as NEVs, primarily benefiting established automotive players. “Unfortunately, these subsidies neither served the environment nor the public. They simply padded profits for principal companies and their local partners.”
In contrast, he said, PHEVs offer a meaningful solution: pure electric driving for short urban commutes and hybrid flexibility for longer journeys — addressing the range anxiety often associated with EVs.
He pointed out that affordability remains a major hurdle. Globally, hybrids become financially viable when priced within 10pc of an equivalent petrol vehicle. In Pakistan, however, the price gap is much wider — averaging 45pc.
“For example, a C-segment SUV hybrid can cost up to Rs12m, while its petrol counterpart is priced around Rs8m — a difference of Rs4m,” he said.
While the NEV policy outlines a progressive roadmap, industry implementation remains critical. With more PHEV models expected to enter the market, the key question is whether automakers will pass on incentives to consumers — or repeat the hybrid-era model of high margins and minimal environmental benefit.
“The potential is enormous,” Ahmed concluded. “But only if we prioritise real consumer value and environmental impact over short-term profits.”

According to the biannual performance report (July-December FY25) released by the Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) of the Ministry of Finance, PTCL posted a loss of Rs7.2 billion during the period, pushing its accumulated losses to Rs43.6bn.
The report also noted that PTCL has moved up the ranking of loss-making SOEs, rising from 10th position in the first half of FY24 to 7th place in the current fiscal year.
The finance ministry cautioned that the proposed acquisition of Telenor Pakistan by PTCL, if not carefully managed, could further destabilise the Group’s finances. The ministry warned the move may hinder PTCL’s digital transformation goals and limit its ability to invest in core growth areas over the coming years.

Finance ministry flags risks to Telenor acquisition

The report also highlighted PTCL’s outstanding pension liabilities, which stand at Rs42.84bn.
Notably, PTCL had posted a net profit of Rs20.78bn in 2005-06 — the year its management control was handed over to UAE-based telecom firm Etisalat, which acquired a 26pc stake. The government of Pakistan retains a 62pc shareholding in PTCL, while the remaining 12pc is held by public investors through the stock market.
PTCL Group also comprises Ufone, its cellular subsidiary, and UBank, a microfinance institution.
The finance ministry described the planned acquisition of Telenor Pakistan as a bold strategic step to strengthen PTCL Group’s market position. The move promises potential synergies, cost efficiencies, and an expanded subscriber base. However, it also presents significant risks.

Myanmar has been mired in civil conflict since a military coup in 2021, with the junta battling a coalition of ethnic armed groups and pro-democracy resistance forces.
Saturday’s attack by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) targeted a military base in Kayin state at around 3pm local time, Thailand’s military said in a statement.
One hundred Myanmar soldiers and 467 civilians had crossed into Thailand on Saturday, where Thai military and police disarmed them and provided treatment and humanitarian aid, officials said.

Three kids among 22 civilians killed in monastery bombing

Saw Thamain Tun, a leader of the KNLA’s political wing, confirmed there had been fighting near the border and said that joint forces had “seized some front posts” from the army.
“Some (Myanmar troops) defe­c­ted to our joint forces, but some of them ran into Thailand,” he said.
Myanmar’s civil war has caused huge waves of population displacement, with 81,000 refugees or asylum-seekers from the country currently living in Thailand, according to United Nations figures.
Strike on Buddhist monastery
More than 20 civilians, including children, were killed after an  air strike on a monastery in central Myanmar, an anti-junta fighter and a resident said on Saturday.
Myanmar has been consumed by civil war since the military ousted a democratic government in 2021, and central Sagaing region has been particularly hard-hit, with the junta pummelling villages with air strikes targeting armed groups.
The most recent occurred around 1am on Friday in Lin Ta Lu village when “the monastery hall where internally displaced people were staying” was hit with an air strike, said an anti-junta fighter, requesting anonymity.
He said that 22 people were killed, including three children, while two were wounded and remained in critical condition at the hospital.
“They had thought it was safe to stay at a Buddhist monastery,” the anti-junta fighter said. “But they were bombed anyway.”
Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun did not immediately respond to AFP’s request for comment.

GILGIT: The climbing season on K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum I and Gasherbrum II, has been thrown into disarray, as climate change, unpredictable weather and scant snowfall combine to create perilous conditions for foreign mountaineers.
Dozens of international expeditions are currently stranded at the base camps of the Karakoram giants, anxiously awaiting a safe window to attempt their summits.
Polish mountaineer Waldemar Kow­ale­wski on Friday suffered a leg fracture in an avalanche incident.
A source at base camp said Kowalewski is in a stable condition in a tent at 6,500m, attended by a colleague. A rescue helicopter has been requested from the army.
Traditionally, the main climbing season for these peaks stretches from late June to mid-August. But this year, tour operators say, the risks are unusually high.
“This year, weather at the peaks are not normal,” Iqbal Qadri, a tour operator with five foreign expedition groups waiting at base camps, told Dawn.
“Less snowfall was received in winter, and there are risks of rockfall and snow avalanches.”
Sakhawat Hussain, another tour operator, confirmed that progress on the 8,000-metre peaks has been delayed.
“Even ropes have not been fixed at K2, owing to unstable conditions,” he said, adding that the lack of snow has contributed to the danger.
“There are threats of rockfall at K2 and other eight-thousander peaks this year.”
Experts believe shifting weather patterns, driven by climate change, have upended the climbing season.
Low winter snowfall, followed by intense heat, means snow melts rapidly rather than consolidating into stable ice.

• Notes investment in youth essential for Pakistan’s future success
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to achieving a complete economic turnaround through long-overdue reforms, structural changes and prioritising meritocracy.
Addressing a group of Pakistani students enrolled in leading global educational institutions and selected for the government’s internship initiative ‘Uraan Pakistan’, the prime minister said that when the current government took office in 2023, Pakistan was facing a serious threat of default and its future was hanging in the balance.
 






“The majority believed Pakistan would default, while only a few were optimistic we would avoid disaster,” he said, adding that he held marathon discussions with the IMF managing director and gave firm assurances that Pakistan would not default and would stay committed to the Fund’s programme.
He said that the economy was in a bad shape at that time, with inflation reaching 38 per cent while the policy rate was hovering at 22pc. The PM, in his remarks broadcast on national TV channels, further said that they had a huge responsibility to work together with unity and sincerity to steer the country out of the crisis.
“The joint efforts have paid off as now the policy rate has dropped to below 11pc. The Uraan Pakistan programme has also taken off,” he added.
He also referred to reforms and digitisation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), saying the government had removed corrupt officials without yielding to pressure or favouritism.
“To root out corruption from the FBR, I had a clear vision and took unprecedented decisions, ignoring the culture of favouritism,” he said.
The prime minister noted that earlier, the digitisation process in FBR had only existed on paper, as no practical steps were taken, blaming corrupt and shrewd elements for misleading the system.
Now, he said, digitisation was the hallmark of FBR, where work had been converted from paper-based to digital, with multiple initiatives including AI and faceless interaction.
As a result of the measures, revenue collection in one sector had jumped from Rs12bn to more than Rs50bn in one year, highlighting the extent of previous tax evasion, he maintained.
“We face a long and thorny journey, with mountain-like obstacles, but I assure the nation we will not shy away from fulfilling our responsibilities.”
Underscoring the importance of the country’s youth, he said their role is key to Pakistan’s success, and any investment in them is an investment in the nation.
Responding to students’ queries, the prime minister said that due to climate change, Pakistan had suffered significantly during the 2022 floods, with the economy facing $30 billion in losses, despite the country’s minimal contribution to the global greenhouse effect.
To another question, he said that Pakistan faced India’s uncalled aggression against the backdrop of the Pahalgam incident in May. “I proposed an impartial international investigation, but India never responded,” he said.
He claimed that as a result of Indian aggression, 55 Pakistanis were killed. In self-defence, Pakistan shot down six Indian aircraft. “On May 9 and 10, following India’s attack, Pakistan responded with full might and taught the enemy a lesson,” he said.
The prime minister praised the armed forces for their professionalism and bravery, stating that Pakistan had won the conventional war. He reiterated that Pakistan’s nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes and self-defence.

• Orders issued for immediate restoration of irrigation channels amid drought threat
GILGIT: Extremely high summer temperatures and erratic weather patterns continue to cause destruction in Gilgit-Baltistan, as a cloudburst-induced flood damaged 13 homes, agricultural land, crops, and other properties in Gilgit and Ghizer on Saturday.
The flood also blocked Naltar Highway, Gilgit-Ghizar road and other link roads.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Deputy Director Raja Zahooruddin Babar described the cloudburst as “unprecedented,” as such an event had never been recorded in these areas before.
He said cloudbursts have happened in GB before; however, the scale of the disaster this time was unprecedented.
The cloudburst resulted in a heavy downpour in several areas of Gilgit and Ghizer districts, resulting in flash floods. At least 13 homes were damaged by the deluge along with farmlands, crops, water and irrigation channels and other properties in Shiroot and Shakyot areas of Gilgit.
A flash flood and landslides at Bargo Pari area in Gilgit damaged a car, two motorcycles and a tractor. Falling rocks blocked the Gilgit-Ghizer Road, which disrupted traffic for many hours.
Mr Babar of GBDMA stated that the road was later cleared and reopened for traffic. The authority is assessing damages in the area. No loss of human life or injury was recorded, he said. He added the cloudburst-induced flood also damaged farmlands and infrastructure in Biarchi and Gulapur areas of Ghizer. He said the authority was working to restore link roads in the area.
The Naltar expressway has been blocked at 10 locations from Nomaal to Naltar Valley.
GBDMA DG Zakir Hussain, along with Nagar Deputy Commissioner Asghar Khan and other officials, visited the affected sites in Nagar district, including Hamari Tokorkot and Supultar nullahs.
Earlier on Thursday, floods damaged 20 homes and crops in Babusar area of Chilas.
On Friday, light rainfall across GB brought down the temperature.
Recovery efforts
This year, record-high summer temperatures in Gilgit-Baltistan have accelerated the melting of glaciers, leading to heavy flooding in districts across the region.
Last week, the maximum temperature in Chilas was 48.5°C, the highest since July 17, 1997, when it was recorded at 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature jumped to 46.1°C, the highest since July 1971.
The GBDMA DG has issued directives to expedite the restoration of irrigation channels damaged by recent floods.
The extensive damage to farmlands and crops and the unavailability of water posed a risk of drought in the region.
Mr Hussain told Dawn that GBDMA is prepared to protect vulnerable communities and dozens of households have been relocated to safer places.
The affected families in Nagar, Gilgit, Ghizer and Diamer have been provided with food and other items.

The DPP was originally established under the International Plant Protection Convention, while AQD was tasked with preventing the entry of foreign animal diseases. Their integration into NAFSA is intended to create a modern, scientific, and data-driven body capable of ensuring compliance with Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) requirements while also facilitating access to quality agricultural inputs to promote surplus production and national food security.
A DPP official said NAFSA reflects the ministry’s broader vision of promoting sustainable agricultural exports and enhancing Pakistan’s credibility as a reliable source of plant and animal products. The authority will replace outdated structures with a technology-driven institutional framework aligned with international best practices.
While the DPP has shown relatively better performance in plant protection, AQD faced persistent staffing constraints that hampered its efficiency. However, sources familiar with the development noted uncertainty regarding NAFSA’s future role in locust control—a responsibility previously managed by the DPP.

NAFSA to align Pakistan with global food safety and phytosanitary standards

According to a press release issued by the ministry on Saturday, the reforms are aimed at improving Pakistan’s compliance with international trade requirements and boosting its export competitiveness. On the directives of Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain, the DPP has undertaken a series of transformative, corrective, and disciplinary measures over the past six months to strengthen regulatory systems and operational efficiency.
Import regulations
As part of the broader institutional overhaul, the DPP has initiated several strategic projects, including the upgrading of testing laboratories and the establishment of modern infrastructure.
One of the most significant reforms has been the revision of import regulations based on scientific assessments, leading to a substantial reduction in the use of Methyl Bromide (MB) — a pesticide often applied unnecessarily. This regulatory shift has resulted in cost savings of Rs30,000 to Rs40,000 per container, particularly benefiting imports of cotton, grains, pulses, and lentils.
The move has been welcomed by industry stakeholders as a major step toward rationalised pesticide use and environmental sustainability.
The ministry also revealed that a detailed internal audit — carried out under the minister’s instructions for stricter compliance and transparency— found that a company was importing Methyl Bromide from a suspicious source. A rigorous investigation followed, involving third-party verification and document cross-checking.
The company’s licence was promptly suspended for regulatory violations, and, in coordination with Pakistan Customs, four under-process shipments worth approximately $1 million were intercepted at the port before clearance.
These enforcement measures not only prevented the potential entry of hazardous substances but also reinforced the ministry’s zero-tolerance stance on malpractice. Disciplinary action has been initiated against officials found involved in misconduct.
The minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to structural reforms, stating that Pakistan’s agricultural and quarantine systems will be aligned with international benchmarks.
He stressed that no leniency will be shown to those who violate the law or compromise national interests.
The unearthing and disruption of this high-value scam, he said, underscores the ministry’s resolve to uphold transparency, fair competition, and institutional integrity.

Over the past year, multiple attacks have been reported across KP in which remotely operated quadcopters were used to drop explosives. The military has blamed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan for these attacks.
In Bannu, the quadcopter dropped ammunition at the Miryan police station building, an official told Dawn.
“The munition fell in the compound of the pol­i­­ce station and did not cau­se any damage,” he claimed.
He said policemen depl­oyed at the station remai­ned safe in the attack.
The cops opened fire at the unmanned quadcopter but failed to hit it due to its high altitude.
It was the fifth quadcopter attack on the same police station in the Miry­­an area during the last month, showing a surge in the use of advanced quadcopter technology by terrorists.
A search operation was launched to arrest the at­­t­ackers and security was be­­efed up across the district.
Attack repulsed
In Lakki Marwat, cops repelled a midnight attack on a police station in the Serai Gambila town.
A police official said around a dozen armed men attacked the police station with light and heavy weapons late Friday night in a bid to take over the building.
“It was a multi-pronged attack as assailants circled the police station and tried to strengthen their position before launching the attack,” he added.
“After an intense exch­ange of fire, the assailants managed to flee the pla­ce,” he claimed, adding that all policemen deployed at the police station remai­ned safe in the attack.
The Serai Gambila poli­­ce station is located along the Peshawar-Karachi High­way near Gambila river.
It has been attacked several times in the past.
KP Inspector General of Poli­­ce Zulfiqar Hameed and Bannu Regional Police Of­­ficer Sajjad Khan lauded cops for “bravely” repulsing the attack and thwarting the terrorists’ plan to breach the police station building.

The indirect talks over a US proposal for a 60-day ceasefire are nonetheless expected to continue, the sources told Reuters.
According to AFP, which cited two Pales­tinian sour­ces with knowledge of the discussions, indirect talks are being held up by Israel’s proposals to keep troops in the territory.
Israel has meanwhile kept up its strikes on Gaza and the territory’s civil defence agency said more than 20 people were killed on Saturday, including in an air strike on an area sheltering the displaced.
“We all generally came here because we were told it was a safe area,” Bassam Hamdan told AFP after the overnight attack in an area of Gaza City. “While we were sleeping, there was an explosion… where two boys, a girl and their mother were staying. We found them torn to pieces, their remains scattered,” he added.
Medics said 17 people trying to get food aid were killed on Saturday when Israeli troops opened fire, the latest mass shooting around a US-backed aid distribution system that the UN says has resulted in 800 people killed in six weeks.
Witnesses who spoke to Reuters described people being shot in the head and torso. The news agency reported seeing several bodies of victims wrapped in white shrouds as family members wept at Nasser Hospital. The Israeli military claimed its troops had fired warning shots, but that its review of the incident had found no evidence of anyone hurt by its soldiers’ fire.
Seven UN agencies warned in a joint statement on Saturday that if fuel runs out in Gaza, it would be “an unbearable new burden on a population teetering on the edge of starvation”.
Delegations from Israel and Hamas have been in Qatar for a week in a renewed push for an agreement which envisages a phased release of hostages, Israeli troop withdrawals and discussions on ending the war.
US President Donald Trump, who hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the past week, had said he hoped for a deal soon. But the Israeli and Palestinian sources described longstanding issues that remain unresolved.
A Palestinian source said that Hamas had rejected withdrawal maps which Israel had proposed that would leave around 40 per cent of Gaza under Israeli control, including all of the southern area of Rafah and further territories in northern and eastern Gaza.
Two Israeli sources said Hamas wanted Israel to retreat to lines it held in a previous ceasefire before it renewed its offensive in March.
The Palestinian source said matters regarding aid and guarantees on an end to the war were also presenting a challenge. The crisis could be resolved with more US intervention, the source said.
Hamas has long demanded an agreement to end the war before it would free remaining hostages; Israel has insisted it would end the fighting only when all prisoners are released and Hamas is dismantled as a fighting force and administration in Gaza.
Shooting
Saturday’s reported mass shooting near an aid distribution point in Rafah was the latest in a series of such incidents that the United Nations rights office said on Friday had seen at least 798 people killed trying to get food in six weeks.
“We were sitting there, and suddenly there was shooting towards us. For five minutes we were trapped under fire. The shooting was targeted. It was not random. Some people were shot in the head, some in the torso, one guy next to me was shot directly in the heart,” eyewitness Mahmoud Makram told Reuters. “There is no mercy there, no mercy. People go because they are hungry, but they die and come back in body bags.”
After partially lifting a total blockade of all goods into Gaza in late May, Israel launched a new aid distribution system, relying on a group backed by the United States to distribute food under the protection of Israeli troops.
The United Nations has rejected the system as inherently dangerous and a violation of humanitarian neutrality principles. Israel says it is necessary to keep “militants” from diverting aid.
Since Oct 7, 2023, Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, displaced almost the entire population of more than two million people, sparked a humanitarian crisis and left much of the territory in ruins.

“On the instructions of (PML-N President) Nawaz Sharif and (Punjab Chief Minister) Mar­­yam Nawaz, a budget of Rs35bn has been allocated for my constituency NA-120,” said Mr Sadiq while addressing party workers at his constituency here on Saturday.
“Currently, development work worth Rs19bn is underway in my constituency. There were no roads or sewerage systems here before. Now sewerage will be installed, clean drinking water available, and roads built. No street in any area will be left behind, I assure. All streets will be paved,” he said while praising Maryam Nawaz.
“The Maryam administration has allocated Rs70bn development budget for Lahore or all constituencies of the city in the first phase. In the second phase, a sum of another Rs70bn will be spent,” a senior official of the Punjab government disclosed while talking to Dawn on Saturday.

Federal ministers Tarar and Aleem also using their good offices to secure funds from CM, party source says

“Besides Mr Sadiq, federal minister Atta Tarar (who won from NA-127), Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) head and federal minister Aleem Khan (who secured NA-117), PML-N financers Khokhar brothers — Saiful Maluk (also PML-N Lahore president) and Afzal Khokhar who bagged NA-126 and NA-125 seats, respectively, — are using their good offices to secure maximum funds from the CM for their constituencies,” a party source said. 
Mr Tarar, who won the seat against PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and PTI’s Zaheer Abbas Khokhar, is keen to contest future elections from the same NA-127 constituency, which previously belonged to late Pervaiz Malik, former PML-N Lahore president.
The ruling party MNAs are not only seeking funds from the provincial government but also from the Shehbaz Sharif administration.
When the PML-N lawmakers met the prime minister and asked for more funds for their constituencies, the latter advised them to increase interaction with their constituents and resolve their problems on a priority basis.
While Nawaz, Shehbaz, Maryam and Hamza, all from the Sharif family, contested the 2024 elections from Lahore, the source said, this time around neither Nawaz nor Hamza was pressing the Punjab government for spending on their constituencies, considering the allocation of an equal amount of uplift fund to all Lahore constituencies happens to be pain in the neck of the provincial administration.
