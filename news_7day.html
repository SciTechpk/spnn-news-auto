<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/6817e8a4d411a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908455/missile-hits-tel-aviv-airport-in-retaliation-for-gaza-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>Missile hits Tel Aviv airport in retaliation for Gaza attacks</strong></a><br><p>TEL AVIV: A ballistic missile struck inside the perimeter of Israel’s main airport on Sunday, wounding six people, halting flights and gouging a wide crater, in an attack claimed by Yemen’s Houthi fighters.
The Houthis, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
The Israeli military said “several attempts were made to intercept” the missile that was launched from Yemen, a rare Houthi attack that penetrated Israel’s air defences.
An Israeli official said the country’s security cabinet would convene in the evening.

Netanyahu blames Iran as defence minister threatens seven times stronger response

A police video showed officers standing on the edge of a deep hole in the ground with the control tower visible behind them. No damage was reported to the airport infrastructure.
The police reported a “missile impact” at Israel’s main international gateway.
An AFP photographer said the missile hit near the parking lots of Terminal 3, the airport’s largest. The crater was just hundreds of metres (yards) from the tarmac.
“You can see the area just behind us: a crater was formed here, several dozen metres (yards) wide and several dozen metres deep,” central Israel’s police chief, Yair Hezroni, said in the video.
 
 

The Israel Airport’s Authority said: “This is the first time a missile has fallen so close to the terminal and the runways.”
“The missile force of the Yemeni armed forces carried out a military operation targeting Ben Gurion airport” with a “hypersonic ballistic missile”, the Houthis said, referring to their forces.
Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened a forceful response, saying: “Anyone who hits us, we will hit them seven times stronger.”
Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to respond to Iran at  “a time and place of our choosing” over the attack  on Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport.
“Attacks  by the Houthis emanate from Iran. Israel will respond to the Houthi  attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our  choosing, to their Iranian terror masters,” Netanyahu wrote on X,  reposting a March message by US President Donald Trump also  attributing attacks by the Yemeni group to their Iranian backers.
Palestinians hail attack
Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad later hailed the Houthis’ attack on the airport.
Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service said it had treated at least six people with light to moderate injuries.
An AFP journalist said he heard a “loud bang” at around 9:35 am (0635 GMT), adding the “reverberation was very strong”.
“Security staff immediately asked hundreds of passengers to take shelter, some in bunkers,” the AFP journalist said.
“Many passengers are now waiting for their flights to take off, and others are trying to find alternative flights.” An incoming Air India flight was diverted to Abu Dhabi, an airport official said
It was one of the airlines to suspend Tel Aviv flights until May 6, along with Germany’s Lufthansa Group, which includes Austrian, Eurowings and SWISS.
A passenger said the attack, which came shortly after air raid sirens sounded across parts of Israel, caused “panic”.
An airline official said: “Today was a close call”.
“I have worked at the airport for several years but even I was afraid today,” they said.
Flights resumed after being halted briefly, with the aviation authority saying Ben Gurion was now “open and operational”.
Gaza war expansion
An Israel official said Israel’s security cabinet later met on Sunday, after media reported a planned expansion of the Gaza war with call-up orders issued for tens of thousands of reserve troops.
Several news outlets said the military had begun sending the orders for reservists to replace conscripts and active-duty soldiers in Israel and the occupied West Bank so they can be redeployed to Gaza.
A military spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied the reports but Israel’s public broadcaster said the security cabinet would meet to discuss the expanded offensive.
Israel resumed major operations across Gaza on March 18 amid deadlock over how to proceed with a two-month ceasefire that had largely stopped the Gaza war.
Sunday’s attack on Israel was the fourth the Houthis have claimed in three days.
Israel claims to have intercepted most of the Houthis’ missiles fired since the Gaza war started.
In March, the Houthis threatened to resume attacks on shipping over Israel’s aid blockade on Gaza after a suspension of attacks during the truce.
The US military has been hammering Houthis with near-daily strikes since March 15.

Though the Commi­ssioner for Indus Waters was not available to comment, a source privy to the development said that the report sent by the commission to government mentions a massive breach of the treaty in the form of construction of three hydroelectric plants / projects at the western rivers, including Jhelum and Chenab. The construction of the 450MW had reportedly been started at Chenab basin in 2005, followed by 330MW Kishan Ganga Hydropower Project in 2010 at Jhelum river basin. The construction of 850MW Ratle Hydropower project is yet to be initiated.
“The report also contains the information about other violations of the treaty by India such as delaying or avoiding giving information regarding release of floodwater during monsoon in rivers, including Ravi and Satluj. Besides these, there are a series of violations India committed already,” said the source while talking to this scribe.
He further said a very recent major violation committed by India was holding the treaty in abeyance that is not at all allowed.
He further said the report also mentioned that New Delhi suspended the treaty unilaterally on the pretext of the Pahalgam attack last month.
 
 

According to another source, India always faced defeat whenever Pakistan challenged and raised objections on the design of the aforementioned projects and took up these issues on relevant forums, including neutral expert or international court of arbitration.
“The proceedings on a couple of projects including Ratle are still underway at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, a non-UN intergovernmental organisation located in The Hague,” he said.
Talking to Dawn, Syed Jamat Ali Shah, a former commissioner on Indus Waters said in fact the draft of treaty finalised in 1960 gave no privilege to India to use waters of western rivers—Indus, Jhelum and Chenab on which Pakistan had the full right to use.
“India had full right to use  the water of eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas and Satluj) whether through construction of dams (for water storage and power generation) or other purposes.”
He added that a few months before signing of the treaty, India had started building pressure on the authorities concerned to also allow it to construct run-of-the river hydropower projects and small storages for irrigation purposes in the catchment areas of the western rivers.
He said since a lot of work has already been done on the treaty and there was no time to further delay, it was decided to allow India do so, but with some restrictions / conditions such as consulting Pakistan while finalising design of the projects etc.
He urged the government to brief the UNSC in detail about a series of violations of the treaty India committed.
“The Pakistani team may also take up this issue with the World Bank immediately in a bid to get the India’s unilateral decision of holding treaty in abeyance scrapped,” he urged.

Users accessing both accounts in India see a mes­sage stating the acco­unts were withheld “in response to a legal demand”.
PPP condemned India’s move to block the account of the party chairman. In a statement on Sunday, a PPP spokesperson said India’s action was a retaliation for Mr Bhutto-Zar­dari’s “unequivocal and bold stance on the Pahalgam incident” which he had presented before the international community.
The press release issued by the Bilawal House media cell said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was afraid of Mr Bhutto-Zardari. “It also proves that India is an undemocratic country and its prime minister is an extremely cowardly person,” the statement added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s narrative on the Pahalgam attack “unsettled the Indian prime minister”, the PPP spokesperson said, adding that it was Mr Bhutto-Zardari who first exposed the “Butcher of Gujarat” before the world, and he would continue to hold up a mirror to Mr Modi’s war-mongering mindset.
Since the Pahalgam attack on April 22, the Indian government has blocked a number of social media accounts belonging to the Pakistan government, news channels, content creators, film stars, sportspersons  and journalists. The accounts were blocked on YouTube, X and Instagram.
X, formerly Twitter, has been banned in Pakistan since February 2024.

The political leaders made this pledge during an in-camera briefing by the civil and military leadership on Sunday, in which the army spokesperson apprised the mainstream political parties about the latest situation in the region and the preparedness of the country’s armed forces to avert any misadventure by the neighbouring country.
The in-camera briefing was given by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. However, the main opposition party, PTI, did not attend the huddle.
A source privy to the huddle proceedings told Dawn that the political parties were of the view that they stood by the armed forces to foil any attempt by India to spoil regional peace. Before the briefing, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the main objective of the huddle was to get feedback from the political forces in light of tensions with India.

Participants told India wanted to divert water, intensify Kashmir oppression using Pahalgam

Another source told Dawn that the participants were briefed about how India “prepared and implemented its false flag operation” in Pahalgam. The meeting was informed that India could not sell its narrative to the world and that Pakistan’s stance had emerged stronger in the aftermath of the attack. The participants were also apprised of the preparedness of the armed forces to foil any kind of misadventure by India.
 
 

Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir, who attended the briefing, said that the meeting was informed about how and why India conducted the attack in Pahalgam. Senator Qadir said, as per information shared with the political leaders, the primary objective of the operation was to further divert Indus water, intensify aggression in held Kashmir, and camouflage Indian terrorism with the help of the Afghan Taliban.
With the help of video clips, the participants were given a briefing about Indian involvement in terrorism in Pakistan, especially Balochistan, he added.
PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf, Qamar Zaman Kaira, and Shazia Marri; PML-N’s Barrister Aqeel and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Tallal Chaudhry; PM’s aide Pervez Khattak; MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar; and Kashmiri leader Shah Ghulam Qadir, among others, were in attendance.
Tension between the two nuclear states escalated soon after the Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed on April 22.
Soon after the attack, India blamed Pakistan for being involved in the attack. On the other hand, Pakistan termed the attack a false flag operation by India and called for a neutral probe.

An attack on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
According to PTV News, national security issues were discussed in the camera session today, in the context of the Pahalgam false flag operation.
“Several leaders of political parties  participated in the session,” PTV News reported.
Sources say that the DG ISPR informed the leaders of political parties about the preparations of the army, PTV News reported, adding that DG Sharif said, “Pakistan is a peaceful country and wants peace in the region.”
“If aggression is imposed on Pakistan, then the forces are ready to give a befitting reply to the enemy,” PTV News quoted the DG ISPR as saying.
It added that during the in-camera session, the information minister also informed the political leaders about the government’s diplomatic measures and the country’s stance.
Earlier, state-run Radio Pakistan and PTV News reported that Lt Gen Chaudhry and Tarar would jointly brief the top leaders of “all political parties” on the situation with India today.
 
 

According to Radio Pakistan, the high-level background briefing would focus on national security in the context of Pakistan-India relations and the “implications of recent developments”.
“Participants will be briefed on the defensive preparedness of Pakistan’s armed forces, ongoing diplomatic efforts, and the official stance of the state on key issues,” the report read.
PTV News highlighted that in the current circumstances, the briefing was a “great example of national unity, solidarity and consensus”.
Without investigation, India had accu­s­ed “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers and escalated tensions with Pak­­i­s­tan through military and diplomatic actions.
India cancelled visas of Pak­istani travellers, held the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance, initiated ski­rmi­shes along the Line of Control (LoC) and hinted at potential airstrikes.
Pakistan denied involvement and issued retaliatory steps.
 
 

The standoff, marked by exchange of fire on the LoC and tit-for-tat actions, has raised fears of broader conflict, prompting international calls for restraint and renewed dialogue.
In the latest show of strength, Pakistan yesterday successfully tested an improved version of its nuclear-capable Abdali missile, significantly increasing its range to 450 kilometres.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Thursday asserted that any “misadventure” by India would be met with a “swift, resolute and notch-up response”. The next day, the army’s top brass also warned India of a “sure and decisive” response should it attempt to impose war.
 
 

To prepare itself for any military action by India, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has accelerated efforts to replenish wheat flour stocks in vulnerable areas along the LoC.
It is increasing reserves in forward locations to meet the needs of residents for at least two months and relocating food depots from areas exposed to potential shelling or military activity to relatively safer zones.
PTI decides not to participate in briefing
Separately, in a statement on X, PTI said its participation in the briefing was “unnecessary” as the party believed there was “no serious attempt to create a national consensus” by the government and that there was no intention to include PTI founder Imran Khan either.
 






The party said it had always unequivocally condemned every kind of terrorism in all its forms.
It said that the government should have immediately convened a multi-party conference, so that a common course of action could have been drawn up by taking all parties into confidence.
“Unfortunately, the government wasted this opportunity,” the party said, adding that not only was the multi-party conference not convened, but instead, “a one-sided briefing is being given by a government minister”.
“Considering all these factors, the PTI political committee has unanimously decided that the party will not participate in the briefing,” the statement read.
Pakistan decides to brief UNSC on India’s aggressive actions: FO
Pakistan has decided to brief the United Nations Security Council on the latest situation in the region amid sky-high tensions with India, according to a statement issued by the foreign ministry today.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has directed Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps to convene a meeting of the Security Council.
“Pakistan will inform the UNSC about India’s aggressive actions, provocations, and provocative statements,” the statement said.
“Pakistan will specifically highlight India’s illegal actions to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty,” it said, adding that the country would clarify how New Delhi’s aggressive actions are jeopardising “peace and security” in the region.
“This important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan’s efforts to present accurate facts to the international community.”
Iran FM arrives in Pakistan, will India next week
As several friendly countries and global powers have been attempting to reduce Pak-India tensions, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Pakistan late on Sunday night, according to a social media post by the FO.
The post on X said that Araghchi arrived in Islamabad on an official visit and was received by Additional Secretary West Asia Syed Asad Gillani, the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan and other senior officials.
“He (Araghchi) will hold important meetings with the Pakistani leadership, including the President, Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister,” the FO wrote.
 






Earlier, Iran’s state news agency IRNA quoted Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei as saying that Araghchi was expected to visit Pakistan on Monday to “discuss the recent developments at the regional and international levels”.
 
 

Araghchi would also pay an official visit to India later next week, the spokesperson added. Iran’s semi-official Fars News and Mehr News Agency also reported the same.
Iran on April 25 had offered to mediate between Pakistan and India as tensions heightened in the wake of the Pahalgam attack. The next day, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke on the phone with President Masoud Pezeshkian, welcoming Iran’s readiness to calm the situation.
OIC, Malaysia urge restraint
Meanwhile, continuing his diplomatic engagements, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar today spoke on phone with his Malaysian counterpart, Dato Seri Mohamad Hassan, to brief him on the current regional developments.
FM Hasan, expressing support for Pakistan’s position, called for restraint by all parties, the Foreign Office said.
 

A partial screengrab of a post on X by Foreign Office.

During their call, Dar “categorically rejected India’s provocative actions, including its baseless allegations [and] inflammatory propaganda”. He termed India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty “an outright violation of treaty provisions and international legal obligations”.
While reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security, Dar asserted that Pakistan reserved the “right to safeguard its sovereignty and national interest”.
Both leaders agreed to maintain close contact on the evolving situation, the FO added.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif conveyed “serious concerns” to Malaysian Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim over the prevailing tensions because of India’s provocative behaviour since the Pahalgam incident.
During a telephone conversation with his counterpart, PM Shehbaz categorically rejected any attempts to link Pakistan to the incident, without any evidence from the Indian government and reiterated Pakistan’s offer for an international, transparent, credible and neutral investigation to ascertain the facts.
He said Pakistan would welcome Malaysia’s participation in this investigation.
While stressing that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations, PM Shehbaz highlighted Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the war against terror and the tremendous sacrifices of the country.
“India’s actions are distracting Pakistan from its counter-terrorism efforts on the western border,” he added.
He emphasised that it was unthinkable for Pakistan to get involved in such a controversy, particularly at a time when the country had just emerged from a “serious economic crisis and was back on the path to economic stability”.
The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) yesterday had called for restraint and the “urgent resumption of dialogue” between Pakistan and India to de-escalate the situation.
In a statement, the OIC General Secretariat expressed its “deep concern over the deteriorating security situation in the South Asian region”.
 


“It stressed the need to resolve differences through peaceful means, in accordance with international law and the United Nations Charter, to safeguard peace, security, and stability in South Asia.”
The OIC recalled the decisions of the Islamic Summit and the resolutions adopted by the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers that reaffirmed the organisation’s “unwavering support for the Jammu and Kashmir question”.
Noting that the unresolved issue of Kashmir remained the “core challenge to lasting peace and stability in the region”, the OIC urged the international community to intensify efforts to find a peaceful resolution to it, in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.
Bilawal’s X account blocked in India
In a statement issued today, according to Associated Press of Pakistan, Bilawal House spokesperson Surendar Valasai condemned India’s move to block the X account of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
He described the action as a retaliatory response to the party leader’s “unequivocal and bold stance on the Pahalgam incident”.
The spokesperson said India’s move to block the PPP chairman’s X account proved that India was an undemocratic country and its premier was an “extremely cowardly person”.
Separately, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, in reaction to the Indian step to block Bilawal’s X account, said that suppressing voices does not hide the truth.
She added that the Indian government should present evidence and not resort to censorship.
“Efforts to suppress critical voices are increasing concern not only in Pakistan but also globally,” the PPP leader said.

Teknofest is Türkiye’s first and only aerospace and technology festival organised in partnership with many organisations that play a critical part in the development of national technology in Türkiye, according to the information available on its website.
Last year, the competition took place in Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir, hosting tech competitions spanning 41 categories, all aligned with the focal points of the future. These competitions attracted applications from over 333,000 teams and more than 1 million individuals from all 81 Turkish provinces and 96 countries.
“Asma Fatima and Inaya Khan, along with their teacher Gohar Khursheed, met Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan to receive their first-place award at Teknofest 2025,” Pak-Turk Maarif International Schools and Colleges announced in a post on Instagram.

Their project ‘Emotion Detector Gadget for Quadriplegic’ won the Social Innovation competition for middle-school students.
“During the award ceremony, winners were announced among 268 finalist teams and 1,083 competitors from six countries, selected from over 47,000 applicants across 22 countries,” the competition’s website stated.
Speaking to Dawn.com after their win, Inaya said: “My experience at Teknofest was phenomenal. There were so many brilliant projects, and the competition was fierce.”
She added that they “poured their our hearts into their project and it paid off”.
“All the challenges, the moments we thought we’d never get through, were all worth it.
“This is a huge win for us, for our team, school and for our country. We’re not just celebrating a victory; we’re celebrating the power of innovation and the impact we can make on Pakistan’s young generation.”
Their teacher, Gohar, speaking about the victory, said, “It’s a reminder that with hard work, determination, and a little bit of innovation, anything is possible.”
Gohar continued that their winning project focused on helping linguistically paralysed people to understand their feelings.
Last year, a Pakistani students team had won three bronze medals in the 54th International Physics Olympiad (IPhO), held in Isfahan, Iran, from July 21 to 28.</p><small>2025-05-04 20:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/042320047cbc122.jpg?r=232243' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908418/sheinbaum-says-she-nixed-trump-offer-to-send-us-troops-to-mexico' target='_blank'><strong>Sheinbaum says she nixed Trump offer to send US troops to Mexico</strong></a><br><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Saturday that she had rejected an offer from United States President Donald Trump to send American troops to Mexico to help combat drug trafficking.
“I told him, ‘No, President Trump, our territory is inviolable, our sovereignty is inviolable, our sovereignty is not for sale,’” she said at a public event, referring to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal that described a tense exchange between the leaders.
During the recent call, Sheinbaum said, Trump had asked how he could help fight organised crime and suggested sending troops.
She said she declined, telling him that “we will never accept the presence of the United States Army in our territory”.
Sheinbaum said she offered to collaborate, including through greater information-sharing.
Trump himself said in an interview last week with conservative outlet The Blaze that he had offered to help Mexico fight the drug cartels, but that he had been turned down.
Without providing details, Trump told his interviewer: “You could say at some point maybe something’s gonna have to happen. It can’t go on the way it is.”
In her appearance on Saturday, Sheinbaum said she had urged Trump to stop the cross-border arms trafficking that has contributed to a wave of violence lasting nearly two decades, claiming more than 450,000 lives in Mexico.
Trump, on his part, has complained repeatedly about cross-border drug smuggling and has pressured Mexico to crack down on criminal cartels.
Trump angered Mexicans in early March when he said America’s southern neighbour was “dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control … posing a grave threat to (US) national security”.
Trump has also long complained — and uses as an argument for imposing tariffs on the country — that Mexico has not done enough to stop the trafficking of migrants and drugs, particularly fentanyl, into the United States.
Those topics have been part of an ongoing diplomatic dance between the countries over the trade tariffs.
Mexico, as the largest US trade partner and the second-largest economy in Latin America, is considered one of the most vulnerable to the US president’s expansive import duties.</p><small>2025-05-04 18:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/04225800c1f39d7.jpg?r=225923' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908417/pakistan-expands-india-trade-ban-to-include-transit-export-from-third-countries' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan expands India trade ban to include transit, export from third countries</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Sunday banned the import of Indian-origin goods transiting through Pakistan by land, sea and air and prohibited the transit of goods exported to India by third countries, a notification from the commerce ministry said.
An attack on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, both nations have imposed tit-for-tat measures on each other in a tug-of-war started by India.
The notification, which has been seen by Dawn.com, stated that these bans would not be applicable to goods for which a bill of lading or letter of credit had already been issued.
The ministry banned, “the import of Indian origin goods by third countries via sea, land and air; transiting through Pakistan; goods imported from India by third countries via sea, land and air, transiting through Pakistan; [and] the exports of third countries, to India via sea, land and air, transiting through Pakistan”.
The notification stated that the federal government issued the orders “in the interest of national security and in public interest”.
Late on Saturday night, Pakistan banned the use of its ports by Indian flag carriers in a tit-for-tat response to India announcing that Pakistani-flagged ships would not be allowed to visit any of its ports, and Indian flagged-ships would not visit any ports in Pakistan.
An order issued by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs’ Ports and Shipping Wing said: “In view of the recent development of maritime situation with neighbouring country, Pakistan in order to safeguard maritime sovereignty, economic interest and national security enforces following measures with immediate effect: Indian flag carriers shall not be allowed to visit any Pakistani port, Pakistani flag carriers shall not visit any Indian port [and] any exemption or dispensation shall be examined and decided on case to case basis.”
Trade between the two nations has dwindled over the last few years.
In August 2019, Pakistan had already formally downgraded its trade relations with India to the level of Israel, with which Islamabad has no trade ties at all, in reaction to New Delhi’s decision to revoke Article 370 of its constitution that granted occupied Kashmir a special status.</p><small>2025-05-04 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/04221717ff9c7ff.jpg?r=221750' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908416/brazil-police-foil-lady-gaga-gig-bomb-plot' target='_blank'><strong>Brazil police foil Lady Gaga gig bomb plot</strong></a><br><p>Brazilian police on Sunday said they had arrested two people in connection with a foiled plot to attack Lady Gaga’s packed mega-concert in Rio de Janeiro.

Officials said the superstar’s huge free gig on the beach, her first concert in Brazil since 2012, drew up to two million people.
Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to the US pop diva’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters”.
It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” and Molotov cocktails as “a collective challenge with the aim of “gaining notoriety on social media”.
The police added that the group behind the plot “spread hate speech”, radicalised youths, and used self-harm on digital platforms as mechanisms to develop social belonging.
Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso.
Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong show on Copacabana beach in a year, after a huge concert last year by Madonna.
‘Scared sick’
Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed.
The 39-year-old star’s fans reacted with shock to the news of the foiled plot.
“Thank god. This would have had an impact on over 2m people,” posted the LadyGagaFansTogether Instagram account, which has 307,000 followers.
Writing on the same account, one fan said he was “scared sick about her (Gaga) being safe at all times”.
The gig was part of a strategy by Rio to hold mega-concerts in May in an effort to boost tourism during what is considered the low season.
All week, Gaga fans had flocked to Rio, a city famous for its annual Carnival that attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world.
Mayor Eduardo Paes has also hinted that he plans to bring in Irish rock band U2, although no date has been given.
Lady Gaga had kicked off her show perched more than two metres (6.5 feet) above the stage in a massive scarlet hoop gown which opened to reveal a vertical cage from which her dancers exited to a rendition of her 2011 song “Bloody Mary”.
“Brazil, I missed you so much,” screamed the popstar, who performed several tracks from her latest album, “Mayhem”, as well as favourites from throughout her career.</p><small>2025-05-04 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/04202920a3cb336.jpg?r=203413' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908412/trump-says-i-dont-know-if-must-uphold-us-constitution-as-president' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says ‘I don’t know’ if must uphold US Constitution as president</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said in a television interview airing on Sunday that he does not know whether he must uphold the US Constitution.
He also said he is not seriously considering running for a third White House term, after musing publicly over an idea clearly barred by the nation’s founding legal document.
“I don’t know,” Trump responded when the host of NBC News programme ‘Meet the Press’, Kristen Welker, asked directly whether he believes he needs to uphold the supreme law of the land.
Asked specifically whether American citizens and non-citizens alike deserve the due process of law, as the US Constitution states, Trump said: “I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know.”
The president’s aggressive moves to deport undocumented migrants — some without the benefit of a court hearing — have drawn widespread criticism, but Trump insists it is necessary in the face of what he has declared to be a “national emergency”.
The suggestion of possibly seeking a third term in office has been sharply questioned by legal and constitutional scholars.
The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”
But Trump said in March he was “not joking” about seeking a third term, adding without elaboration that there are “methods” that would allow it to happen.
Changing the Constitution to allow a third term would be a heavy lift, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US state legislatures.
But “this is not something I’m looking to do”, Trump told NBC’s Welker, adding: “I’m looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.”
Asked who that might be, he mentioned Vice President JD Vance — calling him a “fantastic, brilliant guy” — and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, while adding that “we have a lot of good people in this party.”</p><small>2025-05-04 15:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/041741430c8eede.jpg?r=175735' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908407/two-dead-as-small-plane-crashes-into-california-neighbourhood' target='_blank'><strong>Two dead as small plane crashes into California neighbourhood</strong></a><br><p>A small plane has crashed into a backyard of a residential neighbourhood in southern California, in the United States, killing two people onboard and damaging homes, local authorities said.
The Ventura County Fire Department said firefighters received reports on Saturday afternoon of a single-engine aircraft that had crashed into two houses in Simi Valley, northwest of Los Angeles.
Police and the medical examiner’s office “verified there were two passengers in the aircraft, both of whom were fatally injured in the accident,” the county fire department wrote on X.
 






The two homes were occupied at the time of the crash but no injuries to residents were reported, the fire department said.
Photo and video images posted by the department showed firefighters on top of a house with holes in the roof, a fence and brick wall between residences knocked down, and the tops of trees sheared off.
The Simi Valley Police Department said officers had located the plane “in the backyard of a residence.”
Police told CBS News that the pilot, a passenger and a dog were aboard when the plane crashed at around 2pm (2am PKT).
The Federal Aviation Administration said, according to CBS, that the plane was a Van’s RV-10, which had taken off from William J. Fox Airfield in Los Angeles County and was heading to Camarillo Airport in neighboring Ventura County.
In January, a Van’s RV-10, a small plane with four seats, crashed into a commercial building near Fullerton Municipal Airport southeast of Los Angeles, killing at least two people and injuring 18 others.</p><small>2025-05-04 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/041548398292414.png?r=155146' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908400/federal-ministers-monthly-salaries-hiked-to-rs519000-to-match-those-of-mnas' target='_blank'><strong>Federal ministers’ monthly salaries hiked to Rs519,000 to match those of MNAs</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari promulgated four ordinances on Friday — one of them to increase the salaries of federal ministers and ministers of state to match those of National Assembly members (MNAs).
In February, the lower house of the parliament passed the Members of Parliament Salaries and Allowances (Amendment) Bill 2025 — already approved by the Senate — with a majority vote, increasing the salary of the parliament members.
The National Assembly’s Finance Committee, headed by NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, approved the proposed increase of the monthly salary of each MNA and senator to Rs519,000. Previously, lawmakers received a monthly salary of Rs180,000.
“The federal ministers and ministers of state shall receive a monthly salary equivalent to the salary of a member of the National Assembly,” read the ordinance.
The changes were made to the Federal Ministers and Ministers of State (Salaries, Allowances and Privileges) Act, 1975.
The ministers’ salaries will now be Rs519,000 per month and equivalent to the MNAs.
Federal ministers were receiving a salary of Rs200,000 per month, and state ministers received Rs180,000 per month, before the change.
In an expansion on February 27, 12 federal ministers and nine ministers of state were sworn in by President Zardari. In addition, three advisers and four special assistants to the prime minister were also inducted.
The size of the federal cabinet doubled, increasing its members from 21 to 43, including 30 federal ministers, nine ministers of state and four advisers. Most of the newly inducted members belong to the ruling PML-N, but leaders from allied parties also secured positions in the cabinet.
The president also promulgated an ordinance to establish the National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority (NAFSA). It will take steps to ensure sanitary and phytosanitary measures in relation to imports and  exports.
Another ordinance titled the Tax Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025 was also promulgated to recover pending tax amounts tied up in litigation.
The president further promulgated an ordinance titled the Capital Development Authority (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025.</p><small>2025-05-04 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/041458560e81a8c.jpg?r=150011' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908396/afghanistan-fears-negative-impacts-of-pakistan-india-tensions-on-kabul-region' target='_blank'><strong>Afghanistan fears negative impacts of Pakistan-India tensions on Kabul, region</strong></a><br><p>Afghanistan officials on Sunday expressed their concern that the ongoing tensions between Pakistan and India would have a “direct negative impact” on Kabul and the region.
After an attack on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
In response to India’s aggressive moves against the country, Pakistan had announced retaliatory measures that have included halting all border trade, closing its airspace and ports to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats.
Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Hekmatullah Zaland, the deputy director of the Afghan foreign ministry’s Centre for Strategic Studies (CSS), said: “Since Pakistan and India are located in our neighbourhood, if this tension spreads, it will have a direct negative impact on the region and Afghanistan.”
The CSS deputy director added, “We are currently interacting with both countries in the light of our balanced policy.”
Zaland was speaking during a roundtable discussion at an academic conference titled “Tensions in Pakistan-India relations and their impact on the region”. The conference was organised by the CSS, according to a foreign ministry statement posted online.
During the discussion, officials pointed out the closure of the Attari-Wagah border, emphasising that the decision would affect Afghan traders.
On April 23, India had announced the closure of the Attari checkpost, alongside other measures. The next day, Pakistan responded by shutting the Wagah Border for any trade with India, including to or from a third country.
 
 

However, despite Pakistan allowing 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, India has not permitted them to cross into its territory, leaving truckers from Afghanistan in a mess.
According to the central leader of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI), Pakistan has also not permitted vehicles carrying items imported from India to enter Afghanistan.
Afghan traders said up to 2,000 containers carrying goods have arrived at Karachi ports from India under the transit agreement with Pakistan. But these vehicles are stranded in Pakistan, with some waiting at Torkham and Chaman to enter Afghanistan.
CSS Director Waliullah Shaheen discussed the historical background of the tense relations between Pakistan and India, stating that the two nuclear-armed countries would not enter into war and would find a solution to the problem.
 
 

Mufti Noor Ahmad Noor, the first political director of the Afghan foreign ministry, delivered a keynote speech at the roundtable discussions, the ministry said.
Discussing the factors behind the recent escalation of the conflict between Pakistan and India, he noted that the Pahalgam attack had exacerbated the long-standing tension. As a result, he added, both countries took measures, such as the closure of the Wagah-Attari border, that have affected the region, especially Afghanistan.
According to Noor, due to the border closures, Afghanistan’s commercial goods were practically stuck, causing significant damage to the Afghan trade sector. “Therefore, the Islamic Emirate [of Afghanistan] needs to prepare for potential incidents in advance,” the official stressed.
Noting that Afghanistan had “commonalities and positive interactions” with both Pakistan and India, Noor stated his country did not want a war between the two arch-rivals.
 
 

“Rather, in light of the Islamic Emirate’s balanced and economy-oriented policy, and because regional stability and security are important to the Islamic Emirate, we will strive to resolve this conflict peacefully,” he said.
Dr Hafiz Ikramuddin Kamil, another official, spoke about the legal aspect of India’s potential threat to disrupt flow of water after it suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty.
Kamil observed that blocking the river for a long time seemed technically difficult and also had various legal aspects according to international law. “But for now, this issue has also emerged as a significant consequence of the tension in relations,” he added.
Dozens of foreign ministry employees participated in the discussion, where they shared their opinions and analyses on various aspects of the issue.
Dar chairs follow-up meeting on Kabul trip
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar presided over a high-level meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa) in Islamabad today to follow up on the outcomes of his recent visit to Kabul.
 
 

Dar’s visit to Afghanistan on April 19 marked the high point of a renewed re-engagement process between Islamabad and the Afghan Taliban administration after months of diplomatic deadlock, border clashes and mounting security concerns.
During his trip there, Afghan­istan’s acting prime minister, Mullah Hasan Akhund, had assured Pakistan that the Afghan territory would not be used for hostile activities against any country.
In the meeting led by Dar today, officials from Mofa and relevant ministries were briefed on the progress in implementation of earlier decisions, according to the Foreign Office.
Dar, also the foreign minister, reaffirmed “Pakistan’s vision for a peaceful neighbourhood, enhanced trade and connectivity, sustainable development, and prosperity”.
The meeting was attended by Pakistan’s Special Representative to Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq and senior officials from various ministries.

In a statement on Telegram, the Kremlin said that Xi will discuss with Russian President Vladimir Putin the development of the two countries’ strategic partnership, as well as signing a number of documents.
“During the talks, the main issues of further development of relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction, as well as current issues on the international and regional agenda will be discussed,” the Kremlin said.
The Soviet Union lost 27 million people in World War II but pushed Nazi forces back to Berlin, where Hitler died by suicide and the red Soviet Victory Banner was raised over the Reichstag in 1945.
Several other national leaders are expected at the celebrations, including the presidents of Brazil and Serbia, and the prime minister of Slovakia.
Putin has proposed a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine around the May 9 celebration, one of the most important in the Russian calendar.
Responding to Moscow’s offer of the three-day ceasefire, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was ready as long as the ceasefire would be 30 days in length, something Putin had already ruled out in the near term, saying he wants a long-term settlement, not a brief pause.
Zelenskiy said Ukraine, given the continued war with Russia, could not guarantee the safety of any foreign dignitaries who came to Moscow for the traditional May 9 victory parade.</p><small>2025-05-04 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/04141552325105b.jpg?r=141833' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908388/pmd-says-chances-of-rain-in-karachi-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>PMD says chances of rain in Karachi tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Karachi could experience isolated dust and thunderstorms accompanied by rain on Monday evening, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said on Sunday.
The PMD has predicted that a westerly wave is affecting the upper and central parts of the country.
Weather was expected to remain “hot and humid with chances of isolated dust-thunderstorm and rain on [Monday] evening,” in Karachi, according to the PMD’s forecast.
It added that there were chances of thunderstorms and rain in the outskirts of Karachi in the evening.
Dust storms and thunderstorm-related rain are likely at isolated places in Jamshoro,  Tando Mohammad Khan, Badin, Hyderabad, Mitiari,  Tando Allahyar, Mirpurkhas, Nosheroferoz, Sanghar, Khairpur, Ghotki, Umerkot, Tharparker, Badin, Shikarpur and Kashmore districts today, the PMD said.
Its advisory said that windstorms, thunderstorms, hailstorms, and lightning may damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels.
“Farmers are advised to manage their crop activities keeping in view the weather conditions and take care of their livestock as well,” the PMD added.
Earlier today, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) warned of potential landslides in Murree and Galiyat due to forecasted heavy rain, urging citizens to take necessary precautions, reported Associated Press of Pakistan.
Heavy rain accompanied by gusty winds and hailstorms lashed the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Friday, turning the weather chilly.
The PDMA had issued a rain alert earlier this week, warning of strong storms and heavy rainfall until May 4, with a forecast indicating a high likelihood of lightning strikes.
“Tourists visiting Murree have been advised to take caution and monitor weather conditions,” a PDMA Punjab spokesperson said while talking to a private news channel, said the report.
He further asked them to avoid unnecessary travel during the unpredictable weather.
“Tourists [should] strictly adhere to safety guidelines and follow instructions from the local authorities. Residents have been advised to avoid being in open areas to minimise risks,” the report read.
“The PDMA recommends that citizens follow disaster management plans and guidelines. Citizens are encouraged to stay alert and follow PDMA’s advisories to stay safe.”
On Friday, the PDMA announced that two people had died and 24 others were injured due to windstorms and rain in different cities of Punjab.
In the event of a disaster, citizens have been advised to call 1129 for assistance.</p><small>2025-05-04 09:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/04132417d1d55a4.jpg?r=132759' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908385/samsung-fights-520m-india-tax-demand-points-to-reliance-practice' target='_blank'><strong>Samsung fights $520m India tax demand, points to Reliance practice</strong></a><br><p>Samsung has asked an Indian tribunal to quash a $520 million tax demand for allegedly misclassifying imports of networking gear, arguing officials were aware of the practice as India’s Reliance imported the same component in a similar manner for years, documents show.
Samsung becomes the second major foreign company in recent months to challenge an Indian tax demand.
Volkswagen has sued Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in court for a record demand of $1.4 billion for misclassifying its component imports.
In the Samsung case, tax authorities in January asked Samsung to pay $520m for evading the 10-20 per cent tariffs by misclassifying imports of a key mobile tower equipment, which it then sold to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s telecom giant, Reliance Jio, from 2018 to 2021.
In its 281-page challenge at the Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal in Mumbai, Samsung criticises Indian authorities for being “fully aware” of the business model as Reliance had a “long-established practice” of importing the same equipment without any tariff payments for three years until 2017.
Samsung’s India unit says it discovered during an Indian tax investigation that Reliance had been warned about the practice way back in 2017, but Reliance did not inform the South Korean company about it and tax officials never questioned Samsung.
“The classification adopted by the appellant (Samsung) was known to the authorities, however the same was never questioned … Department was fully aware,” Samsung says in its April 17 filing, which is not public but was seen by Reuters.
“Reliance Jio officials did not inform” Samsung about the tax warning of 2017, it adds.
Samsung and India’s tax authority did not respond to Reuters queries.
Further details of Reliance’s 2017 warning from tax authorities are not public and were not disclosed in the Samsung filing. Reliance didn’t respond to Reuters queries.
Other than $520m demand Samsung faces, Indian authorities have also imposed an $81m fine on seven of its employees, taking the total tax demand to $601m. It’s not clear if Samsung employees are separately challenging the fines.
The tax demand represents a substantial chunk of last year’s net profit of $955m for Samsung in India, where it is one of the largest players in the consumer electronics and smartphones market.
In defending its tariff declarations, Samsung also argues in its filing that the tax authority passed the order in January “in a hurry” and it was not provided “a fair opportunity” to present its case, despite the “huge stakes” involved.
The Samsung case concerns imports of a component called “Remote Radio Head”, a radio-frequency circuit enclosed in a small outdoor module, that tax officials say is “one of the most important” parts of 4G telecoms systems.
The case against Samsung alleges it misclassified the component’s imports worth $784m from Korea and Vietnam between 2018 to 2021, to maximise profits.
Investigators found that Samsung “transgressed all business ethics and industry practices or standards in order to achieve their sole motive of maximising their profit by defrauding the government exchequer”, the January order stated.</p><small>2025-05-04 08:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/04131110495eac4.jpg?r=131623' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908386/two-more-bodies-of-libya-boat-tragedy-victims-arrive-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Two more bodies of Libya boat tragedy victims arrive in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>Two more bodies of Pakistan nationals who lost their lives in a tragic boat accident off the eastern coast of Libya, arrived at Lahore Airport on Sunday, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
The incident occurred during the night between April 12 and 13, when a migrant boat capsized near Libya’s eastern shoreline.
The accident was the latest in a series of mishaps over the past few years in which hundreds of Pakistanis were killed in the Medi­ter­ranean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean while trying to reach Europe from Africa.
The victims were identified as Sufyan and Nadeem Ahmed, residents of Gujranwala, APP reported.
State Minister for Public Affairs Rana Mubashir Hussain and Member Punjab Assembly Mian Imran Javed received the bodies at the Lahore Airport cargo department. Later, the bodies were handed over to the grieving families. Prayers were also offered for the departed souls.
Speaking on the occasion, Hussain expressed deep sorrow and grief and expressed solidarity with the bereaved families.
He said, “We are making strict laws against those who play with the lives of people. Some culprits had been arrested while the rest have yet to be caught.”
Last month, the bodies of six people who died in the boat tragedy arrived in three districts of the Gujranwala division. The victims whose bodies arrived included a couple belonging to Sialkot.

Last year, Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Sahil’s Six Months Cruel Numbers data revealed that a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country.
In the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported. 48 cases of pornography after sexual abuse were also recorded.
“A case has been registered against a madrassa teacher at the Mirhazar police station,” a police spokesperson said.
The spokesperson continued that the police took immediate action and arrested the suspect.
The first information report (FIR) was registered under Section 376(iii) (rape of a minor) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The teacher took the student to his residential room in the madrassa and raped the student twice, according to the FIR.
“A case was registered on the statement of the child’s mother,” the police spokesperson added.

It was a genuine thriller as in-form Quetta Gladiators looked to upstage table toppers Islamabad United on a track which had everything for all. 
Medium-pacer Moha­mmad Shahzad was given the ball to bowl the final over with Gladiators needing 15 to win.
Shahzad off his own bowling dropped Hasan who top edged a short ball. The very next ball, captain Salman Ali Agha floored a difficult chance in the slip as the batters took two runs. The 22-year-old Hasan lifted the pacer for a six over long-off before wicket-keeper Andries Gous in confusion failed to gather the ball while running towards third man, giving Hasan yet another life as the batters added two more.
Hasan — who made a superb 64 not out off 41 balls with four sixes and two fours — had the last laugh on the penultimate ball as the right-hander smashed a slightly short delivery for a six over backward square leg giving Gladiators a memorable win besides lifting them to top of the table. They now have 11 points from eight games while United have 10 in as many matches.
Chasing 158, Gladiators got off to a swift start but lost both the openers inside the first four overs.
Captain Saud Shakeel was caught nicely by Mohammad Shahzad at point off paceman Salman Irshad on the last ball of the third over.
Fast bowler Naseem Shah, who was hit for a couple of fours by Finn Allen in the second over, came back to dismiss the batter in the fourth over who was caught by Jason Holder. Gladiators were now 28-2. Allen made 20 off 13 balls.
One-down batter Rilee Rossouw thumped pacer Jason Holder for four fours as Gladiators crossed the half-century mark to end the powerplay at 53-2.
Following a 52-run partnership off 38 balls with Hasan Nawaz, Rossouw’s 27 off 24 knock ended in a horrible run-out in the 10th over. The left-hander failed to return to the non-striker’s end after being sent back by his partner who was not interested in a run after playing a shot to short fine leg. 
Mark Chapman did not last long and, looking to play a lofted shot, was caught by Haider Ali at long-on off Nawaz in the 11th over as Gladiators slumped to 84-4.
A massive six by Hasan off Nawaz over long-on helped Gladiators reach 100 in 12.2 overs.
Haseebullah Khan (seven) was caught by Gous off a Holder’s back-of-length ball just outside the off stump in the 14th over. The batter reviewed the decision but the on-field umpire’s call was upheld.
Faheem Ashraf (six) was caught brilliantly by Holder off Salman Ali Agha at short cover while Kyle Jamieson’s (three) wicket was claimed by pacer Salman as United ended the 16th over at 117-7.  Mohammad Wasim’s cameo (16 off 11) was ended by Naseem Shah in the 19th over.
Earlier, United posted a decent 157-9 after being asked to bat first.
Sahibzada Farhan and Kyle Mayers gave United a brisk 58-run stand inside the powerplay.
In-form Farhan, who cracked pacer Kyle Jamieson for a six over widish mid-wicket in the very first over, clearly looked more aggressive than his partner — smashing fast bowler Khurram Shahzad for a six in the fourth over before hitting paceman Mohammad Wasim Junior for a four and then back-to-back sixes over fine leg in the fifth over as United cruised to 50 in 4.5 overs.
After pulling mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed for a maximum in the sixth over, Mayers was cleaned up on the very next ball. He made 22 off 17 as United ended the powerplay at 59-1.
After the departure of Mayers, United kept losing wickets.
Medium pacer Faheem jolted United with a double strike in the ninth over.
First, he dismissed Colin Munro (nine off 13) who was caught by wicket-keeper Haseebullah and then sent captain Salman Ali Agha (naught) back to the pavilion as the batter top-edged a short ball which was caught by Mark Chapman at deep square leg. United were now 70-3.
Saud, the part-time slow left-arm spinner, in the next over bowled a dangerous-looking Farhan who failed in his attempt to play a slog sweep. Farhan made 39 off 24 balls with the aid of four sixes and a couple of fours.
Faheem excelled again with two wickets in the 13th over.
The pacer picked up his third wicket when he bowled wicket-keeper/batter Andries Gous (eight). Two balls later, Shahzad (zero) fell as Saud took a stunning catch while diving to his right at extra cover that left United 91-6 in 13 overs.
Mohammad Nawaz, who was dropped by Jamieson off Faheem at long-on in the 13th over, took full advantage of the chance plundering 49 off 34 with help of five sixes and a four.
In the process, he alongside Haider (10) added a crucial 39 runs off 26 balls for the seventh wicket before the latter was caught by Rossouw at long-on off Khurram.
After touching 100 mark in 15.1 overs, United accelerated scoring courtesy Nawaz’s calculated hitting.
Having hit Jamieson for a maximum in the 11th over, Nawaz smashed Abrar for a six in the 16th over; the left-hander in the next over lifted Faheem for two more sixes and then struck a six and a four off Jamieson in the last over before getting caught brilliantly by Haseebullah. Jason Holder made 14 not out off 11.
Faheem picked up 4-25 in three overs.

While KWSC Chief Operating Officer Asadullah Khan had on Thursday said that the repair work would be completed by Saturday night, a water utility spokesman said that the repair work was still in progress and would be completed by Sunday (today).
The leakage in the main supply line wreaked havoc on Karachi University and nearby housing societies. It also caused an acute water shortage in several areas of the metropolis.
 
 

Officials said that the city required over 1,200 million gallons of water daily and it was getting 400 MGD, out of a regular supply of 650MGD, due to the repair work on the Siphon No 19.
The KWSC spokesman said that the water would be released to the Siphon No 19 after the completion of the repair work. The water pumped from the Dhabeji Pumping Station usually took 14 to 16 hours to reach the city’s distribution network, he added.

“100 per cent of samples of tea leaves and 90 per cent of milk samples collected in different areas have been found adulterated and contaminated with chemicals and added colours,” the officials added.
Speaking to Dawn on Saturday, they said that the SFA had recently inspected as many as 127 tea shops and stalls in different parts of Karachi to collect samples of the two major ingredients of the aromatic beverage prepared by boiling water, milk, sugar and cured leaves.
Their analysis showed that all of them were using contaminated and adulterated tea leaves, while only 10 per cent were using pure milk, they added.

Food Authority says milk was adulterated with detergent, carbonates, salt and water

They said that 80 per cent samples of the milk collected from 127 tea shops were found adulterated with different chemicals, while 10 per cent had water adulteration.
The sources added that the milk samples were found adulterated and contaminated with detergent, carbonates, salt, sugar, skimmed milk and added water.
They said, tea leaves in all 110 inspected tea stalls and shops were also found adulterated and contaminated.
SFA Director General Asif Jan Siddiqui said that the collected samples of the milk and tea leaves were examined by the collaborated laboratory of the SFA and the University of Karachi.
He said the authority had planned a strict action against the use of adulterated and contaminated ingredients of tea — a popular hot drink throughout the world. “Strict action will be taken against those involved in the supply and business of the adulterated milk and tea leaves,” he added.
Mr Siddiqui said that the drive against the use of adulterated ingredients in chai had been launched in all seven districts of the city and all 127 samples of the tea leaves contained polyphenols, a low-cost material found in different plants and used by manufactures and supplies to increase profit.
The SFA chief said that tea adulteration with other plants negatively impacts health, potentially leading to digestive issues and other complications.
He said that the adulterants diluted the natural polyphenol content of the tea, affecting its quality.
The officials said that the tea shops and stalls were selected in different localities across the city. The areas included Clifton, Saddar, Burns Road, old city areas, Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Federal B Area, Gulshan Iqbal, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Korangi, Shah Faisal, SITE, Keamari and Malir.
The district-wise report of the samples, available with Dawn, said that only 10 per cent sample were found adulterated with added water and did not have any other adulterants.
 
 

According to the district-wise break-up of the collected samples, he said that as many as 43 samples of milk were taken from as many shops in district South and 19 of them were found adulterated.
Nine out of 16 samples collected in Korangi were detected adulterated, 10 out of 20 in Malir, five out of 16 in East, six out of 13 in Keamari, three out of seven in West and two out of 12 samples in district Central.
Alarmingly, all 110 samples of tea leaves in seven districts were found adulterated with polyphenols.
Of them, 43 were taken in district South, 16 in Korangi, three in West, 13 in Keamari, 16 each in East and Malir and three in district Central.

The authorities were using a private van to transport prisoners; the driver and the vehicle were released by the gunmen.
Officials said that a police team was shifting 10 prisoners to Quetta and the central jail in Mach from Gadani jail.
 
 

When the wagon reached the Mangocher area of the Kalat district in late evening, the armed men were blocking the national highway and inspecting every vehicle, including buses and trucks.
After they came across the prison van, they freed the prisoners and kidnapped five police personnel, who were guarding the van, along with their official weapons.
Two police personnel dressed in plainclothes, however, remained safe.
The prisoners included one condemned prisoner who was awarded a death sentence and another was awarded life imprisonment and both were tried for killing their wives. Other prisoners allegedly involved in drug smuggling were coming to Quetta for their case hearing on May 5.
Officials said that security forces had launched a search operation in the hilly area of Mongochar and the surrounding areas to recover the hostages. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident.

An official statement issued here said that Mr Saif met deputy head of the US Embassy in Islamabad where both sides discussed the tense situation between Pakistan and India following the ‘false flag’ operation in Pahalgam.
The discussions also covered regional peace, law and order, and the political climate at both national and provincial levels, the statement said, adding that Mr Saif strongly condemned India’s baseless allegations post-Pahalgam and highlighted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s war-mongering behaviour.
The statement said that the KP government’s spokesperson briefed the US diplomat on ‘politically-motivated’ and ‘fabricated’ cases against political prisoners, including PTI founding chairman Imran Khan. 
The two sides also discussed development issues in the province, especially in the merged districts.
Mr Saif stated that the KP government was specially focusing on development of the merged areas, and emphasised that the provincial government was investing heavily in improving law and order, education, and health sectors for the welfare of the people.
The US diplomat appreciated the provincial government’s initiatives for public welfare and assured full cooperation from the United States, the statement said.

Paweł Małaszko arrived in Gilgit on Saturday as part of his adventure to cycle across Pakistan — from the shores of the Arabian Sea to the K2 Base Camp.
However, his adventure was stalled as the required permit to go to the popular tourist destination couldn’t be issued due to an ongoing legal battle.
On Friday, the GB Chief Court ordered the government to issue the trekking permit to Mr Małaszko.
Last year, the GB government hiked permit fees for mountaineering and trekking expeditions by 300 per cent under the GB Finance Act, 2024.
The region’s tour operators challenged the decision in court, which issued a stay order, effectively suspending the issuance of new permits.
Mr Małaszko had filed an appeal in the GB Chief Court for the trekking permit, according to Asghar Ali Porik, a tour operator.

An official of the GB tourism department said the Polish cyclist has been granted a trekking permit after the court order.
However, permits to other foreigners couldn’t be issued until the court gives a clear directive, the official added.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Małaszko confirmed his journey to the K2 basecamp would begin in the next couple of days.
Before his journey to the K2 Base Camp,  the cyclist travelled to the Khunjerab Pass from Gilgit on Saturday.
He arrived in Gilgit after cycling from Kara­chi, covering a distance of around 1,900 kilometres.
Mr Małaszko said the expedition was not only his dream but also “an opportunity to promote Pakistan as a destination for adventure and exploration throughout Europe and beyond”.
‘Tourism to take a hit’
Since the stay order by the GB Chief Court, the tourism department has stopped issuing permits to foreign adventurers.
The matter has been pending for more than two months since a hearing could not be held due to lawyers’ strike.
Muhammad Ali, a tour operator, told Dawn the delays might force foreigners to cancel their trips this year.
 
 

He added that this would badly hurt the tourism sector as a large number of foreign tourists have planned to visit Pakistan for trekking and mountaineering this year.
The GB tourism department official said 900 foreign mountaineers and trekkers have applied for a visa this year, with more applying for visas every day. Official sources told Dawn the GB cabinet was likely to discuss the issue of permits on May 6.

• Some see status quo after tomorrow’s meeting as war-like situation expected to hike food prices
KARACHI/ISLAMABAD: Despite a long-term decline in inflation and real interest rates above 11 per cent, opinions on the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) likely decision on the policy rate are divided, with trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.
Researchers conducted polls to gauge market sentiment, but the 0.3pc inflation in April has caused division among those who were confident there would be no change in the interest rate.
The SBP’s Monetary Policy Committee will meet on Monday to set the key interest rate for the next two months. The central bank had delivered a surprise by leaving its policy rate unchanged in the last review, disappointing the business community, which was demanding a substantial cut of at least 500bps. Many experts were expecting a slight cut of up to 50bps.
However, once again, many experts believe the SBP would cut the rate by 50bps. Some have also found reason for a likely status quot as they feel the war-like situation between India and Pakistan has created uncertainty that may escalate prices.
This situation may force the central bank to adopt a cautious approach in face of sudden shocks of higher inflation.
In a poll conducted by Topline Securities, 69pc of market participants expect a rate cut of at least 50bps, while 31pc believe that the central bank will maintain the status quo.
“We believe the central bank will maintain the status quo in the upcoming meeting,” said the Topline.
The April Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to bottom out and clock in below 0.50pc year-on-year at 0.29pc. For the full FY25, inflation is expected to average between 4.5 and 5pc, it added.
However, a poll conducted by Reuters shows that out of 14 analysts and investors, nine believe that the State Bank will keep the rate unchanged; three expect a 50bps cut, while the two were expecting a 100bps cut.
Due to continuous deceleration in inflation, it is generally believed in the financial sector that the interest rate should be reduced for two reasons: to attract domestic investors, increase economic growth, and reduce the real interest rate, now over 11pc.
The State Bank has slashed the interest by 1,000bps since June 2024 to 12pc and kept it unchanged in March. The business circle demands further cuts to revive economic activities, but the policymakers look cautious, fearing higher inflation in the coming months.
Some bankers believe the geopolitical tensions added uncertainty, which demands a cautious approach.
A Tresmark (global currency tracker) poll shows 68pc of traders expect no change in monetary policy stance. CPI has collapsed to 0.3pc in April against 0.7pc in March and 17.3pc last year. Core inflation has dipped to 7.4pc. A textbook setup for a rate cutMarkets are rattled by trade risks, capital outflows, and a central bank that’s rightly cautious, it said.
“Over $225m has quietly exited from bonds and equities in April. A cut could widen the exit door,” said the Tresmark report.
“That said, the growth story is buried. Export-to-GDP keeps falling. FDI is limp. If there’s ever been a case for monetary stimulus, it’s now. Perhaps the central bank may need to prioritise growth over caution,” said Tresmark CEO Faisal Mamsa.
Businesses call for major cut
Meanwhile, the United Business Group leader has strongly slammed the high interest rate regime and said that the benefits of low inflation should be reflected in the SBP policy rate decision.
Member Central Core Committee United Business Group (FPCCI) Ahsan Zafar Bakhtawari said that 0.3pc inflation in April had created a ground to cut the interest rate by 400bps to 8pc and bring down the electricity tariff to Rs26 per unit to provide real relief to the economy.
“When inflation has dropped to such a low level, bringing the policy rate down to single digits is both economically logical and essential for policy coherence,” he said while addressing a meeting of the business community in Islamabad on Saturday.
“Reducing the interest rate to 8pc would stimulate investment, lower borrowing costs, and accelerate economic activity,” he said.
At the same time, the business community expressed serious concerns about high electricity rates, which were hurting industrial production and squeezing the purchasing power of ordinary consumers.
The business community warned that if this opportunity is not seized, the country could face industrial stagnation, unemployment, and economic slowdown despite the temporary dip in inflation.
The Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) also urged the SBP to cut its policy rate to single digits to stimulate industrial activity and drive sustainable economic growth.
RCCI President Usman Shaukat emphasised that the current interest rate is significantly hampering business growth and must be lowered.
“Pakistan currently maintains the highest interest rate regime in the region,” said Mr Shaukat in a statement.

The protest came in the wake of the deadly April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Occupied Kashmir, which left 26 people dead and reignited tensions between India and Pakistan.
India has accused Pakistan of involvement in the attack, an allegation Islamabad has firmly denied, instead calling for an independent and impartial investigation into the incident.
Waving Pakistan flags and placards, demonstrators chanted slogans including, “Gen Asim Munir Zindabad”, “Pakistan Zindabad”, “Kashmir belongs to Pakistan” and “We condemn Indian terrorism”.
 
 

The protesters also denounced India Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Hindutva ideology, with chants of “Modi is terrorist” and “Down with Hindutva ideology” echoing through the streets.
PML-N UK President Ahsan Dar addressed the protesters, saying:“ This huge show is a reflection of the sentiment Pakistani overseas have for their motherland. Today, Pakistanis from across the UK have gathered outside India House to express their support for the civilian and military leadership of Pakistan.
He added that India had hastily blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack without presenting any evidence. “It’s clear this was a false flag operation aimed at maligning Pakistan.”
Dar also highlighted the unity among the diaspora community. “We countered Indian protesters on April 25 in large numbers. We are glad that activists of PTI, PML-N and other parties joined us against Indian aggression. The whole nation is united.”
The demonstration remained peaceful but drew significant attention from passersby and local media.
London Police maintained a visible presence to ensure order.

Religious groups have gained strength after the toppling of the iron-fisted regime of Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, opposing attempts at reforms they say are un-Islamic.
Hefazat-i-Islam — an influential group made up of multiple political parties, Muslim organisations and religious schools — issued a string of demands at Saturday’s rally, including the abolishment of a government women’s commission seeking equality.
“Men and women can never be equal: the Holy Quran outlines specific codes of life for both genders,” said Mohammad Shihab Ud­din, 53, leader of a women’s mad­­rassa, a religious school. “There is no way we can go beyond that.”
No date has been set for elections, but caretaker leader Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who heads the interim government, has promised polls will be held by June 2026 at the latest.
 
 

Muhammad Umar Faruq, 30, another teacher at a seminary, said they helped the interim government run the country.
“If a government atte­mpts anything anti-Isla­mic in a country where 92 per cent of the population is Muslim, we will reject it immediately,” he said.
Hasina, who was blamed for extensive human rights abuses, took a tough stand against Islamist movements during her autocratic 15-year rule.
Since she fled to India — where she has defied extradition orders to face charges of crimes against humanity — religious groups have become emboldened.
Religious parties have demanded an end to a swath of activities, including cultural events deemed “anti-Islamic” — from music to theatre festivals, women’s football matches and kite-flying celebrations.

• Food depots being relocated from exposed areas to safer zones
• Officials asked to develop contingency plans to ensure uninterrupted food supply
MUZAFFARABAD: The Food Department of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has accelerated efforts to replenish wheat flour stocks in vulnerable areas along the Line of Control (LoC), amid heightened tensions with India and fears of possible incursion from across the divide.
In snowbound and remote areas of AJK — many of which lie adjacent to the LoC — the Food Department traditionally stocks specially treated wheat flour with an extended shelf life to sustain local populations from December through May. In comparatively safer areas, routine storage is limited to a 15-day supply due to easier accessibility.
However, in response to fresh directives from AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, the department has begun increasing reserves in forward locations to meet the needs of residents for at least two months.
“In accordance with the prime minister’s instructions, we have launched an intensive operation to ensure wheat flour stocks are available for a full two months in the entire LoC belt,” AJK’s Minister for Food Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim told Dawn.
He said the government was simultaneously working on relocating food depots from areas exposed to potential shelling or military activity to relatively safer zones without disrupting access for residents.
 
 

The minister added that he had also instructed officials to prepare contingency plans to maintain uninterrupted food supply chains to vulnerable settlements, especially those that were frequently cut off during winter or during episodes of Indian shelling.
On Thursday, the AJK premier had informed the Legislative Assembly that he had constituted a special ‘Emergency Response Fund’ with an initial allocation of Rs1 billion.
The fund would cater to urgent needs such as replenishment of wheat flour, procurement of lifesaving medicines, and provision of other essential services in the 13 constituencies situated along the volatile LoC, spanning six districts — Neelum, Jhelum Valley, Haveli, Poonch, Kotli and Bhimber.
When contacted, AJK Food Department Director Abdul Hameed Kiani said sufficient wheat flour stocks had already been secured in all depots along the LoC.
“However, in light of the prime minister’s instructions and the uncertain situation, we are now increasing our storage capacity to meet a two-month demand,” he said.
“All contractors engaged by the department have been mobilised to use the maximum number of vehicles to deliver wheat flour in the shortest possible time,” he said, adding that department officials were supervising dispatches directly — both at the flour mills and in the delivery zones.
According to Mr Kiani, nearly 70 per cent of the target had so far been achieved.
On Saturday, around 250 tonnes of flour were dispatched from a single mill on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad.
Food Inspector Syed Zawar Haider, who was overseeing operations at the mill, said the consignments were being sent to various parts of Neelum Valley and forward areas of Jhelum Valley district.
“We are executing the task without interruption and expect to complete the operation within the next two days,” he said.
