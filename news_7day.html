As New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam attack, which Islamabad denied, PAF downed six Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The praise from Lt Gen Gang came as a high-level defence delegation led by him called on PAF’s Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, the military’s media affairs wing said in a press release on Tuesday.
“Lauding the professional acumen and strategic foresight of PAF’s leadership, the visiting dignitary paid rich tribute to the exemplary performance of Pakistan Air Force during the recent conflict with India,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated.
Gen Wang, chief of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (Plaaf), praised the “decisive and measured response delivered by PAF pilots under the resolute leadership of the air chief, describing it as a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”.
 


During their meeting, the two air force heads discussed “matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics and avenues of enhanced bilateral cooperation, particularly in the domain of airpower and operational synergy”.
Lt Gen Gang also expressed “deep appreciation for the high state of operational readiness and the cutting-edge capabilities” of the PAF, according to ISPR.
He was “particularly impressed by PAF’s seamless integration of multi-domain operations, terming it a hallmark of modern air warfare and conveyed Plaaf’s keen interest in learning from PAF’s battle-proven experience in multi-domain operations”.
The Plaaf chief was given a comprehensive briefing on PAF’s modern force structure, strategic initiatives and the evolution of its operational doctrine, the ISPR statement added.
 
 

Air Chief Marshal Sidhu also reaffirmed the “strong bond of friendship between the two air forces and reiterated PAF’s commitment to expanding cooperation in training, technology and operational domains”.
He extended a gracious welcome to the distinguished guests, reiterating that Pakistan and China enjoy historic and time-tested ties rooted in mutual trust, strategic convergence, and shared aspirations for regional peace and stability.
“The meeting stands as a testament to the shared resolve of Pakistan and China to advance their time-tested strategic partnership through deepened cooperation and innovation-driven collaboration,” the ISPR highlighted.
The meeting came nearly a week after the air chief met with senior military and political leadership of the United States in the first official visit by a serving PAF air chief in “over a decade”.</p><small>2025-07-09 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091308240364afb.png?r=130930' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923038/aurangzeb-reaffirms-govts-commitment-to-consultative-policy-framework' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb reaffirms govt’s commitment to consultative policy framework</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to maintaining a consultative policy framework as the Pakistan Business Council transitioned its leadership.
Aurangzeb met with a delegation of the PBC led by outgoing CEO Ehsan Malik and incoming CEO Javed Kureishi at the Finance Division.
The minister welcomed the PBC’s transition in leadership and extended his full support to the incoming team, reaffirming the government’s commitment to maintaining an inclusive and ongoing consultative process with key stakeholders in the business community.
During the meeting, Aurangzeb appreciated the constructive role played by the PBC, particularly acknowledging the value of its policy input, research, and the extensive sectoral data regularly shared with the government.
He underscored the importance of evidence-based policymaking and informed the delegation that the Tax Policy Office had been relocated from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to the Finance Division, intending to institutionalise tax policy formulation and strengthen engagement with forums such as the PBC.
Aurangzeb also emphasised that the government places high value on the perspectives and feedback of the business and industrial community, and in keeping with this approach, the consultative process for the federal budget 2025–26 was initiated earlier than usual this year.
 






This step was taken to allow greater time for dialogue, reflection, and integration of a wide range of recommendations received from chambers, trade bodies, and business forums into the budget-making process, he added.</p><small>2025-07-09 08:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0913071430744a4.jpg?r=130737' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923030/armed-attackers-kill-3-in-kps-tank-police' target='_blank'><strong>Armed attackers kill 3 in KP’s Tank: police</strong></a><br><p>Three people, including two brothers, were killed inside their house by armed attackers in the Mulazai area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank district in the early hours of Wednesday, police said.
Public Relations Officer (PRO) to the Tank District Police Officer Ahmad Khan told Dawn.com, “The incident took place in the Mulazai village where armed men entered the victims’ house and opened indiscriminate fire on them. As a result, three people, including two brothers, were killed.”
According to Khan, initial reports suggested that the incident was related to old enmity.
A first information report (FIR) was lodged under sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (punishment of murder) and 324 (attempt to commit murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code against six suspects and further interrogation into the case has begun.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered on the complaint of the deceased father.
It stated that the complainant was asleep in his residence when he heard gunshots being fired. When he came out of his room, he saw “six people firing at his sons”, who then ran away. When he went to the guest room, he found all the victims dead.
The PRO said the dead bodies were shifted to the district headquarters hospital, Tank, for medical and legal procedures.
 
 

He added that the assailants had fled the scene after committing the crime.
On Monday, a woman was arrested in the Kata Kot area of Haripur district for allegedly beating her stepson to death.
In May, a man and his two sons were shot dead in Mardan district by five suspects who fled the scene, while six people, including three women, lost their lives in an exchange of fire over a family feud in Peshawar.</p><small>2025-07-09 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091204514606760.png?r=120547' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923025/apple-eyes-us-formula-1-broadcast-rights-after-f1-the-movie-success' target='_blank'><strong>Apple eyes US Formula 1 broadcast rights after ‘F1: The Movie’ success</strong></a><br><p>Apple is in talks to acquire the US broadcast rights to screen Formula 1 when the contract becomes available next year, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, following the success of Brad Pitt-starrer F1: The Movie.
The report follows the strong box office performance of Apple’s high-octane racing film F1: The Movie, which has grossed $293 million in its first 10 days, according to Variety and other outlets.
The iPhone maker is challenging current US broadcaster ESPN, owned by Disney, for the Formula 1 rights next year, the FT report said, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.
Netflix’s Formula 1: Drive to Survive series helped boost the sport’s popularity in the United States, a momentum Apple now hopes to capitalise on.
Several media outlets reported in February that Netflix is among the contenders for Formula 1’s US broadcasting rights from the 2026 season as ESPN’s exclusivity period to negotiate a new contract with F1 expired.
Apple and F1 did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.</p><small>2025-07-09 07:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09113308f9bcebd.png?r=121835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923022/us-justice-dept-scrambles-to-defend-its-about-face-on-release-of-epstein-files' target='_blank'><strong>US Justice Dept scrambles to defend its about-face on release of Epstein files</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s Justice Department scrambled on Tuesday to answer questions after its leadership concluded there was no evidence to support a number of long-held conspiracy theories about the death of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged clientele.
Conservative influencers from Laura Loomer to Elon Musk have criticised Attorney General Pam Bondi and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Kash Patel for their findings, which came months after Bondi pledged to reveal major revelations about Epstein, including “a lot of names” and “a lot of flight logs”.
“It’s sitting on my desk right now to review,” Bondi told Fox News in February when she was asked if the Justice Department would be releasing Epstein’s client list.
On Tuesday at the White House, Bondi walked that comment back, telling reporters that she was referring to the entire Epstein “file” along with other files pertaining to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. “That’s what I meant by that,” she said.
She added that the many of the videos in the Epstein investigative file “turned out to be child porn”. This material, she added, is “never going to be released. Never going to see the light of day”.
The Justice Department’s memo on Epstein, released on Monday, concluded that after reviewing more than 300 gigabytes of data, there was “no incriminating client list” nor was there any evidence that Epstein may have blackmailed prominent people.
 
 

The memo also confirmed prior findings by the FBI which concluded that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell while awaiting trial, and not as a result of a criminal act such as murder.
A subsequent report by the Justice Department’s inspector general later found that the Bureau of Prisons employees who were tasked with guarding Epstein failed to search his cell or check on him in the hours before his suicide.
Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, a former conservative podcaster, both previously made statements before working at the FBI about a so-called client list and often suggested that the government was hiding information about Epstein from the American public.
Trump defended them in a Truth Social post on Monday amid a backlash by his Make America Great Again (MAGA) base, calling them the “greatest law enforcement professionals”.
 


He expressed annoyance when reporters asked him questions about Epstein on Tuesday at the White House during a cabinet meeting, saying, “Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?”
 


Musk claims former Trump aide in the files
Tech tycoon Elon Musk, now Trump’s estranged former close aide, said on X: “How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?”
When their feud blew up last month, Musk alleged that Trump was named in the Epstein files, but he later deleted his posts.
Musk further claimed Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Trump during his first presidency, was “in the Epstein files”.
He was replying to a post that shared a 2024 report stating that Epstein “spent hours being interviewed on camera” by Bannon.
 


“They arrested (and killed) Peanut, but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list,” Musk said in another post, referring to an Instagram-famous squirrel seized by New York state authorities last year.
“Government is deeply broken,” the Tesla boss added.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said his country hoped the truce would contribute to regional stability, and emphasised Riyadh’s position “in supporting dialogue through diplomatic means as a path to resolving disputes,” the ministry said in a post on X early on Wednesday.
According to the Saudi ministry, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi “expressed his gratitude” to Riyadh for its condemnation of Israel’s attacks on Iran last month.
 






Israel launched its unprecedented bombing campaign on Iran on June 13, targeting military and nuclear facilities as well as residential areas. The strikes killed more than 1,000 people in Iran, including senior military commanders and nuclear scientists, according to Tehran.
Israel, in turn, was hit by waves of drone and missile fire from Iran, which Israeli authorities said left at least 28 people dead.
The United States, which had been in talks with Iran about its nuclear programme since April, joined Tel Aviv’s war and carried out its own strikes on Iran on June 22, targeting several nuclear sites.
The talks between Tehran and Washington have since stalled, but the ceasefire between Iran and Israel has been in place since June 24.
 
 

Iran and Saudi Arabia have often been on opposing sides of regional conflicts, including in Syria and Yemen. The two regional heavyweights broke off diplomatic relations in 2016 before re-establishing them in 2023 under a rapprochement deal brokered by China.
It amounted to a diplomatic achievement for Prince Mohammed, who has taken a more conciliatory approach to regional diplomacy in recent years.
Saudi Arabia condemned the Israeli strikes on Iran last month, calling them “aggressions” and a “clear violation of international laws”.
Riyad also expressed its “great concern” following the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Araghchi held “fruitful conversations” with Prince Mohammed, as well as Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan and Defence Minister Prince Khaled bin Salman about bilateral relations and developments in the region.</p><small>2025-07-09 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/686dae49b169c.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922923/occupants-of-nine-buildings-start-vacating-as-demolition-drive-begins-in-karachis-lyari' target='_blank'><strong>Occupants of nine buildings start vacating as demolition drive begins in Karachi’s Lyari</strong></a><br><p>• Lyari residents protest against ‘building safety’ crackdown
• Governor visits affected people, announces 80-sq-yd plots for displaced families
• Five-member inquiry committee tasked with investigating building collapse holds first meeting
KARACHI: With the provincial government setting up a high-powered committee to investigate the recent collapse of a multi-storey building in Lyari that killed 27 people, authorities have ordered occupants of nine “dilapidated” buildings to vacate their homes as an operation begins to demolish one of the “weakened” structures in the same vicinity.
The developments came in the wake of the tragedy, which also left several families displaced and raised alarm over the state of “ageing and illegally constructed buildings” in the city.
Some occupants of such buildings were seen emptying their homes on Tuesday and transporting their belongings to temporary abodes.
A number of residents also staged a protest demonstration, demanding that the government provide alternative housing before demolishing the properties they had purchased with their hard-earned money.
In the early hours of Tuesday, demolition crews began tearing down one of the nine newly identified structures as part of an emergency safety drive.
Officials said the buildings had been found to be structurally “unsound” and posed a severe risk to occupants and nearby residents.
A spokesperson for the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) confirmed that notices had been issued to the occupants, urging them to vacate immediately in order to avoid further tragedies.
Governor visits displaced families
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori on Tuesday visited the site of the collapsed building.
During the visit, he faced a group of emotional residents and activists demanding accountability and immediate relief.
Public outrage over the tragedy continues and has led to street protests in the affected area.
Mr Tessori, accompanied by senior administration officials, met with the affected families and promised swift support.
He announced that each displaced family would be allotted an 80-square-yard residential plot.
“We stand with the victims during this difficult time. We will ensure no family is left without shelter,” he said, adding that interim housing arrangements would be made until permanent plots are allocated.
Speaking to the media, Governor Tessori vowed to personally look into the matter.
“I will be sending all my recommendations regarding this tragedy to the Sindh government through a formal letter. This is no minor matter. There will be no silence, and those responsible will be held to account,” he stated.
He also urged the provincial government to provide six months’ rent and temporary relocation within the same locality for residents evacuated from the dangerously unsafe buildings.
He further assured that the Governor House would remain actively engaged in relief efforts, offering essential support including ration supplies and employment opportunities for the affected families.
As the government continues to identify more dangerous structures, questions remain about the authorities’ capacity to both enforce regulations and ensure humane treatment of residents displaced by such enforcement.
Five-member committee notified
The Sindh government on Tuesday formed a five-member inquiry committee headed by Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, comprising Special Secretary Ayesha Hameed, SBCA’s Nadeem Ahmed and Asif Ali Langah and the local government department’s Hammadullah Seehar.
“The committee has been directed to conduct a thorough inquiry into the incident, which occurred on 4 July 2025, and submit its findings within 48 hours. The Terms of Reference (ToRs) also mandate the committee to identify those responsible for negligence and propose recommendations to prevent similar incidents in the future,” said a statement detailing the notification.
“Furthermore, the committee is tasked with developing a mechanism for the evacuation of residents from buildings deemed dangerous. It has been authorised to co-opt any relevant officer required during the course of the inquiry.”
The committee held its maiden meeting on Tuesday.

The Golden Visa is a long-term residence visa that enables foreign talent to live, work, or study in the UAE while enjoying a range of exclusive benefits. According to the UAE government’s official portal, eligible categories include investors, entrepreneurs, scientists, outstanding students and graduates, humanitarian pioneers, and frontline heroes.
This week, several Indian media outlets, including The Press Trust of India and The Hindu, reported that the UAE government had initiated a “new nomination-based visa policy”, allowing Indians to “enjoy the UAE’s Golden Visa for life by paying a fee of AED100,000”.
Meanwhile, Times of India reported that the newly launched scheme was in its pilot phase and was currently available to applicants from both India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applications expected in the first three months. Dubai-based Gulf News also reported on Monday that Bangladeshi citizens could apply for the Golden Visa remotely if they meet the requirements.
“The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has denied the accuracy of rumours circulated by some local and international media outlets and websites regarding the United Arab Emirates granting lifetime Golden Visas to certain nationalities,” the WAM report said.
“ICP clarified that the categories, conditions, and regulations of the Golden Visa are clearly defined in accordance with official laws, legislations, and ministerial decisions.”
According to WAM, the ICP emphasised that “all Golden Visa applications are handled exclusively through official government channels within the UAE, and that no internal or external consultancy entity is recognised as an authorised party in the application process”.
The federal authority said it had “recently observed news articles from a consultancy office based in another country, suggesting that lifetime Golden Visas could be obtained for all categories from outside the UAE via consulting or commercial entities under simplified conditions”.
The WAM report further added: “These claims have no legal basis and were made without coordination with the relevant authorities in the UAE. The federal authority reaffirmed its commitment to providing a safe and transparent environment for applicants.”
It also stated that legal action would be taken against entities “spreading such false information in an attempt to illegally collect money from individuals aspiring to live and reside in the UAE, exploiting their hopes for a dignified and secure life.”
The federal authority urged individuals wishing to visit, live, or invest in the UAE not to respond to inaccurate rumours and false news aimed at a quick profit. They should avoid paying any fees or submitting personal documents to any party claiming to provide these services, the report said.
 
 

The Economic Times quoted a top golden visa consultant based in Dubai as rebutting the Golden Visa reports.
“I checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue,” Iqbal Marconi, ex-chief executive officer of ECH Group (which Khaleej Times has described as the largest golden visa facilitator in the region), told Economic Times.
“The only new update they have is that crypto investors won’t be considered for the Golden Visa scheme. I checked with the GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai) also; they too said they don’t have any information on this, “ Marconi said.
He added that a “couple of officials […] in the same line of work” whom he contacted also did not have any information in this regard.</p><small>2025-07-09 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091050333ea7e9c.png?r=105104' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922953/frontline-players-ignored-again-as-pakistan-name-squad-for-bd-t20s' target='_blank'><strong>Frontline players ignored again as Pakistan name squad for BD T20s</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Pakistan selectors on Tuesday anno­unced a 15-member squad for the upcoming three-match T20 International series against Bangladesh, with five frontline players including former captains Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Shah Afr­idi omitted for a second series in a row, while two uncapped pacers were called up.
Vice-captain Shadab Khan and fast bowler Haris Rauf were also ruled out due to fitness issues. Shadab is recovering from shoulder surgery in England, while Haris sustained a hamstring injury during a T20 league match in the United States last week.
Babar, Rizwan, and Shaheen were left out again as the selectors continue to experiment with new faces ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup, scheduled for February-March next year in India and Sri Lanka.
While Babar and Rizwan have faced criticism for their strike rates in the format, Shaheen’s recent dip in form has also been a factor despite the pacer topping the bowling charts of the Pakistan Super League earlier this year. Both Rizwan and Babar last featured in the T20I squad during the South Africa tour last year, whereas Shaheen played on the New Zealand tour after that.
 
 

Fast bowlers Ahmed Daniyal, 28, and Salman Mirza, 31, have been rewarded for their strong performances in the PSL and are set to make their T20I debuts.
The squad also sees the return of all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz, who last played a T20I in January 2024, and left-arm spinner Sufyan Muqeem. Middle-order batter Hussain Talat, who was also picked in last month’s home series against Bangladesh, continues to stay in the national squad having played his last T20I in 2021. However, his selection has raised some eyebrows given a modest record of 394 runs and four wickets in 18 T20Is.
The squad will be led by Salman Ali Agha, who continues as captain, while no vice-captain has been named in the absence of Shadab.
In an unusual development, the squad was announced by Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) Chief Operating Officer Sumair Ahmad Sayed and Media Director Amir Mir — instead of any member of the four-person selection committee.
Although committee member Aaqib Javed was present at the National Cricket Academy adjacent to the Gaddafi Stadium, and both Azhar Ali and Aleem Dar reside in Lahore, none of the selectors attended the press conference.
 


The announcement came abruptly following a previously scheduled presser by the PCB’s domestic cricket department, catching the media off guard. It marked the first time that a national squad was unveiled by PCB’s administrative and media personnel rather than the selectors themselves.
The national team will assemble in Karachi for a training camp starting Wednesday ahead of the Bangladesh tour. The T20I matches are scheduled to be held on July 20, 22 and 24 at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka.
The squad for the white-ball series against the West Indies, scheduled after the Bangladesh tour, will be announced later.
Squad: Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Ahmed Daniyal, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Hassan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Sahibzada Farhan (wicket-keeper), Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Sufyan Muqeem

A day ago, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had announced that Fidan, along with Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler, will visit Pakistan on July 9. Fidan also paid a visit to Pakistan in May last year.
“During his official engagements in Pakistan, all important issues of mutual interest will be discussed,” the Foreign Office said in a post on X. “The visit reflects the close and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, culture, and mutual trust.”
 






It added that upon their arrival, the visiting dignitaries were received by Pakistan’s Additional Secretary for West Asia, Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani.
 






Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious, and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect.
On Tuesday, Pakistan had extended condolences to Turkiye after 12 Turkish soldiers died of methane exposure in Iraq during a search mission in the Claw-Lock Operation zone a day earlier.
Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met on the sidelines of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) summit in Khankendi, Azerbaijan, to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.
The two leaders discussed deepening cooperation in key areas, including trade, energy, defence, connectivity and investment. PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to working closely with Turkiye to promote peace, stability and sustainable development in the region.
In February, President Erdogan also visited Pakistan, during which both nations pledged to ensure bilateral trade worth $5bn.</p><small>2025-07-09 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09102441549e5c1.jpg?r=102606' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922878/punjab-police-officers-asked-to-submit-dual-nationality-certificates-by-monday' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab police officers asked to submit dual nationality certificates by Monday</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI:Following the Inspector General of Police Punjab’s orders, police officers and officials holding dual citizenship have been directed to promptly submit their dual nationality certificates.
City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani, in his directives to all SPs, including security, CIA and Investigation, SDPOs, SHOs, Muharrar police lines, security division and in-charges of Dolphin Force, Elite Force and others to submit dual citizenship certificate, either they have been holding or not, without any delay by Monday.
Earlier in May, IGP Dr Usman Anwar had sought the details of the police officials and officres of Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), who had been holdingdualnationality.
 
 

The IGP had also sought the details of how many police officials of inspectors ranks, inspector legal and senior traffic wardens had been holding dual nationality.
In this regard, a performa, seeking the name of region and unit, names of the country holding dual citizenship, date of holding dual citizenship and name of inspector Establishment Branch, Inspector Legal, inspector /telecommunication, fingerprint bureau & Senior Traffic Warden etc holding dual nationality.
The IGP has directed the police across the province, including IGP National Highway & Motorway Police Islamabad, the commandant national police academy Islamabad, additional inspector generals of police South Punjab, Multan, Investigation branch, Special Branch, CTD, PHP, IAB, EPF, Operations, Crime Control Department (CCD) and Training, Punjab to provide the details of their dual citizenship.
All regional police officers (RPOs), DG anti-corruption Punjab, DG FIA Islamabad, COO Safe Cities Authority, the Chief Traffic Officers, Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Multan and Rawalpindi. All principal Police Training Schools in Punjab and Commandant Ring Road Police Lahore had been directed to provide the names of officers with ranks DSP, ASP and above, postings and dual nationality, if yes then also mention the name of the country.
A senior police officer revealed that 30 to 40 percent of officials/officers’ families had been holding dual nationalities of different countries, including Canada, Turkiye, UK and Malta and this trend is more in Punjab police compared to KPK and other provinces.
While citing one example of a police officer who went abroad for study after getting long leave from the police department but when he returned back to Pakistan, he was holding a dual nationality.
Another police officer said that one should be asked whether the police officers/officials themselves have been holding dual nationality and how many families of police officials/officers have been holding dual nationality.
Once the families of police officers/officials get the dual nationality, it becomes much easier for them to get it after retirement or in case of acquitting the job.

According to Italy’s Corriere della Sera daily, the man was a 35-year-old Italian. It said he burst into the airport, then used an emergency exit to rush onto the runway towards an aircraft preparing for take-off.
Earlier in the day, Spanish airline Volotea wrote on social media that its flight from Bergamo to Asturias in Spain was involved in an “incident” at 10:35am.

Addressing a press conference at the residence of former president of Supreme Court Bar Association Abdul Lateef Afeidi (late) at Hayatabad on Tuesday, ANP central president Senator Animal Wali Khan emphasised that the party would vigorously defend both the 18th and 25th Amendments at all costs.
On the occasion, several people, including the family of Abdul Lateef Afridi, headed by Danish Afridi, announced joining the ANP.
The party’s provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain and other office-bearers were also present.
Aimal Wali highlighted that the integration of Fata was a historic milestone for ANP, aiming to bring development and modernisation to the region. However, he lamented that the promises made to the people of these areas had not been fulfilled by the government.

Aimal laments promises made to people of ex-Fata remain unfulfilled

He pointed out that the main obstacle to development in the tribal districts was the control over the natural resources in the region.
“The exploitation of these resources without benefiting the local population is keeping them in backwardness,” he said.
Aimal Wali mentioned the irony of Waziristan, where the chilgoza (pine nuts) forests were protected, but the people living there were not safe. He said that this situation underscored the need for prioritising human security over resource protection.
The ANP leader made it clear that the party would strongly resist any possible attempts to roll back the 25th Constitutional Amendment, just as it had defended the 18th Amendment. He reaffirmed his party’s stance, saying that the struggle for protecting the amendment would continue, whether the party ANP was in parliament or not.
Aimal Wali reiterated ANP’s stance against terrorism and extremism. He emphasised that the implementation of the National Action Plan was crucial for establishing peace in the region.
He criticised the Senate elections, suggesting that the outcome was predetermined and that the process was unconstitutional.
Aimal Wali mentioned that ANP was allocated only one reserved seat and expressed willingness to give up even that seat if it could lead to systemic improvements.
He dismissed the news of the President Asif Ali Zardari stepping down and the talk of 27th Amendment as mere attempts to gauge public reaction, calling it a tactic to mislead the public.
He reaffirmed ANP’s commitment to defending constitutional rights, promoting peace, and ensuring development in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The party, he said would remain steadfast in its opposition to any moves that undermine the province’s autonomy and the rights of its people.

• Sets aside notification declaring JUI-F’s Gorpal Singh minority lawmaker
• IHC also issues notice to Election Commission over KP reserved seats
PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday barred two women MPAs-elect of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly from taking oath and directed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to modify its last year’s notification on the allocation of these seats.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal also set aside the ECP’s notification dated March 26, 2024, which had declared Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) candidate Gorpal Singh as MPA-elect on a seat reserved for non-Muslims in the KP Assembly.
The court directed the ECP to reallocate reserved seats for women and non-Muslims within 10 days in accordance with the law, after hearing all relevant political parties, their representatives and contesting candidates.
Until the ECP issues a new decision, the bench ordered that the oath should not be administered to JUI-F MPAs-elect Naheeda Noor and Arifa Bibi, who were elected on the disputed seats.
The bench issued a short order on a petition filed by the PML-N through its KP President Amir Muqam, who challenged two ECP notifications dated March 4 and March 26, 2024. These notifications declared candidates from various parties as MPAs-elect on reserved seats for women and non-Muslims.
The PML-N argued that both it and JUI-F had seven MPAs in the KP Assembly, but while PML-N received eight reserved seats for women, JUI-F was allotted 10. On the non-Muslim seats, JUI-F was granted two out of four seats, whereas PML-N was allocated only one.
The petition also challenged the ECP’s cut-off date of Feb 22, 2024, for independent MPAs to join political parties, after which reserved seat allocations were made.
The bench declared that the ECP’s use of the Feb 22 date for allocating reserved seats was illegal and contrary to the mandate of Article 106 of the Constitution, Sections 18 and 104 of the Elections Act 2017, and Rule 92 of the Elections Rules 2017.
The bench pointed out that the electoral college for reserved seats must include all members of political parties, as well as independent candidates who have joined parties, as of the actual date of election or allocation of the reserved seats.
A panel of lawyers, including Aamir Javed, Saqib Raza and Syed Inayat Shah, appeared for the petitioner and stated that the PML-N had initially won five seats in the Feb 8 general elections, and two independents later joined it.
Mr Javed said that the ECP allegedly calculated reserved seat allocations based on only six MPAs rather than seven. He noted that although an independent MPA joined PML-N on Feb 22, the same day he was officially notified as an MPA-elect, the ECP did not include him in the final seat tally.
Initially, the ECP allocated five women’s seats on Feb 22 — two each to PML-N and JUI-F, and one to PPP. On March 4, it issued a second notification for the remaining 21 seats, resulting in JUI-F receiving a total of 10 reserved seats and PML-N eight.
As for the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, one each was initially allocated to JUI-F, PML-N and PPP. The petitioner contended that the fourth seat should have been decided through a draw between JUI-F and PML-N, but the ECP unilaterally awarded it to JUI-F candidate Gorpal Singh.
The ECP was represented by Special Secretary Zafar Iqbal, legal counsel Mohsin Kamran Siddique, Special Secretary (Law) Mohammad Arshad and Deputy Director Saima Tariq Janjua. Advocate Naveed Akhter appeared for JUI-F and argued that his party had not been made a respondent in the petition despite being directly affected.
IHC issues notice to ECP
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday also issued a notice to the ECP on a petition filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P), seeking suspension of the ECP’s July 2 notification allocating 21 reserved seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the plea. PTI-P’s legal team, comprising Advocates Sultan Muhammad Khan and Tufail Shahzad, appeared in court alongside the party’s Central Secretary General Malik Habib Noor.
Advocate Khan argued that the ECP’s notification was based on flawed calculations and had deprived PTI-P, founded in 2023 by the former KP chief minister Pervez Khattak, of its lawful share of reserved seats. He maintained that the party should have received additional seats based on its performance in the Feb 8 general elections.
Justice Minhas inquired whether any court had suspended the notification. The lawyer confirmed that no stay had been granted so far. The court declined to suspend the notification immediately but issued a notice to the ECP to submit a response and adjourned the hearing.
PTI-P argued that allowing lawmakers elected through the disputed notification to take oath would cause “irreversible prejudice” and undermine the party’s main petition.
The party contended that the ECP’s March 4, 2024, notification erroneously recorded PTI-P as having secured only one general seat in KP, whereas it had actually won two — PK-73 and PK-103. This misrepresentation allegedly cost the party at least three reserved seats.
The matter was also earlier under review in the PHC, which had granted a stay on the oath-taking of MPAs on reserved seats. However, after a two-member PHC bench raised questions about the petition’s maintainability in light of similar proceedings at the IHC, PTI-P withdrew its petition from the PHC, resulting in the dismissal of the case and recall of the stay order.

Magistrate Rana Sheharyar conducted the remand proceedings after the police presented the suspect, Hashir Ali.
The investigating officer said the suspect was a minor and a student of Grade 7. He said custody of the suspect was required to verify his age and further investigation.
The counsel, appearing on behalf of the suspect, opposed the remand request but the magistrate allowed the prosecution’s plea.
The magistrate approved physical remand of the suspect for four days and directed the police to produce him again after completion of the remand period along with the investigation report.
According to police, the underage driver was driving a black SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle) at over 120kph on a road leading to a village in Shahdara when he hit at least three motorcycles.
In the incident, Malik Amin died on the spot while his brother, Malik Farid, was among the injured persons who were shifted to hospital.
Initial investigation reveals the SUV belonged to the owner of the house where the boy lived along with his maternal grandmother.

TOBA TEK SINGH: Seized computers and other gadgets being loaded on a trailer. — Dawn

TOBA TEK SINGH: The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) claimed to have arrested 149 persons, including 48 Chinese and nationals of some other countries, for their alleged involvement in an online fraud, in a raid on a factory at Chak 54-RB, Sirohli, Faisalabad, late on Monday night, in Balochni police station limits.
According to sources, the factory where the raid was conducted is allegedly owned by a former chairman of Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco) Board of Directors, Malik Tehseen Awan.
The sources say that the arrested persons, including 48 Chinese nationals, allegedly involved in hacking banks’ internet systems and other cybercrimes, had been operating from the factory.
The says that the factory owner, Mr Awan, managed to escape during the NCCIA team’s raid.

The premises is allegedly owned by Fesco BoD ex-head; 48 Chinese nationals among the suspects

The team seized a large number of laptops and other gadgets from the factory and had to use a trailer to transport the case property to their office.
Despite efforts by this scribe, no contact could be made with Mr Awan for his version.
The NCCIA has registered seven FIRs, from serial  number 142 to 147, under sections 13, 14 and 16 of Peca, read with  sections 109, 419 and 420 of the PPC, on the complaint of seven different  persons against 149 arrested persons.
Mr Awan would allegedly lure  people to do “online work” through these suspects.
The sources say that the network also deprived people of millions of rupees through Ponzi schemes.
The arrested suspects include 44 men and four women from  China, three men and five women from Nigeria, one man and three women from  Philippines, one man and one woman from Sri Lanka, six men from Bangladesh, one  woman from Zimbabwe, two women from Myanmar and 76 men and two women from  Pakistan.
ACTION RECOMMENDED: The Faisalabad DC has recommended departmental action against the medical superintendent (MS) and two female doctors following the death of a child in the Government Teaching Hospital Ghulam Mohammadabad.
The DC has recommended action against the MS and two doctors to the secretary of Punjab Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Department in the light of an inquiry that found them guilty of negligence and providing inadequate treatment to a child who later died in the hospital.
The allegations stem from the tragic death of one-and-a-half-year-old Muhammad Yousuf, a resident of Ghulam Mohammad Abad.
The child was reportedly brought to the hospital after he choked on a syrup bottle cap on Feb 19. However, the doctors on duty allegedly kept referring the child’s family to different wards unnecessarily, before finally directing them to the Allied Hospital. The child passed away allegedly because of the delay in treatment.
The bereaved family protested against the hospital administration for negligence.
The child’s uncle, Nadeem Ahmed, lodged a complaint with Faisalabad commissioner, who then directed the DC to conduct an inquiry into the matter.
The DC, retired Capt Nadim Nasir, recorded statements of the affected family and the witnesses, besides reviewing the hospital’s CCTV cameras’ footage.
The inquiry found MS Dr Asif Shehzad, Postgraduate Resident (PGR) Dr Ahda Payam, and Women Medical Officer Dr Momina Sohail guilty.
The DC has recommended departmental proceedings against the accused under the Peeda Act.

The decision to post Frontier Corps (FC) personnel for security at the canal was taken by the provincial Apex Committee on Tuesday.
The meeting was presided over by Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and Corps Commander Lt Gen Rahat Nasim Khan.
The meeting was convened to discuss the law and order situation and other issues in the province.
The meeting resolved to intensify the ongoing anti-smuggling drive, with strict action to be taken against transport companies involved in illegal activities and FIRs would be lodged against offending drivers.

Apex committee warns blocking of road or highway won’t be allowed in the name of protest

While reviewing anti-terrorism measures, the meeting directed officials concerned to finalise rules under the Anti-Terrorism Act promptly.
The committee decided that protesters will not be allowed to block roads or highway in any area of Balochistan.
“No road in the province will be allowed to be blocked. The Constitution stands with the person fighting for life in an ambulance,” Mr Bugti said.
Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said action would be taken against those involved in smuggling, illegal remittances, extortion and subversive activities.
The committee also directed the FIA to act against illegal money transfers and step up action against those social media accounts spreading “anti-state propaganda”.
The committee also pledged to eliminate extortion and enhance operations against illegal immigrants.
Police and Levies personnel were ordered to strengthen the counter-terrorism response.
The Home Department briefed members of the committee on the digitalisation of the Fourth Schedule process.
The committee decided the provincial government will expand the Bolan route of the National Highway and construct the Dera Murad Jamali Bypass.
The National Highway Authority (NHA) was ordered to complete the Quetta Western Bypass by December 25.
He warned that anyone acting against the state would face consequences.
If the NHA delays or hinders road projects, the provincial government will assume responsibility for the project’s construction in public interest.
To that end, he said, the government has allocated Rs1.7 billion for the Bolan route expansion.
The meeting also resolved to ban the entry of liquefied petroleum tankers into residential areas.
The committee decided to celebrate Independence Day and ‘Marka-i-Haq’ — the official name for Pakistan’s response to Indian aggression in May — with patriotic spirit.

Speaking at the conf­erence on ‘Pakistan’s Final Warning: Climate Calamity or Col­­lective Action’, the PPP senator said that despite unprecedented clim­a­­te shocks, there was a trou­­­bling silence in policy corridors.
“I see no alarm bells ringing anywhere in power corridors. No budgets are being recalibrated for coping better with the crisis,” she noted.
“If there is one priority for collective climate action in Pakistan it has to be water conservation. The water crisis means we have either too much water in the system and rivers at the wrong time, or too little when and where we need it, to sustain food security and livelihoods across the country.
Pakistan, she noted, is deeply underprepared for the scale of climate investment required: “To meet the climate crisis head on, everything will have to be scaled up. Finance is just one part of it. And let’s be clear — it’s not coming in anywhere close to the quantum needed by frontline ecosystems like ours.”
She also reminded the in­­t­ernational community of their responsibilities and str­­essed the importance of public-private partnerships.

Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi has called the SJC meeting to consider around two dozen pending complaints against superior court judges and a set of recommendations to streamline the process of handling complaints and ensure transparency while probing allegations of misconduct against judges.
The recommendations were prepared by Justice Munib Akhtar, also an SJC member.
The SC, through an announcement on the completion of the first 100 days of CJP Afridi in office, had explained the SJC had examined 46 complaints against constitutional officeholders and 40 of them have been disposed of. In five complaints, comments have been sought while further information was asked for in another case.
In one of the SJC sittings, it was decided regular sessions would be held every month in order to clear the backlog of outstanding complaints against superior court judges on a fast track.
Also, the SJC in its July 12 meeting is expected to resume consideration of a letter by six judges alleging interference by intelligence agencies in judicial affairs and calling for a thorough investigation. The letter was sent by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 25, 2024.
The SJC, at a previous session while considering different options concerning the letter, agreed to expand consultations, noting that the code of conduct of judges also applies to the heads of different institutions.
The letter had earlier prompted the then CJP Qazi Faez Isa to initiate suo motu proceedings after ex-CJP Tassaduq Jillani declined to lead a one-man commission to investigate the alleged meddling in judicial affairs. CJP Afridi, before assuming the top office, had recused himself from hearing the suo motu case, arguing that “inaction by IHC chief justice or judges” should not drag the Supreme Court into imposing its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
“This may affect the functioning of the worthy [IHC] chief justice and judges in their discharge of judicial functions and would amount to interference in the independence of the high courts,” Justice Afridi had suggested at the time.
The weekend meeting of the council will also be attended by senior puisine judge of the Supreme Court Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Sindh High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar.
According to an announcement, the SJC is actively considering amendments to its code of conduct and procedure of enquiry.  The SJC had appointed Justice Munib Akhtar as head of a committee to propose amendments to the code of conduct.

Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan’s Kunar province.
Upon receiving intelligence about a group of Fitna al-Khawarij militants attempting to infiltrate the Pak-Afghan border in Lowi Mamund tehsil’s mountainous areas, security personnel responded swiftly, foiling the attempt and eliminating all eight militants, the sources said.
They said that following the successful action, the security forces have further tightened surveillance and monitoring of the border areas to prevent any future infiltration of Fitna al-Khawarij militants from the Afghan side.
While the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), did not release an official statement about the operation, local residents confirmed the clashes between security forces and militants in the area.
According to the residents, the clashes between the security forces and the militants, which continued for several hours, left one child wounded.
They said that the injured child — identified as Muhammad Khan, son of Abdur Rouf — was first taken to Larkholozo Hospital and later transferred to the District Headquarters Hospital in Khar.
The security forces’ fresh action against militants in Bajaur came about a week after a bomb explosion targeted a government vehicle in the Sadiqabad area of Khar tehsil on July 2, killing five people, including Nawagai Assistant Commissioner Faisal Ismail and Tehsildar Abdul Wakeel Khan, and injuring 17 others, including four policemen.

• Gohar finally meets party founder, asks supporters to prepare for ‘peaceful but powerful’ campaign
• Aleema says Imran’s sons, family will also join movement
ISLAMABAD: As PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Tuesday met party founder Imran Khan in Adiala jail after more than a month of repeated attempts to gain access to the incarcerated former premier, who is said to be kept in solitary confinement, the party founder issued a nationwide protest call.
The meeting between the two party leaders revolved around the protest movement announced by Imran Khan, which will reach its “peak” on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases. According to a statement on his X account in the evening, Imran Khan ruled out any kind of dialogue, saying the time for dialogue had passed.
“For the sake of the country, I have repeatedly talked about negotiations, but now the time for negotiations has passed. After the 26th Constitutional Amendment…the hope we had for justice from the courts has completely disappeared, so now no other method can bring the Pakistani nation out of this swamp of lawlessness except a nationwide protest movement,” the PTI founder said. It is pertinent to note that he does not have access to his social media accounts and someone else posts on his behalf.
“The complete plan of action for the nationwide movement will be presented this week - on August 5, my unjust imprisonment will complete 2 years. This day will be the culmination of our nationwide protest movement,” he said. “Now there will be no negotiations of any kind with anyone! There will be protests only on the streets so that the nation can get rid of the puppet rulers imposed by force,” he added.
 






Speaking to reporters outside the prison, Barrister Gohar confirmed that the PTI founder asked party workers, supporters, and the general public to prepare for a peaceful but powerful protest campaign starting August 5. “This is not just about political revenge anymore—it’s about every citizen’s rights being stolen. The founder has said this movement should now take the shape of a second Pakistan Movement,” Barrister Gohar stated. He revealed that Khan, even while in solitary confinement, remained “mentally sharper and more determined than ever” and “despite being silenced, the founder has given us a message—prepare, mobilise, and raise your voice peacefully but fearlessly”.
The PTI leader also criticised the prison authorities for continued mistreatment and isolation of Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, while also highlighting their prison conditions, disregard of court orders, and systemic efforts to break political resistance through isolation.
Mr Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, who did not meet her brother, also spoke to media persons outside the jail alongside her sisters. She also talked about the protest movement announced by her brother, claiming that the entire family will be a part of the movement. Ms Khan said that Imran’s sons, Qasim and Suleiman, will go to the US to highlight injustices meted out to their father before coming to Pakistan to become part of the movement and Imran Khan had been informed about this. However, Ms Khan did not clarify if the duo will join the movement before Aug 5 or after. She said a plan regarding their visit was being formulated.
‘Solitary confinement’
Ms Khan also painted a grim picture of her brother’s conditions in prison. “He has been kept in complete solitary confinement for months. For the past week, even his newspapers, books, and television have been taken away. What sort of justice is this?” she asked.
She revealed that despite repeated legal requests and court directives, even basic human rights were being denied. “He is not a criminal. He is the former elected prime minister of this country. Yet he is being treated worse than convicted felons,” she claimed.
 
 

Ms Khan said that the PTI founder had told her during a previous brief meeting that his books were lying in the deputy superintendent’s room, inaccessible to him. “What threat do books pose to the state?” she questioned. “His voice is being silenced, his mind is being isolated, and now they want to completely disconnect him from the outside world.” “Even his doctor has not been allowed for 10 months,” he alleged.
Both Ms Khan and Barrister Gohar emphasised that Imran Khan’s health was being deliberately ignored. “For ten months, his personal physician—who has known his medical history for decades—has been denied access. If something happens, who will be responsible?” Ms Khan asked.
She also stated that Bushra Bibi was undergoing similar conditions in her prison cell. “She has been kept in solitary confinement as well. There are no visitors, no sunlight, no communication—just absolute seclusion. Is this how women are treated in custody in Pakistan?”
She said the authorities believe that by isolating the PTI founder, they can dismantle his influence and demoralise his supporters.
“Let me tell you clearly: he cannot be broken.
His spirit is stronger than ever. He told us—whatever happens, his message will reach the people,“ Ms Khan said, referring to Imran Khan’s recent communication from prison.

The melting of ice, which resulted in glacier lake outburst floods (Glofs), blocked roads, damaged homes and left people stranded across GB on Tuesday.
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), high temperatures were recorded across GB last week.
GBDMA DG Zakir Hussain told Dawn the situation in GB is “unusual” this year.
He said high temperatures have increased the risk of flooding in rivers and streams, particularly in Diamer and Gilgit.
Last week, the maximum temperature in Chilas was 48.5°C, the highest since July 17, 1997, when it was recorded at 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature jumped to 46.1°C, the highest since July 1971.
Currently, the water level in rivers and streams across the region is dangerously high as inflows have increased due to rapidly melting glaciers.
According to the GBDMA, a flash flood blocked the Karakoram Highway (KKH) at Gandlu-Muladad Padi near Chilas on Tuesday.
A flood in Hamari stream damaged the Nagar Khas Valley road, while deluge in Supultar nullah blocked the Hoper Valley road.
The rising water level in rivers blocked the Chipurson Valley road in upper Hunza while Siachen Road in Ghanche was severely affected by river erosion in Thugs and Bangilongba areas.
Flooding in the Botogah nullah in Chilas damaged makeshift bridges, leaving the communities without any route to cross the waterway.
Flooding in Hamari and Supultar nullahs in Nagar damaged agricultural land, irrigation and drinking water supply systems, link roads and public and private infrastructures.
Many areas were without water and electricity supply after damage to the infrastructure.
Local administration said continued land erosion in the Hamorkhay area in Nagar Khas has submerged fields, trees and other infrastructure and was threatening over a dozen households.
Flood also damaged public and private properties in Chilas of Diamer, Chipurson areas.
A Glof from Shishper glacier in Hassanabad nullah, Hunza, has once again threatened KKH and local properties.
GBDMA said four houses were evacuated as a precautionary measure following the Glof event.
The local administration has warned people not to travel to affected areas as the risk of flooding and land erosion is high.
Rescue efforts
Mr Hussain, the head of GBDMA, said the authority has mobilised machinery to reopen roads blocked by flooding.
“Our first responsibility is to save the lives of people,” he said, adding locals in affected areas have been shifted to safe places.
The GBDMA was also restoring irrigation channels as a majority of people in the region depended upon agriculture as their livelihood.
According to Mr Hussain, the agency is now looking to identify the behaviours of glaciers to understand the scientific reasoning for melting.
The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission has been requested to provide equipment for the monitoring of glaciers.
Meanwhile, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered the GBDMA, district administration and all relevant departments to remain alert in view of the floods.
All deputy commissioners have been ordered to take timely steps to prevent damage to life and property.
Urban flooding in Punjab
In Punjab, heavy monsoon rainfall on Tuesday triggered urban flooding in several cities as the province braces for above-average rainfall in the coming days.
In Lahore, rainfall led to waterlogging in Jail Road, Qurtaba Chowk, Liberty Chowk, and Lakshmi Chowk.
According to the Met Department, Jail Road and Qurtaba Chowk received the most rainfall, with 46 and 43 mm, respectively.
The average rainfall in the provincial capital on Tuesday was 40mm.
The deluge overwhelmed drainage systems in several areas, forcing the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) workers to install pumps to drain water from inundated areas.
Wasa Managing Director Ghufran Ahmad has directed round-the-clock drainage of water.
He said all resources must be deployed to protect low-lying neighbourhoods from inundation.
Across Punjab, the rainfall pattern showed sharp variations, with Sheikhupura recording the province’s highest total at 48mm.
The provincial government has put all disaster response agencies on high alert after Lahore and several other districts recorded heavy downpours, with Nishtar Town receiving the highest rainfall at 52mm.
PDMA meeting
In Sialkot, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) DG Irfan Ali Kathia held an emergency meeting on the preparedness of local authorities.
Mr Kathia said the province is expected to receive 40 to 60 per cent above-normal rainfall in the coming days.
The heavy rain is expected to result in flooding, particularly in riverine areas near Head Marala, where water flow was 70,000 cusecs on Tuesday.
Local administrations have established relief camps stocked with food and water supplies, while electricity poles have been reinforced.
In rural areas, special teams have been mobilised to protect livestock and ensure their safety during the monsoon.
Gujranwala Division Commissioner Naveed Haider Shirazi has ordered the immediate evacuation of dilapidated buildings.
“We cannot risk any loss of life due to structural collapses during these rains,” Mr Shirazi warned, noting that 16 million residents in his division were potentially at risk.
The authorities have warned people to avoid unnecessary travel and report flooding immediately.
CM’s directives
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has directed all institutions to remain on alert during the monsoon season.
Officials of Wasa, PDMA, local government, Rescue 1122 and traffic police must remain in the field to oversee relief activities and help citizens.
She further directed the commissioners and deputy commissioners to monitor water drainage from low-lying areas and the traffic police should prepare plans to avoid gridlock.

The decision about the programme was made during a meeting of the local government and rural development department here with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in the chair, according to an official statement.
The other participants included cabinet members, the chief secretary, administrative secretaries of the relevant departments, and officials of the local government department.
Mr Gandapur termed the initiative a significant step towards improving sanitation services to ensure cleanliness across village councils at rural areas of the province.
In the first phase, the programme will be implemented in 2,061 rural union councils with an initial estimated cost of Rs5.5 billion.

CM says initiative to ensure cleanliness, provide jobs to thousands of people

During the briefing, it was informed that under the programme, a sanitation workforce of four individuals per union council will be hired on a daily wage basis through a transparent recruitment process. This workforce will be responsible for door-to-door collection of solid waste and its transportation to the designated collection points managed by tehsil municipal administrations. Every union council will initially be provided with one loader vehicle and other necessary equipment for waste collection and sanitation.
The programme’s implementation will be supervised by the respective assistant commissioner, tehsil municipal officer and assistant director (local government).
The participation of elected local government representatives and relevant committees will also be ensured to enhance the programme’s success. Also, an effective monitoring mechanism will be established to oversee its execution.
The meeting was informed that the programme will be formally launched immediately after approval in the upcoming provincial cabinet meeting. In the second phase, the programme will be extended to union councils in the hilly regions of the province.
About the significance of the initiative, the chief minister said that it was a signature programme of the provincial government.
“For the first time in the history of the province, sanitation services are being introduced in rural areas. I hope that the programme will be formally launched by August 14 this year,” he said.
Mr Gandapur said that the initiative would not only ensure cleanliness in rural areas but also provide employment opportunities to thousands of people.
He directed authorities to take all necessary steps for timely implementation of the programme in accordance with the defined timelines.
The chief minister said that transparency and strict adherence to rules and regulations must be ensured in the recruitment of sanitation workers.
He said that a realistic and sustainable strategy should be devised to ensure the long-term continuity of the programme.
Meanwhile, the provincial government has officially launched a digital identity system, Khyber Pass.
A formal ceremony marking the inauguration of the system was held at the Chief Minister’s House on Tuesday, where Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur formally launched the Khyber Pass digital platform.
The ceremony was attended by Special Assistant to the Chief Minister on Information Technology Shafqat Ayaz, members of the provincial cabinet and provincial assembly, and senior government officials.
According to the official statement, Khyber Pass is the first-of-its-kind digital identity system in Pakistan on the basis of a QR code mechanism. It will be integrated with Nadra and other government databases, enabling citizens to access all their identity-related information online. With this system, citizens will no longer need to repeatedly provide personal information to avail government services.
Through a single Khyber Pass digital account, residents will be able to access all public services offered by the provincial government.
The unified QR code will serve as a gateway to services such as health, education, taxation, licensing, property records and more, eliminating the need for multiple registrations or form submissions. Citizens will no longer have to visit different offices or wait in long queues, as services will be accessible online through a single digital ID.

An additional district judge, Liaqat Ali, ruled that plaintiff Asfandyar Wali Khan had got a cause of action and was entitled to the decree.
While Mr Asfandyar sought recovery of Rs100 million as damages and Rs50 million as aggravated damages, the court decreed the suit only to the tune of Rs1 million as general damages.
Mr Asfandyar had sued the PTI leader through his counsels Tariq Afghan and Sajeed Afridi, for alleging in a presser on July 25, 2019, that the ANP chief had “sold Pashtuns for $25 million.”

PTI leader had accused ANP leader of ‘selling Pashtuns for $25m’

Mr Yousafzai was the spokesman for the then PTI government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Any false statement against the leader of a party with stature of Asfandyar Wali Khan, definitely hurts the reputation of the leader but also hurts the feelings of vast majority of workers, who always look at their leader as a man of principles and character and rightly do so,” the court observed in its 11-page detailed judgement.
The counsels for Mr Asfandyar told the court that their client was the son of Pakhtun leader Khan Abdul Wali Khan and the grandson of Pakhtun leader Bacha Khan, both prominent leaders of international repute in the Independence Movement.
They said that Mr Asfandyar had served as a member of National Assembly four times and as a senator and a member of KP Assembly once. 
The lawyers insisted that the defendant made the defamatory accusation against their client intentionally to “adversely affect his reputation in the public mind and lower his status in public.”
The defendant, Shaukat Yousafzai, alleged that the suit had been brought by the plaintiff just to harass, humiliate and give mental torture to him.
He claimed that he had only quoted the words and phrases used by the leader of ANP namely late Mohammad Azam Khan Hoti published in different newspapers as well as uttered in different talk shows and that no opinion or statement was made by him in personal capacity against the plaintiff, therefore, he couldn’t be held responsible for the said allegations.
The judge observed that perusal of the extracts of the news made it clear that no reference to statement of Mohammad Azam Hoti had been given by the defendant, rather plain statement had been recorded that ‘Asfandyar Wali had sold Pashtuns for $25 million.’
The court observed that during cross examination, the defendant had admitted that in the newspapers concerned, there was no reference to allegations made by Mr Hoti.
“Defendant himself had been associated with print media for a long time, before coming to politics. Had there been any misstatement or incomplete statement he should have corrected the same,” the judge ruled.
The judge further observed that the defendant in his written statement as well as in his earlier statement expressed respect towards plaintiff and his family, which provided grounds to substantially reduce the quantum of damages.
“Yet the fact remains that defendant should have avoided issuing allegations that are not based upon solid grounds,” the judge observed.
The court also overruled the defendant’s stance that legal action should have been taken against Mr Hoti instead of him, observing that a responsible minister should not pass on allegations of serious nature without proof.
It is pertinent to mention that last year the court had decreed the suit in favour of Mr Asfandyar ex-parte, however, on the application of the defendant the suit was again restored and the defendant was allowed to put forward his defence.

The remains of the pterosaur, roughly the size of a small seagull, and the other creatures were discovered in Petrified Forest National Park, a place famous for producing fossils of plants and animals from the Triassic Period including huge tree trunks. The newly found fossils are 209 million years old and include at least 16 vertebrate species, seven of them previously unknown.
The Triassic came on the heels of Earth’s biggest mass extinction 252 million years ago, and then ended with another mass extinction 201 million years ago that wiped out many of the major competitors to the dinosaurs, which achieved unquestioned supremacy in the subsequent Jurassic period. Both calamities apparently were caused by extreme volcanism.
The fossils, entombed in rock rich with volcanic ash, provide a snapshot of a thriving tropical ecosystem crisscrossed by rivers on the southern edge of a large desert. Along with the pterosaur were other new arrivals on the scene including primitive frogs, lizard-like reptiles and one of the earliest-known turtles — all of them resembling their relatives alive today. This ecosystem’s largest meat-eaters and plant-eaters were part of reptile lineages that were flourishing at the time but died out relatively soon after. While the Triassic ushered in the age of dinosaurs, no dinosaurs were found in this ecosystem, illustrating how they had not yet become dominant.
“Although dinosaurs are found in contemporaneous rocks from Arizona and New Mexico, they were not part of this ecosystem that we are studying,” said paleontologist Ben Kligman of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, who led the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
“This is peculiar, and may have to do with dinosaurs preferring to live in other types of environments,” Kligman added. This ecosystem was situated just above the equator in the middle of the bygone supercontinent called Pangaea, which later broke apart and gave rise to today’s continents.
Pterosaurs, cousins of the dinosaurs, were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, followed much later by birds and bats. Pterosaurs are thought to have appeared roughly 230 million years ago, around the same time as the earliest dinosaurs, though their oldest-known fossils date to around 215 million years ago in Europe.
The newly identified pterosaur, named Eotephradactylus mcintireae, is thought to have hunted fish populating the local rivers. Its partial skeleton includes part of a tooth-studded lower jaw, some additional isolated teeth and the bones of its elongated fingers, which helped form its wing apparatus. Its wingspan was about three feet (one meter) and its skull was about four inches (10 cm) long. It had curved fangs at the front of its mouth for grabbing fish as it flew over rivers and blade-like teeth in the back of the jaw for slicing prey. The researchers said Eotephradactylus would have had a tail, as all the early pterosaurs did.
