It is an attempt to diversify its external financing sources and enhance financial relationships with China.
A Panda Bond is a bond, issued in China, by a foreign sovereign or entity, in Yuan (RMB). It would be the first time that Pakistan attempts to offer a sovereign foreign bond that specifically targets the Chinese investors. It is expected that the sums raised will be large net additions to the foreign exchange reserves over a span of three to five years.
The move is being described by policymakers as a “strategic financial innovation”, one that aims to reduce pressure on the dollar and open access to the deep pool of yuan liquidity within China’s domestic capital markets. For Pakistan, which continues to face persistent balance of payment challenges. This move may reduce dependence on US dollar-denominated borrowing and promote financial deepening with its most important trading partner, China. It is also consistent with the government’s broader objective of expanding Yuan-based settlements for bilateral trade under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) framework.
Panda Bonds have three distinctive features: firstly, these bonds are issued by a non-Chinese entity on the mainland of China; secondly, they are not denominated in a foreign currency but in RMB; and thirdly, they cannot be sold to an investor outside the People’s Republic of China. These bonds are listed on the Chinese Interbank Bond Market (CIBM) and usually guaranteed by international institutions like the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

Pakistan’s launch of Panda bonds is not just a financial transaction but a strong message that Pakistan is ready for innovation and diversification of its debt profile

Over the past few years, several emerging economies, including the Philippines, Egypt, and Hungary, have entered this market to diversify their debt portfolios and hedge against foreign exchange volatility. The first Panda Bonds were issued in 2005 by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and had a yield of approximately 3.4 per cent and 3.34pc, respectively. In 2018 the Philippines was the first Southeast Asian nation to issue a Panda Bond, where it raised RMB 1.46 billion with a 4.75pc yield.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that Pakistan had re-entered commercial markets after two and a half years, securing financing from Middle Eastern banks, and is planning to issue its first Panda bond before the end of the year.
The move, announced by Mr Aurangzeb, signals a strategic shift in Islamabad’s borrowing strategy: tapping the RMB-denominated market to secure longer-term funding, diversify its investor base and reduce reliance on short-term domestic debt and US dollar borrowings.
It has been reported that Pakistan’s deal is supposed to be jointly led by arrangers and advisors from Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and China International Capital Corporation (CICC). During the first stage, the bond shall be focused on institutional investors (banks, insurance companies and pension funds) in China. After the initial issuance is successful, the offering can be made available to retail and individual investors in a gradual process that will be akin to the one discussed earlier in the year 2020.
China’s Panda Bond market is growing rapidly but remains selective. Any country wanting to issue Panda Bonds must go through a rigorous approval procedure and must first secure clearance from key Chinese regulators, including the People’s Bank of China, the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors and the China Securities Regulatory Commission. To gain the confidence of investors, Pakistan has to show that it will manage its debt transparency, reporting standards and macroeconomic stability.
 
 

Pakistan’s recent progress in restoring discipline under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and its renewed focus on fiscal consolidation are likely to play a key role in shaping investor sentiment. The recent development in Pakistan in terms of bringing back discipline in the IMF programmes and the new emphasis of the country on fiscal consolidation will play a key role in creating investor sentiment.
However, Chinese investors, who are typically known for their long-term view of sovereign creditworthiness, will evaluate Pakistan’s structural reform agenda closely. In this context the progress on restructuring state-owned enterprises, rationalisation of energy subsidies and enhancing the tax collection will remain central to their risk assessment.
Beyond its economic rationale, the proposed Chinese bond is an extension of the Pakistani financial diplomacy with China. It complements the ongoing CPEC collaboration beyond the infrastructure and trade into the realm of financial and capital market spheres.
This move also indicates Pakistan’s growing financial integration with the Global South, particularly within the BRICS financial ecosystem. At the same time, such symbolic gestures should not divert attention from ground realities. It will expose Pakistan to yuan exchange rate risk; therefore, transparent governance, effective marketing and sound post-issuance management are critical to sustaining investor confidence. Without macroeconomic stability, the benefits of this new instrument may be short-lived.
The launch of the Panda bond is not just a financial transaction but a strong message that Pakistan is ready for innovation and diversification of its debt profile. This move could open future doors for more financing in yuan and enhance Pakistan’s standing among international investors.
However, the Panda Bond must be seen as a financial catalyst rather than a structural remedy. While it may assist in improving liquidity and risk diversification of funding sources, it cannot substitute structural reforms that are essential for economic resilience. In order to capitalise on this opportunity, Pakistan must complement financial innovation with institutional reforms and rebuild investor confidence through transparency, fiscal prudence and consistent reform implementation.
Ultimately, the success of this initiative will not be measured by the size of funds raised, but by how effectively these borrowed funds are utilised. The real test lies in whether Pakistan can convert this symbolic entry into China’s bond market into a credible step towards disciplined borrowing, a partner that can be relied upon, and an economy that is ready to confidently integrate with the rapidly growing financial markets of the world.

The Federal Shariat Court, located opposite the Supreme Court building, will house the new FCC.—Tanveer Shahzad/White Star

• Constitutional Bench head Justice Aminuddin Khan among leading candidates for top slot
• Federal court will have exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters
ISLAMABAD: With the 27th Constitutional Amendment progressing smoothly through parli­ament, the government has begun restructuring the superior judiciary, shortlisting seven judges for appointment to the proposed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) — an institution designed to deal with constitutional interpretation and intergovernmental disputes.
Official sources said the government has initiated consultations on the composition of the new court, and Justice Amin­uddin Khan, who presently heads the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, is being considered for appointment as the chief justice of the FCC.
The names of Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Mus­arrat Hilali, Justice Aamer Farooq, and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi from the Supreme Court, along with Justice K.K. Agha of the Sindh High Court and Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, the incumbent chief justice of the Balo­ch­istan High Court, are also being discussed for inclusion in the initial composition of the new court.
 
 

Sources said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require an Act of Parliament.
Officials at the law ministry confirmed that the president, on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint judges to the new court under the proposed amendment.
The FCC proposal has been revived in the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill to streamline the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction and improve efficiency in constitutional adjudication.
The government believes this initiative will ease the SC’s workload, speed up constitutional rulings, and enhance judicial independence and credibility.
The idea of a separate constitutional court was first introduced in the 2006 Charter of Democracy signed by the PPP and PML-N. The CoD proposed a specialised court for constitutional matters to let the SC focus on final appeals. The idea reappeared in the 26th Amendment draft but was dropped due to opposition from JUI-F and others.
The proposal sets the Constitutional Court judges’ retirement age at 68, three years beyond the Supreme Court’s 65, to ensure continuity and attract experienced jurists.
The new court will be housed in the Federal Shariat Court building in Islamabad, while the Federal Shariat Court moves to the Islamabad High Court. This will symbolically and administratively separate the FCC from the Supreme Court and other superior courts.
The FCC will have exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation, intergovernmental disputes between the federation and provinces, and matters arising directly from constitutional provisions. It will also be empowered to examine the legality of presidential orders, constitutional amendments, and questions referred to it by the president or the Parliament.
Judges’ profiles
Justice Aminuddin Khan, the likely nominee for chief justice of the FCC, was born in Multan in 1960. A second-generation lawyer, he earned his LL.B from University Law College, Multan, in 1984 and began practice under his father, Khan Sadiq Muhammad Ahsan.
He became an advocate of the LHC in 1987 and of the Supreme Court in 2001, later rising to the LHC bench in 2011 and the SC in 2019. He has authored several landmark judgements in civil and constitutional law.
Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, born in Karachi in 1962, began practicing law in 1988 and was elevated to the SC in 2023. He is known for his integrity and expertise in constitutional and administrative law.
Justice Musarrat Hilali, the first woman chief justice of the Peshawar High Court, was elevated to the SC in 2023. She has a distinguished legal career and has served as Additional Advocate General of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and Federal Ombudsman for Protection against Harassment of Women.
Justice Aamer Farooq, former IHC chief justice, was elevated to the SC in February 2025. Educated in London and at Lincoln’s Inn, he specialises in constitutional and commercial law.
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi of the LHC has vast experience in civil, criminal, and constitutional law. He has decided over 37,000 cases and led key inquiries, including the 2014 Model Town investigation.
Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, chief justice of the Balochistan High Court, joined the judiciary in 1998, was elevated to the High Court in 2019, and became chief justice in July 2025.
Justice K.K. Agha of the Sindh High Court has an extensive international career, having served as prosecutor at the UN tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and as senior counsel at the Special Court for Sierra Leone.

As the third order term expired on Saturday, the Punjab home department on Sunday yet again notified imposition of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, across the province for another seven days.
The Punjab government had initially imposed the ban on Oct 8 for 10 days and then notified extensions on Oct 18, Oct 25, Nov 2, and eventually on Nov 9 for one week ban each.
The home department has extended the ban on rallies, gatherings, carrying of arms, use of loudspeakers and spreading of provocative material.
The home department in its order says review of the latest reports and threat assessments shared by law enforcement and intelligence agencies explains the threat perception to public peace, tranquillity and law and order has not abated.
Extending the ban for the fourth time, the home department asserts continuation of restrictions including assembly, gathering, procession or sit-in of four or more persons in any public place, street, road or open space; carrying of arms, use of loudspeakers as well as publishing, disseminating or display of any provocative material that may incite public sentiment or disturb inter-faith and sectarian harmony.

“There will be no Turkish boots on the ground,” spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian told reporters in response to a question.
US President Donald Tru­mp’s plan to end the two-year war calls for a temporary Inter­national Stabi­lisation For­ce to gradually take over security of Gaza from the Israeli military.
The force has yet to be established and many countries are calling for it to have a mandate from the UN Security Council.
Asked about Israel’s objections to Turkish forces in Gaza, US Ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack said at a Manama security conference earlier this month that Turkey would participate.

Vice President JD Vance last month said there would be a “constructive role” for Ank­ara to play but that Washington wouldn’t force anything on Israel when it came to foreign troops “on their soil”.
 
 

Israel receives remains of officer killed in 2014
Israel said it had received on Sunday the remains of a prisoner, which Hamas says belong to Israeli officer Hadar Goldin who was killed in the 2014 Gaza war.
“After the identification process was completed… IDF (Israeli military) representatives informed the family of the fallen hostage Lieut­enant Hadar Goldin that their loved one has been returned to Israel and his identification has been finalised,” the prime minister’s office said.
Israel has received, via the Red Cross, the coffin of a fallen prisoner that was transferred to IDF and Shin Bet personnel inside the Gaza Strip, the Israeli prime minister’s office said.
The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigade, said earlier it had found Goldin’s remains in a tunnel in Rafah the day before.
Goldin’s body has been in Gaza since his death in 2014.
Israeli media reported on Saturday that Israel had allowed Hamas and Red Cross personnel to search in an area under Israeli control in Rafah to locate Goldin’s remains.
Another Israeli soldier, Oron Shaul, was also killed in the six-week war in 2014.
His body was recovered earlier this year during the latest all-out war on October 7, 2023.
Goldin, 23, was part of an Israeli unit tasked with locating and destroying Hamas tunnels when he was killed on August 1, 2014, just hours after a 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire took effect.
The army alleged Hamas fighters ambushed his team, killing him and seizing his body.
Israel had listed Goldin among the deceased Israeli prisoners whose remains it seeks to repatriate under the ongoing US-brokered ceasefire deal to end the latest Gaza war.
Goldin’s father said on Sunday that true victory in the current war would only be achieved when all prisoners were brought home.
“What this war has proven is that when we fight for our soldiers, we succeed. Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel,” Simcha Goldin said in a statement.
At the start of the truce, Hamas was holding 20 living prisoners and the bodies of28 deceased prisoners.
It has since released all the living Israeli prisoners and returned 23 remains of the deceased in line with the ceasefire terms.
In exchange, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Pales­tinian that had been in its custody and returned bodies of hundreds of Hamas fighters killed in Gaza.

• Senate body to question industry on steep hikes
KARACHI: Prices of more than a hundred commonly used medicines have increased by an average of 32 per cent since February last year, after the caretaker government lifted price controls under its deregulation policy, prompting concern among officials and calls for the pharmaceutical industry to explain the steep hikes, according to officials and industry sources.
The steep rise has not only fuelled public anger but also caught the authorities off guard, as they had expected that price deregulation would promote competition and eventually bring down costs for consumers. However, the outcome appears to be quite the opposite.
 
 

The surge in medicine prices came to light through recent findings of an ongoing national survey ordered by the prime minister, following complaints from citizens, hospitals, and provincial health departments about soaring drug costs.
Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, Senator Amir Waliuddin Chishti, told Dawn that officials of the federal health ministry and the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) had informed the committee that an overall 32pc increase in medicine prices had been observed since the caretaker government deregulated non-essential medicines in February 2024.
He added that in some cases, prices had risen by as much as 100pc, while an increase of around 50pc was recorded in several others.
Senator Chishti said the purpose of deregulation was to boost competition, attract investment and increase exports, not to burden consumers.
Industry to face questions
He noted that a 32pc overall rise in medicine prices within two years warranted corrective action.
“We have decided to seek justification from the industry in all cases where medicine prices have increased by 50pc or more,” Senator Chishti added.
“We expect to meet industry representatives next month, and if we detect any element of cartelisation by the pharmaceutical sector, we will ask the Competition Commission of Pakistan to look into the matter.”
 
 

He said the committee did not want the pharmaceutical industry to suffer and wanted it to grow, but not at the expense of patients, who were already struggling due to the prevailing economic situation.
He continued that the committee was expecting recommendations from the prime minister on the pricing of non-essential medicines.
Before deregulation, pharmaceutical companies were allowed to increase prices by up to 7pc annually in line with the Consumer Price Index under the previous pricing system.
Officials pointed out that, under this formula, prices would have risen by about 14pc over two years, far lower than the 32pc surge witnessed after deregulation.
Claims rejected
The Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA), however, rejected claims of an excessive price increase. It argued that the survey reflected an average rise of about 15pc and that, if the roughly 3pc linked to the launch of new products and strengths is excluded, the actual two-year increase stood at around 12pc.
PPMA’s Tauqeerul Haq said the deregulation was a timely move that prevented the collapse of the pharmaceutical industry amid soaring input costs, currency depreciation, inflation, rising energy and labour costs, and heavy taxation over the years.
“The policy helped restart production of many previously unavailable medicines, improved their availability, and curbed the circulation of counterfeit drugs during shortages,” he added.
The pharmaceutical industry argues that deregulation was necessary as the previous controlled pricing system made production unsustainable. Even under the old system, prices could not be raised without the federal cabinet’s approval. “Whenever a proposal to raise drug prices was presented, the cabinet would usually reject it due to political pressure,” said an industry representative. “Thus, deregulation was only possible during the caretaker government’s tenure.”
While deregulation has led to an increase in medicine prices, it has had a positive impact by resolving shortages of medicines at the retail level.
Abdul Samad Budhani, chairman of the Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, said the deregulation of medicine prices ensured abundant availability of medicines, ending persistent shortages.
He described deregulation as a necessary step to move away from centralised pricing controls that had hindered the sector’s ability to respond to rising production costs.
However, Mr Budhani noted that challenges remain for essential drugs classified as “hardship cases”.
“The real need for relief was in essential drugs, but their prices were not approved, while non-essential drugs received pricing approvals,” he said, adding that bureaucratic delays had contributed to shortages of some vital medicines.

Islamabad’s participation in the Gaza peace accord brokered by Washington has also strengthened political and diplomatic collaboration between the two nations.
Pakistan’s renewed outreach to the US is hardly surprising given its trade dynamics. The US remains its single largest export market after Europe, where Pakistan maintains a consistent trade surplus; for a long time, it also was a major source of foreign direct investment in the country alongside the European Union and the United Kingdom until China replaced it with large investments in energy, port and transport infrastructure under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) during the last decade.
Not just that, analysts say, Wash­ington’s support has traditionally been considered crucial, given Islamabad’s continued reliance on financial support from multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, controlled by the western powers, for repeated bailouts for its external sector stability.

Islamabad’s new balancing act is being closely monitored in Beijing, where Pakistan’s apparent tilt towards Washington has raised questions, if not caused unease

The goodwill of the country’s present military and political leadership with the current US administration of President Donald Trump has helped Islamabad secure a slightly better tariff deal compared to regional competitors, enabling Pakistan to retain and expand its export share in the world’s single largest market of consumer goods.
While analysts view Pakistan’s renewed economic and diplomatic engagement with the US after more than a decade as a positive development, they also caution that it could pose a new foreign policy challenge for Islamabad given its deepening strategic alliance with China. They note that the reset in ties with Washington will be tested by Pakistan’s close relations with Beijing, which could pull the country in conflicting directions and require a careful diplomatic balancing act.
Besides direct investment in infrastructure, Pakistan’s dependence on China for finished goods as well as raw and intermediary materials has increased manifold over time. Today, China stands as Pakistan’s largest trading partner and principal source of imports — excluding energy and edible oil — of around $20 billion or more.
It is the country’s single largest investor and bilateral creditor, extending critical balance-of-payments support through currency swap arrangements, deposits kept with the central bank and debt rollovers. More than half of Pakistan’s bilateral external debt, nearly $24bn, is owed to China. Beijing also remains indispensable for Pakistan in technology transfer and as the primary supplier of military hardware and support.
Though the country’s civil and military leadership has pledged not to “sacrifice one friend for another”, analysts argue that it is easier said than done. Some China watchers, including Dr Mahmood-ul-Hassan Khan, President of the Centre for Knowledge and Public Policy, say Islamabad’s new balancing act is being closely monitored in Beijing, where Pakistan’s apparent tilt towards Washington has raised questions, if not caused unease.
 
 

Dr Khan maintains that Pakistan’s alleged offer to the US to build a new deep-sea port at Pasni, barely a hundred kilometres from the Gwadar Port developed by China under the CPEC initiative, and Islamabad’s silence on the matter have fuelled speculation in Beijing. He further points out that the expanding Pakistan-US cooperation in rare earth minerals and China’s growing concerns over the security of its workers in Pakistan have raised serious doubts about the future development of Gwadar and the next phase of CPEC.
This became evident from the outcome of last month’s meeting of the CPEC Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) in Beijing, which ended without resolving key issues related to the security of Chinese personnel and payments to Chinese Independent Power Producers (IPPs), two major irritants hampering fresh Chinese investment in the country.
Commitments for major projects such as the ML-1 railway upgrade also remain pending. The dispute over payments to Chinese IPPs persists, as Islamabad has sought to extend the repayment schedule. On the ML-1 project, Beijing has demanded a firm financial commitment from Pakistan before moving ahead with any agreement, particularly in light of the ongoing IMF programme.
Even so, the meeting was hailed as a milestone for marking the formal start of CPEC Phase II. Yet, attracting fresh Chinese investment will remain difficult unless these long-standing concerns are addressed, Dr Khan cautions.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal’s proposal to hold JCC meetings every six months and convene Joint Working Groups quarterly during the first three years of CPEC Phase II underscores the delays and bottlenecks that continue to impede the corridor’s progress. Analysts argue that institutional strengthening, the resolution of pending issues, and enhanced security for Chinese personnel remain essential to sustain momentum and move Phase II forward.
Dr Khan advises that Pakistan must take the Chinese policymakers into confidence to urgently dispel growing concerns that Islamabad is warming up to Washington at the expense of its strategic partnership with its time-tested friend.
“Pakistan has to navigate its foreign policy challenges in a global geopolitical environment that is marked by growing multipolarity but weakening multilateralism and increasing US-China competition. The durability of this China-Pakistan partnership hinges on Islamabad’s ability to address these pressing concerns.”
Analysts say Pak-US ties have been transactional and cyclical in nature, often fluctuating between estrangement and benign engagement. Washington has viewed Islamabad through a transactional lens, one largely shaped by its interests in the region, and has not hesitated to impose sanctions whenever those interests diverged.
The most consequential factor today is America’s policy of containing China and its strategy to rally countries behind efforts to counterbalance Beijing’s growing global influence, analysts observe.
“Pakistan’s relationship with China, by contrast, is strategic, historic, trouble-free and remains pivotal to the country’s foreign policy. While Islamabad may seek to strike a balance between the two powers, it cannot afford to be part of any anti-China strategy. This constraint limits the scope for expanding relations with Washington beyond a certain threshold,” concludes Dr Khan.

Mr Achakzai said the peaceful protest would be held under the slogan of a Habib Jalib ghazal: “Aise Dastoor Ko, Subh-i-BeNoor Ko, Me Nahi Manta, Mai Nahi Janta”.
Speaking at a news conference at the National Press Club, he anno­unced two additional slogans: “death for dictatorship and democracy live long” and “free the prisoners”.
Mr Achakzai described himself as a “true patriotic” who has taken the oath to protect the country five times, noting that the current National Ass­embly speaker, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, administered two of those oaths.

Opposition alliance announces nationwide protests; plans to observe ‘Black Day’

He recalled an exchange from 1993 with then-speaker Gohar Ayub Khan.
“I spoke to the speaker that he has taken an oath of protecting the Constitution from hundreds of people, but how will we protect the constitution,” Mr Achakzai said. “I suggested taking another oath from us that if any general violated the constitution, we will be on the roads. How­ever, my suggestion was not considered.”
Mr Achakzai drew a parallel with Afghanistan, noting the shared language and blood. “We can only forgive them if there will be constitution and democracy in Pakistan,” he said.
 
 

He criticised the country’s economic state, stating that 45 percent of people live below the poverty line while some seek lifetime impunity from the law.
“Then who will be investigated, a drug addict who steals money for the drugs or food?” he asked, claiming that those who commit minor crimes will be punished while those who “loot the country will have impunity”.
Mr Achakzai argued that the country cannot be protected by empowering a single individual but by stren­gthening its constitution and people.
“We appeal to all sections of society that it is an attack on the foundation of the country, so all should rise and resist against the conspiracy to smash the Parliament,” he said. “We all should get united and make a system to protect the country before it gets too late, here people are being killed, and they are being pushed to take the weapons in their hands.”
Another TTAP leader, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, said the 27th Amendment was designed to protect the interests of certain individuals and was disconnected from the issues facing the public.
 
 

A draft of the TTAP’s plans detailed a National Conference to be held this week to strategise against the amendment. The day after the amendment is passed will be observed as a “Black Day,” with lawyers and citizens encouraged to wear black arm strips.
It claimed that the 1973 constitution was no more representative of the masses and was being used to protect the power in Rawalpindi, Lahore and Larkana.
The movement will also involve publishing articles in national and international newspapers and establishing committees to meet with stakeholders, including bar councils and retired Supreme Court judges.

When power structures shift, markets shake. Yet, when faced with sensitivities and the opaque nature of the proposed amendment, many business leaders chose silence in a debate that could reshape the economic landscape they operate in.
Without taking a hard line for or against the proposed 27th Amendment, several business leaders cautiously urged transparency and broad-based consultation. They warned that hastily rushed sweeping constitutional changes without debate risk deepening public mistrust, unsettling investors and injecting fresh uncertainty into an already fragile economic climate.
“In a country still struggling to stabilise positive sentiments and attract capital for growth, secrecy in public decisions and indecent haste in rewriting the rules of the game are not affordable,” a Punjab-based business leader cautioned privately.
“Historically, Pakistan’s business community may not have championed democratic causes, but decades of navigating shifting political cycles and the requirements of global trade have taught hard lessons,” he noted. “Stable markets need credible democratic institutions, consensus-based governance and broad public legitimacy. Without these, policy cannot endure and investment cannot flow.”

‘Stable markets need credible democratic institutions, consensus-based governance and broad public legitimacy; without these, policy cannot endure and investment cannot flow’

Despite concerns over productivity and competitiveness, Pakistan’s business sector wields substantial financial muscle and dominates the economic landscape. The country hosts more than 2.5 million registered firms and an estimated 7m informal enterprises, employing over 70 per cent of the non-agricultural urban workforce. As of August 2025, official records show 265,587 registered companies. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics’ 2025 census counted around 7m informal economic establishments, with 28.5pc of households engaged in home-based work.
Karachi’s business community has been more candid than Punjab’s in assessing the proposed amendment. Ehsan Malik, former CEO of the Pakistan Business Council, offered a detailed note of response, framing the 27th Constitutional Amendment as a potential reset, one that could strengthen stability, clarify authority, and improve policy continuity. In his view, these are prerequisites for long-term investment and sustainable growth.
A key feature, he noted, is the likely return of over Rs500bn of provincial National Finance Commission (NFC) allocations to the centre. Provinces may counter this resource shortfall by imposing selective new taxes, particularly on services, but the shift aligns with the demands of national security and debt-servicing imperatives. It could also compel provinces to finally broaden their own revenue base and pursue long-avoided agricultural and service-sector taxation reforms.
He also noted that provinces posted a record Rs1 trillion surplus in FY25. If reduced NFC flows coincide with continued International Monetary Fund-mandated surpluses, provincial development budgets will inevitably tighten. However, he suggested that a more centralised, priority-driven development model, especially for Karachi, could improve execution and reduce waste, provided coordination mechanisms are strengthened.
 
 

“A clearer constitutional framework, including a formalised institutional role for national security structures, could enhance policy predictability and attract strategic capital from the Gulf and China, where investors value stability over fragmented authority,” he argued. “A proposed Constitutional Court could expedite commercial and regulatory dispute resolution, while selective re-centralisation in education and labour may support a unified skills strategy and strengthen productivity.”
Syed Asad Ali Shah, a leading business commentator and former managing partner of Deloitte Pakistan, was blunt in his assessment. Critical of the 26th Amendment passed last year, he warned that the proposed 27th Amendment would further undermine judicial independence and be an extension of the rule of law and justice. “Such changes would be counterproductive to fair dispensation and good governance, undermine investor confidence and damage the entrepreneurial climate,” he cautioned.
“Moreover, major legislation, especially constitutional amendments, must involve consultations with the private sector and civil society,” he said. “There is no justification for rushing such fundamental changes in the country’s constitution.”
Arif Habib, founder of the Arif Habib Group, said he had yet to review the full text of the proposed amendment. However, based on initial understanding, he did not expect it to unsettle business sentiments and believes it will adjust the NFC framework in favour of the federal government.
Majyd Aziz, former president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, lamented the limited access and influence business leaders have in Pakistan’s power corridors. He advised waiting for the formal tabling of the 27th Amendment before forming a definitive view but broadly supported its direction, including a partial rollback of the 18th Amendment.
In his opinion, the 27th Amendment would restructure powers among the pillars of state, increase government efficiency, and curb “the unbridled wastage and plunder of resources by provinces”. If implemented in letter and spirit, he argued, it could boost business confidence.
Shariq Vohra, former president of the Karachi Chamber, criticised the exclusion of business stakeholders from the constitutional reform process. “The draft hasn’t been shared with us, but from what little we know, it appears to centralise power in Islamabad, curtailing provincial authority over the NFC, land regulation, education and population policy,” he said.
“Such concentration will weaken provincial autonomy, shift regulatory approvals to the federal capital, fuel bureaucratic gatekeeping and corruption, and create instability that deters investment, especially for SMEs [small and medium enterprises]. Rather than strengthening democracy and economic governance, it risks ushering in an authoritarian, centralised structure. Major reforms require consultation — not imposition.”

• MQM, ANP proposals for local govt reforms, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa name-change deferred
• Committee’s report on constitutional tweaks to be tabled in Senate today amid opposition boycott
ISLAMABAD: Amid a boycott by opposition lawmakers, a joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s law and justice standing committees on Sunday app­roved the 27th Consti­tutional Amendment Bill with minor changes.
The bill aims to set up a federal constitutional court and grant permanent immunity to the president as well as lifetime status to the field marshal rank, amid criticism that the amendment will erode the judiciary’s independence.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who also attended the meeting, said all key amendments, including changes to Article 243, were amicably approved by both committees. In response to a question about amendments to Article 243, Mr Dar said that all the amendments have been approved. The said article pertains to the military command structure.
 
 

Senator Farooq H. Naek, who was presiding over the meeting, said the bill was adopted with minor changes. He said that the committees empowered him and the law minister to make a couple of amendments.
The committees, however, deferred the proposals of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) seeking to amend Article 140 related to local governments as well as the Awami National Party’s (ANP) amendment for changing the name of the province.
The ANP submitted a proposal to rename Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by removing ‘Khyber’, arguing that Khyber is a district and other provinces do not include district names in provincial titles. Likewise, the Balochistan National Party’s proposed amendment to increase the seats in the province was also deferred.
Earlier in the day, ANP’s Hidayatullah Khan had told reporters that the committee had sought time until tomorrow (Monday) to decide on his party’s suggestion for changing the name of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Meanwhile, Law Mini­ster Azam Nazeer Tarar told reporters it was dec­ided that provinces be taken into confidence on changing the province’s name. MQM-P’s suggestion regarding local governments was also discussed, he said, adding that it was decided that provinces be taken into confidence on changing the province’s name. Mr Tarar further said that the report of the committees would be tabled before the Senate on Monday (today).
Opposition boycott
The standing committees met on Sunday to discuss the proposed bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment a day after it was tabled in the Senate. This bill was approved by the federal cabinet on Saturday hours before it was presented in the upper house of parliament. As Senator Farooq H. Naek chaired the meeting, the PTI, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) and the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) continued their boycott of the parliamentary committee.
Referring to the JUI-F’s absence, the law minister had stated its members had informed the committee on Saturday about their party’s policy. He emphasised that parliamentary parties should utilise their right to vote, rather than boycotting the process altogether.
The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes the PTI, announced a nationwide protest movement against the 27th Amendment, urging the people to take a stand against the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution.
 
 

Separately, PPP’s MNA Kasim Gilani, in a tweet summarised, that the 27th Constitutional Amend­ment “mainly touches 5 key areas: establishment of the Federal Const­itutional Court, transfer of judges (Article 200), fixing the KP Senate election anomaly, [two per cent] cabinet size increase on smaller provinces’ demand (Article 130(6)), [and] amendments in Article 243 on defence services & presidential immunity”.

The session was convened today — on a Sunday in a rare move — with a one-point agenda to deliberate on the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The 26-page Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled in the Senate yesterday amid the opposition’s outcry over the pace and scope of the proposed changes, just hours after its approval by the federal cabinet.
Senate Chairperson Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the session today, which began with the House remembering Allama Iqbal on his birth anniversary. Later, the house also passed a resolution in relevance to Iqbal Day.
During the session, PTI lawmakers had pictures of their party founder Imran Khan placed on their desks. At the beginning of the proceedings, a PTI leader raised an objection, to which Gilani replied that as per his ruling yesterday, the senator could bring his concerns to the Senate chairman’s office.
‘You cannot force a Constitution through bullets’
Addressing the upper house of the parliament, PTI Senator Ali Zafar outlined “five points” that he said formed the basic spirit of the 1973 Constitution and were now being “punctured” in the proposed 27th Amendment.
The first, he said, was that Pakistan was a federation with autonomous provinces. Secondly, the elected parliament had authority but was bound to the Constitution. Zafar said the third point was the fundamental rights provided therein, with courts formed to protect and implement them.
Fourth pillar of the Constitution, he added, was an independent judiciary to protect people’s rights and guarantee democracy, while the fifth one was civilian supremacy.
“If you alter this balance of five pillars even slightly through any amendment, the entire Constitution will be shaken and can result in major chaos,” Zafar warned.
At one point, Senator Sarmad Ali objected to the PTI bringing framed pictures and placards, pointing out that it was against the Senate rules, at which Gilani requested the opposition to refrain from doing so.

After presenting his arguments against the proposed legislation, Zafar urged the House to reject the bill for it and invited the treasury benches for further discussions.
“We can sit and think. There are a lot of options how to reduce the pendency of cases. We are ready to talk with you to consider amendments that will benefit the people, but we will not tolerate that you harm the public,” the PTI leader said.
During his speech, Zafar stressed that the Constitution was a contract between the state and the public, with a “spirit of its own”. He added that the document was a pledge that everyone, regardless of the region they hailed from, would live according to the laws.
“When you make any change in the Constitution, it is equal to tampering with the foundation of a building, and if you make any mistake, the entire building can collapse,” he contended.
 
 

Recalling that two dictators made amendments to the 1973 Constitution that “broke it”, Zafar highlighted that even they took “a lot of time” to be passed. He added that the “real spirit” of the 1973 Constitution was restored through the 18th Amendment in 2010.
The PTI senator underscored the need for a consensus on making any changes to the Constitution, contending that consensus and a two-thirds majority were separate things. “You cannot force a Constitution through bullets.”
Arguing that the PTI represented millions of people and was rejecting the 27th Amendment, Zafar said, “Respect the mandate of the people and kindly do not vote for this amendment.”
The lawyer asserted that those bringing any constitutional amendment should be “genuinely elected”, with no personal motives or wishes to stay in power. “This parliament, in my opinion with due respect, is not authorised to pass these amendments,” he added.
Zafar also claimed that the proposed changes related to provincial shares and rights under the 18th Amendment, which were dropped in the current draft, were a “face-saving for the PPP” so certain originally intended amendments could be passed.
He said the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) under the new amendment would end the judiciary’s independence, and the president having the authority to appoint the judges could result in “selection of his choice”. He added that the increase in retirement age of FCC judges from 65 to 68 years was an “incentive for judges to become pliant judges”.
 
 

The PTI lawmaker highlighted the powers proposed for the FCC, including considering cases related to fundamental rights, and cautioned that the court not following previous judicial precedents would result in a “collapse of the system”.
Zafar further termed the provisions related to the transfer of judges without their consent as a “dangling sword” of moving them from one high court to another. “This will bring the judiciary under the executive’s total control,” he argued.

The senator also slammed lawyers citing the reason for the formation of FCC as pendency of cases, calling them “intellectually dishonest”, and asserted that the SC pendency only amounted to two per cent of cases pending across the country.
The PTI senator recalled how the parliament “systematically” reached debating the 27th Amendment today, highlighting the “slow, gradual but effective erosion of democracy and the Supreme Court”.
He then mentioned the Jan 13, 2024 verdict by a bench led by then-chief justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, which revoked the PTI’s electoral symbol a month before the general elections. He also recalled the SC’s ruling in the Article 63A case that struck down an earlier order and allowed the ballots of lawmakers who voted against party policy to be counted.
 
 

“It was as if the judiciary opened the gates for the 26th Amendment through this decision,” Zafar alleged, further claiming that the ruling coalition coerced some lawmakers to vote in 26th Amendment’s favour. The senator clarified that the PTI had never agreed to even the formation of constitutional benches, and had instead termed them “lesser of the two evils” compared to a constitutional court.
The senator then highlighted three verdicts handed by the SC’s constitutional benches — the reserved seats ruling that distributed seats earlier awarded to the PTI to the coalition partners, the order allowing the military trials of civilians, and the ruling in the judges’ transfer case to allegedly “control the Islamabad High Court”.
The upper house of the parliament broke into a loud exchange at one point, when Gilani gave the floor to PTI’s Faisal Javed to speak but a lawmaker interjected. “Who are you to say this to me when the chairman has allowed me to speak?” Javed asked.
Necessary to bring some improvements in judicial system: PML-N’s Pervaiz Rashid
From the treasury benches, PML-N Senator Pervaiz Rashid regretted that Barrister Zafar had presented just one side of the picture, “which is likeable to them”. Zafar did not mention anything about the effort in the past to “convert the judiciary into a tool of a political party”, Rashid said.

The PML-N lawmaker said the members from the opposition benches had spoken on just one point of the proposed amendment, which pertained to the judiciary. He added that he would take it as their acceptance of the rest of the clauses of the proposed amendment.
Rashid further stated that he would have been pleased had opposition members also participated in the meetings of the standing committees so that their input would have been included in their reports and subsequently discussed in the house.
Meanwhile, PPP Senator Syed Masroor Ahsan said the PTI lawmakers were “confused”, which led to an eruption of responses from the opposition benches.
In his fiery speech, Ahsan stated that the PPP had “seen bodies” of its slain leaders, including late prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, his daughter and ex-premier Benazir, Murtaza Bhutto, Shahnawaz Bhutto and Nusrat Bhutto.
“You are in the parliament, you are sitting with politicians, you are also ready to enact legislation with political individuals, but you are willing to talk with someone else only,” he said while addressing the PTI.
The PPP senator also said he wanted the opposition to take part in the meetings of the standing committees, just as they were participating in the Senate proceedings.
 






You cannot end judiciary’s independence because of past decisions: Hamid Khan
In his speech, PTI Senator Hamid Khan took exception to the manner in which the government was trying to amend the Constitution.

“Constitutional amendments are not promulgated in this manner. You first reach a consensus and then amend the constitution,” he asserted.
Khan further stated that he considered the 26th Amendment “the death of the Constitution” and the effort to promulgate the 27th Amendment was akin to an “effort to bury the Constitution”.
“Both these amendments are truly something to be ashamed of.”
He went on to say that some political parties had “complaints that when the judiciary was liberated in the true sense, it issued orders to disqualify two prime ministers”.
 
 

“But this does not mean that they (political parties) get personal […] They [shouldn’t try to] put an end to the same Constitution under which [the prime ministers] were disqualified, to bring about the end of that same judiciary that disqualified them,” he added.
Khan clarified that he understood that those decisions were “controversial to some extent” and he was not supporting those decisions. “But this does not mean that you end the independence of the judiciary because of judges’ past decisions. […] Both right and wrong decision are made in history, but they don’t become a reason to ban courts.”
He questioned that if the existing judicial system ceased to exist, “who will you go to for your fundamental rights?”.
“We are at a historical moment [at present]. And if, for any reason, […] we take a step that results in the destruction and distortion of the Constitution, all of us will have to face its consequences — those who will vote [in favour of it] and the coming generations as well,” he warned.
PTI Senator Azam Swati, addressing the Upper House with a black ribbon tied around his arm, hailed the “amazing” 1973 Constitution introduced by Bhutto and other political leaders, adding that the 27th Amendment would ruin it.
Swati contended that the Statement of Object and Reasons in the proposed bill did not even address the amendments suggested in it, terming them “vague and incomplete”. He further said that the SC’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) had been torn into pieces, and that Articles 175 and 191 did not make up for it.
“May God give you long life, this (legislation) will bite you back one day, and you will admit that you made a major mistake,” the PTI leader said.
PTI’s Mohsin Aziz also questioned the “haste” in passing the Amendment, adding that certain “informed” individuals already knew that this legislation would be introduced.
He said most of the amendments made so far were “benign”, while certain were major such as the 13th, 18th and 25th. “So why is there a need for two amendments in just two years?” he asked.
The PTI lawmaker defended the speeches given by Zafar and Hamid, saying they were not political. “They spoke as opposition not for the sake of opposition, but for the sake of betterment of this country.”
He further said, “Do not be in haste. If there are good amendments, we will definitely sit proudly with you and agree on it.”
‘Are non-Muslims not Pakistanis?’
Balochistan Awami Party Senator Danesh Kumar also spoke during the session,  raising the question that when amendments were proposed, why did they not address the lack of minorities in the federal cabinet.
“When you were proposing amendments to Article 130 and expanding the size of the cabinet, why did you not suggest that at least one member be from the minorities?” he asked, addressing Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar.
“There are no minority members in KP or Balochistan. The only minority member here is a state minister, not a federal minister,” he added.
Kumar then mentioned that according to the Constitution, the prime minister and president have to be Muslim.
“In Article 91, it says the prime minister can only be Muslim. Are we non-Muslims not Pakistani?” he asked. “If you are bringing amendments, then amend these things.”
Later, the Senate session was adjourned until 11am tomorrow.
‘Govt’s haste calls into question the intention behind moving the bill’
Separately, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) issued a statement, deploring “the manner in which the 27th Amendment to the Constitution is being tabled in Parliament”.
“The government’s haste—including the absence of any meaningful consultation with the political opposition, the wider legal fraternity and civil society—calls into question the very intention behind moving this amendment bill.
“Its reported content, with numerous changes designed to reconfigure the judicial system, the office-specific concentration of power ceding more civilian space, and lifelong immunity to certain state offices, has alarmed constitutionalists, the legal fraternity, human rights defenders and many others who believe in the independence of the judiciary and the tenets of civilian supremacy in a democracy,” the statement posted on X said.
It added that the  HRCP planned to hold an urgent consultation with a wide range of stakeholders to examine the proposed amendment and its “far-reaching impact on the country’s polity and society”.
 






Meanwhile, Karachi Press Club (KPC) President Fazil Jamili posted on X that the “ rushed 27th Amendment through Parliament, lacking the meaningful consultation, is deeply alarming“.
“We at KPC deplore the proposed judicial reconfiguration, concentrated power, and lifelong immunity, which gravely threaten the independence of the judiciary and civilian supremacy,” he added.

According to state-run APP, the premier hosted a dinner for the senators — a development that came after the standing committees on law and justice of both houses of Parliament approved the proposed legislation earlier today.
The bill for the amendment, which has been criticised particularly over its clauses pertaining to changes in the judiciary and Article 243 (command of the armed forces) of the Constitution, was tabled in the Senate yesterday amid the opposition’s outcry. Prior to that, the PM had held several meetings with the representatives of the allied parties with the proposed legislation on the agenda.
According to the APP report, addressing his guests today, the PM said he was thankful to the heads of all allied parties and President Zardari.
“All allied parties fully backed this national thought,” the report quoted him as saying. He further stated: “All of us made unified efforts to strengthen the federation, in the broader interests of the country, to increase harmony among the provinces and to improve governance.”
The premier said that all the “milestones” achieved by his government were a result of the coordination with the allied parties.
“Pakistan’s diplomatic successes are a reflection of harmony and unity among the allied parties. It is because of our unified efforts that Pakistan reached a great position,” he said.
He maintained that the country’s economic situation had been improving and Pakistan was now “moving in the right direction” due to political and economic stability.
He stressed the need to work together for the country’s progress.</p><small>2025-11-09 19:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0923543224c2206.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954106/bbc-boss-tim-davie-resigns-following-criticism-over-trump-documentary-edit' target='_blank'><strong>BBC boss Tim Davie resigns following criticism over Trump documentary edit</strong></a><br><p>The director general of Britain’s BBC, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of news, Deborah Turness, have resigned following criticism over bias at the corporation, including in the way it edited a speech by United States President Donald Trump.
The BBC has been embroiled in a spate of allegations that it had failed to maintain political neutrality in its reporting, including in its coverage of Trump, the Israel-Hamas war and over transgender issues.
In the most recent controversy, The Daily Telegraph had reported for days on an internal document produced by a former BBC adviser on standards who had listed a raft of errors, including in the way a speech by Trump on January 6, 2021, was edited.
The document suggested the flagship ‘Panorama’ programme had edited two parts of Trump’s speech together so he appeared to encourage the Capitol Hill riots of January 2021.
“This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the Chair and Board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days,” Davie said in a statement.
“I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering.”
Trump in the BBC documentary was shown telling his supporters that “we’re going to walk down to the Capitol” and that they would “fight like hell”, a comment he made in a different part of his speech.
Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the BBC as “100 per cent fake news” and a “propaganda machine” in an interview published on Friday.
Davie will stay on for the next few months while a replacement is found. A person familiar with the situation said Davie’s decision had left the BBC board stunned by the move.</p><small>2025-11-09 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09184241554914f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954090/karachis-university-road-to-remain-closed-from-nov-10-dec-30-due-to-new-work' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi’s University Road to remain closed from Nov 10-Dec 30 due to new work</strong></a><br><p>A new wave of road closures is set to cripple Karachi once again, as after the much-delayed Red Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project turned major arteries into construction zones, the Karachi Water and Sewerage System Improvement Project (KWSSIP) is bringing fresh digging, roadblocks and traffic congestion to one of the city’s busiest corridors — University Road.
According to officials, a section of University Road between Nipa Chowrangi and Federal Urdu University will remain closed from November 10 to December 30.
“The closure is necessary for laying new 96-inch and 72-inch pipelines as part of the K-IV augmentation plan,” said a senior official. “This stretch, which is roughly 2.7 kilometres long, will form part of a new network that’s crucial for improving the city’s water supply.”
However, for millions of daily commuters, the Red Line BRT’s construction already brought endless congestion, dust, and frustration to residents of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Gulistan-i-Johar and adjoining areas.
The first phase of the new water project will cover the Nipa Chowrangi to Federal Urdu University stretch, while the second phase will extend from Hasan Square to Nipa Chowrangi, according to project documents.
Officials have set December 30 as the deadline, but many remain sceptical given the city’s track record of repeated delays and missed timelines.</p><small>2025-11-09 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/092137559fa0829.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954103/us-visa-seekers-could-face-rejection-over-health-issues-report' target='_blank'><strong>US visa seekers could face rejection over health issues: report</strong></a><br><p>The visas of foreigners seeking residence in the US face the possibility of rejection if the applicants have certain medical conditions, including diabetes or obesity, according to US-based news outlet KFF Health News.
The publication reported this on Thursday, citing a new directive from the Trump administration.
According to the outlet, this new directive was outlined in a cable issued by the US State Department to embassy and consular officials.
It “directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the US for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits”, KFF reported.
“The guidance says that such people could become a ‘public charge’ — a potential drain on US resources — because of their health issues or age,” the report said.
“You must consider an applicant’s health,” the cable read, according to KFF. It added: “Certain medical conditions — including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions — can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care.”
According to KFF, the cable also encouraged visa officers to consider conditions like obesity — which it noted could cause asthma, sleep apnea and high blood pressure —  while assessing whether an immigrant could become a public charge and should therefore be denied entry into the US.
“All of these can require expensive, long-term care,” the cable read, additionally directing visa officers to determine if applicants had the means to pay for medical treatment without financial assistance from the US government.
KFF reported that the instruction also directed visa officers to consider the health of the applicant’s family members, including children or older parents.
Tommy Pigott, the US State Department’s principal deputy spokesperson, also said in a statement: “It’s no secret the Trump administration is putting the interests of the American people first. This includes enforcing policies that ensure our immigration system is not a burden on the American taxpayer.”
Separately, the official told reporters that the decision to issue a visa had always been at the discretion of an officer.
Officers are not being instructed to reject an applicant because they have a certain medical condition, but to consider the “overall impact” if someone would be unlikely to be able to pay for their own medical care, they clarified.
“It’s addressed on an individual, case-by-case basis,” the official added.</p><small>2025-11-09 17:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/092144081db981f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954104/fir-registered-against-kp-cm-afridi-under-peca-law-over-profane-misleading-remarks-about-state-institutions' target='_blank'><strong>FIR registered against KP CM Afridi under Peca law over ‘profane, misleading’ remarks about state institutions</strong></a><br><p>A case was registered against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad over his “profane” and “misleading” remarks about state institutions.
Afridi had made the remarks referred to in the FIR on Nov 6 during an interaction with the media outside Adiala jail after he was once again denied an audience with PTI founder Imran Khan.
He had alleged that security forces in KP would bring dogs into mosques and tie them down there, thereby violating the sanctity of holy places. His statement sparked an outcry, drawing condemnations.
Subsequently, a first information report (FIR) was registered against him today on behalf of the state and under Sections 11, 20 and 26-A of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, stated that following an inquiry dated November 8, it transpired that Afridi and others had “knowingly and deliberately, with mala fide intentions and ulterior motives, uttered false, misleading, derogatory and intimidating words against state institutions, which were recorded [and] disseminated and propagated” through social media platforms. In this connection, the FIR particularly mentioned the PTI’s YouTube channel.
It said that in a video uploaded on the channel, Afridi had made a statement “containing offensive, profane, false, misleading and unfounded allegations, with the intent to malign, defame and cause harm to the reputation and integrity of the state institutions of Pakistan”.
The “false, fake and ill-will content, publicly and intentionally uttered and promoted by the accused and others through social media is an organised attempt to undermine public trust on state institutions, including racial hatred, create unrest in the country and destablise national security”, it was alleged in the FIR.
In the report, Afridi was also accused of being involved in “preparing, publishing, sharing and circulating fake and misleading contents publicly on social media with the intention to incite violence, create racial hatred, panic, fear, disorder and unrest among the general public alongwith promoting anti-state sentiments, which is detrimental to the security, integrity and stability of Pakistan”.</p><small>2025-11-09 16:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091852100322c36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954093/pakistan-saudi-arabia-vow-to-deepen-defence-ties-enhance-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Saudi Arabia vow to deepen defence ties, enhance bilateral cooperation</strong></a><br><p>The military leadership of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia vowed to enhance bilateral defence cooperation and reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen ties between the two countries, a statement from the military’s media wing said.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the commitment was made during a meeting of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, with the Chief of General Staff of the Saudi Armed Forces, General Fayyadh bin Hamed Al-Ruwaili, in Saudi Arabia. The Pakistani official is on an official visit to the Kingdom.
“During the meeting, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional environment and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation,” the ISPR said. “The military leadership reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the strong brotherly ties and enduring defence partnership between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.”
 






In recognition of his significant contributions in deepening Pakistan-Kingdom of Saudi Arabia relationship, in particular the military to military ties, the CJCSC was conferred with the “King Abdulaziz Medal of Honour of the Excellent Class,“ the ISPR stated.
It further added that the Saudi military leadership lauded the professionalism of the Pakistan armed forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
In September, the two countries signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.</p><small>2025-11-09 15:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09185407814bf55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954100/before-talks-with-trump-riyadh-doubles-down-on-terms-for-israel-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Before talks with Trump, Riyadh doubles down on terms for Israel ties</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump has been talking up the prospects of Saudi Arabia agreeing to normalise ties with Israel, but it is unlikely to happen when Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits the White House this month.
The establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia after decades of enmity could shake up the political and security landscape in the Middle East, potentially strengthening US influence in the region.
Trump said last month he hoped Saudi Arabia would “very soon” join other Muslim countries that signed the 2020 Abraham Accords normalising ties with Israel.
But Riyadh has signalled to Washington through diplomatic channels that its position has not changed: it will sign up only if there is agreement on a roadmap to Palestinian statehood, two Gulf sources told Reuters.

The intention is to avoid diplomatic missteps and ensure alignment of the Saudi and US positions before any public statements are made, they said. One said the aim was to avoid any confusion at or after the White House talks on November 18.
The Crown Prince, widely known as MBS, “is not likely to entertain any possible formalising of ties in the near future without at least a credible pathway to a Palestinian state”. said Jonathan Panikoff, former deputy US national intelligence officer on the Middle East.
MBS is likely to try to use his influence with Trump to seek “more explicit and vocal buy-in for the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state,” said Panikoff, who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington.
Trump’s upbeat comments on Abraham Accords
Next week’s visit is the Crown Prince’s first to Washington since the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, an MBS critic whose murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul caused global outrage. MBS denied direct involvement.
The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco have already normalised ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, and Trump has said he expects an expansion of the accords soon.
“We have a lot of people joining now the Abraham Accords, and hopefully we’re going to get Saudi Arabia very soon,” he said on November 5, without offering a timeline.
 
 

In a television interview broadcast on October 17, he said, “I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in. I think when Saudi Arabia goes in, everybody goes in.” But the agreement signed by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco sidestepped the issue of Palestinian statehood.
The two Gulf sources said Riyadh had signalled to Washington that any move to recognise Israel must be part of a new framework, not just an extension of any deal.
For Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and custodian of its two holiest sites, Makkah and Madina, recognising Israel would be more than just a diplomatic milestone. It is a deeply sensitive national security issue tied to resolving one of the region’s oldest and most intractable conflicts.
Such a step would be hard to take when the Arab public’s mistrust of Israel remains high over the scale of its military offensive during the war against Hamas in Gaza, despite a fragile ceasefire in the conflict that followed the group’s attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.
Saudi Foreign Ministry official Manal Radwan has called for a clear, time-bound Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the deployment of an international protection force and the empowerment and return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza.
These steps, she said, are essential to the establishment of a Palestinian state — the prerequisite for regional integration and the implementation of the two-state solution.
With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu staunchly opposed to Palestinian statehood, Saudi Arabia sees no immediate prospect of satisfying Trump’s demand that it normalise ties with Israel, the sources told Reuters.
Progress on that front depends on concessions neither Washington nor Israel is currently prepared to make, Saudi officials say.
Trump and Crown Prince set to seal defence pact
Saudi officials are intent on steering the Trump-MBS meeting towards defence cooperation and investment, wary that the politically charged issue of normalisation of ties with Israel could overshadow the agenda.
 
 

The meeting is expected to seal a pivotal defence pact defining the scope of US military protection for the de facto ruler of the world’s top oil exporter, and to cement America’s military footprint in the Gulf. The prospective deal has, however, been scaled back.
Two other Gulf sources and three Western diplomats said the defence deal falls short of the full, Congress-ratified treaty Riyadh once sought in exchange for the long-promised normalisation of ties with Israel.
The agreement, loosely modelled on an arrangement with Qatar that was established through an executive order in September, expands cooperation to include cutting-edge technology and defence.
Riyadh, according to the two Gulf sources, pushed for provisions to allow future US administrations to elevate the pact to a full treaty — a safeguard to ensure continuity for a non-binding pact, vulnerable to reversal by future presidents.
“It’s not the treaty they want; they might not see it as perfect, but it’s a stepping stone [to a full treaty],” said David Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute, where he directs a project on Arab-Israeli relations.
The linkage between the defence pact, normalisation with Israel and Palestinian statehood has produced a complex negotiating equation, pushing Riyadh and Washington to settle for a limited defence deal in the absence of progress on the other two tracks, the Gulf sources and Western diplomats said.
That compromise, they say, could eventually evolve into a full treaty if normalisation advances.
“The Saudi-American negotiations have undergone a fundamental shift in environment and context following the developments in Gaza since October 7,” said Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Saudi-based Gulf Research Institute think tank.
He said the direct linkage between normalisation of ties with Israel and Palestinian statehood remained, but Riyadh now wanted Saudi national security requirements addressed separately.
“The Saudi position is clear: meeting the Kingdom’s national security demands will help shape its broader stance on regional issues, including the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,” he said.
Threat from Iran receding
A Nato-style defence pact appears a distant prospect, given the shifting regional calculus and the political hurdles in Washington.
Iran, the main threat once driving Riyadh’s pursuit of binding US guarantees, has been strategically weakened over the past year by Israeli strikes on its nuclear and military infrastructure.
The Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen have also suffered heavy blows.
With pressure from Iran easing, the appetite for a treaty requiring two-thirds congressional approval has diminished, especially in the absence of normalisation with Israel.
The two Gulf sources said such a pact would likely come with conditions, including curbs on Saudi Arabia’s expanding economic and technology ties with China, complicating Riyadh’s drive to balance strategic autonomy with US security guarantees.
The current deal would expand joint military exercises, deepen cooperation between US and Saudi defence firms, and include safeguards to limit Riyadh’s military-industrial ties with China, the sources said.
It would also fast-track advanced US weapons sales to the kingdom, bypassing the delays and political hurdles that have stalled previous deals.</p><small>2025-11-09 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091634186d3679d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954086/afghan-taliban-used-talks-to-prolong-temporary-ceasefire-not-take-action-against-terrorism-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan Taliban used talks to prolong temporary ceasefire, not take action against terrorism: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday stated that the Afghan Taliban only participated in talks with Pakistan this past week to prolong a temporary ceasefire between the two nations and did not take any action against terrorist elements operating from their soil.
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban followed weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month. On Friday, the talks broke down, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying that the negotiations “entered an indefinite phase”, but a temporary ceasefire between Kabul and Islamabad still stands.
In a lengthy statement published today, the FO said: “Anyone following the talks held under the mediation of brotherly countries of Turkiye and Qatar, could easily discern that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna-al-Khawarij) and BLA/FaH (Balochistan Liberation Army/Fitna-al-Hindustan) elements present on Afghan soil.”
 
 

Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“Instead of finding solutions to address Pakistan’s core concern, [the] Afghan regime used the opportunity to malign Pakistan through hypothetical accusations and jingoistic rhetoric,” the statement added. “It prolonged discussions and engaged in futile arguments to stonewall the efforts at reaching any concrete understanding.”
The statement added that at the same time, the Afghan Taliban regime tried to paint the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue.
“In the aftermath of Pakistan’s ‘Operation Zarb-i-Azb’ in 2015, terrorists belonging to the so-called TTP/FaK fled to Afghanistan,” the statement read. “They abetted [the] Afghan Taliban in their fight against the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) and [the] Afghan Government of the time. These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by [the] Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to Afghan Taliban.”
Despite the breakdown of the negotiations, the statement emphasised that Pakistan has never turned down dialogue with “any government in Kabul”, but affirmed that it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.
The FO noted that since the Taliban’s takeover in 2021, terrorist attacks in Pakistan surged, with the attacks “emanating from Afghan soil”. It added that despite the attacks, Islamabad maintained restraint and took no retaliatory action.
“Pakistan’s expectation was that with [the] passage of time, [the] Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the TTP/FaK elements present on Afghan soil,” the statement read, adding that Pakistan tried to foster positive ties through providing humanitarian assistance and encouraging trade.
“However, despite all these positive gestures by Pakistan in terms of trade, humanitarian assistance, educational and medical visas facilitation and efforts at international forums to encourage the international community to engage with [the] Taliban regime in the interest of regional peace and stability, and for the socio-economic development of Afghanistan and its people, the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction.”
The statement reiterated Pakistan’s demand that the Afghan Taliban hand over these terrorists to Islamabad’s custody, adding that Kabul repeatedly refused to do so, citing a lack of control.
“More than being a matter of capability, it has become a matter of intent of [the] Taliban regime. Empty hopes and hollow promises rendered by Taliban regime so far have already outlived their efficacy,” the FO stated.
“[The] Taliban regime is also trying to portray the TTP/FaK and BLA/FaH elements as refugees in Afghanistan. This is not a humanitarian or a refugee issue, but a ploy to frame terrorists as refugees.”
The statement added: “Instead of acting upon the core expectation from Pakistan … not to allow Afghan territory to be used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions.”
The FO said Kabul has tried to “confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues” and keeps trying to “develop a narrative which absolves [the] Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards international community and its own people.”
The statement affirmed that Pakistan’s response to attacks launched from Afghanistan’s territory would leave “no stone unturned” to safeguard its sovereignty and citizens, adding that anyone supporting or abetting terrorists is “not considered a friend” of Islamabad’s.
Narratives and propaganda
The statement added that the Afghan Taliban try to spread narratives about disagreements within Islamabad over Afghan policy.
“Irrespective of this misleading propaganda, there is absolute clarity among the people of Pakistan that the ordinary people of Pakistan are the biggest victims of the terrorist activities by elements hiding in Afghanistan and their abettors,” the FO clarified, maintaining that Pakistan’s armed forces are fully capable of safeguarding the population against any acts of aggression.
Moreover, the FO noted in its statement an attempt by elements in the Afghan Taliban to “instigate Pashtoon (Pakhtun) nationalism” in Pakistan.
“It is a historical fact that Pashtoons in Pakistan are a vibrant part of the society and the state, holding leadership positions across the spectrum of polity and bureaucracy,” the statement read.
“More … Pashtoons live in Pakistan than in Afghanistan … therefore, instead of instigating pashtoonism in Pakistan, it would be wise for [the] Taliban regime to look into its own credentials of inclusivity of all segments of its population in its governance structures.”
‘Strong lobby’
The FO added that there are people within the Afghan Taliban who do not want war with Pakistan, but noted the presence of a “strong lobby, with monetary support from foreign actors that has been tasked to stoke tensions”.
“In search for legitimacy and to unite their fractious government, certain elements in [the] Taliban regime, anti-Pakistan terrorist elements and their abettors have found raising the bogey of Pakistan quite useful,” the statement read.
“These elements have engaged in abuses and outrageous allegations against Pakistan. By doing so, they are fast eroding whatever goodwill they had within Pakistan.”
Border clashes and talks
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha.
Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held several rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement was not achieved.
After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday.
The talks began on Friday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire. Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing.
However, the talks failed as negotiators could not bridge deep differences between the two sides.
“Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” said the defence minister while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’.
The defence minister added that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and that they were not willing to sign a written agreement. “They said that they would only respect the verbal agreement, but there is no room to do that.”</p><small>2025-11-09 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091709218f0667e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954087/pakistan-saudi-arabia-formally-ink-haj-2026-agreement' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Saudi Arabia formally ink Haj 2026 agreement</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia formally signed an agreement for Haj 2026, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Sunday.
According to the report, “Saudi Deputy Minister for Haj and Umrah Dr Abdulfattah Bin Sulaiman Mashat and Secretary Ministry of Religious Affairs of Pakistan Dr Syed Ata-ur-Rehman signed the agreement in Jeddah on Saturday.”
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
Dr Syed Ata-ur-Rehman expressed gratitude for the Saudi government’s excellent efforts in hosting and providing facilities to the guests of Allah, the report added.
“Like last year, Pakistani pilgrims will be provided with high-quality services this year,” the report quoted Dr Rehman as saying.
The secretary further expressed the determination of the Ministry of Religious Affairs to complete arrangements for both government and private Haj schemes in a timely and effective manner, in accordance with the guidelines of the Saudi government.
In July, the federal cabinet formally approved the Haj Policy 2026, outlining key procedural, financial, and logistical measures for the pilgrimage season. The following month, the government started accepting Haj applications.
This year, the Kingdom allocated a total quota of 179,210 pilgrims for Pakistan — 119,210 under the government scheme and 60,000 for private operators, according to the ministry.</p><small>2025-11-09 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09141258eab6037.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954078/ttap-rejects-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance TTAP rejects suggested ‘person-specific’ changes in Article 243</strong></a><br><p>Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Saturday rejected certain changes suggested to Article 243 of the Constitution under the 27th Amendment, claiming they were “person-specific”.
Yesterday, hours after the Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act 2025 was tabled in the Senate, the TTAP announced a nationwide protest movement against the proposed legislation starting today.
Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who leads the alliance, TTAP Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas addressed a joint press conference in Islamabad.
“Fundamentally, the concept of social contract implies how the state will take care of an individual’s basic rights. This is what the Constitution is all about,” Khokar noted. He stressed the concept of separation of powers provided in the 1973 Constitution, which meant that “no one institution will become so strong as to overpower other institutions”.
“Social contracts have nothing to do with personalities. The amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution are person-specific. They have been drafted by keeping in view the benefits of one position, the position of the field marshal,” Khokhar claimed.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Among the various proposals in the 27th Amendment bill are changes to the military leadership structure by rewriting Article 243 of the Constitution (command of the armed forces).
The bill proposes creating the post of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and abolishing the long-standing office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which was the top military role. If passed, the Amendment would also make the army chief the constitutionally recognised CDF, placing him at the top of Pakistan’s armed services.
The proposed legislation also vests broader, constitutionally protected powers and privileges in the country’s top military leadership.
 
 

Khokhar also termed the proposed lifetime immunity for the president from criminal proceedings as “person-specific”, quipping that the “theatre of the absurd” left the TTAP in surprise.
“These have no connection to the public […] half of Pakistan has gone below the poverty line, but the political, military and judicial elite are making amendments in the Constitution to protect themselves and attain their interests,” the former senator alleged.
“Why should we not think that this is to reward the existing judges in the Supreme Court whose retirements are due,” he added, contending that it was the duty of every segment of society to oppose such legislation.
Khokhar detailed the TTAP’s movement against the proposed Amendment, which included a National Consultative Conference to be held in Islamabad next week, where the future plan of action will be decided.
Khokhar stressed that the fundamental objection to the amendments was that the parliament was “not a representative” of the public as the “mandate was manufactured”, reiterating the rigging allegations during the February 2024 general elections.
The former senator also recalled the “way the 26th Amendment was passed”, indirectly referring to the claims of the PTI and the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) of their leaders being pressured to vote in favour of it.
Khokhar also criticised the Supreme Court for playing the “most important role” in the preparations for the 27th Amendment by allotting the reserved seats to the ruling coalition parties. The ruling, given by the court’s Constitutional Bench formed under the 26th Amendment, struck down an earlier SC verdict that had declared the PTI eligible for those seats.
“They (coalition partners) then got the required number [of lawmakers], as a result of which today they are about to pass the 27th Amendment,” the politician contended.
“We can’t shy away from the facts before us. This parliament does not have the ethical or legal legitimacy to carry out such big amendments,” he asserted.
 


Meanwhile, Achakzai contended that the SC judges should have summoned those parties involved in the Amendment for “attacking the Constitution”. “Until the judges do this, we will take this case of Article 6 (high treason) before the public’s court.”
Addressing the media, the MWM chief detailed the suggested changes to Article 243 and said, “You are giving all the power to one person and making them the head of all, and giving them lifetime immunity. They are making another god.”
Abbas underscored the need for checks and controls on powers, adding that the country was “heading towards fascism”. He alleged that the public’s mandate was “stolen” in the 2024 elections.
“You have destroyed the parliament, as well as the judiciary, and now where are you taking the institution that has to protect Pakistan’s borders?” Abbas said.
“We promise our public to challenge this amendment as much as we can,” he asserted.
Course of action
Later, the opposition alliance also shared its planned course of action to resist the proposed legislation.
The TTAP said in a statement that a “national consultative conference” would be called in Islamabad to devise a strategy, adding that in case of the approval of the bill, a black day would be observed the next day after the development over the “violation and demolition of the Human Contract of 1973”.
It also urged “judges having conscience” to express their stance and reservations over the proposed legislation through letters or in press conferences.
The statement further stated that following the 27th Amendment, the Constitution would no longer be the one agreed upon in 1973 but “an insurance policy for protecting and prolonging the power of Pindi, Lahore and Larkana”.
In this connection, the TTAP stressed that either the Constitution be restored in its original form, as it was till the promulgation of the 18th Amendment, or a debate should be started in Pakistan for a new human contract.
A plan should be presented at the meeting in Islamabad for holding rallies and corner meetings across the country, and an initiative for building public opinion should be undertaken by forming a committee to begin meaningful consultation with and gain support of civil society, media and business community.
“Such committees should be formed up to the union council level and hold meetings with the influencial representatives of trader associations and neighbourhoods and farmers’ bodies.
“Article should be written for local and international newspapers and magazines to present the case of the people of Pakistan on a regular basis,” the statement read.
It further said that the participation of lawyer bodies in this movement should be ensured, and a delegation should be constituted to convince the retired judges of Supreme Court and high courts to participate in the movement or at least gain their support.
PTI parliamentary lea­der Barrister Ali Zafar has contended that the debate on the bill was inappropriate in the absence of a notified leader of the opposition. He accused the government and its allies of being in a “hurry” to pass the amendments.
However, the PML-N and the PPP have rejected the impression that the 27th Amendment bill was rushed through without proper debate, saying the draft has undergone “extensive scrutiny”.</p><small>2025-11-09 12:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09154911e28ebdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954084/turkiyes-top-officials-to-visit-pakistan-next-week-over-tensions-with-afghanistan-president-erdogan' target='_blank'><strong>Türkiye’s top officials to visit Pakistan next week over tensions with Afghanistan: President Erdogan</strong></a><br><p>Türkiye’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin will visit Islamabad next week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday.
He made the announcement while speaking to reporters on his flight returning from Azerbaijan.
Talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators, broke down on Friday without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to monitor and prevent cross-border terrorism, officials and sources said.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif insisted that the negotiations were “over” and had “entered an indefinite phase”.
“Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” Asif told Geo News, alleging that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and was unwilling to sign a written agreement.
A senior security source confirmed that discussions had hit an impasse. “The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” he said.
However, it is understood that a fragile ceasefire between the two countries is still holding. The defence minister also said that the truce stands for the time being but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”.
The third round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks began on Thursday in Istanbul and was planned to continue for two days. Pakistan’s delegation, led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik, included senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials.
The Afghan Taliban side was headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and included Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib.
Reports from Istanbul suggest that the Pakistani delegation had left the hotel for the airport after the talks broke down. There was no direct meeting between the two delegations on Friday. The sides had met face to face in the presence of Qatari and Turkish mediators the previous day.
The ISI chief and some members of the Pakistan delegation have left Istanbul, but the Pakistani side is still not ruling out resumption of the process. A source said an attempt will be made to break the deadlock. It is believed that some senior officials have stayed behind to work with the mediators.
For most of Friday, mediators engaged the Afghan delegation separately, relaying Pakistan’s concerns and demands. Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesman, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, told reporters in Islamabad that the Pakistani delegation had presented its case in a “comprehensive and evidence-based manner”.
He added, “The Pakistan delegation has handed over its evidence-based, justified and logical demands to the mediators with a singular aim to put an end to cross-border terrorism. They are now discussing Pakistan’s demands with the Afghan delegation point by point.”
The dialogue process was launched after border clashes in early October that left several soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Turkiye and Qatar then stepped in to mediate.
The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire, while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks.
The latest round was aimed at finalising the modalities of that verification and monitoring mechanism.
Afghan negotiators, meanwhile, claimed on Friday that their own proposals were “logical and easily achievable” for Pakistan but described Islama­bad’s demands as “unrealistic and aggressive”, suggesting they might serve as a pretext to create further complications.
According to a source familiar with the discussions, the Afghan side conveyed that “it is up to Pakistan’s own calculations to deal with the situation”.
A source in Istanbul described the late-evening atmosphere at Istanbul’s Conrad Hotel, where the talks were held, as “not positive”.
Iranian FM calls Pakistani, Afghan counterparts
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday spoke to his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, Ishaq Dar and Amir Khan Muttaqi, discussing bilateral ties as well as the recent negotiations in Istanbul between Islamabad and Kabul, the Iranian and Afghan foreign ministries said.
According to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, Araghchi announced Iran’s readiness for any kind of assistance to resolve differences between the two countries.
“Expressing concern about the current situation between Afghanistan and Pakistan, he emphasised the need for continued dialogue between the two sides with the cooperation of influential countries in the region to resolve differences and reduce tension, and announced the readiness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide any kind of assistance to achieve this goal.
FM Dar, while explaining the latest situation and the results of the talks between his country and Afghanistan following recent developments, stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region, according to IRNA.

It’s the first such visit by a Syrian president since the country’s independence in 1946, according to analysts.
The interim leader met Trump for the first time in Riyadh during the US president’s regional tour in May.
US envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said earlier this month that Sharaa would “hopefully” sign an agreement to join the international US-led alliance against the militant Islamic State (IS) group.
The United States plans to establish a military base near Damascus “to coordinate humanitarian aid and observe developments between Syria and Israel”, a diplomatic source in Syria told AFP.
The State Department’s decision Friday to remove Sharaa from the blacklist was widely expected.
State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said Sharaa’s government had been meeting US demands, including on working to find missing Americans and on eliminating any remaining chemical weapons.
 
 

“These actions are being taken in recognition of the progress demonstrated by the Syrian leadership after the departure of Bashar al-Assad and more than 50 years of repression under the Assad regime,” Pigott said.
The spokesman added that the US delisting would promote “regional security and stability as well as an inclusive, Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process.”
The Syrian interior ministry announced on Saturday that it had carried out 61 raids and made 71 arrests in a “proactive campaign to neutralise the threat” of IS, according to the official SANA news agency.
It said the raids targeted locations where IS sleeper cells remain, including Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, Homs, Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and Damascus.
After his arrival in the United States, Sharaa shared a video on social media of him playing basketball with Centcom commander Brad Cooper and Kevin Lambert, the head of the international anti-IS operation in Iraq, alongside the caption “work hard, play harder”.
Transformation
Sharaa’s Washington trip comes after his landmark visit to the United Nations in September — his first time on US soil — where the ex-jihadist became the first Syrian president in decades to address the UN General Assembly in New York.
On Thursday, Washington led a vote by the Security Council to remove UN sanctions against him.
Formerly affiliated with Al-Qaeda, Sharaa’s group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), was delisted as a terrorist group by Washington as recently as July.
Since taking power, Syria’s new leaders have sought to break from their violent past and present a moderate image more tolerable to ordinary Syrians and foreign powers.
The White House visit “is further testament to the US commitment to the new Syria and a hugely symbolic moment for the country’s new leader, who thus marks another step in his astonishing transformation from militant leader to global statesman,” International Crisis Group US program director Michael Hanna said.
Sharaa is expected to seek funds for Syria, which faces significant challenges in rebuilding after 13 years of brutal civil war.
In October, the World Bank put a “conservative best estimate” of the cost of rebuilding Syria at $216 billion.</p><small>2025-11-09 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091319524033933.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954077/must-remain-fully-accountable-pm-shehbaz-orders-withdrawal-of-immunity-for-premier-in-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>‘Must remain fully accountable’: PM Shehbaz orders withdrawal of immunity for premier in 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday ordered the withdrawal of proposed immunity for the PM as part of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, urging that the premier must remain “fully accountable”.
Taking to X, he ordered the withdrawal of a clause seeking to grant immunity to the PM in the 27th Amendment and said, “On my return from Azerbaijan, I have learnt that some Senators belonging to our party have submitted an amendment regarding immunity for the prime minister.”
“While I acknowledge their intent in good faith, the proposal was not part of the Cabinet-approved draft. I have instructed that it be withdrawn immediately,” PM Shehbaz wrote.
 






“As a matter of principle, an elected prime minister must remain fully accountable, both before the court of law and the people.”
Separately, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while speaking to reporters today, said that PM Shehbaz told him earlier that “he had no interest in getting immunity,” owing to the executive nature of his role as the prime minister.
“The other positions being granted immunity do not have any executive functions,” Tarrar explained.
The statement comes as Senate and National Assembly committees continue to hold discussions on the proposed bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), changes to the appointment process for high court judges, a higher cap on provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure. A set of clauses in the bill also proposes life-long constitutional protection to officers promoted to five-star ranks of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet.
 
 

Such officers would “retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life”, removable only through the impeachment-like procedure under Article 47.
Immunities similar to those enjoyed by the president under Article 248 would apply in this case.
Article 248 of the Constitution stipulates that “no criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the president or a governor in any court during his term of office.”
On Saturday afternoon, the federal cabinet approved the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment, welcoming it to “the fullest extent.”
Subsequently, it was tabled before the Senate, triggering noisy protests from the opposition over the pace and scope of the proposed changes.
PM Shehbaz was elected as the 24th premier of Pakistan in the 2024 general elections. Article 95 of the Constitution of Pakistan allows for a prime minister to be impeached via a no-confidence motion.
It states: “A resolution for a vote of no-confidence moved by not less than twenty per centum of the total membership of the National Assembly may be passed against the Prime Minister by the National Assembly.”</p><small>2025-11-09 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0907235869ca412.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954002/27th-amendment-dethrones-supreme-court-legal-experts-warn' target='_blank'><strong>27th Amendment ‘dethrones’ Supreme Court, legal experts warn</strong></a><br><p>• Article 175 tweak ‘ends judiciary as we knew it’, says senior counsel
• Supporters believe new constitutional court will modernise judiciary
ISLAMABAD: The initial draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill, ta­­b­led in the Senate on Saturday, has led many legal experts to believe that the tw­­eaks would, in effect, dethrone the Sup­r­e­­me Court as the country’s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to a proposed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
However, proponents of the amendment say the new constitutional court would modernise the judiciary, reduce backlogs and separate constitutional and appellate jurisdictions — a reform they argue will improve efficiency and clarity in the justice system.
“Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’,” remarked a senior counsel who asked not to be named.
He warned that the government could now amend laws like the Elections Act 2017 and others to route appeals to the FCC instead of the Supreme Court.
 
 

Amendment to Article 175, he said, was “virtually the end of the judiciary as we knew it”, arguing that the Supreme Court had been “amended out of the Constitution by making it irrelevant”.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar said the essence of the package was twofold.
First, the insertion of a new Chapter 1A in the Constitution that, in his view, tightens executive control over the superior judiciary through expanded powers to transfer high court judges, and establishes an FCC “empowered by disempowering the Supreme Court”.
Second, an amendment to Article 243 that formally vests the office of Chief of the Defence Forces in the Chief of the Army Staff and constitutionally guarantees the Field Marshal rank for life.
 
 

Another lawyer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said that although the senior-most of the two chiefs would chair the Judicial Commission of Pakis­tan, “for all other purposes, the FCC will be in the commanding position”.
He pointed out that wherever the oaths of judges of the Supreme Court and FCC are mentioned, the FCC is referenced first. “It is clear now which court is higher in terms of hierarchy,” he said.
He noted that under the amended Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC is listed before the chief justice of the Supreme Court and will have a longer tenure, retiring at 68, compared to the current retirement age of 65 for Supreme Court judges.
‘Forward-looking reform model’
In contrast, senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar welcomed the initiative, calling the proposed 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in the justice system.
He said the creation of two separate apex courts — the existing Supreme Cou­rt dealing primarily with appellate functions, and a new FCC with exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation, inter-governmental disputes and matters arising under Article 199 — ref­lected “a forward-looking reform model”.
This division, he argued, would bring Pakistan closer to systems in many established democracies where constitutional and advisory jurisdictions are institutionally distinct, providing “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence”.
He said the reforms could help depoliticise the higher judiciary, eliminate internal divisions, reduce backlogs and prevent overlapping between constitutional and appellate benches.
Mr Khokhar said the amendments to Article 243 were in line with “modern constitutional democracies”, with a unified advisory framework under a principal military adviser answerable to the prime minister, the defence minister and the National Security Committee.
Meanwhile, newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association President Haroonur Rasheed supported the idea of setting up an FCC, and said the association was considering convening an All Pakistan Lawyers Convention, in consultation with the Pakistan Bar Council and other bar bodies.
“I am glad that an FCC is being established in the country by amending the Constitution with consensus and unanimity,” he said.

• In written order released on Saturday, court orders formation of new committee comprising govt officials and civil society members
to inspect zoos across Sindh
KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has ordered formation of a new committee to visit zoos across the province and suggest steps for improvement as well as sending the exotic animals to their natural habitats.
Inviting suggestions to phase out zoos in the entire province, a two-judge SHC bench comprising Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Justice Syed Fiaz-ul-Hassan Shah declared that the court had decided to examine the whole concept of keeping zoos and caging animals.
The remarks were part of a written order issued on Saturday regarding the Nov 6 hearing of a petition seeking shifting of lone female bear Rano from Karachi Zoological Gardens to Bear Sanctuary, Islamabad Wildlife Management Board.
The order stated that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and other respondents filed statements and reports and submitted that Rano had been successfully transported to the federal capital on Nov 5 in compliance with the orders issued by the bench earlier.
However, the bench enhanced the scope of the petition from Rano to the welfare of all animals kept in zoos and invited suggestions as to how to phase out zoos in the entire province.
Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar proposed that a committee may be constituted with the municipal commissioner, forest & wildlife secretary, wildlife conservator and KMC’s senior director-zoo as its members.
 
 

Representing the petitioner, Mohammad Jibran Nasir also suggested that philanthropist Ava Ardeshir Cowasjee, Dr Uzma Khan from Asia lead for WWF Pakistan, Advocate Nazia Hanjrah, Zhalay Sarhadi and petitioner/animal rights activist Jude Allen Preira may also be made part of the committee.
The bench ordered constitution of the committee and inclusion of all the names suggested by the wildlife conservator and the petitioner’s counsel.
The bench in its order stated: “In addition, the committee shall be given mandate to co-opt experts of the subject fields, who shall visit the zoos in the province and suggests steps for improvement in the zoos and identify issues being confronted by them at the moment to resolve them as a short term measure. As a long term measures, they shall recommend steps to be taken which may include but not limited to sending the exotic animals to their natural habitat.”
It further stated that as per the petitioner’s counsel the committee, constituted by the chief minister for shifting of Rano, had visited Karachi Zoo and found all the medical equipment out of order.
 
 

The bench stated that Zoo Director Aklaq Ahmed Yousufzai had undertaken to replace all out-of-order machines immediately and to outsource vets for treatment of the animals.
The hearing was adjourned till Nov 21.
At a previous hearing, the bench had directed the committee formed by the CM to visit the Karachi zoo and prepare a detailed report about the number of animals kept there as well as their physical and mental health.
It also asked the committee to examine the circumstances under which animals are being kept as well as to identify the animals as natives or exotic and must also make recommendations for improving the situation if it found the animals were kept in improper conditions.
The bench further ruled that since the issue was not of one bear but hundreds of animals being kept in captivity apparently just for entertainment of people and court has decided to examine the whole concept of keeping zoos and caging animals.

Officials said that the number of violent incidents against polio teams had decreased in the current year due to foolproof security measures, as four policemen and one civilian were killed and three police officials suffered injuries. Also, 17 health workers were kidnapped during house-to-house vaccination campaigns.
 
 

Official data shows that a total of 96 people have been killed by alleged terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 2012 and they included 61 policemen, 27 health workers and five civilians. Also, 170 people, including 124 policemen, 28 health workers and 21 civilians, were injured in attacks on polio teams.
During this period, 32 health workers, three civilians and one policeman were kidnapped during vaccination campaigns.

KP records better vaccination coverage

Of the people who were subjected to violence in the shape of death, injuries and kidnapping, 283 were men and 18 women, according to an official report.
However, the current year has proved to be relatively peaceful, enabling health workers to bring down the number of children who missed polio drops earlier either due to vaccination refusal by their parents or for being accessible to vaccinators in security-compromised areas.
Officials said that it was a welcome sign for the polio programme as health workers would be able to reach most children targeted in polio drives.
They said the continued violence against polio teams had also caused scare among health workers, so the number of unvaccinated children continued to rise.
The officials, however, said that in the current year, vaccinators were covering more children than those vaccinated in previous years due to enhanced supervision and surveillance both from the government and Emergency Operations Centre for Polio.
They said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had recorded 18 polio cases, most in the countrywide tally of 29, due to strong surveillance, which led to the collection of “most samples from suspected children.”
The officials said Sindh had recorded nine polio cases, while one case each was reported in Punjab and GB.
A recent report by the Independent Monitoring Board, which works on behalf of international donor agencies, said that Pakistan faced continued transmission in core reservoirs, particularly southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, alongside ongoing operational challenges that include missed children, security constraints and the urgent need for strengthened essential immunisation systems.
According to an IMB report released in September, security assessments have revealed a more nuanced picture than is often portrayed.
Of Pakistan’s 45.4 million target children, only 1.2 million face direct security constraints, primarily those in southern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The report, titled “The Glass Mountain,” said that escalating circulation in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with more than 100,000 unreached children represented the most immediate threat to interruption of transmission.
It noted that there were persistent access constraints and accumulated vulnerability, while many children missed vaccination in rounds after rounds, so intensive new approaches were required.
The polio programme has divided south Khyber Pakhtunkhwa into three categories, including green areas (71 per cent of the population, 159 union councils) with good access but quality challenges; community-led vaccination initiative areas (20 per cent of the population, 80 union councils) utilising community-led approaches; and black areas (nine per cent of the population, 26 union councils) requiring intensive engagement to achieve house-to-house access.
Officials said that new strategies and approaches were paying off with the unprecedented support of the government and security forces.
They said the innovative strategies had strengthened security due to which the vaccinators felt secure and took part in the campaign fearlessly.
The officials also said that recently, health secretary Shahidullah Khan transferred three district health officers and one district coordinator for showing laxity in polio drives.
They said that chief secretary Shahab Ali Shah, as the chairman of the provincial task force on polio, was likely to take action against the deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners for similar reasons.

The Justice Rana Bhagwandas Family Park and Dr Fareduddin Sethna Family Park were renovated in 2022 under the World Bank–funded Karachi Neighbourhood Improvement Project (KNIP) using public funds.
The residents expressed concern that these newly upgraded parks — complete with walkways, greenery, benches, and lighting — are being dismantled for private purposes, bringing late-night lights, noise, and traffic to peaceful residential areas.
“These parks were built for the community, not for commercialisation,” said a resident representative from the Save Bhagwandas Park Campaign. “Millions were spent under KNIP to create safe, family-friendly spaces. It’s unacceptable that public parks are being torn down just two years later.”

Oppose plan to convert family parks into padel courts

It may be noted that the Sindh High Court and Supreme Court have both ruled that public amenity land — including parks — cannot be leased, granted, or converted for private or commercial use.
Residents have also become parties to a constitutional petition at the SHC to legally halt all commercial construction and ensure that these parks remain public, peaceful, and non-commercial spaces.
Boundary walls of Beach Park, Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim demolished
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has torn down the outer walls of the Beach Park and Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim in Clifton to “show green beauty vibrantly and openly to the public like parks in other countries”.
A KMC spokesperson told Dawn that the decision would only be applied to the two parks facing Clifton Beach.
Regarding a video that went viral on social media showing some people taking out iron bars from the rubble, he said that it was KMC staff and the iron bars will be used in future infrastructure projects.
Meanwhile, Opposition Leader of the Karachi City Council Advocate Saifuddin strongly condemned the demolition of the protective walls of Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim and Beach Park, calling the move a criminal act.
He has sent an official letter to Municipal Commissioner Afzal Zaidi, with copies forwarded to Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah and mayor Murtaza Wahab.
In his letter, Mr Saifuddin demanded an immediate halt to the demolition and the reconstruction of the destroyed walls, stressing that tearing down park walls built with millions of rupees in public funds is a gross misuse of authority.
 
 

He questioned, “Who can authorise the demolition of properties worth crores? The parks are being destroyed, and now their beautiful walls are being razed as well. Without these protective boundaries, how will the park’s safety and demarcation be ensured?”
He termed the action incomprehensible and regrettable, calling for a thorough investigation and strict punishment for those responsible.
Such a major decision cannot be made without the City Council’s approval, he said and reiterated that Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim is a landmark of Karachi, and protecting and maintaining it is the primary responsibility of municipal authorities.

Trump had announced in September that Vice President JD Vance would travel to the meeting later this month instead of him, but has now said that US representatives will skip it entirely.
“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,” Trump said on his Truth Social network. “No US Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue.”
Trump said that Afrikaners — descendants of the first European settlers of South Africa — “are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated”. He added that he looked forward to hosting the 2026 G20 summit in the US — which the billionaire US president will controversially hold at his own golf resort in Miami, Florida.

South Africa calls Trump’s decision ‘regrettable’, pledges smooth summit

The South African foreign ministry cal­led Trump’s comments “regrettable” and said it was looking forward to hosting a “successful” summit set for November 22-23.
“The characterisation of Afrikaners as an exclusively white group is ahistorical. Furthermore, the claim that this community faces persecution is not substantiated by fact,” it said in a statement.
Pretoria chose “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability” as the theme for its G20 presidency but has faced some resistance, including from Washington.
“South Africa’s focus remains on its positive global contributions,” the foreign ministry said.
“Drawing on our own journey from racial and ethnic division to democracy, our nation is uniquely positioned to champion within the G20 a future of genuine solidarity.”
Trump has singled out South Africa for harsh treatment on a number of issues since he returned to the White House in January, most notably on his false claims of a “white genocide” in the country.
He ambushed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval office earlier this year, playing a video in which he alleged a campaign against white farmers by the post-apartheid government.
South Africa’s government denies any such policy. Trump’s administration announced plans last week to drastically cut back the number of refugees to be accepted annually by the United States to a record low of 7,500 — and give priority to white South Africans.

The crackdown, which spanned Lahore and other districts over the last 24 hours, led to the arrest of the violators and resulted in fines totaling over Rs1.067 million imposed on 491 people. An additional 38 individuals were issued warnings for environmental violations.
 
 

According to the breakdown provided by the spokesperson, the operations targe­ted key sources of pollution. A total of 209 smoke-emitting vehicles were cited, alon­gside 101 incidents of crop residue burning and 7 violations related to brick kilns.
This recent enforcement action is part of a larger, year-long initiative.
The spokesperson revealed that since the beginning of the current year, the police have registered a significant 2,275 cases and arrested 2,027 violators. The financial penalties have been substantial, with fines exceeding Rs227.1m imposed on 87,780 individuals, while 11,268 others have received warnings.
 
 

The annual data highlights the scale of the problem, with 52,872 violations for smoke-emitting vehicles, 3,365 for brick kilns, 1,725 related to industrial activities, and 1,166 cases of crop residue burning.
IG police Dr Usman Anwar has directed officers to further accelerate the anti-smog crackdown.
In his directives, the IG emphasised a zero-tolerance policy, ordering strict and immediate action against all those found violating the standard operating procedures (SOPs) designed to combat smog. The operations are to be intensified on highways, in industrial areas, on agricultural lands, and at other key locations contributing to poor air quality.

However, the Ministry of Finance has asked the Ministry of Industries and Production to first seek the IMF’s clearance for the incentives proposed under the new policy.
Officials said a meeting between IMF representatives and a team led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan is expected later this month to discuss the annual fiscal cost of the incentives planned for various sectors.
The policy targets $60 billion in exports by 2030, GDP growth of 6pc and manufacturing growth of 8pc annually by the end of the decade. It aims to provide a roadmap for industrial competitiveness, job creation and export expansion.
Key constraints
The NIP identifies a range of structural and policy-related challenges impeding industrial growth. These include macroeconomic instability, policy uncertainty, costly industrial land, excessive regulation, unreliable and expensive power supply, and limited access to long-term credit.

NIP targets $60bn exports by 2030; identifies high costs, weak regulation and uneven taxation as key hurdles

The ministry said local industries face high borrowing costs and limited access to capital markets. Weak investor protection and an inadequate insolvency framework have further discouraged lending, leaving banks with few tools to restructure loans.
The policy notes that uneven taxation across sectors discourages industrial investment. While manufacturing bears a heavier tax burden, sectors such as real estate, construction, wholesale and retail remain undertaxed, reducing returns on industrial ventures.
Manufacturing firms also face foreign exchange constraints, with frequent delays in accessing dollars for importing raw materials. In some cases, foreign investors struggle to repatriate profits, deterring foreign direct investment.
The NIP highlights weak standards compliance, which hampers exports, and calls for reforms to improve product quality and certification systems. It also stresses the need for inclusive industrialisation, noting that women remain largely excluded from industrial entrepreneurship and management.
 
 

“Women remain at the periphery and suffer from a sense of not belonging. This needs to change, and more women industrialists must be promoted,” the document states.
The policy proposes a predictable and transparent taxation regime consistent with IMF-backed reforms. It recommends widening the tax net and ensuring that all sectors contribute proportionately to their share of value-added in GDP.
The NIP also calls for the review and simplification of corporate income tax (CIT), currently set at 29pc, higher than the regional average of 26pc, which affects export competitiveness. The super tax, levied in addition to the CIT, should also be reassessed to ease the burden on industries, the document says.
Structural measures
To support struggling firms, the policy proposes setting up a National Industrial Revival Commission (NIRC) to oversee company rehabilitation and coordinate regulatory support.
It further calls for strengthening intellectual property rights (IPR) through accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty and enhancing the enforcement capacity of the Intellectual Property Organisation of Pakistan (IPO) to counter counterfeiting and piracy.
Reducing port charges, particularly those levied by the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and Port Qasim Authority (PQA) — among the highest in the world — is also recommended to improve export competitiveness.
Officials said the policy, once approved, will serve as a framework for industrial transformation through improved governance, fiscal discipline and an enabling environment for private investment. However, its implementation will depend on IMF endorsement of the incentive package, given Pakistan’s commitments under the ongoing economic stabilisation programme.
