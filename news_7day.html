The 13 terrorists were among 35 “khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij” killed in two separate engagements from September 10 to 13, the press release said.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
In an “encounter that took place in South Waziristan District, thirteen more khwarij were neutralised by the security forces. However, during intense fire exchange, twelve brave sons of soil, having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat (martyrdom),” the ISPR said.
 
 

The military’s media affairs wing further said that 22 “Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell” in Bajaur after an intense fire exchange during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) conducted by the security forces.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian-sponsored killed khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement added.
“Intelligence reports have unequivocally confirmed physical involvement of Afghan nationals in these heinous acts. Besides, [the] use of Afghan soil against Pakistan by Fitna al Khawarij terrorists continues to remain a grave point of concern,” the military further noted.
“Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government to uphold its responsibilities and deny use of its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan,” it added.
Pakistan has long maintained that it faces a persistent threat from militant groups operating out of Afghanistan, including the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which was recently designated by the US State Department as a Foreign Terr­­orist Organisation.
The ISPR asserted: “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khwarji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve.”
 
 

Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Earlier this month, six soldiers were martyred, while five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters in the Bannu district.
In response, the military has intensified its counter-terrorism operations. From September 9 to 10, security forces killed 14 “Indian-sponsored khwarij” in KP’s Mohmand district, four in North Waziristan, and one in Bannu district, according to the ISPR.
Yesterday, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Balochistan’s Mastung.
Last month, security forces gunned down 50 terrorists over a four-day operation, foiling an attempt by militants to cross over from Afghanistan into Balochistan.</p><small>2025-09-13 10:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/131403399d4d003.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941687/ice-officer-kills-man-in-chicago-suburb-during-arrest-attempt' target='_blank'><strong>ICE officer kills man in Chicago suburb during arrest attempt</strong></a><br><p>A US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a man in the Chicago area on Friday as officers attempted to detain him, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and local officials said.
ICE officers were conducting a vehicle stop to arrest Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez when he drove his car at the officers, DHS said in a statement. An ICE officer fired at Villegas-Gonzalez after being dragged by his vehicle, according to the statement.
The officer, who was not named, was injured and in stable condition, according to DHS.
Reuters could not immediately find contact information for Villegas-Gonzalez’s family.
DHS said in the statement that he was in the country illegally.
The Consulate General of Mexico in Chicago confirmed the identity of the person who was killed, saying he was a 38-year-old cook from Mexico.
The Trump administration said on Monday it had launched an immigration enforcement action in Chicago and other parts of Illinois called “Operation Midway Blitz”.
“We warned that ICE’s aggressive tactics and disregard for due process were a violent escalation,” US Representatives Jesus “Chuy” Garcia and Delia Ramirez and Illinois Representative Norma Hernandez said in a statement.
‘Endangers all our community’
The Mexican Consulate General said it was in touch with Villegas-Gonzalez’s family and that Mexico had asked ICE for more information on the incident.
DHS said the ICE officer used “appropriate force” during the incident and that Villegas-Gonzalez had a history of reckless driving. The agency said activists were encouraging people in the country illegally to resist law enforcement, a claim rejected by elected officials.
“Advocates and elected officials in Chicago have been warning people to be safe and know their rights if they have an encounter with law enforcement,” Garcia, Ramirez and Hernandez said in their statement.
Lilian Jimenez, an Illinois state representative in Chicago, also criticised ICE for the death.
“This endangers all of our community for ICE to operate in this manner,” she said. “Now we have seen the ultimate, horrific circumstances that we were all worried about. They have taken away the life of our community member.”
DHS said the incident took place in Chicago. Jimenez and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said it happened in the suburb of Franklin Park.
“The people of Illinois deserve a full, factual accounting of what’s happened today to ensure transparency and accountability,” Pritzker said on X.
 






US President Donald Trump, a Republican, has signalled in recent weeks that he could send National Guard troops and federal officers to Democratic-led Chicago to combat crime and illegal immigration.
The operation has so far more closely resembled Trump-era immigration enforcement operations than the troop deployments he authorised in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, this summer.
Trump’s threats have been met with protests across Chicago and the surrounding suburbs.</p><small>2025-09-13 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/131420182ef6e0d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941690/cjp-afridi-calls-for-cordial-cohesion-between-bench-bars-to-preserve-rule-of-law' target='_blank'><strong>CJP Afridi calls for ‘cordial’ cohesion between bench, bars to preserve rule of law</strong></a><br><p>Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi on Saturday called for “cordial” cohesion and relations between the bench and bars across the country, to preserve the rule of law.
Speaking at a judicial conference in Muzaffarabad, the CJP said it was heartening to witness the “spirit of judicial fraternity between Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK)” and extended “full constitutional [and] institutional support” from the Supreme Court to the AJK judiciary.
“I earnestly urge my brother judges and my respected bar members of [AJK] to keep three foundational fundamentals in mind in progressing with their future,” CJP Afridi said.
“I earnestly state, firstly, it is neither us sitting on the bench, nor for the worthy, respected bar members standing on the roster, but the litigant whose interest must always remain supreme.”
He added that secondly, the relationship between the bench and the bar “should always be cordial, constructive and considered”.
“Mind you, without this cohesion between the two pillars, there can be no guarantee for preserving the rule of law or ensuring any reform to go forward,” CJP Afridi emphasised.
“Thirdly, and finally … technology has to be integrated in the justice delivery process. Only then can the ultimate aim be achieved,” he added. “What is the ultimate end? [For] justice delivery to become efficient, transparent, and above all, citizen-centric.”
CJP Afridi added that Supreme Court Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar was committed to supporting the AJK judiciary’s automation.
“In any respect that you require, we are there and we stand ready to share experiences, extend technical cooperation and jointly build a future where the quality and accessibility of justice is strengthened across the board,” the CJP stated.

India held the IWT in abeyance following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”.
Friday’s event was jointly organised at the UN headquarters in New York by the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the UN and the Muslim-American Leadership Alliance (Mala), according to a statement posted by the Mission on X earlier today.
Participants of the event, which was on the theme of ‘Indus Waters Treaty and Pakistan’s Water Crisis: Challenges and the Way Forward’, termed the Indian move a “grave violation of international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law”, the statement said.
 
 

Attendees included diplomats, academics, policy practitioners, students, water experts and members of different organisations. Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UN Asim Iftikhar Ahmad was the keynote speaker, while others who addressed the event included Mala chairperson Maha Khan, former World Bank official Dr Masood Ahmad and lawyers.
Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Usman Jadoon, in his concluding remarks, warned that undermining the treaty would have “grave” humanitarian implications.
Jadoon stressed that denial of critical data-sharing translated into “food insecurity, displacement, and heightened vulnerabilities — especially for women, children, and the poor”.
He said the event’s discussions highlighted that the IWT, “despite current challenges, remains a binding and enduring international instrument”.
“The Indus River system is not only Pakistan’s lifeline but also a shared heritage of humanity,” he was quoted as saying by the Mission.
 






Amid the floods last month, the Foreign Office (FO) noted that India had shared flood warnings with Pakistan but the alerts were routed through diplomatic channels rather than the Indus Waters Commission, as stipulated under the IWT.
In his keynote speech at the event, Ambassador Ahmad warned against the “weaponisation of water”, which would have serious consequences for regional peace and stability.
Asserting that the IWT remains legally intact and recalling decisions by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), he noted that treating water as an instrument of political leverage is to deny people their most fundamental human right.
In June, the PCA in The Hague issued a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. In August, the court affirmed Pakistan’s right to “unrestricted use” of the western rivers.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also raised the issue at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) summit in China, where his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi was also present, and called for a “structural” dialogue on all outstanding disputes.
“These rulings leave no ambiguity — no party has the authority to unilaterally suspend or abandon this agreement. The Indus Waters Treaty is alive, and its provisions remain binding on the parties,” he highlighted.
Ambassador Ahmad also warned that the consequences of undermining the IWT are “extremely grave in terms of human suffering”.
“Water — especially in arid regions like ours — cannot be withheld or manipulated by the upper riparian without serious consequences for the lower riparians.”
Underscoring that access to water was a basic right, the UN envoy said: “Water scarcity heightens vulnerabilities, particularly for women and children. The human cost of undermining the Indus Waters Treaty is therefore borne disproportionately by those least able to endure it.”
He added that beyond the humanitarian dimension, India’s actions carried “grave implications for peace and security”, the Mission statement said.
Dawood Ghazanavi, a Supreme Court lawyer, spoke about the humanitarian consequences of IWT violations.
He pointed out that India’s failure to share hydrological data and key information with Pakistan “contributed to devastating displacements and mass migrations” caused by the recent floods in Punjab.
 
 

Ghazanavi said 45 per cent of Pakistan’s livelihoods primarily depend on the Indus River, warning that water insecurity threatens both survival and stability.
According to the Mission’s statement, Ghazanavi argued that India’s dam constructions and unilateral actions violated international conventions. Describing water deprivation as a breach of basic human rights, the lawyer called on the World Bank to reassert its role in mediation and also sought the UN’s involvement and mobilisation of civil society to demand compliance.
 






‘Far-reaching consequences’
Maha, the Mala chairperson, highlighted that water security had been at the heart of Mala’s work, given its “profound humanitarian implications for Pakistan”. She said the water crisis was not a distant challenge but a “pressing threat to livelihoods, stability and human dignity”, according to the statement.
“Addressing it is not only urgent, but essential to ensuring peace and sustainable development,” Maha was quoted as saying.
 






Dr Ahmad, a World Bank Infrastructure Development specialist who retired in 2017, “brought forth the technical depth and engineering basis” of the IWT.
Noting that the treaty enabled significant infrastructure development across the basin, he stressed that beyond legal and political debates, the “real challenge lies in improving water efficiency, irrigation systems, and resilience in times of crisis”.
The infrastructure expert, the Mission statement said, urged Pakistan to strengthen its capacity to respond to future shocks, ensuring the IWT continues to function as a foundation for sustainable development.
Among various legal experts who addressed the moot was independent consultant Kishor Uprety, who referred to the IWT as a “remarkable framework of cooperation” but cautioned that its credibility was under strain.
Uprety criticised India for bypassing the dispute resolution mechanisms set in place, warning that IWT’s suspension or collapse would have “far-reaching consequences across Asia and even beyond”. He stressed the need for strict adherence to international legal norms to preserve the balance between regional powers and protect human rights.
 
 

“He argued that terrorism allegations cannot be classified as material breaches that justify suspension and reminded the participants that the treaty contains no exit clause — its termination can only come through a replacement agreement,” according to the Mission.
Legal scholar Shahmeer Halepota, a partner at Aza Law, hailed the IWT as South Asia’s “most durable example of multilateralism and cooperation” but pointed to serious flaws in its current dispute resolution system. He noted the World Bank’s “active moderating role” when mediating the treaty but lamented that its “recent silence has led to delays and inconsistent rulings”.</p><small>2025-09-13 09:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1310022843ebf09.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941658/wasim-akram-tells-pakistan-india-to-forget-noise-and-enjoy-asia-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Wasim Akram tells Pakistan, India to forget noise and ‘enjoy’ Asia Cup clash</strong></a><br><p>Pace bowling great Wasim Akram has urged Pakistan and India’s cricketers to ignore the noise and enjoy the game when they meet in a highly charged Asia Cup T20 match on Sunday.
The Group A match in Dubai is the first clash on the cricket field between the countries since a military conflict four months ago took relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours to their lowest point in decades.
India resisted calls to boycott the match between the pair, who have not played in any bilateral series since deadly attacks in Mumbai 2008.
“Enjoy, it’s a game of cricket,” legendary left-armer Akram told AFP of the match, which potentially could be the first of three high-octane meetings between the countries in the T20 tournament.
“Forget about everything other than cricket. One team will win, and one team will lose,” he said.
“Just enjoy the moment if you win the game. Pressure will come, enjoy that and show discipline because this is just a game. It’s for both teams and for both sets of fans.”
A full house of 25,000 is expected at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium and Akram recalled how he thrived in such pressure situations during his 19-year international career.
“I enjoyed every game against India, and so did players from the opposition,” said Akram, who led a Pakistan touring team to India in 1999 despite threats from extremists.
The 59-year-old was also part of Pakistan’s 1987 tour during which the two countries came close to war.
 
 

Akram advised an inexperienced Pakistan team to think of the bigger picture and not get carried away by the hype of playing T20 world champions and arch-rivals India.
“Pakistan have a chance as they won a tri-series last week,” said Akram, referring to a T20 series with Afghanistan and the UAE.
“They should not think that we just need to win against India, think of winning the Asia Cup,” he said.
“You can lose to a big team but even then, stand up and play well in the tournament.
“I don’t think the match will be one-sided like India against UAE,” said Akram of India’s opening romp on Wednesday, where they needed just 4.3 overs to reach their target after dismissing the hosts for 57.
“Anything can happen in this tournament.”
Pakistan beat Oman by 93 runs in their opening match on Friday.
Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Bangladesh are in Group B.
The top two teams from each Group will qualify for the Super Four. The Asia Cup final will be in Dubai on September 28.</p><small>2025-09-13 08:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05174045751a1d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939898/the-pain-that-isnt-scanned-why-is-mental-health-missing-in-cancer-care' target='_blank'><strong>The pain that isn’t scanned — Why is mental health missing in cancer care?</strong></a><br><p>At just 40, Farhat had never imagined her world would shrink to hospital corridors, infusion drips, and the sterile hush of oncology wards. A spirited schoolteacher from Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Karachi, she was known for her laughter — loud, contagious, and always a beat ahead of the room.
But after her breast cancer diagnosis, the laughter disappeared. What followed was not just the slow unraveling of her physical health, but a silent, suffocating assault on her emotional wellbeing.
Sara, another breast cancer patient, endured mastectomy, chemotherapy, and the disorienting fog of fatigue and pain. But the darkest moments weren’t marked by physical suffering; they came in the long, sleepless nights filled with fear, anxiety, and an overwhelming sense of isolation. “Everyone talks about surviving cancer,” she whispered, “but no one prepares you for surviving yourself.”
Like countless women in Pakistan, these women found themselves trapped in a blind spot of our healthcare system: psychological support.
Farhat was recommended therapy, yes — but each session cost more than her monthly utility bills, and the nearest affordable counselling centre was two crowded bus rides and a month-long waitlist away. Her oncologist had done all he could for her body, but for her mind, there was nothing.
In a country where mental health is still spoken of in hushed tones and emotional pain is dismissed as weakness, her suffering went largely unseen. Even her family, loving but bewildered, urged her to pray harder, stay positive, and avoid “overthinking.” But what happens when the mind itself becomes a battlefield no prayer alone can soothe?
Their stories are not rare. And it forces us to ask: are we truly treating cancer or only the parts of it we can see?
 
 

The missing half of cancer care
Globally, the prevalence of anxiety and depression is 30 per cent and 33pc, respectively, according to an umbrella review carried out by Addisu et al. Some researches show the percentages to be even higher.
A Karachi-based study of 402 breast cancer patients found 59.7pc suffered anxiety, 69.4pc depression, and 47.5pc reported suicidal ideation. That said, what are the options a cancer patient has? A handful of psychotherapy centres exist, but most operate privately, and for the average patient, the cost of care remains far beyond reach.
Integrating mental health care into oncology remains one of the field’s greatest challenges. Despite the overwhelming prevalence of psychological distress, many cancer patients are left with unmet mental health needs.
The reasons are layered: limited time for distress screening, inadequate training of healthcare professionals, and insufficient resources to follow through when mental health concerns are identified. What is crucial to note here is that mental health support is often delivered separately from cancer treatment, leading to a disjointed and fragmented approach that leaves patients to piece together their own care.
We don’t have to look far for examples. In Sri Lanka, psychotherapy is being woven into cancer care, with the Ministry of Health recognising psychological support for patients and survivors as essential. Survivorship care, including counselling, has been formally built into the country’s National Strategic Plan for Cancer Prevention and Control.
Alongside this, Sri Lanka is strengthening palliative care services that incorporate psychosocial support, while also exploring ways to integrate complementary medicine with conventional cancer treatment.
Emotional healing has a price tag
This vision of holistic care stands in sharp contrast to Pakistan, where the prohibitive cost of therapy alone keeps psychological support out of reach for most patients.
A single session with a qualified therapist in Karachi can range from Rs3,000 to Rs8,000 — an amount far beyond what many middle income families can afford, especially when they’re already struggling to pay for diagnostic tests, medications, chemotherapy or even surgery. Unlike physical treatments, therapy is rarely a one-time intervention. It is ongoing, often requiring weekly or biweekly sessions — costs that quickly multiply into an overwhelming financial burden.
Yes, there are peer-led support groups in Pakistan that provide emotional comfort through shared stories, mutual encouragement, and a sense of community. However, they are not a substitute for professional mental health care.
Psychotherapy, especially when delivered by psychologists experienced in trauma and chronic illness, offers evidence-based interventions tailored to each patient’s psychological needs. It can address clinical depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and adjustment disorders, issues that often go beyond the scope of peer support.
 
 

Treating the body and the mind
It is time for Pakistan’s healthcare system to recognise that cancer treatment cannot stop at surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Emotional wellbeing must be treated as an essential part of recovery, not an afterthought. Psychological screening and counselling need to be built into routine oncology care, particularly in public hospitals where most patients turn for treatment.
Provincial governments must invest in training psycho-oncology professionals, subsidise mental health services for cancer patients, and expand teletherapy to bridge the urban–rural divide. At the same time, civil society and health institutions must lead awareness efforts so that emotional suffering is no longer dismissed as weakness, but understood as a valid, treatable consequence of illness.

Because in the fight against cancer, emotional wellbeing is not a luxury, it is survival.

Training oncology staff to recognise depression in cancer patients is crucial for improving both care and outcomes. Simple tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) can be used in clinical settings to screen patients and ensure no one slips through unnoticed.
Farhat survived the surgeries, the chemotherapy, the physical pain, but the emotional wounds lingered, unspoken and untreated. And her story is far from unique. Across Pakistan, countless patients endure the same silent suffering, their mental health sacrificed in a system that sees only the tumour, not the trauma.
Until cancer is treated as a disease of both body and mind, true healing will remain out of reach. It is not enough to save lives; we must fight to save what makes them worth living.

In her application to the IHC registrar,which Mazari shared on X, she said: “I write to you today to seek [the] preservation of CCTV footage of the Honourable Chief Justice’s courtroom no.1 from September 11, 2025 between 9am and 11am, as an unfortunate incident took place with the undersigned counsel, as a result of which it is imperative that the exchange recorded on the CCTV footage is preserved.
“I would also request [the] provision of a copy of the CCTV footage from the aforementioned date and time on the USB I have annexed herewith this instant application.”
 






The proceedings that Mazari referred to in her application are from a hearing on Thursday, during which she represented her client — who sought the removal of rights activist Mahrang Baloch’s name from the Exit Control List — in the court of IHC CJ Dogar.
At the hearing, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting hold of her”.
For her part, Mazari had said that she was only fulfilling her professional duty and was prepared to face contempt proceedings if the court deemed it necessary.
A day later at the hearing of another case, Justice Dogar provided a clarification on the matter, saying that his words were presented out of context. He also denied saying anything along the lines of “getting hold of” Mazari — a claim contested by Mazari’s husband Hadi Ali Chattha who also attended Thursday’s hearing.
In his clarification, Justice Dogar also said that Mazari was “like a daughter” to him, and he was only trying to explain things to her the previous day.
“I was explaining to her just as (I would) to a child, but she was not understanding. She was repeatedly mentioning fundamental rights. Does this court not have any fundamental rights,” he said.
His remarks drew criticism from the country’s legal fraternity and Mazari herself, who termed his remarks “sexist”.
A number of lawyers’ bodies and bar associations issued statements condemning the IHC CJ’s behaviour, with some even demanding that he be removed from his office.
The Lahore High Court Bar Association strongly condemned the exchange, saying that lawyers were “officer[s] of the court” and their respect and dignity should be prioritised, just like those of respected judges. It urged the Supreme Judicial Council to remove Justice Dogar from his post.
This demand was echoed by the Balochistan Bar Council as well, while the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) strongly condemned the “highly inappropriate conduct” of Justice Dogar.
The Women’s Action Forum was also outraged by the judge’s reported remarks, and condemned the “highly objectionable patriarchal misogynist anti-women remarks and behaviour … patronising language employed in addressing and instructing the lawyer’s spouse…”.</p><small>2025-09-13 07:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/122227056bb4d83.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941485/tokyo-set-for-athletics-extravaganza-to-ease-pain-of-covid-hit-olympics' target='_blank'><strong>Tokyo set for athletics extravaganza to ease pain of Covid-hit Olympics</strong></a><br><p>A sea of purple posters at the Narita Airport announces the World Athletics Championships — in both English and Japanese. Banners of Haruka Kitaguchi, Japan’s javelin star, are plastered on the walls of the mazy metro stations in the Japanese capital. On the buildings in Ginza, digital billboards have the Japanese athletics team on display.
After a spectator-less Olympics four years ago during the Covid-19 pandemic, Tokyo is geared up to host a global athletics extravaganza beginning on Saturday.
It was an emotional memory for Japanese athletics chief Yuko Arimori, who teared up when asked at the opening press conference on Friday what it meant to finally have fans in attendance at the championships.
“Sports aren’t just for athletes but for everyone to enjoy,” the former marathon runner said as she recalled being cheered on by fans at her international debut at the 1991 Tokyo World Championships.

The stadium is sold out on most nights, and as of Friday evening, nearly 500,000 tickets have been sold for the nine-day event featuring more than 2,000 athletes from 200 countries.
“This will be an athletics display of the ages,” World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said at Friday’s press conference, highlighting Usain Bolt’s presence at the World Athletics Ultimate Championships countdown party a day earlier.
“Sports have the unique ability to touch the hearts, minds and lives of young people.”
A Covid-delayed, spectator-less Olympics pushed World Athletics and the athletes to become more creative, better connected and grasp the use of advanced technology. “The athletes came back stronger, more mentally resilient,” Coe said.
He also defended World Athletics’ decision to cap off the season with the championships rather than it being the crescendo amid a stacked Diamond League season.
When asked, Coe brushed off any downside to two big-ticket events like the men’s and women’s 100 metre being scheduled for the same night, saying “it’ll work well”.
Several Olympic champions are headlining day one of the championships. It’s almost a given that Sweden’s Armando Duplantis will win gold and break another world record — his own — in the men’s Pole Vault, although that much-awaited display will come later, as Saturday is just the qualifying round.
US’ Valerie Allman, Olympic champion in Paris, leads the field in the women’s discus throw, while countrymate Ryan Crouser makes his season’s debut in Tokyo after battling injury. Crouser is the world record holder in the men’s shot put, a three-time Olympic champion and two-time world champion, his accolades almost guaranteeing the US a medal in the event.
Yet another US superstar to take the spotlight — which he absolutely adores — is Noah Lyles. The 28-year-old showman is the Olympic and defending champion in the men’s 100m, but currently holds the third fastest time this year with 9.90. Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson is the world lead with a sensational 9.75 run at the Jamaican Championships this June.
USA’s Kenneth Bednarek isn’t too far behind with 9.79 at the US Championships last month. Lyles and Bednarek will renew their rivalry in the 100m after Bednarek shoved Lyles following a heated showdown at the USA Track and Field Championships.
The women’s 100m comes with its own set of year-long rivalry. US’ Melissa Jefferson-Wooden arrives undefeated this year with a 10.65, the same time that won teammate Sha’Carri Richardson gold in Budapest 2023.
Jamaican twins Tina and Tia Clayton have taken the sprinting world by storm this year. Unfortunately, only national champion Tina will compete in the 100m dash this year after Tia suffered an injury during the Jamaican trials.
Five-time world champion and sprint goddess Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce will be ending her career “on her own terms” after Tokyo, which marks her ninth world championships. The 38-year-old Jamaican is an eight-time Olympic medalist and undoubtedly considered one of the greatest sprinters of all time. She’s the third-fastest woman in the world, with a 10.60 clocked in 2021.
The women’s 400m will be anyone’s game. Bahrain’s Salwa Eid Naser comes in with a 48.67 world lead set in the Zurich Diamond League final last month, while Dominican sprinter Marileidy Paulino is the defending and Olympic champion with a 48.81 this season.
Hurdles superstar Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone is focusing on the 400m flat this time. The 26-year-old won the US title in 48.90 earlier this year, just 0.16 shy of her personal best.</p><small>2025-09-13 07:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/131007574fea165.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941525/military-lands-and-cantonment-unveils-new-policy-for-internal-audit-in-cantt-boards' target='_blank'><strong>Military Lands and Cantonment unveils new policy for internal audit in cantt boards</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: The Military Lands and Cantonment on Friday unveiled a new policy for internal audit in the cantonment boards across the country.
Military Lands and Cantonment Director General Maj Gen Irfan Ahmad Malik unveiled a new initiative of Internal Audit Framework for Cantonment Boards across the country to ensure enhancing transparency, accountability and operational excellence.
According to a press release, external audits are already being conducted by the Directorate General Audit Defence Services (ADS), the need for an internal mechanism had long been felt to ensure corrective measures are taken in time and to reduce the number of audit observations during external reviews.
The newly-instituted system has been designed with clear objectives: Transparency and Uniformity in auditing practices, accountability at all levels of field offices, preventive and remedial action to identify irregularities or unwarranted practices at their earliest stage.
A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) devised by Director Headquarters Dr Saima Shah, has been formulated, providing well-defined processes for conducting inspection audits in a fair and competitive manner.
This initiative standardises practices across boards, ensures compliance and creates a strong foundation for proactive governance. This reform emphasises the institution’s commitment to strengthening internal checks.
The framework will serve not just as a set of guidelines but as a pledge to build trust, ensure financial discipline and deliver impactful results at the grassroots level.
The Internal Audit Framework is primarily preventive, remedial and curative in nature. By identifying and addressing acts of omission, commission, irregularities or illegalities at the initial stage, the system curbs unwarranted practices before they escalate.
This strengthens the financial systems of cantonment boards, ensuring optimal output through adherence to rules and procedures. The Military Lands and Cantonments Department affirms that this initiative will not only streamline audit processes but also boost the overall credibility and performance of cantonment boards, reinforcing their role in service delivery and good governance.

Israel attempted to kill the political leaders of Hamas with an attack in Qatar on Tuesday, a strike that risked derailing US-backed efforts to broker a truce in Gaza and end the nearly two-year-old conflict.
The attack was widely condemned in the Middle East and beyond as an act that could escalate tensions in a region already on edge.
Trump expressed annoyance about the strike in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and sought to assure the Qataris that such attacks would not happen again.
Trump and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani were joined by a top Trump adviser, US special envoy Steve Witkoff.
“Great dinner with POTUS. Just ended,” Qatar’s deputy chief of mission, Hamah Al-Muftah, said on X.
 






The White House confirmed the dinner had taken place but offered no details.
The session followed an hour-long meeting that al-Thani had at the White House on Friday with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
A source briefed on the meeting said they discussed Qatar’s future as a mediator in the region and defence cooperation in the wake of the Israeli strikes against Hamas in Doha.
Trump said he was unhappy with Israel’s strike, which he described as a unilateral action that did not advance US or Israeli interests.
Washington counts Qatar as a strong Gulf ally. Qatar has been a main mediator in long-running negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza, for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and for a post-conflict plan for the territory.
Al-Thani blamed Israel on Tuesday for trying to sabotage chances for peace but said Qatar would not be deterred from its role as mediator.
Israel’s assault on Gaza since October 2023 has killed over 64,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials, while internally displacing almost all of Gaza’s population and setting off a starvation crisis.
Multiple rights experts and scholars say Israel’s military assault on Gaza amounts to genocide.
Israel has rejected that determination.
It launched its latest and ongoing offensive in Gaza after an attack by Hamas in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Israel has also bombed Lebanon, Syria, Iran and Yemen in the course of the Gaza conflict.</p><small>2025-09-13 05:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1310502645cace8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941588/indian-hardliners-give-religious-twist-to-nepal-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Indian hardliners give religious twist to Nepal protests</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI: Protesters in Nepal ousted the prime minister and set parliament ablaze over the government’s ban on social media and corruption allegations, but in India the violence is being misrepresented online as something else entirely: a religious uprising.
While some claim that the demonstrations are a demand for a “Hindu state”, others say the opposite — that they are an attack on the faith.
Fuelling the narrative are allegations from Indian broadcasters and politicians that rioters vandalised Nepal’s Pash­u­pa­ti­nath temple, a revered Hindu site.
“Some rioters, hiding within the crowd of protesters, attempted to vandalise the temple, and it was only after this incident that the army was deployed,” an anchor for the right-wing Zee News channel said in a report featuring a clip of people climbing onto the temple’s gate and violently shaking it.
 
 

Jivesh Mishra, a member of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar state, which shares a border with Nepal, told reporters on Wednesday: “An attack on a temple is an attack on (the) Hindu faith.”
Right-wing influencers also amplified the claim to their thousands of followers.
But fact-checkers traced the footage to a religious ritual called Naxal Bhagwati Jatra, filmed weeks before the violence.
K. N. Swami, a renowned monk in the temple, also posted clips on social media to refute claims it had been attacked.
“I am currently inside the temple, and everything is peaceful here,” he said.
Nepal’s demonstrations began in the capital Kathmandu on Monday, driven by angry young protesters and now dubbed the “Gen Z” movement.
The protests escalated into an outpouring of rage nationwide, with government buildings set ablaze after a deadly crackdown. Sharma Oli quit as prime minister shortly after demonstrators set fire to his house.
 


‘Instigated and funded’
Hundreds of social media posts have clai­med without evidence that the protests were “instigated and funded” by “anti-Hindu forces and Islamists” to attack religious sites. Nepal, a secular republic since 2008, has witnessed frequent demonstrations by groups demanding a return to Hindu statehood.
Old visuals of the rallies resurfaced online this week, misleadingly presented as the current protests.
 
 

Footage of protesters calling for a Hindu monarchy in the past was falsely shared as evidence that Nepal’s “Gen Z” movement is more about religion than corruption.
Another image circulated with a claim that demonstrators wanted India’s firebrand Hindu monk Yogi Adityanath as Nepal’s prime minister.
‘Hindu nation’
Hashtags in favour of a “Hindu Nation” — a popular catchphrase of the BJP — have trended across social media platforms in India.
The posts warn the country to “prepare for similar youth uprisings”.
“The urge to break news fast in India is higher, and that led to misinformation from their side,” said Prashant Das, a research fellow at South Asian University.
“What is rife now are speculations and rumours, which are natural responses of people in such situations.”

In two separate orders issued after proceedings spanning over three years, the regulator imposed Rs200m on Gepco for overbilling consumers on the pretext of slow meters and Rs48m on Sepco for disrupting power supply to consumers based on aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses — an illegal practice.
Nepra said it had initiated proceedings against Gepco in August 2022, following complaints from 1,298 consumers regarding overbilling for a prolonged period, allegedly due to slow meters. The matter proceeded through investigations, a show-cause hearing, and other proceedings.
 
 

“Keeping in view the submissions of Gepco, the evidence available on record, provisions of relevant laws and applicable documents, the authority rejects the response of Gepco… and imposed a fine of Rs200m,” it said.
It directed Gepco to immediately ref­und or adjust all the bills charged to the affected 1,298 consumers over and above two billing cycles on account of slowness of energy meters, as was confirmed by Ge­­pco’s own report of Sept 9, 2022 within 30 days of receipt of this order, failing which an additional fine of Rs100,000 per day shall be imposed for continued violation.

Gepco fined Rs200m for overbilling and Sepco Rs48m for loadshedding

It said Gepco had charged consumers heavily through ‘detection bills’ on account of the slowness of energy meters for more than two billing cycles, with effect from January 1, 2021. The Gepco report, confirmed on September 9, 2022, stated that 1,298 consumers were charged detection bills due to slowness, in violation of the relevant provisions of the Consumer Service Manual (CSM).
Nepra had earlier directed Gepco in February 2023 to adjust the supplementary bills issued due to the slowness of energy meters for more than two billing cycles in future billing of the affected consumers, which was not implemented.
“Charging of supplementary bills on account of slowness for more than two billing cycles is blatant disregard of relevant provisions of CSM and has also caused serious harm to the reputation of licensee and unwarranted financial burden on the affected consumers,” Nepra held, adding that Gepco failed to comply with directions of the regulator for revision of supplementary bills charged on account of slowness of metering equipment in violation of provisions of CSM.
Illegal loadshedding
On the other hand, it imposed about Rs48m at the rate of Rs100,000 per day since April 4, 2024, on Sepco when it was directed by Nepra to stop ATC-based loadshedding for being illegal and against the regulations.
Sepco took the position on record that the ATC-based loadshedding was started in March 2014 upon the directions of the Ministry of Energy and the categories or slabs of the losses were defined by a subsidiary of the said ministry.
 
 

Nepra finally rejected Sepco’s position and directed it to “immediately cease and refrain from continuing AT&C-based load shedding in contravention of the Authority’s directives and the applicable legal framework”. Furthermore, the regulator also imposed a fine of Rs 100,000 per day on Sepco for each day of persistent contravention, effective from the date of Nepra’s original order dated April 4, 2024, until the violation is rectified. It asked Sepco to deposit the fine within 15 days.
“Failure to comply shall entail recovery of the outstanding amount under Section 41 of the Nepra Act as arrears of land revenue or through any other appropriate legal means, in addition to any further legal action.
The regulator observed that Sepco had been violating its own so-called AT&C policy and carrying out excessive load shedding as compared to the scheduled one. Moreover, a few feeders were randomly selected. It was observed that Sepco had failed to make improvements in the technical and financial health of those feeders over the last four years despite allowing colossal amounts under the O&M head by Nepra and continuing their operations in the status quo, due to which, even good-paying consumers were suffering a lot.

A rug hangs out to dry from a balcony of a home. Grey clouds still cover the sky but life carries on as usual in Saadi Town. Just a couple of days ago, the houses here looked like water-locked islands.
“The water did not enter our houses. Since this is not that old a town, the houses are built quite above the roads so we were fine, despite being marooned,” Babar Mirza, resident of Saadi Town, Block 7, told Dawn.
Even though the water has receded, it has left the roads in bad shape with an uneven surface, cracks and potholes. But the wild grass and weeds in vacant plots are lush green from the rain. They provide distraction from the moisture stains on brick walls.

Communities in Scheme 33 say their expensive residential town ‘turns into a katchi abadi’ when it rains

Saadi Town, Pir Zaman Town, Saadi Gardens and all other townships were submerged, according to the residents. The water spared none of them. They were all in the same boat.
“It was alright. I have lived in Saadi Town for some 22 years now. We have been through this before,” said Majida Bibi, another resident. She said they were prepared for that this time. “Our pantries were well-stocked as we had only recently shopped for the entire household at the start of the month. Even though we were trapped in our homes, we had adequate supplies to live on so there was no need to panic. And see how quickly the water receded,” she pointed out.
 
 

Haji Haroon Abdul Latif who runs a pan shop in the area said that he lived nearby at Mosamiat. “By the time I closed my shop to go home, the water level had risen to two to three feet. My motorcycle stopped in the water. But there was a mechanic I knew of not far from here, who was able to fix it,” said the pan shop owner. “We did not expect the water to recede so soon but it did thankfully,” he added.
Meanwhile, Sher Azam, who runs a footwear shop built at quite a height in one street which still had some water, smilingly shared his ordeal. “My shop is quite high from the ground, as you can see. But the water reached its highest step. Then if any vehicle passed by, the current turned the water into little tides which entered my shop. Some show boxes were ruined but thankfully I got a high table just in time to shift my stuff on it and hence save it,” he said.
“Now when most of the water has left this area with just a few streets still submerged, passers-by question me why there is still so much water here, or whether I have complained about it anywhere. This is neither my doing nor my fault,” he shrugged and frowned.
Dawn then reached out to information secretary for Saadi Town, Saadi Garden Action Committee, Irfan Mughal, who said that flooding in the area was not as big an issue as the infrastructure.
“Our gutter lines, laid out in 1975, have collapsed. The builder tells us that it is not so as actually the lines in Safoora Goth are blocked. But then why are the gutters there not overflowing?” The resident and information secretary wondered.
He also informed that there was a makeshift storm-water drain dug out in their area which opens into the Malir River. “But it was blocked by one of the builders here while using it as a dumping site for trash. There is also a pipeline under the Superhighway with one end opening at the Northern Bypass and the other at Saadi Town. The flooding rainwater enters through it to reach Saadi Gardens and after passing through there it flows into Saadi Town. This flowing flood of water from the Northern Bypass to Saadi Town takes around seven to eight hours but no one cares to block it at any point from entering a residential area,” he complained.
“Then when we are flooded, we find the media here doing photo shoots of our plight,” he said.
“We are an expensive residential town but we turn into a katchi abadi  [shanty town] as soon as it rains heavily,” Mr Mughal regretted. “And on  top of that we are paying double residential and water taxes here as we  have to pay the builder of our township as well as the  cantonment board,” he said.

In fact, there might be more. One of the questions, I suspect, may revolve around why such critical cases are being treated so uncritically.
Another would pertain to the reasons that compelled the Supreme Court to prioritise infructuous matters, or matters of dissimilar import, over those which hit the court’s credibility and integrity. Another may orbit around how the judiciary can even talk about judicial reform when it cannot decide the limits of its own judicial form.
Finally, one may ponder over what justice the Supreme Court can hope to deliver to others, when it evidently is unable to deliver justice to itself. All or any of these questions may be considered critical, and it can be debated which one deserves to be answered first. But what is beyond question is the silence of the court when it comes to answering any of them.
 
 

Whichever way one looks at it, the problem in the curious case of the challenges to the 26th Amendment lies in its very fundamentals. In essence, the changes brought about by the amendment appear to touch upon the very scheme of the Constitution it seeks to amend. The Supreme Court has itself referred to this ‘scheme’ in different ways on different occasions — as a ‘basic structure’, or as ‘salient features’, or ‘prominent characteristics’.
Whichever permutation you prefer, the gist of the argument remains the same: the Constitution retains certain fundamental features that make it what it is, and without them, it would perhaps no longer be the Constitution of Pakistan. In layman’s terms, the salient features are the Constitution, or at the very least, it’s soul.
While there may be many salient features, democracy, a parliamentary form of government, and independence of the judiciary are three definite ones. A long history of cases previously has acknowledged the presence of such features in one form or the other. However, on whether a constitutional amendment itself can be struck down on the touchstone of the same, the case law has been less enthusiastic.
 
 

Interestingly, Pakistan’s courts have traditionally been seen as more resistant to striking down a constitutional amendment on the basis of the doctrine of salient features, as opposed to Indian jurisdiction’s accommodating and more welcoming position on the issue.
This, however, seems to have changed in 2015, when the Supreme Court, hearing matters relating to the vires of the 18th Amendment, along with the 19th and 21st Amendments, specifically addressed this question. Out of a total of 17 judges, 11 not only upheld the presence of salient features in the Constitution in one form or the other, but also acknowledged and upheld the judicial review of a constitutional amendment on the basis of an infringement of the same. This is not to say that the judiciary retained unlimited powers to undo such amendments, which would be an overstatement.

Judicial independence is called a ‘principle’ of law for a reason.

However, in the context of the changes in the judicial appointment mechanism, as made by the 18th and 19th Amendments, and which revolved around the composition and functions of the judicial commission and parliamentary committee, the Supreme Court provided certain insightful observations.
In the context of Article 175-A of the Constitution, the court held that the litmus test for judicial independence appears to be that the power to initiate, as well as the primacy and decisiveness of the final outcome of the appointment process, must vest in the chief justices and members of the judiciary. Essentially, the judiciary must be given a decisive role in making such appointments and initiating them.
 
 

Earlier, in relation to the challenges to the 18th Amendment, and prior to the enactment of the 19th Amendment, the Supreme Court had articulated how the Constitution envisions a judiciary which is free from executive influence or oversight, and free from the shackles of legislative blackmail. It delineated such a principle on the basis of the constitutional provisions relating to a fair trial, separation of the executive from the judiciary, and securing an independent judiciary. It was actually in light of these principles that the need for the 19th Amendment was felt, which had whittled down the 18th Amendment in order to ensure that the executive and legislature would lack undue influence in judicial processes overall.
In my opinion, such influence would not merely be limited to considering the ratio of judicial officers to non-judicial representatives in the judicial commission, but would also have to consider the number of members, judicial or otherwise, being directly or indirectly appointed by the executive or legislature.
When the current challenges to the 26th Amendment are seen from this prism, the amendment does not seem to fulfil the above-mentioned litmus test or preserve the Constitution’s salient features. And that is perhaps why no one wants to deal with these cases. They have the potential to be messy, comes at an undesirable time, and is — for a lack of a better word — inconvenient.
 
 

That said, judicial independence is called a ‘principle’ of law for a reason. A ‘principle’ is a position one takes and stays committed to even in difficult times. If you remain committed to your principles only when it is convenient, it isn’t a principle, but a trend. In the past, the judiciary typically chose the path of least resistance when dealing with critical constitutional issues such as these, thereby being seen as facilitating power. Over the decades, it garnered criticism and lost much face.
One hopes that this time round, unlike its chequered past, it treats judicial independence as the principle it should be, and not as the trend it is now becoming.

The concerns came from office-bearers of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists during an emergency meeting at the National Press Club.
According to a statement, the participants expressed their dismay over the indictment of senior journalist Shahbaz Rana by a local court, despite the fact that he had filed the report based on official records.
They announced that the journalist community would hold a protest against what they called a biased trial. The case against Rana is based upon a complaint of an FBR official, who alleged that the journalist’s report was defamatory and scandalous.
However, the meeting reviewed the report and noted that not only was the information available in the official record, the report had proven to be true based on factual evidence.

“This step has been taken for the necessary maintenance of special Boeing 777 long-range aircraft that cross the Pacific Ocean,” a PIA spokesperson said on Friday.
In a statement issued here, the spokesperson said these aircraft had the capability to fly continuously for 17 hours without stopping.
“Both long-range aircraft will undergo a three-week process of technical inspection and replacement of parts, which becomes essential every 10 years.
“The purpose of this maintenance is to ensure the aircraft are fully prepared ahead of the expected passenger rush in the coming month,” he said.

In its session held at Parliament House and presided over by Senator Farooq Hamid Naek, the committee passed the Pakistan Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which was moved by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, which raises the minimum value of diyat from 30,663 grams to 45,000 grams of silver.
The adjustment aims to reflect current economic realities and ensure fair compensation for the heirs of victims in line with inflation.
 






Senator Zehri said the amendment was framed strictly under Islamic injunctions, while Senator Kamran Murtaza voiced dissent, warning that the higher amount could disproportionately burden less privileged convicts.

Senators endorse bills piloted by Samina Zehri as ‘pro-women’

The committee chairman defended the move, calling it essential for deterrence and “a step towards upholding the sanctity of life”.
The committee also adopted the Family Courts (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024, another initiative by Senator Zehri, which mandates that maintenance amount for divorced women and their children must be fixed at the very first hearing. If the defendant fails to pay maintenance amount by the 14th of each month, the defence will be struck off and the case decided on available evidence.
 
 

“This amendment ensures timely relief and upholds the dignity of vulnerable families,” Senator Zehri said, noting that divorce cases often drag on for years to the detriment of women and children.
Members of the committee strongly endorsed the reform as pro-women and public-friendly legislation, though Senator Murtaza raised concerns over its compatibility with Article 10-A of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to a fair trial.
Meanwhile, the Constitu­tion (Amendment) Bill, 2025, introduced by Senator Mohammad Abdul Qadir and proposing changes to Article 27, was withdrawn by the mover after the committee observed that the measure was redundant in view of a recent Supreme Court ruling and existing constitutional safeguards.
The meeting was attended by Senators Shahadat Awan, Kamran Murtaza, and Samina Mumtaz Zehri, alongside officials from relevant ministries and departments.

In applications, filed under Section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the couple sought an urgent hearing for their pending criminal revision petitions. The filings highlight a critical disparity between the pace of the trial court and the high court.
The petitioners argued that their pleas against the dismissal of acquittal pleas have been pending since January 2024, while the trial court is proceeding with “unprecedented and extraordinary speed,” conducting hearings on a strict day-to-day basis.
This “breakneck pace” of trial, presided over by the Special Judge Central in Islamabad, is severely prejudicial to their rights to a fair trial and due process, they contend.
They expressed a “grave and well-founded apprehension” that the trial court may conclude the case even before the IHC hears their challenge, which they said would render their legal right to revision “infructuous, nugatory, and a mere academic exercise.”

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mini Mazda Truck Owners Association President Latif Gul said Afghan authorities have not allowed the trucks to return, leaving hundreds of Pakistani drivers and conductors stuck across the border in difficult conditions.
“Our drivers have been away from their homes for a month, while truck owners have already exhausted their earnings to meet daily expenses,” he added.
Latif Gul said that delays at the border have increased operational costs, resulting in higher fares for vehicles travelling to Afghanistan. He warned that under such conditions, truck owners and drivers would no longer be willing to transport passengers to Afghanistan.
He further cautioned that if the issue is not resolved immediately, the association would be compelled to block Ring Road in Peshawar and halt the movement of all containers bound for Afghanistan.
He urged both the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to ensure the immediate repatriation of stranded vehicles and drivers.

Earlier, Additional District & Sessions Judge Yalmaz Ghani conducted the proceedings, with the prime minister appearing via a video link.
During the hearing, PM Shehbaz’s counsel Mustafa Ramday objected to several questions posed by Advocate Muhammad Hussain Chotia, the counsel for the defendant.
At the outset, the prime minister objected to the late arrival of the defendant’s lawyer, saying he had returned from an official visit to Qatar for the case. He asked the judge to proceed strictly in accordance with law.

Meetings on ongoing flood situation cited as reason for the request

Later, PM Shehbaz took oath to speak the truth and admitted that the receipts of the legal notice bore the name of his lawyer but did not specify who received them.
He maintained that the legal notice had been issued on his instructions, although he could not recall the complete text of the notice. The prime minister read the legal notice aloud in the court.
The defendant’s counsel pointed out that the defamation suit mentioned the Panama Papers but the legal notice did not.
However, PM Shehbaz said that he had repeatedly clarified that he had no connection to the Panama Papers.
“It is very clear in the suit and there is no need for further questions on this point,” he pressed.
Advocate Ramday also objected, calling the questions posed by the defendant’s counsel irrelevant and meaningless.
The judge adjourned further hearing till Sept 16 to continue the cross-examination of the prime minister.
In his suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran Khan levelled baseless allegations against him.
He sought a decree for recovery of Rs10bn as compensation from the defendant for publication of defamatory content.
The former prime minister had filed his reply to the suit with a delay of four years in 2021, saying one of his friends told him that someone known to him and the Sharif family had approached him with an offer to pay billions of rupees if he could convince him (Mr Khan) to stop pursuing the Panama Papers case.
The former prime minister said he disclosed the incident for the consumption of the public at large and an act in the interest of the public good does not constitute any defamation. Mr Khan said he did not specifically attribute any statement to the plaintiff (PM Shehbaz) while narrating the incident.

• Suspends eight cash and support centres due to Taliban ban on female staff
• Appeals for $259m to sustain life-saving assistance
ISLAMABAD: The top official of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in Afghanistan has called on Pakistan to uphold its long-standing humanitarian approach towards Afghan refugees and extend the legal stay of those still in need of international protection, particularly groups at heightened risk if forced to return.
In a statement issued from Geneva on Friday, UNHCR Representative to Afghanistan Arafat Jamal said the agency stood ready to support Pakistan in developing practical mechanisms to identify vulnerable individuals and expand regulated migration pathways for Afghans.
He also urged regional countries to ensure that all returns remain voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable, stressing that no one should be forced back to danger or to a country already stretched to absorb new arrivals.
“Without additional funding, we will not be able to sustain life-saving assistance for Afghan families facing these overlapping crises. We have updated our regional appeal for returns in light of recent events and are calling for $258.6 million,” Mr Jamal said.
As Pakistan resumes implementation of its “Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan”, more than 554,000 Afghans have returned since April, including 143,000 in August alone.
In recent weeks, the pace has surged further: in the first week of September alone, nearly 100,000 people crossed back from Pakistan, stretching capacities to the limit.
Together with partners, UNHCR is providing returnees with immediate assistance — cash support, protection and other essential services — both at border points and in their areas of return, to help families begin rebuilding their lives.
However, in recent days, UNHCR has been forced to temporarily suspend operations at its cash and support centres across Afghanistan, as the de facto authorities have been preventing national female UN staff members from entering UN compounds.
“This is a problem affecting the entire UN, including UNHCR, and any agency head would tell a similar story. It is not possible to serve women without female staff. We reiterate our call for the immediate lifting of these restrictions and for an urgent solution to be found,” the statement said.
Mr Jamal said the agency closed eight centres providing cash and other support to returnees on Sept 9 because of the ban on female aid workers.
“This was an operational decision. It is not a decision taken to punish anyone or to make a statement, but it simply demonstrates that we cannot work without female workers in certain circumstances,” he told a Geneva press briefing by video link from Kabul, according to Reuters.
“It is a huge step, and it is creating an enormous amount of suffering for these people,” he said, adding that these centres typically helped around 7,000 people a day.
The work at the centres involves personal interviews and biometrics, which he said cannot be done by men on Afghan women, he added.
Restrictions on women
Meanwhile, the United Nations in Afghanistan has called on Taliban authorities to lift restrictions barring women national staff from entering its premises, APP reported.
“These measures are putting life-saving humanitarian assistance and other essential services for hundreds of thousands of people affected by a recent deadly earthquake at risk,” the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) warned in a statement.
 
 

The UN Refugee Agency cautioned that a “crisis within a crisis” was emerging, as forced returns from Pakistan coincide with devastating earthquakes in many of the same areas where returnees are arriving.
Since the start of the year, about 2.6 million Afghans have returned from neighbouring countries, many against their will. Some have not set foot in Afghanistan for decades, while others are being brought into the country for the first time.
The agency “remains grateful to governments, companies and individuals who have already stepped up to support UNHCR’s work in Afghanistan and across the region. But our resources are running out quickly”, Mr Jamal cautioned.
Meanwhile, in the earthquake-affected areas, UNHCR has met families who had only just returned from Pakistan before losing their homes once again. “We are distributing thousands of tents and other relief items, including in some of the most remote locations, while also scaling up protection assessments and programmes already in place in these provinces for returnees,” he added.

LAHORE: Evacuation eff­orts continued across central and south Punjab as exceptionally high flood levels persist between the Panjnad confluence of Chenab-Ravi-Sutlej and Guddu Barrage in Sindh, creating a severe humanitarian crisis, inundating low-lying areas, displacing large populations, and destroying hundreds of acres of standing crops.
The overflowing Indus has also inundated parts of Sindh, with areas in Dadu and Lar­kana witnessing widespread displacement in riverine areas.
Residents of flood-hit areas are also facing widespread electricity and mobile service outages, leaving them cut off from authorities and relatives, while trapped by rising waters.
Punjab Relief Commi­ssioner Nabil Javaid said 97 people had lost their lives as Punjab faced the “biggest flood in history”. He reported that 2.45 million people from 4,500 villages along the Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab rivers had been affected, and that 1.9m cattle had been moved to safe locations.
 
 

The Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) has warned of a very high flood at Head Panjnad, Sidhnai, and Ganda Singh Wala, while high flood levels persist at Head Sulemanki, Head Islam, and Mailsi Syphon.
According to FFD data, released at 1am on Saturday, Punjnad Headworks recorded a flow of 651,572 cusecs, while the outflows at Guddu Barrage were steady at 537,392 cusecs.
Breaches
A total of 19 controlled breaches were carried out on Friday to mitigate the flood threat to Jalapur, Alipur, while efforts to repair the damaged dyke in Shujabad continued in earnest.
In Shujabad, a dyke collapsed at Mouza Dhundwala, flooding several villages and sending water towards the city. The administration and irrigation officials are trying to reinforce the Bakhto Wah canal dyke to protect the town, but several villages have already been submerged.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, who toured several flood hit areas on Friday, also visited the breach site and directed officials to seal it.
However, three workers sent to repair the breach in Shujabad were swept away by the rising waters. Two of them were rescued, but their third colleague could not be traced and was feared dead.
Authorities also made controlled breaches on Uch Sharif Road to divert floodwaters away from Jalalpur city, with Multan police chief Sadiq Ali Dogar saying the decision was necessary as pressure on temporary dams was not easing.
In Alipur, the administration breached Seetpur Road at 18 locations to disperse water flowing towards the city, submerging several villages and trapping thousands on rooftops.  Here, a rescue boat capsized in Darabpur village when a man tried to climb on it, causing it to lose balance. However, all passengers were rescued.
‘Calamity-hit’ Alipur
Marriyum Aurangzeb also visited Alipur to monitor flood relief operations. She declared Alipur tehsil a calamity-hit area.
People gathered around her to report that six members of a family were missing after a rescue boat capsized in Seetpur. Many residents were stranded on rooftops, and boats were not available for evacuation.
The government also deployed drones in the flood-affected areas of Seetpur city to distribute food items. The drones carried supplies and delivered them to people stranded on rooftops.
Malik Riaz, a resident of Seetpur, told Dawn that he had been without food and water for the last two days and that the drone delivery provided much-needed relief. He added that hand pumps were emitting dirty water, which was unsafe for drinking.
Rescue spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said that 18,130 people have been rescued from Jalalpur Pirwala, 11,700 from Liaqatpur in Rahim Yar Khan, and 6,400 from Alipur. In the last 24 hours across Punjab, 19,946 people were rescued from flood-affected areas, including 1,955 from Bahawalpur, 1,715 from Pakpattan, 1,407 from Lodhran, 830 from Okara, 823 from Bahawalnagar, 659 from Jhang, 585 from Kasur, 558 from Vehari, and 545 from Toba Tek Singh.
Dadu flooding
In Sindh, floods inundated parts of Dadu as the Indus River overflowed near the Dadu-Moro Bridge, submerging more than 30 villages in the riverine areas. The rising waters have displaced large numbers of residents and triggered outbreaks of waterborne and other infectious diseases.
 
 

The Health Department, People’s Primary Healthcare Initiative and Rescue 1122 have set up medical camps to provide urgent care.
According to Deputy Commissioner Syed Murtaza Ali Shah, medical camps have been established along the protective embankment, while mobile ambulances are operating to assist the affected population. Boats have also been deployed to help stranded residents. Authorities are monitoring the situation closely and have urged the residents to cooperate with rescue teams and follow precautionary measures.
PM praises relief efforts
Separately, PM Shehbaz Sharif on Friday praised all four chief ministers, as well as the governments of GB and AJK, for carrying out prompt and effective flood relief operations across the country.
The prime minister specially commended his niece, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, saying: “She is leading from the front.”

The PPP chairman said it was “beyond comprehension” as to why the Centre had not sought international assistance despite a disaster of this scale. “This is standard practice for disasters of this scale internationally. It was done for the last floods when I was foreign minister, before that, the 2010 floods and the 2005 earthquake.
Countries all over the world do the same within the first 72 hours of such disasters,” he said on his X (formerly Twitter) account.
“There is no excuse to cut off the millions affected from this assistance,” he said.
 







Sherry Rehman moves resolution in Senate, urges govt to use BISP to help survivors

Mr Bhutto-Zardari welcomed the government’s decision to announce a climate and agricultural emergency and called for the announcement of relief through the Benazir Income Support Programme for flood-impacted areas. He also expressed support for the agricultural community, calling it the “most devastated sector” due to the recent floods.
Resolution
The resolution submitted to the Senate, moved by Senator Sherry Rehman, emphasised that immediate humanitarian relief was critical, including the waiver of electricity bills for the millions of vulnerable citizens now displaced or affected.
 






Key points of the resolution included acknowledging the current crisis as a climate, flood, agricultural, and humanitarian emergency, and emphasising that delays in mobilising support were unacceptable, regardless of the pace of international response, said a statement issued by the PPP.
The destruction of crops and displacement of communities had created a multi-faceted emergency, requiring both immediate national action and robust international support.
 
 

The federal government must expedite direct cash transfers to displaced families and affected farmers via the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), following the successful model of 2022, the resolution said, besides emphasising the urgent need for basic medical care and medicines.
“There is a need for a renewed call for the government of Pakistan to launch an international flash appeal through the United Nations to enable swift donor mobilisation,” it added.

Despite the approval, federal and regional officials face significant funding challenges, with financial responsibility for the new posts placed on the “resource-strapped” Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) government and construction funds deferred until the next fiscal year.
A Central Development Working Party (CDWP) meeting, held on July 25, under the chairmanship of the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commi­ssion, reviewed the GB government sponsored pro­ject “Raising of Cou­nter Terrorism Depart­ment (CTD) in GB”, which carries a cost of over 1.5 billion rupees.
The initiative follows a directive from the prime minister, who during a visit on Nov 6, last year, ordered the establishment of the CTD in GB within six months.
The project aims to enh­ance the capacity of the GB Police by addressing “critical gaps in human and technical reso­urces, enabling effective res­ponses to terrorist incidents and the conduct of comprehensive investigations”.
While the CDWP approved the civil works component of the project — the construction of a CTD HQs in Gilgit and a regional office in Chilas at a cost of Rs720.50 million — it noted the allocation would not be made until the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for the 2026-27 fiscal year.
 
 

The Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, GB and States and Frontier Regions will sponsor the project.
The Ministry of Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives cited “reduced fiscal space in PSDP” and a “substantial” existing financial commitment to GB as reasons for the delay. It told the GB government to either execute the project using its own resources or approach the Finance Division for recurring budget support.
The planning division’s chairman told the meeting that the PSDP is meant for development, while expenses like arms and ammunition are recurring costs that should be covered by the current budget.
The GB Home Department informed the forum that its own regional budget has no room to accommodate new projects and that it is already facing a shortage of resources, a situation exacerbated by ongoing floods.
It said the Finance Division is considering a reduction of Rs40 billion from the already approved SDP, This reduction would limit the PSDP to funding only ongoing strategic projects.
Separately, the Federal Finance Division concurred with the creation of the 613 posts for the new department. However, in a letter to the GB Home and Prisons Department, it attached strict conditions.
“I am directed to… convey the concurrence of Finance Division for the creation of 613 posts for CTD, Gilgit-Baltistan,” the letter from Section Officer Babar Nazir stated.
It stipulated that the “additional financial implications shall be met out by the GB government from their available resources and no additional funds will be provided for this purpose”.

• Qatari PM says Tel Aviv led by ‘bloodthirsty extremists’; reminds how US never attacked Taliban leaders during Doha peace process
WASHINGTON / ISLA­M­ABAD: A rare and public rift emerged among Israel and its closest Western allies during Thursday’s emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, as the US, France and UK voiced differing views on its airstrike against Qatar.
For the first time in recent memory, the US joined all 15 Security Council members in condemning the strike.
Acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea described the operation as “counterproductive” and said it “does not advance Israel or America’s goals“, while emphasizing the importance of de-escalation and support for Qatar, a key mediator in Gaza ceasefire negotiations.
For a Security Council statement to be issued, all 15 members must sign off on the text. The United States has historically shielded Israel from statements of condemnation by not endorsing them, but on Thursday, it opted not to veto the joint statement.
France’s Ambassador to the UN, Jérôme Bonna­font, condemned Israel’s strikes as a violation of international law. He stressed that “a political solution based on the two-State framework is essential,” emphasizing recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state with reformed governance.
 






UK ambassador Dame Barbara Woodward said: “We wholly condemn the strikes on Qatar which will do nothing to deliver peace in the Middle East, or to help safeguard Israel’s long-term security.”
 






Trade barbs
But Israel’s UN Amba­ssador, Danny Danon, made no effort to read the room. Instead, he underscored the double standards of those Western allies who criticised Tel Aviv’s action.
Drawing parallels to the US operation that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, Danon said: “When bin Laden was eliminated in Pakistan, the question asked was not why target a terrorist on foreign soil… The same question must be asked today. There’s no immunity for bin Laden and there can be no immunity for Hamas.”
He also turned on France and Britain, recalling French action against terrorists in Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso, and Mau­ritania, and London’s airstrikes against the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria.
 






At that, Pakistan immediately exercised its right of reply, with Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Ifti­khar Ahmad rejecting the analogy as “unacceptable” and “ludicrous” and accusing Israel of attempting to deflect attention from its own “illegal act­ions and violations of int­ernational law“.
“It [Israel] is an occupier, a serial violator of the UN Charter and international law, that threatens the international community, humanitarian org­anisations, and even the United Nations itself — and does so with impunity,” Mr Ahmad said. “Despite being the aggressor, it pretends to be the victim. But today, it stands fully exposed.”
 






Following Pakistan’s res­ponse, the Israeli amb­assador returned to the floor, accusing Pakistan and others of applying double standards.
In its weekly briefing on Friday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office also condemned the Israeli aggression against Qatar and expr­essed complete solidarity with the brotherly state, calling on the international community to hold Israel accountable for this unprovoked and unlawful aggression.
Qatari PM’s address
In his address under Rule 37, Qatar’s prime minister strongly deno­unced the Israeli attack in Doha. He said the attack targeted a residential compound allocated for negotiating teams, housing Hamas representatives and their families, and terrorised residents.
“It is a violation of the UN Member State’s sovereignty,” he said. “Israel — led by bloodthirsty extr­emists — has gone beyond any borders, any limitation when it comes to behaviour among states and individuals.
Have you heard of any state that is attacking the mediator this way? A state that is attacking the negotiating teams that are hosted by Qatar?”
