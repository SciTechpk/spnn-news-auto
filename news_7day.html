<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/03193841aeb7c06.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952938/fearing-fraud-canada-rejects-most-indian-study-permit-applicants' target='_blank'><strong>Fearing fraud, Canada rejects most Indian study permit applicants</strong></a><br><p>Canada’s clampdown on international students has hit applicants from India particularly hard, government data shows, as what was once a preferred destination loses its allure for Indian students.
Canada lowered the number of international student permits it issues for the second year in a row in early 2025 as part of a broader effort to reduce the number of temporary migrants and address fraud related to student visas.
About 74 per cent of Indian applications for permits to study at Canadian post-secondary institutions in August — the most recent month available — were rejected, compared to about 32pc in August 2023, according to immigration department data provided to Reuters.
By contrast, about 40pc of study permit applications overall in each of those months were refused. About 24pc of Chinese study permits in August 2025 were rejected.
The number of Indian applicants has dropped as well, from 20,900 in August 2023 — when Indians formed just over one quarter of all applicants — to 4,515 in August 2025.
India has been Canada’s top source of international students over the past decade. In August, it also had the highest study-permit refusal rate of any country with more than 1,000 approved applicants.
The spike in refusals of would-be students comes as Canada and India seek to mend ties after more than a year of tension.
Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of involvement in the 2023 murder of a Canadian in Surrey, British Columbia. India has repeatedly denied the allegations.
An effort to crack down on fraud
In 2023, Canadian authorities uncovered nearly 1,550 study permit applications linked to fraudulent letters of acceptance, most of which originated from India, Canada’s immigration department told Reuters in an email.
Last year, its beefed-up verification system detected more than 14,000 potentially fraudulent letters of acceptance from all applicants, it said.
Canada has implemented enhanced verification for international students and has increased its financial requirements for applicants, the immigration department spokesperson said.
The Indian embassy in Ottawa said the rejection of study permit applications from students in India had come to its attention, but that the issuance of study permits is Canada’s prerogative.
“However, we would like to emphasise that some of the best quality students available in the world are from India, and Canadian institutions have in the past greatly benefited from the talent and academic excellence of these students,” the embassy said in a statement.
Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand told Reuters during an October visit to India that Canada’s government is concerned about the integrity of its immigration system but wants to continue having Indian students in Canada.
A drop in Indian enrolment
People who work with would-be international students say they are seeing a higher level of applicant scrutiny.
Michael Pietrocarlo of Border Pass, which helps people apply for Canadian visas, said his firm prepares applicants to show their eligibility beyond what’s required on paper.
He says, for example, when students must demonstrate they have sufficient funds to support themselves, “it’s not enough just to say, ‘Here are some bank statements.’ They may have to go the extra mile and say, ‘Here’s where the money came from.’”
The University of Waterloo, home to Canada’s largest engineering school, has seen a two-thirds decline in the number of students from India entering its undergraduate and graduate programs over the past three to four years.
Ian VanderBurgh, its associate vice president of strategic enrolment management, said the drop was largely due to a government cap on foreign student visas and had altered the composition of the student body.
“We pride ourselves on being an international university,” he said.
The University of Regina and the University of Saskatchewan have also reported a decline in the number of Indian students enrolled.
When Jaspreet Singh, who founded the International Sikh Students Association, came to Canada from India in 2015 to study mechanical engineering, he remembers government posters exhorting newcomers to “Study, work, stay” in the country. That attitude has soured, he said.
Singh is not surprised at the higher rejection rate for Indian study permit applicants, saying he knows fraud is a concern.
But as it becomes harder to get permanent residency or a job in Canada, he says some of those recently rejected appear to not mind: “They are happy they didn’t come.”</p><small>2025-11-03 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031918388a4323e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952937/remand-extended-for-7-nccia-officials-in-bribery-case' target='_blank'><strong>Remand extended for 7 NCCIA officials in bribery case</strong></a><br><p>A Lahore judicial magistrate on Monday awarded three days of physical remand to seven National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials and a private individual in a case registered against them for allegedly misusing their authority, extorting money, and taking bribes.
Last week, a Lahore court granted the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) a three-day physical remand of the officials, while a judicial magistrate extended their physical remand for three more days on Friday.
According to a copy of the remand order available with Dawn.com, while the initial allegation involved a bribe of Rs9 million, the amount recovered by the investigating officer was Rs42.5m.
“After hearing argument and perusal of record, it transpires that complainant … moved [an] application that she paid [Rs9m] illegal gratification to Shoaib Riaz AD/FIA, who was [the] investigation officer (IO) in [the] case of her husband,” the order read.
“Complainant also alleged that she got knowledge that a corruption network in NCCIA is active. On which IO made inquiry and found all accused persons/NCCIA officials were found in [the] alleged corruption network. He recorded statements of all [the] accused in which they mentioned details of amount, reason and procedure.”
The remand order noted that Rs9m was recovered from the prime accused, NCCIA Lahore Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, while the remaining Rs33.5m was recovered from five others.
The magistrate awarded remand due to the amount of money recovered during the previous two periods of remand, extending it by another three days.
The hearing
During today’s hearing, the FIA prosecutor requested additional remand, arguing that the accused were involved in a “white-collar crime” and that information needed to be gathered about the victims.
The prosecutor stated that “Rs45.8m has been recovered from the accused. The accused needs to be investigated further.”
The lawyer for the accused said it was “strange” that the FIA had no plaintiff in the case and that “they are still looking for them”.
“There has been no statement issued against the accused,” advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq, the representative for the accused, argued.
“This case is weak; they (the prosecutors) are alleging that [the accused] take bribes from call centres,” a lawyer for the accused argued. “There is no name or statement from the call centre.”
Ashfaq argued that the case is “ideal” for dismissal, arguing, “The FIA ​​had four opportunities to investigate, but it was not done. The case was made and was operating on verbal testimony.”
He further argued that there is no scope in financial crimes for verbal testimony and asked why, in a bribery case, details about sums of money and serial numbers were not included.
“There is no such declaration on the record,” Ashfaq stated. “They can continue their investigation and appear before the court again when all their records are collected.”
The federal government established the NCCIA to probe illegal activities on social med­ia. The NCCIA, operating under the Interior Divi­sion, has a key role in combating cybercrime in Pakistan.
The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi, the wife of YouTuber Saadur Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, who was arrested in a case pertaining to promoting gambling apps on social media.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered by a total of nine individuals, including eight NCCIA officials, at 7:35pm. Among them, the six remanded in the FIA custody were said to be missing for several days before the FIA announced their arrest last week.</p><small>2025-11-03 14:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031854216c89c4b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952934/election-tribunal-rejects-plea-against-cm-maryams-lahore-win' target='_blank'><strong>Election tribunal rejects plea against CM Maryam’s Lahore win</strong></a><br><p>An election tribunal has dismissed a petition challenging the victory of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz from PP-159, Lahore, it emerged on Monday.
PTI-backed independent candidate Mehar Sharafat had filed the petition, claiming that he initially emerged victorious in the constituency based on the Form 45 results. The tribunal was presided over by retired justice Rana Zahid Mahmood.
He alleged that the results were later manipulated using Form 47 to declare Maryam the victor. He had asked the tribunal to set aside Maryam’s victory notification and declare him a returned candidate. Maryam had secured 23,598 and Sharafat obtained 21,491 votes in the Feb 8 general election.
An order of the election tribunal dated October 21 emerged today, which said that the counsel for the petitioner advanced “very short arguments … and it is important to mention that his arguments are general in nature with regard to allegations of corruption and corrupt practices during the election process in the constituency concerned, however, has not addressed any substantial legal arguments to explain the deficiencies in the verification process together with attestation”.
The order also highlighted various other procedural errors and flaws in the petition submitted by the PTI-backed candidate.
Responding to the development, Sharafat issued a challenge to the chief minister, saying that he would not only pay a fine of Rs20 million but also issue a public apology and leave politics forever if she publicly proved her victory and his defeat.
 






The Commonwealth Observer Group concluded last month that critical decisions by key institutions “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness” of Pakistan’s 2024 general elections and created an ‘unlevel playing field’ that consistently limited one political party.
In its long-delayed election observation report, the group noted that the PTI was primarily affected by these actions.
The findings were released in the group’s final report, made public nearly 11 months after its submission on Nov 20, 2024. The report serves as a detailed charge sheet on the electoral process, from the pre-election environment to post-election legal changes.</p><small>2025-11-03 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031900320160fae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952933/christian-muslim-nigerians-push-back-on-threatened-us-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Christian, Muslim Nigerians push back on threatened US strikes</strong></a><br><p>Nigerians across the religious spectrum pushed back Monday on US President Donald Trump’s threats of military intervention over the killing of Christians in the country.
Africa’s most populous country, which is roughly evenly split between a mostly Christian south and Muslim-majority north, is home to myriad conflicts, which experts say kill both Christians and Muslims without distinction.
Claims of Christian “persecution” in Nigeria have found traction online among the US and European right in recent weeks.
“Christians are being killed, we can’t deny the fact that Muslims are (also) being killed,” Danjuma Dickson Auta, a Christian and community leader, told AFP.
Trump said on social media over the weekend that he had asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack.
Asked by an AFP reporter aboard Air Force One if he was considering putting US troops on the ground or using air strikes, Trump replied: “Could be, I mean, a lot of things — I envisage a lot of things.”
“They’re killing the Christians and killing them in very large numbers,” he said Sunday. “We’re not going to allow that to happen.”
Ethnic violence
Auta, 56, hails from Plateau state, where Christians and Muslims have long lived side by side.
The state has also seen explosions of violence — including deadly sectarian riots in the capital Jos in 2001 and 2008.
In recent years, Plateau and other states in Nigeria’s “Middle Belt” have suffered deadly clashes between mostly Christian farmers and Fulani Muslim herders over dwindling land and resources.
The conflict has often resulted in massive death tolls on the side of the farmers, with entire villages razed.
Smaller-scale attacks on herders — including retaliatory killings of random ethnic Fulanis or their cattle — often generate fewer headlines in both the local and international press.
Though the violence often falls across ethnic and religious lines, experts say the root causes lie in poor land management and policing in rural areas.
Words like “genocide” have been thrown around by those in Plateau frustrated by the escalating violence, though typically in ethnic, not religious terms.
Claims of a “Christian genocide”, meanwhile, have been pushed in recent years by separatist groups in the southeast.
US-based firm Moran Global Strategies has been lobbying on behalf of separatists this year, advising congressional staff on what it said was Christian “persecution”, according to disclosure forms.
Nigeria suggests Trump-Tinubu meeting
Nigeria also faces a long-running jihadist conflict in its northeast, and “bandit” gangs in the northwest who conduct kidnappings and village raids.
The north’s population is mostly Muslim — meaning most of the victims are, too.
“Even those who sold this narrative of Christian genocide know it is not true,” said Abubakar Gamandi, a Muslim who heads a fishermen’s union in Borno state, the epicentre of the Boko Haram conflict.
Chukwuma Soludo, the Christian governor of Anambra state, also pushed back against US intervention, saying Washington “must act within the realm of international law”.
Others have used the controversy to point out long-festering insecurity in the country, and Trump’s rhetoric has resonated with some in Nigeria.
Reverend Joseph Hayab, chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria for the country’s north, said he rejected the framing of “farmer-herder violence” and called Trump’s comments a “wake-up call”.
“People are twisting the story as if Trump said he is coming to fight Nigeria. No, he is coming to deal with terrorists,” he told AFP.
Amid Trump’s ratcheted-up rhetoric, the Nigerian presidency suggested a meeting between the two leaders to resolve the issue.
Daniel Bwala, spokesman for Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, said, “Donald Trump has his own style of communication”.
Bwala suggested to AFP Sunday that Trump’s post was a way to “force a sit-down between the two leaders so they can iron out a common front to fight their insecurity”.
Trump previously attacked South Africa over what he called a “genocide” against its Dutch-descended Afrikaner community, and has offered them refugee status.
Critics of the president said the rhetoric was part of Trump’s hardline diplomatic strategy.</p><small>2025-11-03 14:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0317274987b6faf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952928/conditions-set-by-afghanistan-hold-no-significance-elimination-of-terrorism-matters-to-pakistan-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Conditions set by Afghanistan hold no significance, elimination of terrorism matters to Pakistan: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Director-General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Monday that the conditions set by Afghanistan hold no significance and only the elimination of terrorism matters to Pakistan.
On October 19, Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to an immediate ceasefire following high-level negotiations in Doha, where both countries pledged to respect each other’s sovereignty; they were expected to meet again on October 25 to discuss matters further.  The second round of talks on October 25 kicked off in Istanbul, with Islamabad eyeing a “concrete” mechanism to monitor Afghan Taliban actions aimed at preventing cross-border terrorist attacks.
The military’s spokesperson delivered a closed-door briefing to senior journalists belonging to select media outlets. “The conditions set by Afghanistan hold no significance,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told the journalists. “The important thing is the eradication of terrorism.”
He added that the guarantors of Pakistani security are the armed forces, not Afghanistan and that Islamabad has “never celebrated” the arrival of the Taliban. The military spokesperson further said that operations are underway against banned groups, including the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), with 1,667 terrorists killed.
 
 

“In Istanbul, the Afghan Taliban were clearly told that they need to control terrorism,” Lt Gen Chaudhry stated. “How they do it is their job. We conducted a counter-terrorism operation, and the terrorists fled to Afghanistan. Hand them over, we’ll deal with them according to the Constitution and the law.
“There will be no talks with terrorists, and Pakistan gave the Afghan Taliban a befitting response, which yielded the results we wanted.”
DG ISPR highlighted the role of the nexus between criminals and terrorist organisations, noting that through opium cultivation, terrorists make between Rs1.8 and 2.5 million per acre.
“The entire population joins them, even warlords join in, and they all work together,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.
He added that drugs are being smuggled from Afghanistan into Pakistan and further. “Afghan drug smugglers are interfering in Afghan politics.”
Senior journalist Hamid Mir, who attended the briefing, told Geo News that the journalists were presented with evidence of Afghan Taliban soldiers involved in terrorism in Pakistan.
“We were presented with the same evidence shared with the Afghan Taliban in Doha,” Mir reported. “These soldiers had Afghan and Afghan Army identification cards.
Border skirmishes and talks
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began last month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Türkiye and Qatar have deep ties with Pakistan, while Qatar also played a major role in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and Nato forces.</p><small>2025-11-03 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031529353030706.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952920/structural-reforms-set-pakistans-economic-direction-right-finance-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Structural reforms set Pakistan’s economic direction right: finance minister</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday said that Pakistan’s economic direction had been set right through a series of structural reforms, which were now being operationalised to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth.
“I believe there is a broad consensus that we have made significant inroads and achieved considerable progress in terms of macroeconomic stability,” he said while addressing a joint news conference on economic reforms.
He was accompanied by Power Minister Awais Leghari, Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali.
Aurangzeb said the government had achieved macroeconomic stability, as evidenced by external validation: three leading international rating agencies upgraded Pakistan after a gap of three years. “These agencies are now aligned not only on where we stand but also on our positive outlook,” he added.
He said the successful completion of the second International Monetary Fund (IMF) review and the subsequent staff-level agreement in Washington reaffirmed that the country’s economic trajectory was on the right path.
“When the exchange rate stabilises, foreign exchange reserves rise, inflation declines, and the policy rate comes down, the benefits are evident for industries,” the minister remarked, adding that investors had repatriated more than $4 million in profits and dividends.
Aurangzeb said investor confidence was crucial for attracting new foreign direct investment (FDI). “Until our existing investors are satisfied, we cannot talk about further FDI,” he said, adding that the government had moved in the right direction toward stability.
Highlighting the next phase of economic management, the finance minister said Pakistan must now focus on avoiding historical boom-and-bust cycles and move toward sustained and inclusive growth.
“Pakistan today stands at a unique confluence of economic stability and favourable geopolitical tailwinds,” he said, pointing to stronger trade and investment opportunities with China, the United States and Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
He stressed that structural reforms were indispensable for achieving sustainable growth.
The minister said the government’s reform agenda covered key areas, including taxation, energy, restructuring of state-owned enterprises, privatisation, rightsizing of the federal government, digital transformation, debt management and pension reforms.
These are the areas consistently highlighted by analysts, think tanks, and our bilateral and multilateral partners, he added.
Increase in tax collection
Meanwhile, FBR Chairman Langrial said the tax-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio increased over the last year by 1.49 per cent, crediting effective measures by the government for the collections.
“The rate of submission of individual tax returns has increased,” he said. “FBR is implementing the tax measures approved in the budget; it has the support of all institutions.”
Power Minister Leghari, while giving an update on the reforms in the power division, said that electricity prices have been reduced by Rs10.50 over the last 18 months. He said the reduction for the industrial units has been to the tune of Rs16 per unit.
“We are also set to operationalise the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM) in January or February next year to facilitate the electricity trading market,” he said.
Describing the move as the biggest reform in the power sector, he said, “This will free the government from the business of purchasing power and the consumers will get better prices of electricity in future.“
Leghari said the government has also reduced the circular debt, with a plan to clear the circular debt of Rs1.2 trillion without putting extra burden on the consumers in the next six years.
Highlighting the importance of digitisation, IT Minister Shaza Fatima said digitisation will provide convenience to people, ensure transparency, and save time. “People will no longer have to stand in queues for payment and transfer of the nation,” Fatima said, adding that people will not be able to hide their transactions
She detailed that digitisation was related to increasing the tax net and has an important role in increasing revenues.
Privatisation adviser Muhammad Ali detailed the progress made for the privatisation of different state-owned enterprises. He highlighted the privatisation of the First Women Bank, adding that the target is to privatise Pakistan International Airlines by the end of the year. He said several top groups of Pakistan are interested in the national flag carrier.
Pakistan faced a prolonged economic crisis over the last few years, marked by critically low foreign exchange reserves, an acute balance-of-payment crisis, and the looming risk of default in 2023. The crisis was averted after the IMF released a crucial loan tranche, while support from friendly countries, including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, also played a key role.
After averting default, Pakistan has undertaken tough IMF-prescribed reforms to stabilise its economy and bolster macroeconomic indicators. This year, global credit rating agencies like Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P Global raised Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating.</p><small>2025-11-03 13:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0318134870b88cc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952932/israeli-prime-minister-backs-bill-to-execute-palestinian-prisoners-official' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli prime minister backs bill to execute Palestinian prisoners: official</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s coordinator for hostages and missing persons said on Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports a bill that would authorise the execution of Palestinian prisoners.
The far-right Jewish Power party, led by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, submitted the bill, which will go to a first reading in the Knesset (Israeli parliament)  on Wednesday.
The draft law states: “The death penalty shall be imposed on any person who intentionally, or through indifference, causes the death of an Israeli citizen out of racist motives, hatred, or intent to harm the State of Israel.”
Bills in Israel must pass three readings in the Knesset to become law.
Israel’s public broadcaster KAN reported that Coordinator Gal Hirsch told the Knesset’s National Security Committee on Monday that Netanyahu had expressed support for the measure. Hirsch said he had previously opposed the bill “because of the risk it posed to the lives of the living hostages in Gaza”.
“The hostages are now alive, and therefore my opposition no longer stands,” he added.
Also on Monday, the Knesset’s National Security Committee approved sending the bill to its first reading, according to a statement from the Jewish Power Party. Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for a law authorising the execution of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
In October, Hamas released 20 Israeli living captives as part of a ceasefire deal brokered under United States President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan.
 
 

More than 10,000 Palestinians are currently held in Israeli prisons, including women and children, and face torture, starvation and medical neglect, according to Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups. Several detainees have died in custody.
Rights organisations say Ben-Gvir has sharply worsened prison conditions, restricting family visits, cutting food rations and limiting prisoners’ access to showers.</p><small>2025-11-03 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031718052d4ebbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952930/pakistan-has-re-established-itself-as-respected-voice-in-regional-intl-forums-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan has re-established itself as respected voice in regional, int’l forums: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that Pakistan had successfully re-established itself as a respected voice in regional and international forums due to the efforts of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“Through the prime minister’s sustained diplomatic outreach, Pakistan has successfully re-established itself as a respected voice in regional and international forums, from the United Nations and SCO to OIC and the World Economic Forum,” said the defence minister addressing a seminar in Islamabad.
He said the government’s current diplomacy reflected a “confident and forward-looking” Pakistan that engaged constructively, built bridges and believed in the power of partnerships.
“These achievements reaffirm a simple truth. When guided by clarity of purpose, coherence of policy and continuity of engagement, Pakistan’s diplomacy becomes its strongest national asset. Ladies and gentlemen, our journey of diplomacy is far from over. The progress we have made is both tangible and inspiring.
“Pakistan’s foreign policy is once again being recognised for its maturity, balance and forward direction.”
Asif added that at the core of Pakistan’s renewed diplomatic activism lay economic diplomacy, guided by the prime minister’s “vision of transforming foreign knowledge”.
The defence minister also lauded the vital role of Pakistan’s ambassadors in diplomatic missions abroad.
“Our envoys have been at the forefront of advancing Pakistan’s vision of global engagement and an economically connected Pakistan. Their tireless efforts in strengthening bilateral ties, facilitating investment, promoting trade and projecting Pakistan’s positive image have significantly contributed to our recent diplomatic success.”
Reiterating the foreign policy successes, he said relations with Saudi Arabia had entered a “new era of mutual confidence and economic cooperation” after the prime minister’s recent engagements reinvigorated strategic cooperation and opened pathways to multi-billion dollar investments in diverse sectors.
He said relations with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates had also deepened, adding that both had expressed interest in expanding their economic footprint in Pakistan.
 
 

With the United States, Asif said Pakistan continues to build a “broad-based and balanced partnership”, adding that recent diplomatic engagements emphasised cooperation in trade, technology, climate resilience and counter-terrorism, along with reaffirming Pakistan’s “constructive role as a bridge between regions and interests”.
The relationship with China, he said, remained an “anchor of regional peace and prosperity”. Asif further said the deepening cooperation with China symbolised a shared vision for connectivity and inclusive growth.
The defence minister added that the outreach to Central Asian republics also represented another “milestone in our diplomacy”.
He said that through active engagement, the prime minister has advanced Pakistan’s role as a gateway for trade and energy transit between Central and South Asia.
“Projects like CASA-1000, TAPI and proposed Trans-Afghan Railway underscore our commitment to regional connectivity, economic integration and shared prosperity.
“In the broader Muslim world, Pakistan has actively sought to revitalise ties with Iran, Turkiye and Egypt. These engagements are grounded in shared faith, mutual respect and collective aspirations for peace and development. Our deepening cooperation with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation further amplifies Pakistan’s diplomatic voice on issues such as Islamophobia, Palestinian rights and humanitarian relief in Gaza and Afghanistan,” he said.
On his first visit to the US in February after the Trump administration took office, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar boasted that Pakistan had broken its diplomatic isolation through active diplomacy, and called for sweeping global reforms and strengthening the UN to create a more inclusive international order.
In remarks made on separate occasions, Dar said Pakistan was no longer isolated in the global community, adding that the country’s economy was set to take off as a result of his government’s hard work.</p><small>2025-11-03 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/03180909af8dea6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952921/lawyers-politicos-assail-27th-amendment-proposal-as-rollback-of-provincial-rights' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers, politicos assail 27th Amendment proposal as rollback of provincial rights</strong></a><br><p>The PPP on Monday said that its coalition partner PML-N has officially sought its support for a proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment — the idea of which had been floated soon after the 26th Amendment.
The development comes even as three dozen petitions challenging most of the 26th Amendment, which had also faced sizeable censure, are pending before the Supreme Court.
According to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, proposals include setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, end of protection for provincial shares under the National Finance Commission and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces.
With the 27th Amendment’s introduction in the parliament now seeming to be on the horizon, the legal fraternity and political circles were quick to raise concerns about the proposed changes in the Constitution.
Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, a former Sindh High Court Bar Association president, noted that the proposed changes seemingly aimed to “dilute federalism through the NFC amendment and rollback of 18th Amendment devolution”.
 
 

The 27th Amendment, he said, also seemed to “alter the civil-military balance by amending” Article 243, and “finish last vestiges of independence in superior courts (through a new court and transfer powers) and in lower courts (executive magistracy)”.
Ahmed said he expected “enthusiastic agreement” between the PPP and the PML-N on the court-related changes, “some disagreement” on the NFC rollback, and “complete capitulation” on Article 243.
 






Reema Omer, legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists, said on X: “None of PML-N’s proposals inspire confidence or give hope that this new wave of constitution-tweaking furthers the vision of a federal republic.
“The 18th Amendment was a constitutional resistance. The proposed 27th Amendment seems to be a complete constitutional surrender,” she said.
 






Advocate Hassan A. Niazi commented, “Complete and utter authoritarian consolidation of Pakistan continues.”
He termed “each proposal worse than the last”, claiming that the public’s view had been “completely sidelined by an undemocratic and illegitimate parliament”.
“The decision has already been made — why pretend on deliberations?” quipped Niazi, a partner at Lahore-based Common Law Chambers (CLC).
 






The PTI, one of the loudest voices against the 26th Amendment, also slammed the government’s wishes to make further tweaks in the Constitution.
Senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser noted that the successors of ex-president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, during whose rule the current 1973 Constitution was passed, and “his own party was bent on disfiguring that same Constitution”.
“The wounds of the 26th Amendment are still fresh, and now the 27th Amendment is being discussed,” Qaiser said. He highlighted that the 1973 Constitution “binds together all units of the state in a beautiful bond”.
“The current parliament is a creation of Form-47s and does not have any moral licence to make a major Constitutional Amendment of this nature,” the former National Assembly speaker said.
The PTI leader called on “all democratic forces of the country to stand united against this illegitimate amendment, else no one will get anything”.
 






Former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra called the proposal a “disaster for the country”. In an indirect reference to the PPP, he said, “Now we will see where all these parties that claimed to be for devolution really stand.”
“How can the entire constitutional structure of a country be changed? No one has a clue, and we just learn through some random tweet by Bilawal?” he wondered in another post.
 






Muzammil Aslam, finance adviser to the KP chief minister, said on X: “Honestly, these amendments require national consensus: [they] need broader consultations for the good of the country.
“Talking about NFC remodelling as KP finance adviser, we are completely blank. We need the proposed draft for consultation,” he added.
 






Other politicians also assailed the proposed changes.
National Democratic Movement (NDM) leader Bushra Gohar termed the 27th Amendment a “rollback” of the 18th Amendment. “What are the proposed amendments to Article 243?” the former MNA wondered.
“In my opinion, the 27th Amendment is a coup against the provinces and a blatant attempt to weaken the federation,” Gohar asserted.
 






“This is dangerous,” said former Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair.
“The ruling regime is now planning to literally scrap the 1973 Constitution. Whatever little was left after 26th Amendment will be taken away through the proposed 27th Amendment.
“Resist now or be ready to remain subservient for the next 10 years,” the former PML-N leader added.
 






Former federal secretary Ahmad Nawaz Sukhera stressed: “An independent, competent and apolitical judiciary is vital for any society … including ‘protecting’ people from the wrath of the state!”
 






Journalists and rights activists were another group expressing their concerns.
“How can such issues of national importance be taken without a thorough public debate in parliament and outside?” asked journalist Munizae Jahangir.
The daughter of late Asma Jahangir added: “We need more transparency in what is being proposed. Without that, you will compromise the freedoms of Pakistanis for generations to come.
“Be careful politicians, you may yet again end up harming yourselves!” cautioned Jahangir, also the co-chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP).
 






Hum News Investigation Editor Zahid Gishkori pointed out that Article 243 of the Constitution, which was proposed to be tweaked, was “about appointment, tenure and extension of armed forces’ heads”.
“Move will likely outline the president’s authority to grant the title of Field Marshal to the prime achiever too,” he added.
 






Dawn journalist Nasir Jamal noted: “This proposal involves a significant rollback of the 18th Amendment, which the PPP has been defending all along. How will they walk back on what they’ve been saying since?
“[Bilawal] and his party are in a tough spot,” he added.

The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Coordination Meeting of Arab-Islamic Foreign Ministers on Gaza, for which Dar arrived in Istanbul earlier in the day.
“The Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Muhammad
Ishaq Dar held a bilateral meeting with the Foreign Minister of Türkiye, H.E. Hakan Fidan, on the sidelines of the Ministerial Meeting on Gaza in Istanbul,” the FO statement said.“
“During the meeting, the ministers expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of Pakistan–Türkiye bilateral relations and reaffirmed their shared commitment to further deepening cooperation across political, economic, and defence spheres.
“Both sides agreed to continue working together on the issue of Palestine, especially establishing sustainable peace in Gaza.”
 






It added that both leaders reaffirmed the strong bonds of brotherhood and mutual support that continue to underpin Pakistan–Türkiye relations and agreed to maintain close coordination on regional and international issues.
Earlier in the day, the FO posted on X that upon arrival, FM Dar was received by Ambassador Ahmet Cemil Miroğlu, Director General of Protocol, as well as officials of the Pakistan Embassy.
 






The talks are to begin at around 11am GMT (4pm Pakistan time) at an Istanbul hotel, with a news conference due several hours later, AFP reported.
Hamas and Israel had signed a ceasefire agreement on October 9, agreeing to free the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. Pakistan was one of the eight Arab and Muslim countries to work with Trump on the plan.
However, despite signing the deal, Tel Aviv has already resumed its attacks on Gaza.
Today’s meeting is expected to bring together the foreign ministers of Türkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan — the same countries that met with Trump on Sept 23 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
AFP, citing Turkish foreign ministry sources, reported that Ankara is set to urge the dignitaries to support plans for Palestinians to take control of Gaza’s security and governance.
 
 

Fidan is expected to “emphasise the importance of coordinated action by Muslim countries for the ceasefire to evolve into a lasting peace”, a Turkish foreign ministry source was quoted as saying by Reuters.
Meanwhile, according to FO’s statement yesterday, Pakistan will emphasise the need for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, especially Gaza.
It will also call for the provision of unfettered humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians and the reconstruction of Gaza, while reiterating the need for an “independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine” based on pre-1967 borders.
Seems Hamas ‘determined’ to stick to truce: Erdogan
Hamas is “determined” to stick to the truce, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said today, adding it was crucial that Muslim nations play a leading role in Gaza’s reconstruction.
“It seems that Hamas is quite determined to adhere to the agreement,” Erdogan told delegates from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) gathered in Istanbul for their annual economic summit.
He stressed it was “essential” that the OIC “play a leading role in the reconstruction of Gaza”.
“At this point, we need to deliver more humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza and then begin reconstruction efforts. […] The Israeli government is doing everything in its power to prevent this,” Erdogan said.
 






On the eve of the meeting, FM Fidan welcomed a Hamas delegation led by its lead negotiator Khalil al-Hayya.
“We must end the massacre in Gaza. A ceasefire in itself is not enough,” Fidan said, arguing for the two-state solution to the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“We should recognise that Gaza should be governed by the Palestinians, and act with caution,” he added.

Separately, the PPP also issued a similar statement that quoted Bilawal as saying that the proposal included setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates and the matter of transfer of judges. It also included the end of protection for the provincial share under the National Finance Commission and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces, the statement further quoted Bilawal as saying.
 






He added that the proposed amendment also included a provision about the return of the subjects of education and population planning to the federation and a point about ending the stalemate regarding appointments to the Election Commission of Pakistan.
Bilawal said a session of the PPP’s central executive committee (CEC) had been called after President Zardari’s return from Doha on November 6 for deciding the party policy on the matter.
A subsequent post by the PPP said the CEC session would be held at Bilawal House in Karachi, where overall political situation in the country would also be discussed.
 






‘Have not properly started working on draft’
Later, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik confirmed while speaking to Geo News that discussions regarding the amendment had been and were still ongoing, adding that, however, they had not properly started working on the preparation of a draft.
Referring to Bilawal’s statement from earlier today, he also outlined the proposal’s salient features and provided brief explanations for their inclusion.
The state minister said the establishment of constitutional courts remained an “unfinished agenda” and also underscored the need for changes regarding the executive magistrate so that the burden on courts could be reduced.
Regarding population explosion, he said the “menace” had to be addressed and it needed a “federal approach”. Similarly, he continued, a lack of cohesion was observed among provinces in the area of education in terms of quality and curriculum.
“And even when we see this matter in the context of terrorism in the country — and there is also an element of radicalisation — I think there should be an oversight at the federal level,” he said, emphasising the need for a uniform and single curriculum across the country.
Moreover, the minister pointed out that it was for the first time after the promulgation of the 1973 Constitution that an official had been elevated to the position of Field Marshal.
Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir was made Field Marshal following a four-day escalation between India and Pakistan in May.
Malik said this development, too, had to be addressed in the constitutional scheme of things and recognised, making a case for amendments to Article 243.
Asked whether the government intended to make amendments to this constitutional provision only with this intent, the state minister replied they had not moved on to the step of fine-tuning things yet.
On the deadlock over the appointment of the chief election commissioner, Malik was asked whether the government intended to end the role of the opposition leader in the process.
To that, he said it was not so, but the deadlock also had to be addressed. “If a situation arises that there is no opposition leader and the process is facing delays [due to that], you have to [find a way out.”
Regarding the inclusion of the National Finance Commission in the proposal, he  acknowledged that it required political consensus, “which we are developing with our allies”.
Moreover, the “present situation also has to be factored in […] and this has to be looked at from two to three different angles”, the minister added.
Changing stances
The government had last year passed a 26th Constitutional Amendment. It was passed by parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
Even though the 26th Amendment remains mired in controversy and faces challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad are abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to the insiders, will further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
In August, however, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar had said during a press conference that the country was “running well” and experiencing stability and economic improvement, adding that there was no need for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Bilawal had also previously dismissed talk of any potential legislation regarding a 27th Amendment as “baseless rumours”.
But, the ruling coalition now seems to be steering in a different direction.
The matter of the proposed legislation had reportedly come up during an Oct 27 meeting between Bilawal and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. The two leaders had met to discuss the prevailing political situation and formulate a joint strategy on key national issues.
JUI-F sources said that the focus of the discussion was to formulate a collective strategy related to new legislation and develop parliamentary cooperation between the PPP and the JUI-F. They claimed that Bilawal had stressed during the meeting the importance of the role of opposition parties in the upcoming legislation.
Meanwhile, opposition PTI has been criticising the proposed amendment.
In June, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) had also endorsed the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges. Speaking at a press conference, IHCBA President Syed Wajid Hussain Gilani had stated that the legal fraternity welcomed the 27th Amendment, which followed the precedent set by the 26th Constitution Amendment.</p><small>2025-11-03 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/03163451dbc4cbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952926/uk-police-charge-british-man-with-10-counts-of-attempted-murder-in-train-attack' target='_blank'><strong>UK police charge British man with 10 counts of attempted murder in train attack</strong></a><br><p>A man has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder following a mass stabbing on a London-bound train, British Transport Police said on Monday.

The 6.3-magnitude quake struck overnight at a depth of 28 kilometres with the epicentre near the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
More than 20 people were killed and around 320 were injured in the provinces of Balkh and Samangan, health ministry spokesman Sharafat Zaman told journalists on Monday morning, stressing that this was a preliminary toll.
He did not provide a province-wide breakdown of the casualties.
 






Expressing sorrow over the “tragic loss of lives in northern Afghanistan after the deadly earthquake near Mazar-e-Sharif”, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X that Pakistan “stands in solidarity with our Afghan brothers and sisters in this difficult hour”.
“Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and prayers for the swift recovery of the injured,” he said.
 






Residents of Mazar-i-Sharif, one of Afghanistan’s largest northern cities, scrambled into the streets due to fears their homes would collapse, an AFP correspondent observed.
The city’s famed Blue Mosque, a 15th-century landmark known for its vibrant tiles, was also damaged, an AFP journalist witnessed.
Pieces of the structure, particularly from one of its minarets, broke off and lay scattered across the mosque’s grounds, one of the country’s few remaining tourist spots.

Correspondents in the capital Kabul, around 420km to the south, also said they felt shaking.
Power supply company DABS said imported electricity lines from Uzbekistan had been cut off due to the earthquake, leaving parts of nine provinces without power, Tolo News reported.
 






The Afghan Taliban defence ministry said parts of Balkh and Samangan provinces were the most affected, resulting in fatalities among a number of citizens.
Military Rescue and emergency assistance teams reached the area immediately and began operations to rescue people, transport the injured, and assist affected families, it said in a statement.
 






The USGS issued an orange alert in its PAGER system, which is an automated system that produces information on the impact of earthquakes, and indicated that “significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread”.
Videos of rescue efforts being carried out to save people trapped under rubble and images of fallen debris in buildings were shared on the social media platform X.
One video showed rescuers pulling what appeared to be dead bodies from rubble. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage and the images.
Active faults
Earthquakes are common in Afghanistan, particularly along the Hindu Kush mountain range, near where the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates meet.
Many homes in the predominantly rural country — devastated by decades of war — are shoddily built.
It often takes hours or days to travel by steep roads and paths to remote villages, which are often cut off from help during disasters or poor weather.
Poor communication networks and infrastructure in mountainous Afghanistan have hampered disaster responses in the past, preventing authorities for hours or even days from reaching far-flung villages to assess the extent of the damage.
It is the latest natural disaster for the Taliban government, which has faced three major deadly earthquakes since taking over Afghanistan in 2021, even as the foreign aid that formed the backbone of the country’s economy has dramatically dropped.
 
 

In August, a shallow 6.0-magnitude quake in the country’s east wiped out mountainside villages and killed more than 2,200 people.
Large tremors in western Herat, near the Iranian border, in 2023, and in eastern Nangarhar province in 2022 killed hundreds and destroyed thousands of homes.
The United Nations and aid agencies have warned that hunger is rising among the Afghan population.
The isolated country is suffering from a humanitarian crisis compounded by drought, economic restrictions on the banking sector, and the pushback of millions of Afghan citizens from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan.

Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi had resigned from the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) over a criminal inquiry into the leaking of a video that allegedly showed soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza conflict. She said that she was stepping down because she had approved the video’s leak in August last year.
In a report on Sunday, the Times of Israel said that Tomer-Yerushalmi was reported missing by her family, which prompted a search by authorities.
“The large search, involving police, rescue forces, and the military, was carried out after she was unreachable for several hours, and her car was later found at Hatzuk Beach near Tel Aviv. Hebrew media outlets reported that she had left a letter at home, which some characterised as a ‘suicide note’,” the publication said.
However, Tomer-Yerushalmi made contact with her husband a few hours later and was found along a beach in the nearby city of Herzliya. She was reportedly taken for a health checkup before being arrested in connection with the video leak, the report added.
The Times of Israel reported that the ex-IDF legal chief had been on leave since a criminal investigation was launched by police last week into the leaking of the surveillance video.
 
 

In a separate report, the publication said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed fury about the video leak, declaring it the “most serious public-relations attack” against Tel Aviv to date.
The incident “caused enormous reputational damage to Israel, to the IDF, and to our soldiers”, he was quoted as saying.
“It is perhaps the most serious public relations attack Israel has experienced since its founding — I cannot recall one so concentrated and intense,” Netanyahu said. “This requires an independent and impartial inquiry, and I expect that such an investigation will indeed take place.”
Video leak
The abuse investigation led to criminal charges against five soldiers and stirred an uproar. The inquiry drew condemnation from right-wing politicians and prompted protesters to storm two military compounds after investigators sought troops for questioning in the case.
A week after the break-in at the bases, a security camera video showing the moments of the alleged abuse was leaked to an Israeli television channel.
It showed soldiers taking a prisoner aside and crowding around while holding a dog and blocking visibility of their actions with their riot gear.
Tomer-Yerushalmi defended her action as an attempt to fend off propaganda against the military’s legal department entrusted with upholding the rule of law, and which she said had been subjected to smears throughout the Gaza conflict.

Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan confirmed the details to Dawn, adding that the incident took place on Miranshah road, which connects Bannu and North Waziristan.
“Armed men open fire at the vehicle of North Waziristan’s DPO,” RPO Khan said. “The DPO remained unhurt,” he added.
He further said the injured police personnel were taken to the Bannu District Headquarters Hospital.
 
 

“The unidentified attackers have hidden in nearby areas and a search operation is underway [to trace them],” the Bannu RPO said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The past few months have seen an escalation in attacks on law enforcement agencies, with police forces in KP being targeted repeatedly.
Yesterday, a station house officer and two other cops were injured in a blast caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) in KP’s Hangu district. Last week, terrorists kidnapped a police official from Bannu’s Havaid Adda area.
 
 

Separately, the Bannu police on Friday also claimed to have recovered Constable Noor Zaman, who had been kidnapped by terrorists in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali town. The cop was on his way to attend the last rites of his brother, Constable Javed Khan, who had been martyred in a gun attack in Bannu.
Faced with the heightened militancy, security forces have also intensified counter-terrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
Militants in Pakistan suffered their heaviest losses in 10 years during the month of October as security forces intensified operations against them, according to a report by the think-tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p><small>2025-11-03 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031212330679f3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952912/they-do-not-talk-about-it-trump-claims-pakistan-among-countries-testing-nuclear-weapons' target='_blank'><strong>‘They do not talk about it’: Trump claims Pakistan among countries testing nuclear weapons</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump has included Pakistan among countries that he claims are “testing nuclear weapons”, saying that he did not want the US to be the only country that does not do so.
“North Korea has been testing. Pakistan has been testing. […] But they don’t go and tell you about it,” he said in an interview on CBS News programme ‘60 Minutes’, where he was asked about his recent directives to the Pentagon to resume testing nuclear weapons. He also named Russia and China as testing nuclear weapons.
In a recent social media post, Trump had instructed the US Department of War to resume testing nuclear weapons “immediately”. Confusion has surrounded Trump’s order that the US begin testing, particularly if he meant conducting the country’s first nuclear explosion since 1992.
When the matter was brought up during the interview, Trump said: “Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. I think we should do something about denuclearisation. And I did actually discuss that with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Xi.
“We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world a 150 times. Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot,” he said.
At this point, he was interrupted by the interviewer, who asked, “So why do we have to test our nuclear weapons?”
“Well, because you have to see how they work,” replied Trump. “Testing is because Russia announced that they are gonna do a test. If you notice, North Korea is testing constantly, other countries are testing. We are the only country that doesn’t test, I don’t want to be the only country that doesn’t test.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

He was then asked to clarify whether he was saying that the US would start detonating nuclear weapons after more than 30 years.
He replied, “I am saying that we are going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do.”
But the only country that was testing nuclear weapons was North Korea, the interviewer pointed out. Russia and China have not carried out such tests since 1990 and 1996, respectively.
To that, Trump said Russia and China, too, were testing nuclear weapons. “You just don’t know about it.”
When the interviewer pointed out that Russia’s recent test was that of a delivery system for nuclear weapons, which was essentially a missile, Trump asserted: “Russia is testing, and China is testing, but they don’t talk about it.”
He added: “We are an open society. We are different, we talk about it. We have to talk about it. Because, otherwise, you people are going to report. They don’t have reporters who can be writing about it. We do.
“We are gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea has been testing. Pakistan has been testing. […] But they don’t go and tell you about it. And as powerful as they are — you know it’s a big world, you don’t necessarily know where they are testing. They test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening with the test. You feel a little bit of a vibration.
“They test, and we don’t test. We have to test. And Russia did make a, you know, little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China does test, and we are gonna test also.”
Trump went on to say: “This just doesn’t make sense. You know, you make nuclear weapons and then you don’t test. How are you gonna do that? How are you gonna know if they work? We have to do that.”
Dawn has reached out to the Foreign Office for a comment on Trump’s assertion that Pakistan is among the countries that are testing nuclear weapons.
During the conversation on ‘60 Minutes’, the interviewer also remarked that “apparently, we don’t need to test our nuclear weapons because they are the best in the world, according to experts I have spoken to”.
To that, Trump replied: “According to me, we have the best. And I was the one that renovated them and built them during a four-year period, and I hated to do that. Because the destructive capability is something you don’t even want to talk about. But if other people are gonna have them, we are gonna have to have them.
“And if we have them, we have to test them. Otherwise, you don’t really know how they are gonna work. And we don’t want to ever use them.”
‘Responsible nuclear-weapons state’
Asked about Trump’s comments on Monday, China’s foreign ministry denied conducting nuclear weapons tests.
As a “responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always … upheld a self-defence nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing”, spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference in Beijing.
She added that China hoped the US would “take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability”.

The event is being held from today to November 6 (Thursday) at Karachi’s Expo Centre, and will see the participation of 45 countries, including Pakistan. It has been organised under the overall responsibility of the Pakistan Navy and with the support and patronage of federal and provincial departments.
Addressing PIMEC, Iqbal highlighted that Pakistan had a unique geography as the regions of South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa converged here, which positioned the country as a “natural maritime bridge between the East and the West”.
However, despite these advantages, the maritime sector contributed less than 1pc to Pakistan’s GDP, compared to 4-7pc in several other maritime nations, he lamented.
 


The planning minister pointed out that Pakistan had a coastline of over 1,000 kilometres, an exclusive economic zone of nearly 290,000 square kilometres, and “vast offshore potential” in renewable energy, fisheries and mineral resources.
Noting that the government’s Uraan Pakistan plan aimed to transform Pakistan into a $1tr economy by 2035, Iqbal underscored the importance of the 5Es framework — exports; e-Pakis­tan; equity and empo­werment; environment, and climate change; and energy and infrastructure.
He further said the government had identified “eight key drivers of export-led growth” — agriculture and food processing, manufacturing and industry, information technology and digital services, mines and minerals, manpower and skills export, creative and cultural industries, services sector and tourism, and blue economy.
“In this age of interconnectedness, the oceans have re-emerged as the highways of global commerce, energy and communication, and these nations that harness them wisely are shaping the future of economic power,” Iqbal said.
“The world’s prosperity literally sails on the seas,” the minister noted. Citing the United Nations Trade and Development (Unctad), he highlighted that over 80 per cent of the global trade by volume, and 70pc by value, is carried by sea.
He further said that the global blue economy contributes more than $2.5 trillion annually to the world’s GDP and sustains over 350 million jobs across shipping, ports, fisheries, coastal tourism and other areas.
 
 

During his address, Iqbal termed the spirit of the modern blue economy as seeking God’s “bounty through trade, innovation and exploration while being grateful and responsible stewards of his creation”.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also attended today’s inaugural ceremony.
Terming PIMEC a “great opportunity”, CM Shah said in a statement that the event brings together national and international maritime business leaders, as well as opens new investment doors.
“Sindh government is committed to promoting maritime trade, strengthening ties all over the world,” he asserted.
 






PIMEC’s 2025 edition features 150 local and 28 global exhibitors.
Representatives from 44 countries — such as the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, China, Egypt and Turkiye — are set to attend the event as part of 133 international delegations from Europe, Asia, North and South America, and the Far East.
Experts have said Pakistan’s maritime sector could contribute over $100 billion annually to the national economy and called for urgent action to unlock its potential.</p><small>2025-11-03 08:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/030722081b27fe5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952877/self-rule-for-gaza-tops-istanbul-moot-agenda-today' target='_blank'><strong>‘Self-rule for Gaza’ tops Istanbul moot agenda today</strong></a><br><p>• Summit of Muslim bloc foreign ministers will ‘come down hard on Israel’ over ceasefire violations
• Pakistan to demand complete Israeli withdrawal, unfettered provision of aid to Palestinians
ISLAMABAD: Turkiye is expected to push for ensuring the security and administration of Gaza by Palestinians, as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar joins his counterparts from the eight-nation Muslim bloc, suing for peace in the besieged Palestinian territory, for a summit in Istanbul today (Monday).
The Coordination Meeting of Arab-Islamic Foreign Ministers is expected to take up the Gaza ceasefire deal, piloted by US President Donald Trump.
However, the truce, which left thorny issues like the disarmament of Hamas and a timeline for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza unresolved, has been tested by unilateral Israeli bombardment since coming into force.
The Istanbul meeting is expected to bring together the foreign ministers of Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan — the same countries that met with US President Donald Trump on Sept 23, on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
At the foreign ministers’ meeting, Turkiye’s Hakan Fidan is expected to “emphasise the importance of coordinated action by Muslim countries for the ceasefire to evolve into a lasting peace,” Reuters quoted a Turkish foreign ministry source as saying on Sunday.
The source said Mr Fidan is set to tell the meeting that Israel is “making excuses” to end the ceasefire and emphasise the need for the international community to “take a resolute stance against Israel’s provocative actions”.
He was also set to say that humanitarian aid entering Gaza is insufficient and Israel has not fulfilled its obligations in this regard.
According to TRT World, Mr Fidan is anticipated to stress the need to swiftly implement arrangements that would allow Palestinians to assume responsibility for Gaza’s security and administration, while safeguarding their legitimate rights and upholding the vision of a two-state solution.
He will also highlight the importance of maintaining consultations and close coordination on steps to be taken within UN platforms, the sources added.
Relations between Turkiye and Israel have hit new lows during the Gaza war, with President Tayyip Erdogan harshly criticising Israel’s attacks. It was Turkiye that helped persuade Hamas to accept Trump’s peace plan, and Ankara has expressed willingness to take part in the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), proposed to monitor ceasefire implementation in Gaza.
However, Israel has made it clear that it won’t accept the presence of Turkish armed forces in Gaza. Other nations part of troop contribution talks include Jordan, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan.
Top-level consultations are said to be underway over the question of sending Pakistani troops for the proposed ISF, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon.
However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the United Nations umbrella.
On Saturday, the Jordanian and German foreign ministers had called for a UN mandate for the proposed ISF, saying it would “need a clear basis in international law”.
Pakistan’s stance
During the Istanbul meeting, Pakistan will emphasise the need for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, especially Gaza, as well as the provision of unfettered humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians and the reconstruction of Gaza, a statement from the Foreign Office said.
 






Pakistan has remained engaged with the peace initiative that led to the signing of the Gaza Peace Agreement in Sharm El-Sheikh, the FO said.
“Pakistan will also reiterate the need for collective efforts aimed at achieving an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders, in accordance with relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative,” the FO added.
Pakistan has been, and will continue to be, committed to efforts to restore peace, justice, and dignity to the Palestinian people, as well as to ensure the realisation of their right to self-determination, the statement said.

A deal under which Islamabad will take delivery of eight Hangor-class submarines by 2028 is “progressing smoothly,” Admiral Ashraf told the Global Times in an interview published on Sunday, adding that the successful launch of the second and third submarines in China earlier this year was a major milestone for naval collaboration between the two countries.
Admiral Ashraf further said that the project was not only significant for the advancement of the Pakistan Navy’s submarine force capabilities, but would also contribute toward self-reliance through transfer of technology and skill development at Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works, according to the report.
He said that the Type 054A/P frigates marked another major achievement in China-Pakistan naval cooperation. The publication reported that such multirole frigates were already in service with the Pakistan Navy, quoting Admiral Ashraf as saying that they are “among the most advanced surface combatants”.
Admiral Ashraf also told the Global Times that these Chinese-made frigates had greatly strengthened the navy’s multi-mission capability, particularly in air defence, anti-submarine warfare and maritime surveillance.
“These platforms are playing a key role in ensuring maritime security in the North Arabian Sea and the broader Indian Ocean region, which is critical for global economy,” he was quoted as saying.
The update on the Chinese submarine deal follows the Pakistan Air Force using Chinese-made J-10 fighter jets in May to shoot down an Indian Air Force Rafale aircraft, made by France.
The altercation between the nuclear-armed neighbours surprised many in the military community and raised questions over the superiority of Western hardware over Chinese alternatives.
 
 

Under the terms of the submarine agreement — reportedly worth up to $5 billion — the first four diesel-electric attack submarines will be built in China, with the remaining vessels assembled in Pakistan to improve the nation’s technical capabilities.
Pakistan has already launched three of the submarines into China’s Yangtze River from a shipyard in the central province of Hubei.
“Chinese-origin platforms and equipment have been reliable, technologically advanced and well-suited to Pakistan Navy’s operational requirements,” Admiral Ashraf told the Global Times, adding that the navy’s experience with them had been positive, both in terms of performance and technical support.
“As modern warfare evolves, emerging technologies such as unmanned systems, artificial intelligence and advanced electronic warfare systems are becoming increasingly important. The Pakistan Navy is focusing on these technologies and exploring collaboration with China,” Ashraf was quoted as saying.
Islamabad has long been Beijing’s top arms customer, and over the 2020-2024 period bought over 60 per cent of China’s weapons exports, data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.
On the topic of China-Pakistan naval cooperation in the future, Admiral Ashraf said the Pakistan Navy’s partnership with China was built on deep-rooted friendship, mutual respect, trust and shared strategic interests.
“In the coming decade, we expect this relationship to grow, encompassing not only shipbuilding and training, but also enhanced interoperability, research, technology sharing and industrial collaboration,“ he was quoted as saying.
“There is immense potential for cooperation in advanced technologies, unmanned systems, marine scientific research and maritime industry development. Together, we aim to ensure a secure and stable maritime environment that supports regional peace and prosperity,” he further said, adding that China has been a “trusted partner in the Pakistan Navy’s modernisation journey”.
He further said that the introduction of advanced frigates and submarines had significantly enhanced the Pakistan Navy’s operational reach, multi-domain war fighting capabilities, and deterrence posture, the publication reported.
He said that these platforms, along with joint training and exercises with China, had deepened the two sides’ professional synergy and strengthened interoperability at sea, noting that “this cooperation goes beyond hardware; it reflects a shared strategic outlook, mutual trust, and a long-standing partnership”.</p><small>2025-11-03 05:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0309374228506b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952828/2-booked-for-human-trafficking-after-newborn-taken-away-from-destitute-mother-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>2 booked for human trafficking after newborn taken away from destitute mother in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Two women employees of a private medical facility in Malir — including a doctor — have been booked for human trafficking after they took away a newborn whose family could not afford the medical expenses of the childbirth.
Police said that the baby, who was later sold to someone in Punjab, had been recovered and returned to his parents, while the health facility had been sealed.
On Nov 1, Sarang Khan, the newborn child’s father, lodged a case with Memon Goth police under sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act 2018 and 34 Section of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Memon Goth police officer Fayaz Jokhio told Dawn on Sunday that the baby boy had been recovered from Lahore. “Raids are being held to arrest the nominated suspects,” he added.
In the FIR, Mr Khan told the police he was a resident of a village in Nooriabad and a labourer by trade. His wife (Maheen) was pregnant and she left for her parents’ home after developing some differences with him around three to four months ago.
She was taken to a private clinic in Murad Memon Goth on October 5 by her mother Mrs Shahnaz to deliver the baby.
After the medical check-up, a doctor suggested an operation and asked them to make the required payment.
When Mrs Shahnaz said that they were poor and did not have the money to bear the cost of the operation, the doctor allegedly told them of a woman who would “help the poor and adopt their children”, while also paying for medical expenses.
The complainant claimed that his wife and mother-in-law agreed to this proposal, and the baby boy was handed over to the woman, who turned out to be another employee at the same medical facility.
The complainant claimed that his wife and his mother-in-law kept the incident from him, adding that he came to know through relatives that he was blessed with a male child, but he had been given up for adoption at the hospital.

A source in the Prime Minister’s Office told Dawn that the findings had been submitted to the premier in a sealed envelope, who is likely to decide the fate of the probe in “a day or so”.
In August, the PM had suspended eight senior Nat­ional Highway Authority (NHA) officials and for­med a committee to probe irregularities in the award of the contract, including ghost tendering, by the authority.
The inquiry committee included retired federal secretary Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmed as its convener, the commerce division secretary; retired NHA member Mukhtar Ahmed Durrani, retired chief engineer Akbar Ali, and a planning commission member.
The committee was asked to review NHA’s current practices related to blacklisting contractors; examine whether the NHA undertook due diligence during the opening of technical bids of Carec Tranche-III project; assess whether the NHA conducted the grievance redressal in the instant process in a transparent and judicious manner; evaluate all stages in the award of the project so far to ascertain unnecessary delays, if any; suggest a way forward on the current process; and review any other matter ancillary to the above.

Panel tasked with probing NHA’s current practices related to blacklisting contractors, evaluating award of project

The PMO source said nobody except the inquiry committee was aware of their decision.
The Economic Affairs Division committee, however, had recently questioned how the PM’s inquiry committee would reach a decision, given that the National Highway Authority had failed to provide relevant documents to the Senate committee for the past four months.
The Carec Tranche-III project has also come under scrutiny in five standing committees of the Senate and the National Assembly and the Public Procu­rement Regulatory Authority (PPRA).
In September, the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Division recommended blacklisting a joint venture of three firms, which were awarded a project by the National Highway Authority in violation of the rules.
The Senate panel meeting also recommended sending a letter to the donor Asian Development Bank to apprise them that the bids were “technically invalid and were manipulated due to the mala fide intention of the NHA officials and contractors”.
Carec is an Asian Development Bank-supported initiative which was created in 1997 to encourage economic cooperation among countries in the Central Asian region. Tranche I, II and III road projects are underway or have been completed. Tranche-III has four lots as Lot-1 (58km road from Rajanpur to Jampur), Lot-2 (64km from Jampur to DG Khan), Lot-3 (112km from DG Khan to Tibbi Qaisrani), and Lot-4 (96km from Tibbi Qaisrani to DI Khan).

Party leaders formally filed a representation against the bill, which has been sent to the president, prime minister, Punjab governor, chief minister and other senior officials.
PTI leader Ijaz Shafi said on Sunday the bill would be challenged in the LHC, along with a request for a stay order. He said objections have been prepared with the assistance of lawyers.
The representation has been submitted by Sheikh Imtiaz Mahmood, Ijaz Shafi, Muneer Ahmad and Mian Shabbir Ismail.
According to the text of the representation, several provisions of the bill are in conflict with Articles 17, 32 and 140-A of the Constitution.
PTI leaders have expressed strong reservations about the non-party-based, one-vote, multi-member union council model, saying that the non-party system would weaken the role of political parties and place administrative officers in control rather than elected local representatives, undermining local government powers.
They said the centralisation of financial powers goes against the spirit of local autonomy, while the authority to appoint administrators for an indefinite period is unconstitutional.
They demanded the restoration of direct elections for union council chairmen, the establishment of a fixed five-year tenure and a clear election schedule for local governments and strict restrictions on executive interference and administrators’ powers.
The bill was passed in mid-October.

• Oman urges Tehran and Washington to resume stalled nuclear talks
TEHRAN: Iran said on Sunday that it would rebuild nuclear sites damaged by Israeli and US strikes “stronger than bef­ore”, as mediator Oman urged Tehran and Washi­ngton to revive stalled diplomacy.
US President Donald Trump has said the strikes obliterated Iran’s nuclear programme, but the full extent of the actual damage remains unknown.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a visit to the country’s nuclear organisation, said Tehran “will build (the destroyed sites) stronger than before”.
“By destroying buildings… we will not be set back,” he said in a video posted to his official website, adding that Iranian scientists still had the necessary nuclear know-how.
Pezeshkian did not elaborate. In similar remarks in February before the strikes, he said Tehran would rebuild its sites if they came under attack.
Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran in June, kicking off a 12-day war that saw it target nuclear and military facilities — as well as residential areas — and kill many top scientists.
Iran retaliated with ballistic missile barrages aimed at Israeli cities.
Iranian Foreign Mini­ster Abbas Araghchi said in July, after the United States announced a halt in fighting, that the damage in Iran was “serious and severe”.
Pezeshkian’s comments came as Oman, Iran’s traditional intermediary, urged the two countries on Saturday to resume talks.
“We want to return to the negotiations between Iran [and] the United Sta­tes,” Omani Foreign Mini­ster Badr Albusaidi said at the IISS Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain.
Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said Sunday that Tehran “has received messages” on resuming diplomacy, without providing further details.
Oman hosted five rounds of US-Iran talks this year. Just three days before the sixth round, Israel launched its strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Iran has since faced the return of UN sanctions after Britain, Germany and France triggered the “snapback” mechanism over Tehran’s alleged non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.

According to a police official, Saqib, a team was conducting a search operation in Paracha grav­yard near the Karbogha area when the remote-controlled explosion occur­red, leaving SHO Imran­uddin, Head Constable Jihad Ali and Abid Ali injured.
All three were later provided treatment  Hangu’s district headquarters hospital.
The attack followed a threat alert issued on Fri­day by the federal interior ministry in Islamabad. The alert had cautioned that a  motorcycle lad­en with explosives might be used to strike a police checkpoint or security officials between the Hangu and Orakzai districts.
The alert had urged concerned authorities to heighten security in the area.
IED expert killed
Meanwhile, security forces eliminated Abu Dujana, an Afghan national identified as a specialist bombmaker, during an intelligence-led raid in Tank district’s Lali Khel area.
The operation, which saw two or three militants escape despite sustaining injuries, yielded a significant cache of weaponry including a 30kg IED, which was promptly neutralised, and a suicide vest, grenades, small arms and ammunition, according to sources.
Kalat bridge bomb defused
Separately in Balochistan, locals helped avert potential disaster by alerting authorities to explosives planted beneath a bridge in Kalat district’s Johan area.
Security forces rushed to the site and defused the 10-kilogram device, which a senior levies official described as “locally manufactured” and intended to destroy critical infrastructure in the Johan sub-tehsil.
He added that a further investigation is underway.

• Qaiser says party ‘willing to talk to anyone’ if fair polls assured
• Ismail says no ‘minus-Imran formula’
LAHORE/ISLAM­ABAD: Even as its founder remains locked up, and the party continues to lose ground, some former PTI members seem to have taken it upon themselves to end the isolation faced by their erstwhile party, proposing talks with the government and other parties to bring down political temperatures and pave the way for Imran Khan’s release.
Only a day ago, a number of ex-PTI leaders, including former information minister Fawad Chaudhry and ex-Sindh governor Imran Ismail, had called on party vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a Lahore hospital, ostensibly to seek his blessing for their campaign — an offer Mr Qureshi did not endorse, as per his lawyer.
On Sunday, Mr Chaudhry doubled down on his quest to revive the fortunes of the PTI, even as senior party leaders like Asad Qaiser maintained that both the party and its founder “will not compromise on their principles” even if they engage in a dialogue.
Speaking to Dawn, Fawad Chaudhry acknowledged that he and his colleagues did not have a mandate to engage with the government on behalf of the PTI. However, as a concerned citizen, he said he wanted the volatile political climate to stabilise.
According to the ex-PTI leader, his group will meet the National Assembly speaker and the Senate chairman next week to ask them to play a role in defusing political tensions.
He claimed that most seasoned PTI politicians and more than 15 MPAs had approached him to express their agreement that a government-PTI engagement was “highly necessary”. He urged the government to take the first step towards de-escalation by offering relief to imprisoned senior PTI leaders.
“If the government gives relief to the incarcerated Lahore and Gujranwala leaders, then these leaders could engage with the jailed Khan and lead a process of engagement,” he explained. “Imran Khan’s mandate is with the party leaders, who have been in jails for the past two years,” he acknowledged, referring to people like Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Dr Yasmin Rashid.
“If the government does not leave any stake for the opposition in the system, the opposition will be left with no option but to hold long marches, resign from assemblies and resort to other modes of protest,” he rued.
It may be noted that the government and opposition held a series of talks in the recent past, which did not prove fruitful.
“Until the three major players —Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari – and the establishment engage with the incarcerated seasoned politicians, no political engagement will be possible in a volatile situation,” he added.
Speaking about his “meeting” with Mr Qureshi and Ejaz Chaudhry, he said he planned to take these leaders on board in light of their letters from jail in which they had urged the party chief for dialogue to break the political deadlock. The incarcerated leaders had written a letter to their jailed chief to consider a dialogue with other political parties instead of insisting on only talking to the military establishment.
Downplaying overtures
On the other hand, former NA speaker and PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser played down the recent overtures by his former party colleagues, saying they would be prepared to talk only if the “stolen mandate” was returned to the “true representatives”.
“The fact is that we have been suggesting for years that the PTI is ready to talk to everyone only if justice is provided to the party without creating any hurdles,” Mr Qaiser told Dawn.
“We just want the court cases to be decided on merit. We are willing to talk with anyone about deciding the modalities of the next election and assurances that the next election will be free and fair,” he said.
When asked if it was correct that some party leaders wanted to “streamline” the issues with the establishment, but were reluctant due to Imran Khan, Mr Qaiser said that some individuals may have their personal opinions, but it was not the party policy. “During party meetings, it is categorically stated that there will not be any compromise on principles,” he said.
However, Fawad Chaudhry said the PTI leadership had failed to create any breakthrough to get Imran Khan out of jail during the past two years. He claimed that he had told Mr Khan that many politicians in the party had vested interests attached to his imprisonment and they would make no efforts to help him get out of jail.
No ‘minus formula’
His colleague Imran Ismail dispelled the impression that they were working on a ‘minus Imran formula’ and termed their outreach campaign an “effort to move Pakistan’s politics away from confrontation”.
“We privately consulted a number of PTI stalwarts. Almost all admitted that confrontation has failed and that reconciliation is the only way forward,” he said in a lengthy statement posted on X (formerly Twitter).
 






“When we met Chaudhry Ejaz in Kot Lakhpat Jail and Shah Mehmood Qureshi at PKLI, both — while firmly standing with Khan — agreed that the stalemate must end. They sought normal political breathing space, not surrender,” he said.
He said if any PTI leader believed that “continuing agitation and confrontation is the right path, he should come forward and convince the rest of us who think otherwise”.

• Calls for deeper reforms to cut energy, input costs
ISLAMABAD: The World Bank has asked Pakistan to improve its skewed preferential trade agreements with 10 bilateral partners, ensure a market-determined and flexible exchange rate and push deeper reforms to lower energy and other input costs to turbocharge over three decades of declining exports for sustainable economic growth.
In a policy advice to the government, the bank observed that nearly all countries that have achieved rapid and durable growth have done so by tapping into global markets, but Pakistan has struggled to follow this path.
“Exports have declined from 16 per cent of GDP in the 1990s to just around 10pc in 2024, with the export basket still concentrated in low-value textile and agricultural products,” it said, adding that economic upturns had been fuelled instead by debt and remittance-financed consumption, rather than export dynamism.
 
 

The Washington-based lending agency has asked Pakistan to maintain a flexible exchange rate to ensure export competitiveness and complement tariff reform.
“Allow the emergence of a deep and liquid interbank market without SBP [State Bank of Pakistan] intermediation and encourage greater participation from a diverse range of market players, including exporters, importers and foreign investors,” it said.
It also demanded the publication of detailed data on interbank market transactions, including volumes and participants and phase out ad hoc interventions by the central bank, allowing the exchange rate to reflect genuine supply and demand.
It noted that as growth accelerates and is fuelled by higher imports, foreign exchange reserves are strained, particularly when the exchange rate is tightly managed, triggering recurrent balance-of-payment crises. This cycle of boom and bust has undermined investor confidence, constrained private investment and eroded the foundations of long-term sustainable growth.
 
 

Underlying this weak export performance are deep-seated productivity and competitiveness challenges, it said. Distor­tionary policies, such as high tariff barriers, increased input costs and consumer prices, driving up production costs and encouraging firms to focus on protected local markets.
Simultaneously, excessive and redundant red tape and regulation, and a heavy state presence in the economy (including more than 200 state-owned enterprises at the federal level) have undermined efficiency, deterred investment, and distorted resource allocation, as exporters face major constraints on  access to finance.
On top of that, the costs of customs management and logistics are high, and government-supported measures to assist firms in accessing foreign export markets have often been insufficient, including in negotiating trade deals, establishing a system to support
export market compliance, and promoting Pakistan’s exports abroad.
Therefore, fundamental constraints to firm productivity remain unaddressed, including the exorbitant cost of electricity and limited access to core digital infrastructure.
“In combination, these challenges have led to missing exports of close to $60 billion,” the World Bank said and advised a large set of reforms, including deepening preferential free trade agreements for expanding markets.
The bank said free or preferential agreements with other countries serve as a critical lever for strengthening competitiveness and market access by reducing barriers and addressing trade facilitation issues, such as customs procedures, standards and investment integration, thereby creating an enabling environment for exporters to expand and diversify.
But these agreements, in the case of Pakistan, remained underutilised, leading to missed opportunities. “Pakistan remains party to only 10 trade agreements, most of which are shallow and limited to tariff liberalisation on a narrow set of goods,” it said. The China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement covers a larger share of areas, including tariffs, investment and trade facilitation, while agreements with Malaysia, Sri Lanka and the South Asian Free Trade Agreement remain partial in scope,” the bank pointed out. This leaves Pakistan behind its aspirational peers, which leverage a greater number and depth of agreements to embed themselves in global value chains and attract investment. “Deepening existing trade agreements and expanding coverage under those agreements to services, non-tariff measures and investment will be key,” it said.
The World Bank asked the government to enhance the capacity of the negotiation unit through targeted training, ensure regular consultations with exporters and industry to align agreements with business opportunities and establish mechanisms to monitor implementation and performance of trade agreements.
It also suggested active exploration of avenues to upgrade existing shallow preferential trade agreements towards deeper agreements covering services, investment and digital trade, including those with non-traditional export markets in regions with export potential, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.
The bank welcomed recent tariff reforms but said they needed to be complemented by a flexible exchange rate, full operationalisation of the EXIM Bank of Pakistan, stronger trade facilitation and broader structural reforms to boost export competitiveness.
