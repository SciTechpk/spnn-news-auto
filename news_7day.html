<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0515334353bbdbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971238/kp-apex-committee-deems-cooperation-with-centre-political-parties-vital-for-successful-counter-terrorism-policy' target='_blank'><strong>KP apex committee deems ‘cooperation’ with Centre, political parties vital for successful counter-terrorism policy</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa apex committee has termed “consultation, cooperation and coordination” with the federal government and all political parties “essential” for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy, it emerged on Thursday.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi chaired his first meeting of the provincial apex committee since assuming office on Wednesday.
The panel discussed the “general rise in terrorism incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and an action plan to eradicate the menace of Fitna-al-Khawarij and establish complete peace and stability”, as per a press release issued by the KP CM’s office today.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
During the meeting, the press release said, the committee agreed that “joint consultation, mutual cooperation, and practical coordination between all political parties, public representatives, and the federal government is essential for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy”.
The meeting was attended by provincial ministers, the Peshawar corps commander, the chief secretary and the KP inspector general. Senior civil, military and law enforcement officials were also present.







The apex committee “firmly resolved that the KP government will utilise all its resources, including the armed forces, police, CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department) and other institutions, to combat terrorism and will not hesitate to make any sacrifices”.
The committee hoped that the “long-term strategy would identify all the causes of terrorism and eliminate them, and as a result, ensure the restoration of public confidence so that the government and the public” can work together for the country’s progress.
“The KP government’s agenda is that only good governance and public interest can unite the nation against terrorism,” read the meeting’s press release.
Under this agenda, it was decided that in the “first phase, areas affected by terrorism will be converted into model good governance districts”.
It further said “all government resources will be utilised to compensate for the lack in the provision of development, social services and economic growth” in terrorism-afflicted areas.
The committee also announced a “special package to provide security, communication, health, education, employment, basic amenities and other services in these areas under an organised programme”.
“The forum decided that the government will ensure complete care, rehabilitation, and the provision of basic needs for the welfare of the people affected in the areas where temporary relocation took place for sustainable stability, so that this temporary difficulty can form the base for peace, development and prosperity in the future,” the statement read.
“Their dignified return is a top priority for the [KP] government,” it stressed.
The federal and KP governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists.

 

Speaking during the meeting, CM Afridi stressed that the provincial government “will not make any compromise on peace” in the province.
He asserted that the “civil government, authorities, armed forces, and other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are on the same page for law and order and will continue their joint efforts”.
He reiterated that the fight against terrorism was a “collective one and can only be won through joint efforts”.
The statement comes days after CM Afridi met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, where the two discussed issues related to KP’s finances and counterterrorism.

 

On counter-terrorism, PM Shehbaz had termed the KP government’s cooperation in establishing peace in the province as “unavoidable”.
“There is a need to improve the provincial government’s efforts to establish law and order,” he said, urging the KP government to strengthen provincial departments to combat terrorism.
Affirming that both the Centre and the provincial government would continue their efforts to combat militancy, the premier said the KP administration should fulfil its constitutional duties to ensure peace and public welfare.
The PTI-led KP government and the Centre have mostly been at odds over counter-terrorism policies in the province, particularly military operations, with the former objecting to “decisions taken behind closed doors”.
CM Afridi has repeatedly called for a “policy shift” and urged the inclusion of the provincial government in counter-terrorism policy-making.

 

The debate on the right approach to establish law and order comes on the heels of heightened militancy.
According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.</p><small>2026-02-05 12:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/05171328f0e683a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971243/indian-police-investigate-suspected-suicide-of-3-young-sisters' target='_blank'><strong>Indian police investigate suspected suicide of 3 young sisters</strong></a><br><p>Indian police said on Thursday that an investigation had been launched into the suspected suicide of three young sisters over concerns that they were heavily “influenced” by online games and movies that they were later denied access to.
Local media reported the sisters — aged 12, 14 and 16 — had jumped from their home on Wednesday in the city of Ghaziabad on the outskirts of New Delhi.
Concern among experts and regulators has grown in recent years that too much screen time and addictive algorithms are harming child development, sparking authorities, including in India, to push for social media bans for children and teens.
“[An] investigation is underway based on the suicide note and their phones,” Nimish Patil, a senior police official, told AFP on Thursday.
Police in India routinely investigate the factors leading up to suspected suicides.
The sisters had been “denied access” to K-Pop music and Korean games and movies that they had previously played and watched online.
“They were influenced by Korean culture: K-pop music, games and movies,” Patil said.
He added that the family also appeared to be under financial distress.
Their father had recently taken away their devices and barred them from watching Korean dramas and playing online games, The Indian Express newspaper reported.
AFP could not immediately reach family members for comment.
Korean culture has surged in popularity, especially among young people, in India over the past decades, beginning with rapper Psy’s 2012 hit “Gangnam Style” and expanding through K-pop and streaming platforms packed with Korean dramas.
The case has sparked debate in India with intense media coverage highlighting concerns about young people’s skyrocketing online exposure deepening mental health vulnerabilities.
Two Indian states recently said they were preparing the ground for banning children from using social media.
Internationally, governments have been exploring social media restrictions for children and teenageers, led by Australia, which banned the networks for under-16s in December.
French lawmakers in the country’s lower house last month passed a bill that if confirmed by its Senate will ban social media use by under-15s and bar mobile phones from high schools.</p><small>2026-02-05 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/05154227aef2662.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971201/kashmir-solidarity-day-pakistani-leadership-reaffirms-support-for-kashmiris-just-struggle' target='_blank'><strong>Kashmir Solidarity Day: Pakistani leadership reaffirms support for Kashmiris’ just struggle</strong></a><br><p>The nation is observing Kashmir Solidarity Day today with a renewed pledge to support the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination.
The day will feature rallies, demonstrations and seminars throughout the country. Human chains will also be formed at all entry points of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
One-minute silence was observed across the country at 10am to pay homage to the martyrs of the Kashmir freedom movement, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.



In his message to mark the occasion, President Asif Ali Zardari reiterated Pakistan’s steadfast moral, diplomatic and political support for the Kashmiri people, reaffirming their “inalienable right to self-determination” as enshrined in the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).
The president said the people of Pakistan across the globe stand united with their Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their just struggle.
He recalled that the observance of Kashmir Solidarity Day was initiated 36 years ago by ex-premier Benazir Bhutto following the historic Kashmiri uprising of 1989, a movement that continues to this day.
President Zardari urged the international community to press India to end human rights violations in held Kashmir.
He said India had intensified efforts to entrench its control through “administrative and legislative measures, curbing media freedoms, incarcerating Kashmiri leadership and attempting to alter the demographic composition of the territory”.
The president also highlighted what he described as grave human rights violations by Indian occupation forces, citing international reports that point to a rise in arbitrary detentions, collective punishment and punitive house demolitions.
He added that the “suppression of digital freedoms, including the blocking of thousands of social media accounts, reflected attempts to conceal the realities on the ground”.
In his message on the occasion, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for the dispute’s resolution in accordance with UNSC resolutions.
He urged the international community to play an effective role in getting the Kashmiri people their “inalienable right through a free and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations”.
He also announced that the government has increased the monthly per capita subsistence allowance of Kashmiri refugees to Rs5,000.
“The government of Pakistan is conducting a pilot project to construct 750 residential houses at a cost of Rs3 billion,” PM Shehbaz said.







The premier said the AJK government has provided land for the construction of these houses, exclusively meant for Jammu Kashmir refugees settled in the territory.
He said complete rehabilitation of the refugees of Jammu and Kashmir is a national duty, and Pakistan will stand with the Kashmiris until they achieve their right to self-determination.
PM Shehbaz visits AJK
PM Shehbaz was on a visit to Muzaffarabad to address the special session of the AJK Legislative Assembly, APP reported.
Addressing the AJK Legislative Assembly, the premier said, “Today, we have gathered here to stand in solidarity with our brothers in [occupied] Kashmir on behalf of the Pakistani people and the Pakistani leadership.
“Soon, the freedom and nation of our Kashmiri brothers and sisters […] Kashmir will become a part of Pakistan.”



The prime minister paid tribute to leaders of the Kashmiri freedom movement, including Burhan Wani, Asia Andrabi, Yasin Malik and All-Parties Hurriyat Conference Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.
“History has shown that Kashmiris can sacrifice themselves or their children but will not compromise on their freedom,” PM Shehbaz noted.
“Kashmiris show the world every day the mirror of reality. They announce every day that Kashmir has never been a part of India, it is not, and it will never be,” he further said.
“The solution to the Jammu-Kashmir dispute is to honour the wishes of the people of Kashmir and the implementation of the UNSC’s resolutions,” the prime minister said.
“India has no way other than this.”
PM Shehbaz affirmed, “Pakistan will continue to speak in favour of Kashmir until the birthright of Kashmiris’ freedom is given to them.”
Recalling the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May 2025, he quipped, “Our brave armed forces, under the courageous leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, meted India such a defeat that even their generations would not be able to forget.”
“Our victory during Marka-i-Haq was also a victory of the Kashmir cause and the sacrifices made by Kashmiris,” he said, pointing out that the Kashmir cause was diplomatically “reignited with full force” in the wake of the conflict.

 

The prime minister then turned his attention towards the surge in terrorism in the country.
“After suffering defeat in Marka-i-Haq, India is now intensifying terrorism through proxies,” PM Shehbaz said.
He asserted that peace cannot be established in the region until India’s “aggressive, expansionist, dominating and nefarious schemes come to an end”.
“The brave armed forces and security forces of Pakistan will do the same to the puppets involved in Indian terrorism that they did to Indian jets in Marka-i-Haq,” the premier quipped.
However, he emphasised, “We want peace, but this peace can be established on the basis of equality and justice. No matter what front India opens or what language it uses, we will respond there in an unforgettable way.”
The prime minister underscored Pakistan’s principled stance on the Palestine and Kashmir issues.
PM Shehbaz said the Centre will continue to work with the AJK government to further develop education, infrastructure and health facilities in the territory.
“Recently, I was informed that the people who migrated from occupied Kashmir in 1989 have a stipend of only Rs3,500 per month, and it was requested that it should be increased to Rs5,000. I did not agree with that and said that it should be increased to Rs6,000,” he said.
Announcing the establishment of a Daanish school in Muzaffarabad, he said, “Rs9.4 billion have been allocated for water supply schemes and hydropower projects in Neelum, while Rs10bn have been allocated for the construction of Haryam Bridge.”
He went on to detail that Rs1.40bn have been allocated for the University of Kotli and Rs1,46bn for a women’s university in Bagh.
The premier also remembered AJK President Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry, who passed away recently, saying: “He committed his entire life to the freedom of Kashmir.”
In his speech to the assembly, AJK PM Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore noted that both the political and military leadership of Pakistan were expressing solidarity with the people of occupied Kashmir.
“Pakistani soldiers have never hesitated to make sacrifices for Kashmir,” he said.
Rathore highlighted that the country’s political leadership has never differentiated on the issue of Kashmir.
“On the one hand, there is India that has turned Kashmir into a jail, and then there is Pakistan, which is sensitive to even the smallest of our difficulties,” he said.
On his arrival, PM Shehbaz was welcomed by his AJK counterpart and senior government officials.
The prime minister is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, and Advisor to the PM on Inter-Provincial Coordination Rana Sanaullah.
Concrete action needed to alleviate Kashmiris’ suffering: armed forces
On behalf of the armed forces, Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf, and Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu reaffirmed their unwavering support for the “resilient people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) in their epic struggle for self-determination”.







In their message, issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the services chiefs strongly condemned “grave violations of human rights in IIOJK, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and attempts to alter the demographic and political landscape of the region, with blatant disregard for international law”.
They reiterated that a “just and peaceful resolution” of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, “remains essential for lasting peace and stability in South Asia”.
“The international community must take concrete and meaningful action to alleviate the suffering of the Kashmiri people,” the services chiefs added.
They reaffirmed that the armed forces remain “steadfast in their duty to safeguard Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and unwavering in their solidarity with their Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their rightful quest for freedom and dignity”.
“Long live Pakistan! Long live Kashmir!”
India’s ‘persistent defiance’ undermines UN Charter, UNSC resolutions: Dar
FM Dar, in a statement, highlighted that the Kashmiri people “remain deprived of their fundamental rights”. “Yet, their resilience testifies the legitimacy of their just cause.”
“At the heart of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute lies India’s failure to implement the United Nations Security Council resolutions guaranteeing the Kashmiri people a free and impartial plebiscite,” the foreign minister noted.
He pointed out that India’s “persistent defiance” undermines the UN Charter, the relevant UNSC resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention.
The situation on the ground in occupied Kashmir has “moved beyond episodic violations to a sustained system of repression”, Dar remarked.
He accused India of taking actions after Aug 5, 2019 for “artificially altering the demographic composition to change Muslim majority into majority into minority”.
“Under the Hindutva-driven framework, people in IIOJK face constant discrimination. The recent profiling of mosques in IIOJK, where religious functionaries are forced to provide their personal details, photographs, and sectarian affiliations, shows the extent of institutionalised Islamophobia,” the statement read.

 

FM Dar took note of “grave human rights violations, including fake encounters, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and restrictions on fundamental freedoms”.
He urged the international community to take “decisive action to address the worsening human rights situation in IIOJK, ensure accountability for India’s illegal and unilateral actions, persuade India to implement the [UNSC] resolutions and allow the Kashmiri people their promised right to self-determination”.







In his message, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq noted that the Kashmir issue remained one of the fundamental disputes stemming from the incomplete promises of the partition of the subcontinent.
He stressed that sustainable peace in South Asia cannot be achieved without granting the Kashmiri people their internationally recognised right to self-determination.
Rallies held
Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam led a rally from China Chowk to D-Chowk in Islamabad to mark the day, APP reported.



A ceremony marking Kashmir Solidarity Day was also held at Kohala Bridge, where participants formed a human chain and reaffirmed support for the people of Kashmir.
The event included flag hoisting and the playing of the national anthem, with officials, community representatives and citizens in attendance.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah led a Kashmir Solidarity Day rally in Karachi, marching from People’s Chowrangi to Mazar-i-Quaid.
Members of the provincial cabinet, the Sindh chief secretary and police chief, and other government officials participated in the rally.







Addressing an event, CM Murad recalled that in 1973, “when Kashmiris decided to join Pakistan, India illegally deployed troops” there.
“Ever since, Kashmiris’ right to self-determination has been suppressed by India,” he added.
“It is clear that this is not a decision between two countries, but India must be held accountable and the world must fulfil its promise to Kashmiris,” the chief minister said.
“In the Kashmir issue, everyone is united; there’s no political difference, no ethnicity. Everyone speaks as one on Kashmir,” he highlighted.







‘Kashmir fundamental pillar of Pakistan’s identity’
Separately, at a ceremony held at Pakistan’s embassy in Kabul, Pakistan’s envoy to Afghanistan Ubaidur Rehman Nizamani also reaffirmed the country’s “commitment to the struggle of the Kashmiri people”.
According to a press statement issued by the embassy, Ambassador Nizamani “framed the Kashmir cause as a fundamental pillar of Pakistan’s own spiritual and national identity”.
Addressing the event, the envoy also “emphasised that the stability, security, and very ideological foundation of Pakistan are inextricably linked to the freedom of Kashmiri brethren from Indian occupation”.

He was received by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari in Islamabad.
A post on the President Secretariat’s X account said: “A warm welcome to President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan! President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz received the Uzbek president at Noor Khan Airbase today. This visit marks a significant step in strengthening bilateral ties and regional connectivity.”







According to state-run APP, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the PM on Industry and Production Haroon Akhtar were also present at the Nur Khan Airbase to welcome the Uzbek president.
Mirziyoyev was welcomed with a 21-gun salute, the APP report said.
It added that a smartly turned out contingent of the Pakistan armed forces presented a static salute to the visiting dignitary, and the tri-services band also delivered a performance.
The Foreign Office (FO) earlier said that the Uzbek president was undertaking the official visit to Pakistan at the invitation of PM Shehbaz.
In its statement, the FO said that the President Mirziyoyev would lead a high-level delegation comprising cabinet ministers and business leaders.
It said that the visiting dignitary would meet President Zardari, hold delegation-level talks with PM Shehbaz, and address the Pakistan-Uzbekistan Business Forum.







The FO added that this was the Uzbek president’s second visit to Pakistan, as he had last visited Pakistan in 2022.
The visit “reflects the upward trajectory in Pakistan-Uzbekistan bilateral relations and the brotherly ties between the two brotherly countries, rooted in common history, faith and common aspirations for peace and prosperity in Central and South Asia”, it said.
Pakistan and Uzbekistan have strengthened ties through trade and economic cooperation. A $1 billion trade deal was signed in 2023, and plans for further collaboration, including a roadmap for industrial cooperation, show the two sides’ commitment to boosting regional connectivity.
Last month, the two countries agreed to expand bilateral trade to $2 billion as PM Shehbaz met with President Mirziyoyev in Tashkent.
The Embassy of Uzbekistan said last week that President Mirziyoyev’s visit to Pakistan was expected to mark a new phase in bilateral relations.</p><small>2026-02-05 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/05160151928a8f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240/pakistan-team-will-seek-govt-nod-if-it-meets-india-in-t20-world-cup-knockout-phase-captain-salman-agha' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan team will seek govt nod if it meets India in T20 World Cup knockout phase: captain Salman Agha</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan will seek advice from their government if they reach the knockout phase of the T20 World Cup and meet arch-rivals India, captain Salman Agha said on Thursday.
The tournament has been marred by an acrimonious political buildup after Bangladesh were kicked out and Pakistan refused to face co-hosts India in their Group A match.
However, a semi-final or final showdown between the uneasy South Asian neighbours is still a possibility.
“The India game is not in our control. It was the government’s decision and if we have to play them in the semi-final or the final, we will go back to them and act on their advice,” Agha told reporters in Colombo.
Bangladesh refused to play in India, citing security concerns, as relations soured and were kicked out of Group C by the International Cricket Council (ICC), to be replaced by Scotland.
Pakistan backed Bangladesh’s plea to have their games moved to Sri Lanka.

 

The government in Islamabad cleared the national team to take part but ordered them not to play in the marquee group match against India on February 15.
“It’s sad Bangladesh are not here. They have a very good side. Hopefully, they will support us,” Agha said.
Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in multinational events.
They will face Namibia, the Netherlands and the United States in the group stage.
“We’re excited to play in this tournament. We lost to USA in the last World Cup and we are determined to put that disappointment behind us and put a few things right,” Agha said.
Pakistan will not only lose two points for forfeiting their India match but will also take a big hit to their net run rate.
Even losing one of their group games to bad weather could make it difficult for Pakistan to qualify.
“We know the margin for error is small, but we can’t control the weather.
We are here to play good cricket and we’re not bothered about the conditions,” Agha said.
Pakistan, the 2009 champions, arrive after a 3-0 whitewash of Australia at home.

 

“We’ve been playing really good cricket. We haven’t lost a series since the Asia Cup last year. Everything is coming along nicely and we’re confident of doing well,” Agha said.
All of Pakistan’s games will be played in Sri Lanka, where they toured in January.
“Very happy to play in Sri Lanka — it’s a second home for me. This is my sixth visit, we know the conditions and we get a lot of support,” Agha said.</p><small>2026-02-05 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/05153446a6524b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971239/train-services-restored-in-balochistan-after-5-days-mobile-data-still-suspended-in-quetta' target='_blank'><strong>Train services restored in Balochistan after 5 days; mobile data still suspended in Quetta</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Train services were restored in Balochistan on Thursday, after five days of suspension, as the tense security situation eased following a series of counter-terrorism operations in response to a spate of attacks in the province.
However, mobile data services remained suspended for the sixth day in Quetta and some other districts.
“Train services within Balochistan and to other provinces have been,” Muhammad Kashif, spokesperson for Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, confirmed to Dawn.
He particularly mentioned that the services of the Jaffar Express train on the Quetta-Peshawar route and the Karachi-bound Bolan Mail had been suspended since January 31.
The railway official added that both had been restored now.

 

He further said that operations of the Quetta-Chaman passenger train had also resumed, and it departed today at its scheduled time.
On the other hand, mobile data services remained suspended in the provincial capital for the sixth consecutive day.
The mobile internet was still inaccessible in Quetta, Balochistan Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat told Dawn. However, it was expected to be restored till 12am, he said.
Mobile data also reportedly remained suspended in the Nushki, Sibi and Mastung districts.
The services have also been inaccessible for those in Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat for varying periods due to prior security concerns.
After several days of “mop-up” actions in some parts in the wake of January 31 attacks, the military announced earlier today that security forces successfully concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists.

 

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 36 civilians, including women and children, and 22 security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel were martyred as a result of the operations.
“[…] a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR detailed.
On January 31, police said suspected explosive materials were found on a railway track in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district.
Railway tracks are a frequent target of terrorists, with the Jaffar Express coming under attack several times over the past year.
On the night of January 26, a blast on the railway track linking Sindh to Balochistan derailed four bogies of the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express train coming from Peshawar and damaged the track.
The Jaffar Express had also escaped attacks in Nasirabad in October and November last year. Similar attempts also occurred during the two months in Kachhi and Sindh’s Shikarpur district.</p><small>2026-02-05 11:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/051429439381bac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971235/lahore-qalandars-directly-sign-bangladesh-pacer-mustafizur-rehman-for-over-rs60m' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore Qalandars directly sign Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rehman for over Rs60m</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Lahore Qalandars announced on Thursday that it had directly signed Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman for PSL’s 11th edition, spending over Rs60 million.
“Our Bangladeshi brother, Mustafizur, picked in 2016 and 2018, is now our direct signing and finally back with the family. Once a Qalandar, always a Qalandar.
“Amount spent on DS: PKR6.44 crore,” the announcement on Lahore Qalandar’s X account said.








Mustafizur had registered for the PSL in early January, following his release from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL).
The 30-year-old left-arm pacer, known for his variations and death-over bowling, was acquired by KKR for INR 9.20 crore in the IPL mini-auction held in December.
He was the only Bangladesh player signed for the season.
KKR announced his release after receiving instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
The decision came amid strained relations between India and Bangla­desh, linked to reports of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh.
In response, Bangladesh banned IPL broadcasts in the country and the Bangladesh Cricket Board requested the International Cricket Council (ICC) to shift its T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka.
ICC, however, rejected the request, replacing Bangladesh with Scotland in the 20-team tournament.
Mustafizur, who has played in multiple IPL seasons since 2016 and taken over 60 wickets in the league, previously also featured in the PSL for Lahore Qalandars.
Mustafizur’s direct signing has been made possible after the PCB announced sweeping changes to the player acquisition mechanism for PSL 11 last month, replacing the long-running draft with a full-fledged auction and raising the player purse to $1.6m per franchise.
Under the new framework, each franchise is allowed one direct signing of a foreign player who did not feature in the previous season, giving teams an additional avenue to bolster their squads with new international talent.
PSL 11 will begin on March 26, and will also mark the return of Faisalabad as a host city, expanding the league’s footprint beyond the existing venues of Karachi, Lahore, Multan and Rawalpindi.</p><small>2026-02-05 10:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/051249146eb4acd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971224/algerian-boxer-khelif-says-she-is-open-to-genetic-testing-by-ioc-for-2028-olympics' target='_blank'><strong>Algerian boxer Khelif says she is open to genetic testing by IOC for 2028 Olympics</strong></a><br><p>Algerian boxer Imane Khelif said she will comply with genetic testing requirements as long as the tests are conducted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), to be able to participate in competitions.
Khelif won gold in the women’s welterweight division at the Paris Games in 2024 amid a gender dispute over her eligibility, after the International Boxing Association (IBA) disqualified her from the 2023 World Championships based on sex chromosome tests.

 

World Boxing, which will oversee boxing competitions in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles after being granted provisional recognition by the IOC, last May announced mandatory sex testing for all boxers in its competitions.
Khelif, who lodged an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over World Boxing’s decision barring her from events unless she undergoes genetic sex testing, said she would only undergo the testing if it is administered by the IOC.
“Of course, I would accept doing anything I’m required to do to participate in competitions,” Khelif told CNN.
“They should protect women, but they need to pay attention that while protecting women, they shouldn’t hurt other women.”

New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), signed during a warmer period of relations, ended with the turn of the calendar to February 5, with US President Donald Trump not following up on Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin’s proposal to extend the treaty’s limits for one year.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called it a “grave moment for international peace and security” and urged Washington and Moscow to head quickly to the negotiating table.







“For the first time in more than half a century, we face a world without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals of the Russian Federation and the United States of America,” Guterres said in a statement, which considered the treaty over at midnight GMT or 7pm in New York.
“This dissolution of decades of achievement could not come at a worse time — the risk of a nuclear weapon being used is the highest in decades,” he said, after Russian suggestions of using tactical nuclear weapons early in the Ukraine war.
Pope Leo XIV said each side needed to do “everything possible” to avert a new arms race.
“I urge you not to abandon this instrument without seeking to ensure that it is followed up in a concrete and effective manner,” the American-born pope said at his weekly general audience.
Russia’s foreign ministry said it considered that both countries are “no longer bound by any obligations or symmetrical declarations within the context of the treaty.”
“The Russian Federation intends to act responsibly and prudently,” it added, but warned it was ready to take “decisive” countermeasures if its national security is threatened.







US demands China involvement
Trump has frequently lashed out at international limits on the United States and called for nuclear testing to resume after a long moratorium, although he has not followed up.
But some observers say the expiration of New START owes less to ideology than to the workings of the Trump administration, where career diplomats are sidelined, simply not having the bandwidth to negotiate a complex agreement.
Trump, asked in October in front of his helicopter about Putin’s proposal for a one-year extension, said it sounded “like a good idea”, but there were no subsequent negotiations.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that Trump would make a decision later and reiterated a call for a new agreement that includes China.
“The president’s been clear in the past that in order to have true arms control in the 21st century, it’s impossible to do something that doesn’t include China, because of their vast and rapidly growing stockpile,” Rubio said.
China’s nuclear arsenal is growing quickly with an estimated 550 strategic nuclear launchers, which is still well below the 800 each of Russia and the United States capped under New START. France and Britain, treaty-bound US allies, together have another 100.
Trump in his first term also looked ready to let New START lapse as he insisted on including China, with a US negotiator even provocatively setting up an empty seat with a Chinese flag.

 

Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, which warns of nuclear risks, agreed that China should engage on its nuclear programme but wondered if Trump has even tried.
“Despite Trump’s talk about involving China in nuclear negotiations, there is no indication that Trump or his team have taken the time to propose risk reduction or arms control talks with China since returning to office in 2025,” Kimball said.
He said that Trump and Putin could agree to keep current limits and then press China.
Joe Biden agreed with Russia to extend New START for five years after he defeated Trump in the 2020 election, but tensions between the two countries later soared over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
The treaty, signed in 2010 in Prague by then presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, limited each side’s nuclear arsenal to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads, a reduction of nearly 30 per cent from the previous limit set in 2002.</p><small>2026-02-05 08:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/051142269b580a5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971222/216-terrorists-killed-as-security-forces-conclude-operation-radd-ul-fitna-1-in-balochistan-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>216 terrorists killed as security forces conclude ‘Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1’ in Balochistan: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have successfully concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in the days-long clearance actions against “Indian-sponsored terrorist elements”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
“Security forces have successfully concluded Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 in Balochistan under which a series of coordinated, swift, and intelligence-driven operations were conducted against Indian-sponsored terrorist elements seeking to disrupt peace and development by targeting innocent civilians, including women and children,” the ISPR said in a press release.
The development comes as security forces responded to a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days.
“As a result of these well-coordinated engagements and subsequent clearance operations, 216 terrorists have been sent to hell, significantly degrading the leadership, command-and-control structures and operational capabilities of terrorist networks,” the military’s media affairs wing said.
“Through meticulous planning, actionable intelligence, and seamless joint execution, Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs), with support of intelligence agencies, under Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 responded with precision and resolve,” the statement read.
“During these operations, 36 innocent civilians, including women and children, embraced martyrdom, while 22 brave security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of Pakistan’s territorial integrity and the protection of its citizens,” the ISPR stated.
“Their courage, professionalism, and unwavering commitment reflect the highest traditions of service. The nation honours their sacrifice and stands in solidarity with the families of all martyrs,” the military said.
Detailing the forces’ timely actions, the ISPR recalled that on January 29, “operations were initiated in Panjgur and the outskirts of Harnai District after credible and verified intelligence confirmed the presence of terrorist elements posing an imminent threat to local public”.

 

“During this phase, security forces undertook operations against identified terrorist hideouts, resulting in the elimination of 41 terrorists affiliated with Indian proxy networks,” it noted.
“Subsequently, aggressive and steadfast responses by the brave security forces effectively thwarted the desperate attacks of Fitna-al-Hindustan to destabilise the peace of Balochistan.
“Sequel to these, a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR detailed.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR stated that a “substantial cache of foreign-origin weapons, ammunition, explosives and equipment has also been recovered during the process”.
“Preliminary analysis indicates systematic external facilitation and logistical support to these extremist proxies,” it observed.
The military reaffirmed that the armed forces remained steadfast in their “resolve to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations under the ambit” of the government’s National Action Plan (NAP).

 

It asserted that “counter-terrorism operations will continue with full determination until the complete elimination of terrorist threats”.
“Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 stands as a testament to Pakistan’s and particularly Balochistan’s proud peoples’ unwavering commitment to always prefer peace over violence, unity over division and development over violence,” the ISPR said.
Following the January 31 attacks at multiple locations across Balochistan, security forces and LEAs continued “mop-up” actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province on Tuesday.
Mobile internet had remained suspended in parts of the province for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday, with provincial authorities also halting train services.
President, PM hail forces for ‘crippling’ terrorists
President Asif Ali Zardari commended security forces and law enforcement agencies over the successful completion of the operation in Balochistan, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
According to the report, in a statement, the president noted that the timely action of the security forces thwarted the nefarious attempts of Fitna-al-Hindustan to disrupt peace in Balochistan.
“Eradication of foreign-backed terrorism is our top priority,” the report quoted him as saying.
“The president expressed satisfaction that intelligence-based coordinated operations crippled the leadership and capacity of the foreign-backed terrorist networks,” the report read.
It further said that President Zardari paid tribute to the innocent civilians and security personnel who were martyred during the operation, and expressed condolences to their families.
“The nation salutes the sacrifices of martyrs and stands united against terrorism,” he said.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the officers and security forces personnel, as well as the leadership of the armed forces, for the success of Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1, Radio Pakistan reported.
In his statement, PM Shehbaz praised the professional capabilities of the security forces for “breaking the backbone of enemies for peace and development” in Balochistan during the operation.
The prime minister emphasised that the nation could never forget the sacrifices of its martyrs, Radio Pakistan said.
“He vowed that the cowardly and malicious attempts by the terrorists to sabotage the peace of Balochistan through targeting innocent civilians would always be crushed,” the report read.
“The terrorists have proved that they are enemies of development in the province and its people by targeting innocent civilians,” it quoted the premier as saying.
PM Shehbaz vowed that the war against the “scourge of terrorism will continue until it is completely eradicated from the country”.
“The entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with the armed forces in their unwavering determination to defend the homeland,“ he affirmed.







Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti, in a post on X, stated that the operation was a “clear message to those committing acts of bloodshed in Balochistan”.
He maintained that the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was “a fitna targeting innocent civilians and labourers”, stressing that the group was working “at the behest of India”.
“Pakistan will not compromise on its unity, development, and the protection of its people,” Bugti said.
The chief minister warned that any effort to destabilise the country will be met with “a decisive response”.
“The nation stands united, and any hand raised against Pakistan will not only be dealt with law and full force but will be broken,” he vowed.</p><small>2026-02-05 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/05113946c8df0c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971220/pakistan-must-create-30m-jobs-over-next-decade-world-bank-president' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan must create 30m jobs over next decade: World Bank president</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan must create up to 30 million jobs over the next decade to turn its youth bulge into an economic dividend or risk instability and outward migration, World Bank President Ajay Banga has stressed.
Pakistan is entering the implementation phase of a 10-year Country Partnership Framework (CPF) deal agreed with the World Bank last year, while also working with the International Monetary Fund to stabilise its economy. But Islamabad is still facing mounting pressure to deliver sustained growth and jobs.
“We’re trying to move the bank group as a whole from the idea of projects to the idea of outcomes,” Banga said in an interview with Reuters in Karachi during a visit to Pakistan this week.
“Job creation is the North Star.”
‘Generational challenge’
Pakistan needs to generate 2.5m to 3m jobs a year — roughly 25m to 30m over the next decade — as millions of young people come of age, Banga said. Failure to do so could fuel “illegal migration or domestic instability”.
Banga said Pakistan’s population dynamics mean employment creation will remain a binding constraint on growth over the long term, rather than a secondary policy goal.
“This is a generational challenge,” he said.
The CPF commits around $4 billion a year in combined public and private financing from the World Bank Group, with roughly half expected to come from private-sector operations led by the International Finance Corporation.
Banga said the reliance on private capital reflects a country where the government has limited spending capacity and 90 per cent of jobs are created in the private sector.
Banga said Pakistan’s job strategy rests on three pillars: investment in human and physical infrastructure, business-friendly regulatory reforms, and expanded access to financing and insurance, particularly for small firms and farmers that typically lack bank credit.
Infrastructure, primary healthcare, tourism and small-scale agriculture were labour-intensive sectors with the greatest employment potential, he said, adding that farming alone could account for about one-third of the jobs Pakistan needs to create by 2050.
A growing pool of freelancers also highlighted Pakistan’s appetite for entrepreneurship, but they need better access to capital, infrastructure and support to scale into job-creating businesses, he said.

 

The strain is readily visible in the exodus of skilled workers.
Nearly 4,000 doctors emigrated from Pakistan in 2025, the highest annual outflow on record, according to Gallup Pakistan data based on Bureau of Emigration figures, underscoring concerns that weak job prospects and poor working conditions are pushing trained professionals abroad.
Power first
Fixing Pakistan’s power sector is the most urgent near-term priority, Banga said, noting that losses and inefficiencies in electricity distribution have limited growth despite improvements in generation capacity.
Pakistan’s power sector has long been plagued by growing debt from distribution losses, weak bill recovery and delayed government subsidies, which has strained public finances and discouraged private investment. The debt has been a recurring focus of IMF-backed reform programmes, with successive governments struggling to contain losses while keeping energy affordable.

 

Banga said progress on privatisation and private-sector participation in electricity distribution would be critical to improving efficiency, reducing losses and restoring the sector’s financial viability.
He said rapid rooftop solar adoption, while easing energy costs for households and businesses, risks creating grid instability if distribution reforms are not accelerated.
“Electricity is fundamental to everything — health, education, business and jobs.”
Climate by design
Banga said climate resilience should also be embedded into mainstream development spending rather than treated as a standalone agenda.
Pakistan is among the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries, hit repeatedly by floods, heatwaves and erratic monsoons.

 

Banga said climate-resilient investments should be integrated into infrastructure, housing, water management and agriculture to support jobs while reducing long-term risks.
“The moment you start thinking about climate as separate from housing, food or irrigation, you create a false debate. Just build resilience into what you’re already doing.”
Asked how Pakistan fits into the World Bank’s global portfolio, Banga said he does not view the country through labels such as fragility or crisis, but as a long-term job-creation opportunity.
“We’re in the business of hope,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-05 07:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04230341a4d48d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971051/imrans-son-kasim-accuses-govt-of-deliberately-refusing-to-process-his-and-his-brothers-visas' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s son Kasim accuses govt of ‘deliberately refusing’ to process his and his brother’s visas</strong></a><br><p>Kasim Khan, the son of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, said on Wednesday that the government was “deliberately” refusing to process his and his brother’s visas.
In a post on X, Kasim said, “My brother and I are trying to travel to Pakistan to see our father. For 914 days, he has been held in solitary confinement while his health deteriorates and he is denied access to independent medical care.
“Now the government is deliberately refusing to process our visas. Denying a prisoner treatment is cruel. Denying his children the right to see him is collective punishment,” he said.







“I call on international human rights organisations and governments to speak out and act before irreversible harm is done,” he said.
Kasim and his older brother Suleiman live in London with their mother, Jemima Goldsmith.
The development comes as the government last week admitted that Imran was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), days after reports regarding the treatment of the former premier emerged in mainstream media.
The PTI had subsequently condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians.
A day earlier, the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, Mahmood Khan Achakzai, wrote a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, seeking his “personal intervention” for the medical examination of PTI founder Imran Khan by the jailed leader’s “trusted” doctors.
Meanwhile, Imran’s sons, Kasim and Suleiman, said in December 2025 that the two had applied for their visas and were planning a trip to Pakistan in January.
However, this week reports emerged alleging that the government was refusing to grant Imran’s sons visas.</p><small>2026-02-05 06:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04222604f9301b6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971048/cdf-munir-says-terrorists-facilitators-will-not-be-spared-no-one-can-rationalise-violence-on-any-pretext' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Munir says terrorists, facilitators will not be spared; no one can rationalise violence on any pretext</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday said that no terrorist or their facilitator would be spared, adding that “no one can rationalise violence and terrorism on any pretext”.
He made the remarks during a visit to Quetta, according to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), where he received a “comprehensive operational briefing on the prevailing security environment and internal security operations”.
“The briefing covered recent terrorist attacks orchestrated by Indian-backed internationally-designated terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan and the prompt aggressive response of security forces, which failed their ulterior motive of compromising peace, stability, and development in Balochistan,” ISPR said.







The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The handout said measures being undertaken to further strengthen the writ of the state and ensure protection of the populace and critical infrastructure were also discussed.
During his visit, CDF Munir remarked that “no terrorist and their facilitator will be spared and all will be dealt strictly as per law and that no one can rationalise violence and terrorism on any pretext”.
“He appreciated the professionalism, valour, and sacrifices of officers and troops of all law enforcement agencies in thwarting nefarious anti-Pakistan designs and maintaining law and order.”
The statement said that CDF Munir, along with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, visited the Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Quetta, where he met injured personnel belonging to the army, Balochistan Frontier Corps and police.

They were speaking at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) at a briefing organised to create awareness about epidemiological risks, transmission pathways and prevention strategies related to Nipah virus.
According to the experts, the zoonotic virus, which is an infectious agent that jumps from animals to humans, causing disease, currently poses no direct threat to Pakistan.
As of late January, 2026, only two cases involving healthcare workers have been confirmed in West Bengal, India, and that the risk of international spread is currently categorised as low due to the geographical distance of the outbreak (eastern India, Bangladesh) and the virus’ limited human-to-human transmission.

Stress need to improve healthcare standards and adopt basic hygiene protocols

“The virus is found in animals but can also affect humans. However, only a handful of cases (of human-to-human transmission) have been reported in recent years globally,” said Dr Faisal Mahmood, Professor, infectious diseases and Associate Chief Medical Officer, AKUH, adding that no case has been reported in Pakistan.
The experts explained that the primary mode of Nipah virus transmission is zoonotic, occurring through direct contact with infected bats or the consumption of food, such as raw tree sap or fruit, contaminated by them.
“The virus is not spread through casual exposure to bats, such as flying nearby. It has a high fatality rate of 40 to 50 per cent but it doesn’t spread as easily as respiratory viruses such as Covid-19,” Dr Mahmood clarified.
According to Dr Nosheen Nasir, Associate Professor and Section Head of Infectious Diseases Department, AKUH, the two cases confirmed in West Bengal, India, were of nurses working at the same hospital.
“One of them is recovering while another is reported to be on ventilator support. The authorities there have tested 190 contacts, all of them have tested negative,” she said, adding that no case had been reported from the western region of India that bordered Pakistan.
According to her, cases of Nipah virus infection were first reported in 1998 in Malaysia, where it affected pig farmers. Since then, cases have reported in Bangladesh, India, the Philippines and Singapore.
About its clinical manifestation, she said the infection initially presented with flu like symptoms but rapidly progressed to severe brain inflammation, causing neurological problems including fits.
Responding to a question about the Nipah cases affecting healthcare workers, the experts agreed that infection control practices were too weak in Pakistan and needed to be implemented strictly that would help address growing threat of all kinds of infectious diseases including HIV and hepatitis C.
“We don’t need extra wards. We just need to be vigilant, improve our healthcare standards and adopt basic hygiene protocols,” Dr Mahmood said.
Responding to concerns over the strong regional presence of the virus and Pakistan’s compromised healthcare services, Dr Nosheen said: “The way the infection presents itself in humans, you can’t hide those cases. Having said that, we need to improve clinical surveillance.”
The panel acknowledged the government’s proactive screening of travellers at international entry points as a positive step in safeguarding public health. Drawing on lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic nearly six years ago, AKUH experts emphasised that strong health resilience is built through early preparedness, effective coordination, and sustained community awareness, rather than reactive containment alone.

Describing the app as a major digital reform, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said the unified app consolidates all water and sewerage-related services into one system, enabling citizens to lodge complaints, pay bills, book water tankers and track requests with ease.







He said the initiative is designed to enhance operational efficiency, improve transparency and ensure greater accountability by reducing manual processes and providing real-time access to services for residents across Karachi.
Officials said the app is available in Urdu, English and Sindhi and has been designed with a simple registration and OTP-based verification process to ensure ease of use for all segments of the population.
During the launch ceremony held at the KWSC headquarters, a technical briefing highlighted the app’s systems and service-tracking features, allowing users to monitor the status of their complaints and applications in real time.
The mayor said the initiative reflects the administration’s vision of “One App, One System, One Karachi,” stressing that public utilities must align with modern digital expectations.

ISLAMABAD: Five United Nations experts have expressed alarm over the conviction of human rights activist Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, on multiple charges in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
On Jan 24, an Islamabad sessions court sentenced Ms Mazari and Mr Chattha to jail.
In a joint statement issued on Wednesday, UN special rapporteurs Margaret Satterthwaite, Ben Saul, Mary Lawlor, Irene Khan and Gina Romero noted that the two were convicted on multiple criminal charges, resulting in lengthy prison sentences “for simply exercising rights guaranteed by international human rights law”.
“Lawyers, like other individuals, are entitled to freedom of expression. The exercise of this right should never be conflated with criminal conduct, especially not terrorism,” they were quoted as saying, while also emphasising the vague definition of terrorism-related offences under Pakistan’s counter-terrorism framework.
“Doing so risks undermining and criminalising the work of lawyers and human rights defenders across Pakistan and has a chilling effect on civil society in the country,” the experts stated.
The experts observed that these were not the first prosecutions against the two lawyers, “who have been the subject of 10 criminal complaints since 2022, some of which remain pending”, but were never previously convicted of wrongdoing. “This pattern of prosecutions suggests an arbitrary use of the legal system as an instrument of harassment and intimidation in order to punish them for their work advocating for victims of alleged human rights violations,” they added.
The experts observed, “International standards provide a set of procedural guarantees that must be made available to persons charged with a criminal offence, but these appear to have been undermined in this case.
“These violations seriously threaten the fairness of the trial and conviction.”
UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the UN Human Rights Council to report their findings. They do not speak on behalf of the United Nations itself.
According to the statement, the UN experts “have contacted Pakistan regarding their concerns”.
IHC proceedings
Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday directed former federal minister Shireen Mazari to first approach the superintendent of Adiala jail regarding her request to meet her incarcerated daughter, Ms Mazari, and son-in-law, Mr Chattha, under the prison rules, and disposed of her application after forwarding it to the jail authorities.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir heard the matter after the former PTI leader appeared before the court along with senior lawyer Kamran Murtaza and a team of legal counsel. The petition concerned allegations that prison authorities had denied family and legal access to the detained couple.
During the hearing, the court asked whether Shireen Mazari had formally applied to the jail superintendent for permission to meet the prisoners or to the Islamabad Capital Territory chief commissioner.
Upon learning that the matter had not been fully processed through the jail authorities, Justice Tahir directed the petitioner to follow the prescribed legal procedure.
The court further stated that if the authorities rejected the request, the petitioner could return to the high court for legal redress.

WASHINGTON / LONDON / OSLO: The fallout from the revelations contained in the Epstein Files continued to cause upheaval in Europe, with notable British and Norwegian figures — including royals and top government officials — facing intense scrutiny for a variety of wrongdoings.
King Charles’ brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has left the Royal Lodge mansion, his home of two decades, after Thames Valley Police said they were assessing allegations that a second woman was sent to the UK by convicted sex trafficker and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, for a sexual encounter with the former royal.
In 2014, the late Virginia Giuffre became the first woman to publicly accuse the embattled ex-royal of similar encounters. Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit in the US against him in 2021, settling the case in February 2022 for an estimated £12m. She took her own life last year.
The anti-monarchist campaign group Republic said it had reported Andrew to the police over allegations that “he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to the UK for sex”.
The documents released on Friday included photos of him kneeling on all fours over a woman lying on the ground, while other files repeatedly reference him. “The sight of him plastered on the front pages out riding his horse or driving in his car… amid the continued dripping poison of the Epstein files was just too much,” a royal source told the Daily Mail. “He had to be removed from the public eye,” the source added.
Andrew is said now to be living at Wood Farm, the former residence of his late father Prince Philip on the king’s private estate in Sandringham, eastern England.
Meanwhile, UK PM Keir Starmer is reeling under pressure from within his own party after it emerged that Peter Mandelson, who served in the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown cabinets and recently ended a posting as UK’s envoy to Washington, not only remained in close contact with Epstein, but also leaked sensitive information to him.
Mandelson quit the House of Lords after Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into his misconduct in public office. It has been reported that Mandelson used a private email to correspond with government figures and Epstein.
In the House of Commons, Starmer told MPs Mandelson had “betrayed our country” after “lying repeatedly” about his ties with Epstein. But the government’s attempts to water down a Conservative party-led demand for releasing an array of documents, including due diligence conducted before Lord Mandelson’s ambassadorial appointment, were met with fierce opposition from Labour MPs.
While the government wanted to carve out an exemption, saying they won’t release papers “prejudicial to UK national security or international relations”, a large group of backbenchers — led by former deputy PM Angela Rayner — opposed this position, calling for complete transparency. The fury from within Labour ranks, BBC News reported, caught the Starmer administration by surprise, and it was forced to accept that any documents deemed a risk to national security should be referred to parliament’s intelligence and security committee.
Norwegian PM’s ties
Meanwhile, the Nobel Institute said it was awaiting an explanation from Norway’s ex-premier Thorbjorn Jagland — a former chair of the committee the peace prize — over his reported links to Epstein.
Norwegian newspaper VG, referencing the released documents, reported Jagland had extensive contact with Epstein.
At one point, it said, Jagland asked for financial help to buy an apartment. Jagland told the newspaper the loans for his properties had all been obtained from the Norwegian bank DNB.
Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the institute, said, “If it turns out that Thorbjorn Jagland received significant financial benefits from Jeffrey Epstein while serving as a member of the Nobel Committee, that would be contrary to our code of ethics.”
Jagland was chair of the committee that selects the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize winner between 2009 and 2015.

The US-mediated talks are the latest round of negotiations in a flurry of diplomacy that has so far failed to strike a deal to halt the war, unleashed by Russia’s February 2022 invasion.
The war has spiralled into Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II, with hundreds of thousands killed, millions forced to flee their homes in Ukraine and much of eastern and southern Ukraine decimated.
“Our position is well known,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday as the talks got underway.

EU member states agree Ukraine may use 90bn-euro loan to buy arms from close allies

“Until the Kyiv regime makes the appropriate decisions, the special military operation continues,” he said, using Russia’s term for the offensive.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had on Tuesday said that Russia’s strikes on Kyiv’s energy system “confirms that attitudes in Moscow have not changed: they continue to bet on war and the destruction of Ukraine, and they do not take diplomacy seriously.” “The work of our negotiating team will be adjusted accordingly,” he said, without elaborating.
US President Donald Trump, however, said Russian President Vladimir Putin had “kept his word” with a week-long promise not to hit the capital or critical energy facilities.
“It’s a lot, you know, one week, we’ll take anything, because it’s really, really cold over there,” Trump said on Tuesday.
“I want him to end the war,” Trump added of Putin. Asked if he was disappointed Putin had not extended the pause, he replied: “I would like him to.”
Sticking point in talks
The main sticking point in the talks to settle the conflict is the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine.
Moscow is demanding that Kyiv pull its troops out of swathes of the Donbas, including heavily fortified cities atop vast natural resources, as a precondition of any deal.
It also wants international recognition that land seized in the invasion belongs to Russia.
Kyiv has said the conflict should be frozen along the current front line and has rejected a unilateral pull-back of forces.
Ukraine’s top negotiator Rustem Umerov confirmed the talks had started Wednesday in a trilateral format.
Trump has despatched his ubiquitous envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner to try to corral the sides to an agreement.
Ukraine’s Umerov is seen a shrewd negotiator, hailed by colleagues as a worker of diplomatic “wonders”.
Russia’s top negotiator is military intelligence director Igor Kostyukov, a career naval officer sanctioned in the West over his role in the Ukraine invasion.
Russia occupies around 20 per cent of Ukraine, but Kyiv still controls around one-fifth of the Donetsk region.
EU loan for Ukraine
In a related development, EU countries on Wednesday agreed Ukraine could use a new 90-billion-euro ($118 billion) loan to buy a greater share of weapons from close allies like Britain, if those countries contribute financially, officials said.
The EU said in a statement key allies could gain more access if they pay “a fair and proportionate financial contribution to the costs arising from borrowing”.

Arabia, Turkiye, Egypt ‘unlikely’ to take part at this stage
ISLAMABAD / WASHINGTON: The prospects for talks between Iran and the United States seemed fraught with uncertainty on Wednesday, even after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi publicly announced the date and timing of the proposed negotiations.
“Nuclear talks with the United States are scheduled to be held in Muscat on about 10 am Friday. I’m grateful to our Omani brothers for making all necessary arrangements,” he posted on X late on Wednesday night.







A US official also confirmed that the neg­o­tiations are on track, Reuters reported.
The statement came amid swirling speculation that the talks had already been called off.
Indications of trouble first surfaced after American news website Axios reported that the talks were falling apart, as the US had told Iran that it would not agree to Tehran’s demands to change the location and format of talks.
US officials considered the request to change the venue but then decided to reject it, Axios said. “We told them it is this or nothing, and they said, ‘Ok, then nothing,’” a senior US official was quoted as saying.
The news outlet later reported, citing two US officials, that plans for US-Iran nuclear talks are back on after several Middle Eastern leaders “urgently lobbied the Trump administration on Wednesday afternoon not to follow through on threats to walk away.
“At least nine countries from the region reached out to the White House at the highest levels strongly urging the US not to cancel the meeting,” it added.
Insider accounts suggested the talks were salvaged after persistent requests from regional actors, which had originally been slated to participate in the discussions planned for Turkiye, but were later excluded from the round shifted to Oman.
These countries — including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye — maintain dir­ect stakes, as they would face significant consequences in the event of a conflict, and thus have sustained their strong interest in the dialogue.
Their advocacy seems to have helped preserve at least some channel for de-escalation and prevented the breakdown of diplomacy.
Talking to Dawn from Tehran, Iranian officials had suggested that regional players like were unlikely to take part at this stage. Qatar’s prime minister, however, is more likely to be involved alongside Omani interlocutors.
Troubled talks
Reports about the cancellation of talks started making rounds after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in public remarks, insisted that any engagement would need to address Iran’s ballistic missiles, its regional posture and its domestic governance, alongside nuclear issues.
Rubio’s comments, many believed, pointed to divisions within the US administration itself. While President Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been tasked with exploring a diplomatic opening, Rubio articulated a far more expansive and hawkish agenda.
For Tehran, this seemed to confirm long-held suspicions that Washington was abandoning the idea of a limited confidence-building process. Iranian officials, therefore, saw the expanded agenda not as a starting point for negotiation, but as an attempt to front-load concessions.
A senior Iranian official, however, said the talks would only be about Iran’s nuclear programme, and that its missile programme was “off the table”.
The diplomatic efforts come after Trump’s threats of military action against Iran during its crackdown on protesters last month and the deployment of more naval power to the Gulf.
After Israel and the United States bombed Iran last summer, renewed friction has kindled fears among regional states of a major conflagration that could rebound on them or cause long-term chaos in Iran. Trump has continued to weigh the option of strikes on Iran, sources say. Oil prices have risen due to the tension.
Khamenei ‘should be very worried’
Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be “very worried”, as Washington builds up its military forces in the region.
“I would say he should be very worried, yeah, he should be,” Trump said in an interview with US broadcaster NBC News. “As you know, they are negotiating with us.”
Trump also said that Iran had eyed a new nuclear site after US strikes. “They were thinking about starting a new site in a different part of the country,” Trump told NBC. “We found out about it, I said, you do that, we’re going to do very bad things to you.”

ISLAMABAD: Ahead of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review mission’s planned visit this month, the government has hinted at the recovery of around Rs217 billion super tax arrears in instalments to facilitate businesses, and changing all currency notes.
Testifying before the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue on Wednesday, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial expressed willingness to collect super tax arrears in instalments and clarified that the pending tax recoverable following the Supreme Court (SC) judgement in government favour was Rs217bn, not Rs300bn as speculated.
The FBR chairman said the government did not want business closures for tax recoveries and would be ready to consider super tax recoveries on a case-to-case basis. He said the tax machinery would ensure that the apex court did not create any problem. The super tax was initially imposed in 2015 for one year and later increased and continued till now. Some businesses had secured stay orders through high courts but the SC finally concluded the matter last month, upholding the executive’s inherent powers to impose taxes and ordering all pending recoveries.

 

The lawmakers were given the assurance after they voiced concerns over the ‘sudden tax burden’ on businesses, which could see closure or flight to other countries. The senators told the FBR chairman that the business community and the chambers of commerce and industry had already expressed serious concerns over the issue.
They claimed old taxpayers were being harassed in the name of super tax recoveries and being threatened with freezing of accounts and arrests. They advocated that the taxpayers and businessmen sho­u­ld not be harassed and instead be facilitated thro­ugh gradual recoveries over two to three years at least.
‘Felicitation messages’
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the FBR had effectively controlled smuggling and revenue theft and insisted that FBR messages for recovery of taxes did not breach taxpayers’ financial privacy. He disclosed that he also received FBR’s SMS in personal capacity and found nothing objectionable. He said there should not be an issue with SMS as long as it was delivered to the intended taxpayer, which was not violation of personal data.
On this, the FBR chief explained that messages were sent to relevant taxpayers only. “We send congratulation message to the taxpayer on purchase of plot and only ask its inclusion in the tax return,” he remarked. He claimed, “Such messages increased the number of filers of tax returns by a million and the number of taxpayers showing zero income has dropped.”
The finance minister reminded the senators that the country could not move forward and grow without a sustainable tax-to-GDP ratio and this had nothing to do with the IMF. “We did not appeal for global support following recent floods because we had additional financial cushion to absorb the shock,” he elaborated. He later told journalists that third IMF review was already scheduled for end of February.
Mr Aurangzeb said Pakistan’s external financing needs were fully covered and discussions were in progress with the UAE in this regard. He said the inaugural Panda Bond in the Chinese capital market was planned within the first quarter of the year. The government has been targeting the bond before close of December 2025, but delays followed regulatory approvals in the target market.
NFC discussions
Responding to a question on delays in National Finance Commission (NFC) discussions, the minister said the subgroups of the commission were necessary for the NFC to be called, adding that one of eight groups led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Muzammil Aslam and another led by himself (Aurangzeb) had held one meeting each and meetings of three other groups had been called for next week. Once four to five groups conclude, the next NFC meeting would be convened immediately. “We earnestly want to take the NFC discussions forward,” he said.
The Senate committee, led by former PPP finance minister Saleem Mand­viwalla, decided to convene an in-camera session to discuss corruption and leakages in the tax system, following a proposal by the FBR chairman.
The committee chairman noted that sensitive details regarding systemic weaknesses would be shared behind closed doors.
New currency note designs
Separately, the committee was briefed by the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan on the proposed new designs of currency notes ranging from Rs10 to Rs5,000. He confirmed that enhanced security features had been incorporated and categorically ruled out any proposal to discontinue Rs5,000 note. The new designs have been approved by the SBP Board and forwarded to the federal cabinet, which will take the final decision.
An in-camera briefing on the new currency designs would be held in a committee meeting soon.
The committee strongly criticised the practice of commercial banks charging additional fees for SMS alerts and other customer services, recommending that such charges be discontinued. The SBP governor claimed the matter belonged to the customers and the banks through “bilateral consent”.

WASHINGTON: The United States on Wednesday outlined plans to establish price floors for critical minerals and form a preferential trading arrangement among participating countries, a proposal that Pakistan has so far chosen to approach cautiously as it seeks to maintain close ties with both Washington and Beijing.
US Vice President J.D. Vance told representatives from more than 50 countries that Washington was proposing a coordinated system to stabilise prices of critical minerals essential for clean energy, advanced technology and defence industries, arguing that market volatility had discouraged long-term investment.
Diplomatic sources in Washington told Dawn that Pakistan has been briefed on the US proposal but has not yet signed on. Islamabad was represented at the two-day meeting by Federal Minister for Energy Ali Pervaiz Malik, rather than a senior political delegation, in what officials described as a calibrated approach to an initiative widely seen as aimed at reducing global dependence on China.
Pakistan, which is believed to possess substantial but largely untapped reserves of copper, gold and rare earth elements, used the Washington gathering to highlight its mineral potential while avoiding any public alignment with efforts to counter China’s dominance in the global critical minerals trade.
Speaking at the meeting, Vice President Vance said erratic pricing had made sustained investment in critical mineral industries “nearly impossible”.
“Consistent investment in critical mineral industries is nearly impossible when prices are wildly volatile,” he said, pointing to the impact of foreign supplies flooding markets before new projects could get off the ground.
Mr Vance proposed what he described as “a concrete mechanism to return the global critical minerals market to a healthier, more competitive state,” including the establishment of reference prices at each stage of production.
“We will establish reference prices for critical minerals at each stage of production — pricing that reflects real-world fair market value,” he said. “And for members of the preferential zone, these reference prices will operate as a floor, maintained through adjustable tariffs to uphold pricing integrity.”
He hinted at the formation of a trading bloc among allies and partners, saying the goal was to prevent market manipulation that undermines domestic producers.
“We want to eliminate that problem of people flooding into our markets with cheap critical minerals to undercut our domestic manufacturers,” he added, noting that several countries had already signed on to the initiative.
The Washington meeting forms part of a broader US effort to reduce reliance on China, which currently accounts for about 60 per cent of global production of critical minerals and nearly 90pc of their processing and refining — a concentration US officials describe as a strategic vulnerability.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio hosted the inaugural Critical Minerals Ministerial and underscored the link between critical minerals and economic security.
“We are gathered here today as the first step to rectify the mistake,” Mr Rubio said, calling on participating countries to bring together “our collective talent and innovation” to diversify supply chains and improve affordability.
Mr Rubio said the objective was not merely to address past policy failures but to ensure resilience through coordinated international action.
India’s Minister for External Affairs S. Jaishankar also spoke at the gathering, underlining “the challenges of excessive concentration” and stressing the importance of “de-risking supply chains through structured international cooperation.”
He highlighted India’s efforts to strengthen supply resilience, an approach widely seen as aimed at diluting China’s dominant position in the sector.

 

Pakistan, meanwhile, is preparing to host its own international minerals conference in April and has invited both the United States and China to participate, diplomatic sources said.
The Pakistan Minerals Invest­ment Forum (PMIF) 2026, scheduled for April 8-9 in Islamabad, aims to attract foreign investment to unlock what officials estimate could translate into $6-8 billion in annual mineral export potential.

In response to the announcement, the Balochistan government agreed to release all government employees recently arrested by police while attempting to enter the “Red Zone”.
The decision was reached during a meeting between an authorised government committee and an All Parties delegation representing a broad spectrum of political leadership, including the Awami National Party (ANP), National Party, Pakhtunkhwa National Awami Party (PkNAP), and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).
During the session, the political coalition formally ended its protest movement, citing the prevailing circumstances in Balochistan. In turn, the government confirmed it would move forward with the release of detained employees to de-escalate tensions.
The two sides scheduled a follow-up meeting for Feb 12. During that session, senior political leaders and the government committee are expected to formulate a comprehensive strategy to resolve all remaining pending issues.
The government delegation included Mir Shoaib Nosherwani, provincial minister for finance and minerals; Raheela Hameed Durrani, provincial education minister; and Provincial Minister Ali Madad Jattak. 
Other government representatives included Pakistan Peoples Party leader Syed Iqbal Shah, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister Imran Zarkoon, and Special Secretary Finance Arif Khan Achakzai.
The All Parties delegation featured prominent leaders, including ANP Prov­incial President Asghar Khan Achakzai, National Party Central Vice President Dr. Ishaq Baloch, PkNAP Provincial President Nasrullah Khan Zerey, and PTI’s Salam Agha. Additional participants included Hazara Democratic Party leader Asmat Yari, ANP’s Sanaullah Kakar, National Party’s Mir Inayat Buzdar, employees’ representative Ismail Kasi, and Inayat Shah of the National Democratic Movement.

Talking to reporters in the opposition chamber of the Legislative Assembly, Mr Haider said that despite having 22 ministers, the government’s “hunger for power has not diminished” that he claimed was evident from “undue interference in opposition constituencies and the replacement of elected representatives with party workers”.
“This approach is neither justified nor acceptable,” he said.

Raja Farooq Haider irked by alleged sidelining of leaders by PPP ministers

Mr Haider maintained that the PML-N had secured thousands of votes from every constituency in AJK and questioned why its ticket-holders were being sidelined. “In constituencies where PPP MLAs exist, consultations should also be held with PML-N ticket-holders,” he demanded.
Raising concerns over governance, the former premier called for the criteria for appointments up to Grade-5 to be made public. He also questioned the government’s decision to launch development projects worth billions of rupees while claiming a shortage of funds.
“If the government does not act with fairness, we will be left with no option but to approach the courts,” he warned.
Mr Haider also urged Prime Minister Faisal Mumtaz Rathore to uphold the neutrality of his office. “He should remember that he is the prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, not a representative of a political party,” he said.
Responding to a question, the former premier maintained that the office of the AJK president was the constitutional right of political parties and should not be assigned to non-political individuals. He said he fully endorsed the stance of PML-N President Shah Ghulam Qadir on the issue, adding that it reflected a unanimous position within the party.

“We hope the council will act swiftly to designate BLA under the 1267 sanctions regime, acceding to the listing request that is currently under consideration,” Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, told a UNSC briefing on ‘Threats to International Peace and Security caused by Terrorist Acts’.







In his remarks, the envoy thanked UNSC members for issuing a press statement condemning the recent attacks in Balochistan and expressed appreciation for what he described as an international “outpouring of support and solidarity with Pakistan”.
“We remain resolute in eliminating this externally sponsored scourge from our soil and exposing the sponsors, financiers, aiders and abettors sitting across our borders,” Ambassador Ahmad said.
Ambassador Ahmad said Pakistan had paid a heavy price in the global fight against terrorism.
“As a frontline state in the global counterterrorism effort, we have sacrificed blood and treasure — with more than 90,000 casualties and staggering economic losses over the years,” he said.
Recalling Pakistan’s role in earlier counterterrorism efforts, he said the Al Qaeda “core” was “largely decimated in Afghanistan due to Pakistan’s instrumental efforts,” adding that Pakistan had also played a leading role in combating the militant Islamic State group’s regional affiliate.
However, Ambassador Ahmad warned that the security situation had deteriorated in recent years, particularly after the Taliban takeover of Kabul.
“Externally sponsored and foreign-funded proxy terrorist groups such as Fitna al Khawarij TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) and Fitna al Hindustan BLA and its Majeed Brigade have got a new lease of life,” he said.
“Operating with virtual impunity from Afghan soil and with the active support of our eastern neighbour, these groups are responsible for heinous terrorist attacks inside Pakistan.”
Referring to the latest violence in Balochistan, he said the BLA had claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks across multiple locations.
“Just this weekend, BLA claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks across multiple locations in Balochistan Province that resulted in the martyrdom of 48 innocent civilians, including five women and three children,” he said, adding that “145 BLA terrorists were neutralised during the effective riposte by our valiant security forces”.
It is worth mentioning that last year in August, the US State Department added BLA and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, to its Foreign Terrorist Organisation list.
In his remarks, Ambassador Ahmad also raised concerns about the evolving regional threat emanating from Afghanistan, citing findings by the UN’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team.
“These terrorist groups pose a threat not only to Pakistan, but to the entire region and beyond,” he warned, pointing to recent attacks in Central Asia near the Afghan border as validation of earlier concerns.
He also cautioned against the proliferation of advanced weapons left behind after the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.
“It has become imperative to prevent the billions of dollars of sophisticated weapons and equipment left behind by foreign forces in Afghanistan from falling into the hands of terrorists,” he said, calling for accountability of “external destabilising actors who support, finance and arm these groups, including their proxies in Afghanistan”.
He urged the international community to respond collectively, without double standards.
“The international community must address the contemporary terrorist threat through a collective, comprehensive and coordinated response, including through the balanced implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,” he said.
Ambassador Ahmad also criticised what he described as selective approaches to counterterrorism, arguing that “counterterrorism policies have so far singled out only the adherents of one religion”.
“There must be zero tolerance for state terrorism,” he said, referring to the situation in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, and called for recognition of “legitimate struggles of peoples against foreign occupation” in line with UN resolutions.
He said the upcoming ninth review of the Global Counterterrorism Strategy later this year provided an opportunity to “renew our collective resolve” and address existing gaps.
“Pakistan will continue to support multilateral efforts aimed at devising comprehensive and holistic strategies to combat and eradicate this menace through collective endeavours and cooperation,” he added.</p><small>2026-02-04 19:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/042134434033933.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971047/there-should-be-no-politics-in-sports-pm-on-decision-to-boycott-match-against-india-in-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>‘There should be no politics in sports’: PM on decision to boycott match against India in T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Commenting on the decision to boycott the match against India in the T20 World Cup, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said that there “should be no politics in sports”.
He made the remarks while addressing the federal cabinet in Islamabad. The remarks were televised.
“We have taken a clear stand regarding the T20 World Cup that we will not play the match against India,” he said.
“There should be no politics in sports,” he said. “We have taken this stand after deliberating on it carefully,” he said, calling it an “appropriate decision”.

 


It should be noted that the government on Sunday gave the cricket team the nod to participate in the upcoming T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held on Feb 15 in Colombo.
The development came after Bangladesh’s withdrawal from the tournament amid tensions with India, which is one of the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup.
At the start of his address, PM Shehbaz began by talking about the attacks in Balochistan.
“Within three to four days, 180 terrorists were sent to hell,” he said. “As a result, 17 personnel embraced martyrdom. Similarly, 31 civilians were martyred.”
He added that a “heartbreaking incident” took place in Gwadar, where five women and children were martyred.
“These people (terrorists) are not human,” the premier said.
PM Shehbaz said that the nation would never forget the sacrifice of security forces and that since Marka-i-Haq — the name for Pakistan’s brief military conflict against India last year — Pakistan’s “hostile eastern neighbour” and other khawarij were conspiring against the country’s progress and prosperity.
Khawarij is a term used by the state to designate members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“God willing, this will not happen. We will completely eradicate terrorism and Pakistan will find success on the path of progress,” PM Shehbaz vowed.
He added that the nation should remember how terrorists killed women, children and people who were trying to work.
“It is a terrible incident and the whole nation is mourning, but it is standing with its law enforcement agencies and the Pakistan armed forces,” the premier added.
“The day will come when these sacrifices will be worthwhile and the scourge of terrorism will be erased from this country.”
Switching gears and discussing the tensions in Iran, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan has played a “brotherly role”.
“Myself, the deputy prime minister and the field marshal met the Iranian leadership on multiple occasions and we had telephone conversations,” he outlined. “We had several discussions and played our brotherly role as best we could.”
The premier expressed the hope that through dialogue, a peaceful path would emerge leading to regional peace.
Speaking about Kashmir Day on February 5 (tomorrow), PM Shehbaz said that the nation, from Peshawar to Karachi, would express solidarity with freedom movements within the Indian-occupied territory.
“The people will express their passionate devotion to Kashmir in different cities,” the premier said. “I personally will be heading to Azad Kashmir tomorrow and we will convey a message of solidarity on behalf of the whole nation.”
PM Shehbaz then spoke about his meeting with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.
“I called him the day he was elected and assured him that he would have the full support of the Centre, regardless of whatever party he belongs to,” the premier recounted.
“I told him that Pakistan comes before the party and that he is the chief minister of an important, beautiful province where the people are proud Pakistanis and brave. They have also sacrificed much.”
The premier noted that during the 2010 National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Rs800 billion was allocated to KP for counter-terrorism, security and policing.
“I told him that we gave this money under the NFC, but we have yet to see the results,” he said. “I said that the Safe City project remains incomplete, but he assured me that he intends to complete it.
“I spoke to him again, and he mentioned that some payments have been delayed,” the premier added.
“I immediately tasked [Planning Minister] Ahsan Iqbal, the finance minister and the finance secretary to meet him (KP CM) and, wherever there are delays in payments, to resolve them,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-04 18:08</small></div><hr>
