Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have witnessed terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Kohat District Police Officer (DPO) Dr Zahidullah Khan said that a “large number of miscreants” had attacked a checkpost in Kohat’s Darra Adamkhel from “multiple sides” at 1am.
He said that an exchange of fire then took place between the police and the unidentified assailants, which claimed the life of one cop and left an FC official injured. He said that the exchange of fire went on for two-and-a-half hours.
“The unidentified assailants aimed to capture the checkpost, but their attempt was thwarted,” he said, adding that a search operation was currently under way.
“Three improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have been recovered so far during the clearance operation,” the DPO said.
Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi condemned the attack and paid tribute to the martyred cop. In a statement, he also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
“The sacrifices of the police in the war against terrorism will not go in vain,” he added.
The attack comes a day after a soldier was martyred and another injured when unidentified assailants opened fire on them near KP’s Bannu district.
On Sept 1, a police constable embra­ced martyrdom and ano­t­her sustained serious injuries in an attack on a police post in Mir Ali.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies.
According to a Dawn report, KP remained the most affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.</p><small>2025-10-06 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/061154200ca4312.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946977/weakened-storm-likely-to-bring-isolated-rain-to-sindh-balochistan-coastal-areas-today-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Weakened storm likely to bring isolated rain to Sindh, Balochistan coastal areas today: PMD</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said on Monday that cyclonic storm Shakhti had weakened in severity but would still cause isolated rains in the coastal areas of Sindh and Balochistan today.
A deepening depression over the Arabian Sea on Friday intensified into a cyclone by the name of Shakhti, escalating into a severe cyclonic storm within the next 24 hours as it headed towards the central-north Arabian Sea.
A PMD update issued at 11am and posted on social media platform X said, “The severe cyclonic storm Shakhti over west central and adjoining northwest of the Arabian Sea has weakened into a cyclonic storm during the last six hours.”
The department said that the system was likely to move east-southeastwards over the same region and weaken into depression by the next 24 hours, adding that under its influence isolated rain was likely in the coastal areas of Sindh and Balochistan today.
The statement further added that sea conditions were expected to remain rough due to “squally winds” gusting to 90 kilometres per hour near the Sindh coast, warning fishermen against venturing into the deep sea until tomorrow.
While sea conditions will remain “very rough to high and then very high” over the north-west and west-central Arabian Sea over the next 24 hours, the severity is expected to gradually reduce after this.
 






On Sunday, Security forces and locals rescued over a dozen fishing boats trapped in the Arabian Sea by high tides triggered by the cyclone.
Balochistan’s Provincial Secretary for Fisheries Tariq Qamar Baloch said that all field officers had been placed on high alert and the department was in close coordination with the Pakistan Navy, Levies Force, and local administration to monitor the situation.</p><small>2025-10-06 07:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06095850a272dba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946958/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-wants-to-join-hands-with-malaysia-for-mutually-beneficial-projects' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz says Pakistan wants to ‘join hands’ with Malaysia for mutually beneficial projects</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Monday that Pakistan wanted to “join hands” with Malaysia for mutually beneficial projects which allowed for expertise from the two countries to come together.
The premier, who is on a state visit to Malaysia, made the remarks while addressing a joint presser alongside his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya following bilateral talks between the two leaders.
PM Shehbaz began his media talk by thanking Ibrahim on behalf of the people of Pakistan for extending an exceptionally warm welcome to the visiting delegation and called the country a “second home”.
“This is my first visit to your great country but believe me, ever since we arrived here last night, I [see] familiar faces — very cordial, very warm — as if we have known each other for ages and that stems from sincerity of purpose and very true friendship. It’s like a family reunion,” he said.
“The way you are focused on building your great country into one of the most strong economies in the region and around the globe speaks volumes about your leadership skills, vision, and dynamism,” the premier said.
 






PM Shehbaz said that he and Ibrahim had “very productive discussions” and they had covered a wide range of matters pertaining to bilateral relations and other international matters during a meeting held prior to the joint presser.
“I am very happy that our views converge on almost all important issues,” he said. He further said that the Malaysian premier’s visit to Pakistan last year was memorable in terms of further cementing bilateral relations.
“Today, I am very happy that you have expressed your vision [on] how to build our economic and trade relations, how to promote joint ventures, how to encourage investment […], how we can benefit from your vast experience in technology, artificial intelligence and other areas of economic growth where Malaysia has done remarkably well,” he said, adding that Pakistan stood to benefit from Malaysian experience in these areas.
“Today, I want to make it publicly known that Pakistan wants to join hands with Malaysia, not only to benefit from your experience, but to have joint ventures, mutually beneficial projects, where Malaysian and Pakistani expertise can come together,” he said.
 






The premier noted that there were 150,000 Pakistanis in Malaysia who were contributing to national building efforts. “I think all this put together gives us great encouragement and hope that we can use this potential and make our economies stronger,” he said.
He noted that Ibrahim, in his remarks, had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan to Malaysia worth $200 million. “I am eternally grateful to you […] but let me also make it abundantly clear for our Malaysian importers and officials that this quota of exporting meat will be regulated by a market price mechanism.
“It  will be regulated by all halal certification required by Malaysian custom and food authorities […]. I want to assure you that we will make all possible efforts to meet all your terms and conditions and only on that basis, we will  achieve not only this quota of $200m, but in times to come it will increase and  have a quantum jump,” he said.
The premier further said that an Urdu translation had been launched for Ibrahim’s book Script which detailed the latter’s vision of sustainability, innovation, research and development.
“These are the great virtues and values that brother Ibrahim has inked in this script and I think it will speak across borders for this generation and coming generations,” he said.
 






He further said that nations were not built with a magic wand but rather through “hard work, untiring efforts and unwavering commitment”.
“When I leave this great country tomorrow […] I will be going back far more informed than ever before, far more impressed than ever before, far more comforted than ever before,” he said.
Talking about Pakistan’s youth and their potential, he said, “If we can really dedicate ourselves to injecting modern technology in their souls, they will be great hands, great builders of Pakistan. I have no doubt about it,” he said.
He concluded his remarks by expressing the wish for Malaysia to continue prospering.
Later, the two premiers also witnessed an exchange of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between Pakistan and Malaysia.
 






PM Ibrahim ‘extremely appreciative’ of Pakistan’s stance on Palestine
In his remarks, the Malaysian premier acknowledged the presence and contribution of Pakistani professionals as well as students in Malaysian universities.
He said that his country had increased the import of rice from Pakistan. He stated there was also an interest regarding importing meat and Malaysia would facilitate this, noting that Shehbaz had mentioned exports worth $200 million.
Ibrahim humourously quipped that when he visited PM Shehbaz at his hotel at night, the latter “politely suggested” this but also “harassed”.
“So I certainly welcome that and will discuss with my team,” he said.
Calling PM Shehbaz a “brother”, Ibrahim also said that the former had also encouraged cooperation in information technology and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
“Pakistan was among the Muslim countries who were clearly far ahead initially in these fields and that potential is still there. Now that we have secured stability in the country, we certainly will welcome further collaboration,” he said.
Regarding regional and international issues, he said that the two discussed establishing peace in the subcontinent and also joint efforts for countering terrorism.
He also stated that he was “extremely appreciative” of Pakistan’s stance on the Palestine and Gaza issue.
 
 

“We jointly look favourably at the 20-point peace initiative by US President Donald Trump. Although Malaysia does express some concerns, but at least on the point of cessation of hostilities, stopping the insane bombings and killings by the Zionist Israeli regime, that at least is a clear position taken by Arab countries, Muslim countries, and most of the countries in the world now,” he said, expressing the hope for peace in the Palestinian enclave.
“Our joint position in supporting this peace initiative would probably further help this desire to achieve durable peace,” he said.
PM given guard of honour
After the presser wrapped up, Ibrahim took to social media platform X and said: “This morning, I welcomed Pakistan’s Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif [who is] starting his three-day visit to Malaysia.”
“He and his delegation received an official welcome, including an honour guard inspection by the Batalion Pertama Rejimen Renjer Diraja. After the ceremony, we held bilateral talks in a warm, constructive atmosphere,” he said.
“The visit enhances Malaysia-Pakistan friendship and opens a new chapter of strategic cooperation for our peoples,” he said.
 






PM Shehbaz was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office.
 






According to Radio Pakistan, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier.
Prior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement.
“I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.
Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.
 






‘Visit reflects enduring partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia’
The Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”
Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.</p><small>2025-10-06 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05212259302ddf7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946816/pakistan-sees-sharpest-drop-in-default-risk-only-country-showing-consistent-improvement-finance-ministers-aide' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan sees ‘sharpest drop’ in default risk; only country showing consistent improvement: finance minister’s aide</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has recorded one of the “sharpest drops” in sovereign default risk globally and now ranks as the second-best performer in the world, according to Credit Default Swap (CDS)-implied data reported by Bloomberg, adviser to the finance minister Khurram Schehzad said on Sunday.
A Credit Default Swap-implied probability estimates the likelihood that a borrower — such as a company or a country — will fail to repay its debt. This probability is derived from the market price of its CDS, which is a type of financial insurance investors buy to protect themselves against the risk of default, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
If the cost of a CDS drops, it means investors see the borrower as less risky. So, when Pakistan’s CDS-implied probability falls sharply, it indicates that global investors believe the country’s chances of defaulting on its debt have significantly decreased.
“As per the latest data posted by Bloomberg, Pakistan stands out globally as the 2nd most improved economy in terms of reduction in sovereign default risk, as measured by CDS-implied default probability globally,” Schehzad wrote in a post on X.
 






He added that the country stood second only to Turkiye in the global emerging market (EM) rankings in default risk reduction, as the country has recorded one of the sharpest drops in sovereign default risk globally over the last 15 months (from June 2024 to September 2025).
“Notably, Pakistan is the only country in the EM sample showing consistent quarterly improvement across the past year,” he wrote, adding that the country’s default probability has decreased by 2,200 basis points.
“This marks the sharpest decline among major EMs, ahead of South Africa (3 per cent), EI Salvador (2pc). In contrast, countries like Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, and others have seen their default risks rise.”
Schehzad further said the sharp decline in the country’s risk signalled “strengthening investor confidence, underpinned by macroeconomic stabilisation, structural reforms, timely debt servicing, and staying the course with the International Monetary Fund.”
He also cited the recent positive ratings movements from global credit rating agencies like S&P Global, Fitch, and Moody’s as a factor.
In a message to investors, Schehzad said. “Pakistan is steadily rebuilding market credibility, standing out as one of the most improved sovereign credit stories in the emerging market universe.”
Pakistan faced a prolonged economic crisis over the last few years, marked by critically low foreign exchange reserves, an acute balance-of-payment crisis, and the looming risk of default in 2023. The crisis was averted after the IMF released a crucial loan tranche, while support from friendly countries, including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, also played a key role.
After averting default, Pakistan has undertaken tough IMF-prescribed reforms to stabilise its economy and bolster macroeconomic indicators.</p><small>2025-10-06 06:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06113035e531d12.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946971/hospital-fire-kills-at-least-6-patients-in-indias-jaipur-officials-say' target='_blank'><strong>Hospital fire kills at least 6 patients in India’s Jaipur, officials say</strong></a><br><p>A hospital blaze caused by a suspected short-circuit killed at least six patients in a trauma centre at the largest state-run hospital in India’s northwestern city of Jaipur, and injured five, officials said on Monday.
The fire began in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Sawai Man Singh Hospital, “releasing toxic gases”, hospital official Anurag Dhakad told the ANI news agency, adding that a short-circuit was the suspected cause.
“Five patients are still critical,” he said, while 13 had been safely evacuated from the two wards of the hospital in the capital of Rajasthan, which draws patients from across the desert state.
 






Fire brigade teams arrived within 20 minutes after the fire began late on Sunday in the neurosurgery ICU, hospital superintendent Sushil Kumar Bhati told the agency.
Most of the hospital equipment was gutted in the roughly two hours it took to bring the fire under control, however, broadcaster NDTV said.
Jaipur Police chief Biju George Joseph said a forensic investigation would determine the exact cause.
The government of Rajasthan, whose capital is Jaipur, has set up a panel to investigate the cause, ANI said.
 
 

It will study the hospital’s firefighting arrangements and the management’s response, as well as steps to avoid similar incidents, the agency added.
Similar hospital fires in India have been blamed on short circuits in electronic equipment.
Ten newborns died from burns and suffocation after a fire in November at a neonatal intensive care unit in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
In May 2024, six newborns died in a fire at a baby care hospital in New Delhi, the capital.</p><small>2025-10-06 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06105821e371250.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946967/over-a-dozen-wounded-in-rare-sydney-mass-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Over a dozen wounded in rare Sydney mass shooting</strong></a><br><p>A 60-year-old man was in custody in Australia on Monday after police said he shot up to 50 bullets into a busy Sydney street, wounding more than a dozen people.
Police were called on Sunday evening to the city’s Inner West, where the alleged gunman was firing from his property at random at passing cars and police.
A large contingent of police swarmed the area and locked down the street, before entering the property above a business and arresting the man. They seized a rifle from the scene.
Office worker Joe Azar said he was working across the road when he heard what he thought were fireworks or rocks being thrown at the windows.
“Some guy’s windshield blew up, then the bus stop glass shattered,” Azar told The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.
“The surreal feeling kicked in like, ‘Oh, this is what’s happening’,” he said.
“It was frantic. It all happened so quick, so I couldn’t comprehend what was going on,” he added.
Police had initially said up to a hundred bullets were fired and 20 people were wounded. But on Monday, New South Wales Police Acting Superintendent Stephen Parry revised the number of shots to around 50 and the toll of wounded to 16.
“In my 35 years in the police, there’s been very few incidents of this nature where somebody is randomly targeting people in the street,” he added.
The accused shooter was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries to the area around his eyes sustained during his arrest.
No charges have been laid against the alleged gunman yet. A police investigation is ongoing.
One man self-presented to hospital with a gunshot wound following the incident, but would likely survive, police said. The remaining people were treated by ambulance staff for minor injuries, including shattered glass as bullets hit their car windows.
‘Terrifying’
New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon on Monday described the shooting as “serious and terrifying”.
The gunman’s motive was unclear but there were “no known links to terrorism activity or any gang activity”, he told local radio station 2GB.
One witness who gave his name as Tadgh told the national broadcaster ABC he had been watching rugby when he first heard the gunshots.
“It was very loud and ‘bang, bang, bang’ and flash-bangs and sparks and smoke and the whole works. It was something out of a movie, really,” he said.
Mass shootings are relatively rare in Australia. A ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons has been in place since 1996, when a lone gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania.
In August, alleged gunman Dezi Freeman went on the run in the bush after being accused of killing two police officers. He remains at large.
And in 2022, six people including two police officers were killed in a shooting near the small Queensland town of Wieambilla.</p><small>2025-10-06 06:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06104628a1cb3d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946854/govt-has-withdrawn-aimal-walis-security-claims-anp' target='_blank'><strong>Govt has withdrawn Aimal Wali’s security, claims ANP</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The federal and provincial governments withdrew police and Federal Constabulary security protection to Awami National Party central president Senator Aimal Wali Khan and his family, following his critical speech in the upper house of parliament.
The withdrawal of security came despite assurances by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in a personal telephone call to Aimal Wali with the latter thanking the chief minister.
However, it transpired later that police personnel were reportedly withdrawn which, the provincial government’s spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif refuted.
 






Meanwhile, the chief minister’s focal person on digital media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi, in a post on social media platform ‘X’ said the provincial government deployed four police personnel for Mr Khan’s security while eight personnel were deployed at his residence in Charsadda district.
 







CM’s focal person says four policemen deployed for ANP leader’s security while eight personnel posted at his residence in Charsadda

However, ANP’s central spokesperson said it was an offer which was not accepted as yet.
He appreciated the provincial government’s gesture. “We thank the KP government but, also, we can provide security to our provincial president,” he said.
Similarly, Walibagh, the residence of Aimal Wali, said that federal government had also withdrawn Federal Constabulary from the abode of ANP chief and his father Asfandyar Wali Khan.
On Saturday, federal government withdrew Federal Constabulary personnel deployed for Aimal Wali’s security following his speech wherein he criticised Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir for allegedly presenting samples of rare earth metals to US President Donald Trump in Washington.
Aimal Wali, in a tweet on his X account [former twitter] said that federal government/interior ministry took back all the security personnel allotted to him, his father and family. He said that if anything happened to him or his family, the responsibility would rest with the government.
 






“I’ll keep on speaking for the public and am ready for anything coming my way. Yes, I will be moving more securely with private personal and Salaars [referring to ANP workers],” the ANP president tweeted.
Soon after the federal government’s decision, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur called Aimal Wali and assured him that the provincial government would make security arrangements for him and his family and directed KP police chief in that regard.
On Sunday, however, KP police personnel assigned for security of the ANP president were also called back. None among the police officials took the responsibility while KP police’s security division, established for providing security to VVIPs, bureaucrats and politicians, could not be reached for an official version despite repeated attempts.
“It was early in the morning when provincial government also withdrew Aimal Wali’s security and called back police personnel,” ANP central spokesperson Ehsanullah told Dawn. He said that party workers took over security of the ANP president and his father.
A statement later issued from Bacha Khan Markaz, the central office of ANP, here said that KP police chief completely disregarded directives of chief minister. He said that Mr Gandapur appeared completely powerless against the group comprising ‘Khaki patrons’ of the hybrid regime entrenched in central government and their political lackeys.
It said that Mr Gandapur personally assured Senator Aimal Wali Khan that his security detail would be maintained and not reduced.
However, despite assurance, all relevant police personnel were ordered to report back to line duties this [Sunday] morning, he said. The ANP central spokesperson asked Mr Gandapur to clarify his position.
He said that the hybrid regime refused to abide by the Constitution concerning provincial autonomy and federation. He said that ANP would devise a comprehensive plan regarding security of its leadership to effectively counter such violations and ensure protection of party leadership.
Also, the ANP leadership termed withdrawal of security of the party chief an attack on 18th Amendment.
Former chief minister and central leader of ANP Ameer Haider Khan Hoti termed the decision of withdrawing security of Aimal Wali a political revenge and questioned if any political leader’s security would be determined by centre’s likes or dislikes. He also questioned that if asking questions in the parliament was a crime.
“Withdrawing [ANP president’s] security for raising Constitutional questions in parliament is an attempt to suppress opposition,” he said.
Mr Hoti said in a statement that federal government’s interference in provincial matters was a threat to democracy.
He said that provincial police chief refused to follow Mr Gandapur’s orders.
On the other hand, KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif refuted the ANP leadership’s claim, saying provincial government did not withdraw Aimal Wali’s security.
“If the chief minister has ordered, security will be provided. How it is possible that the chief minister issues orders and security is not provided,” he questioned while talking to Dawn.

They also warned the government to refrain from endorsing any proposal, including the Abraham Accords, which they said was against the will of the Palestinian people.
Dozens of caravans from different parts of the city converged near the Nursery bus stop on Sharea Faisal, where they formed a mammoth rally addressed by leaders of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI).
Riding motorbikes, cars, buses and other modes of transport, the participants carried Palestinian flags and placards bearing images of Hamas leaders.
 







JI chief warns Islamabad against joining Abraham Accords

The march was organised by the party as a show of solidarity with Gaza, particularly in the backdrop of Israeli aggression against the Freedom Flotilla.
In his address, JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman made it clear to Islamabad that any paradigm shift in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine, set by none other than Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, would not be tolerated at any cost.
 
 

“Even decades ago, the All India Muslim League used to protest against Israel,” he said. “On March 23, 1940, two resolutions were passed by the Muslim League — one was the Pakistan Resolution and the other was for Palestine. There is only one state, and that is Palestine, and there is only one leadership in Gaza, and that is Hamas,” he said while urging the government to recognise Hamas and support it as the legitimate representative of the people of Gaza.
“Don’t dare to accept Israel or join the Abraham Accords,” he warned.
He said that the United States was directly responsible for the genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza and therefore had no right to deliver lectures on humanity.
The JI leader claimed that Israel had failed militarily in Gaza as it could not secure the release of its soldiers from Hamas and was, in fact, engaging with the group in one way or another to secure their freedom.
“Hamas is a resistance movement that represents the people of Gaza. However, the ruling class here is not even willing to mention Hamas by name because they fear any movement that originates from the people. The ruling elite dislikes any movement that opposes the US and Israel,” the JI chief added.
He also stressed the need for another UN, saying the current one had become a total failure and an “agent” of the US and Israel, having never resolved the issues faced by Muslims.
He was of the view that the massacre in Palestine happened not because of Hamas, but because of the cowardly Muslim rulers.
 






“We want to tell the rulers and opposition parties of Pakistan to abandon hypocrisy and double standards. The people of Gaza and Hamas must be accepted, and Hamas offices must be opened in Pakistan,” he said.
He also called on Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, currently in Adiala Jail, to express solidarity with Hamas and condemn Israel and the US.
“From Karachi’s Keamari to the mountains of Chitral, the public is united in one voice: we will not accept slavery to America,” he said.
“Greta Thunberg was tortured and forced to kiss the Israeli flag — this is the real face of the Zionist state,” he added.
Other leaders, including Dr Osama Razi, Monem Zafar and Advocate Saifuddin, also addressed the rally.

As per the complaint filed by Asad Abbas, the survey team leader of the agriculture department, nine armed men led by Ali Abbas threatened the team of dire consequence during a survey in Talib Wala area in Kot Momin tehsil of Sargodha. He claimed that the men stopped them from performing their official duties and forced them to leave the area.
The police registered a case against one identified and eight unknown suspects.
DPO Sohaib Ashraf took notice of the incident and directed the Kot Momin SDPO to arrest the suspects.
Meanwhile, Sargodha Commissioner Jahanzeb Awan, along with Deputy Commissioner retired Capt Muhammad Waseem, visited Kot Momin tehsil to review the ongoing and completed flood damage assessment surveys in Khan Muhammad, Sial Mor and Rahanwala areas.
On this occasion, the survey teams were briefed about the survey methodology and data collection. The commissioner directed to ensure transparency and accuracy in all stages of the survey.
He said that the survey process should be completed soon so that the affected families could get compensated. He said that after this, two additional re-verification teams would thoroughly check the records to ensure that there were no mistakes or omissions.
 
 

The commissioner stressed that the district administration, PDMA and the revenue department should maintain close contact with each other so that the relief money reaches the real victims directly.
ACCIDENT: A man died after being hit by a high-speed train on Sunday near Bhalwal.
The body of the deceased, identified as Ali Raza, was handed over to his heirs after necessary formalities.

In a meeting of the district anti-smog committee, he said that awareness should be provided to farmers to prevent stubble burning. Action should be taken against violators under a zero tolerance policy, he added.
 
 

He said that the traffic police should take strict action against smoke emitting vehicles, while the regional transport authority should ensure transparency in issuance of fitness certificates.
Along with this, the district agriculture, environment and local government departments should jointly run an awareness campaign so that the public could be informed about the harm caused by smog and how to prevent it.
Mr Abu Bakar said that as per the instructions of the Punjab government, no negligence would be tolerated during the anti-smog campaign. All officers should be present in the field and ensure compliance, so that citizens could be provided with a clean and healthy environment.

From questions of provincial autonomy to disaster management, and now, calls to redraw the country’s internal boundaries, each of these discussions is rooted in legitimate concerns: unequal development, sluggish service delivery, and political imbalance. Yet too often, the solutions proposed are reactive, fragmented, or short-sighted.
Instead of piecemeal fixes like carving out new provinces, separating disaster functions, or rolling back devolution we need a deeper conversation about what kind of governance model Pakistan really needs. Because behind every institutional failure lies a more fundamental problem: a state that struggles to function effectively at both the centre and the grassroots.
 
 

The 18th Amendment in 2010, was hailed as a democratic milestone. The amendment was designed to empower provinces, dismantle centralised authority, and bring governance closer to the people. More than a decade later, however, it’s time to ask a difficult question: has the devolution of power come at the cost of effective policymaking? In reality it has led to uneven policy implementation across provinces, created jurisdictional ambiguity and exposed the institutional fragility of our system.
The provinces, suddenly saddled with vast responsibilities, were neither administratively equipped nor financially ready. The federal government, stripped of much of its role in social sectors, lacked the tools to coordinate national-level strategies. The result: fragmented policy, duplicated efforts, and weak implementation.

In times of crisis, we need clarity and a unified command not bureaucratic overlap.

But perhaps nowhere is this governance fragmentation more dangerous than in disaster management, particularly in the era of climate change. Pakistan faces one of the world’s highest risks from climate-induced disasters ranging from floods, heatwaves and glacial melts. And yet our disaster architecture remains stuck in reactive mode. Disaster management is not a linear process.
It spans risk assessment, early warning, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. Creating two separate institutions, one for risk reduction (National Disaster Risk Management Authority) and another for disaster response (NDMA) breaks this continuum. When a flood hits, will one authority manage the data and mapping while another handles evacuation and relief?
In times of crisis, we need clarity and a unified command not bureaucratic overlap and institutional finger-pointing. Global best practices point in a different direction. Countries like Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines — each facing frequent natural disasters have chosen integrated disaster management authorities, where risk reduction and response are handled under one roof. The UN’s Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction also emphasises the importance of mainstreaming risk into all phases of disaster management, not siloing it in a separate entity.
The third idea currently gaining traction in political circles is creating new provinces.
Pakistan has long wrestled with questions of federalism, representation, and administrative efficiency. One of the most persistent debates in this regard is whether the country’s large provinces, particularly Punjab, should be divided into smaller administrative units. On the surface, the argument makes sense: smaller provinces would presumably bring government closer to the people, reduce bureaucratic inertia, and help address long-standing grievances of regional neglect. But dig deeper, and it becomes clear that the issue is far more complex.
Beyond governance concerns, there’s the federal imbalance created by Punjab’s numerical dominance. With over 50 per cent of the country’s population, Punjab holds the largest number of seats in the National Assembly. This has long been a source of resentment among smaller provinces, who perceive Punjab’s dominance as a threat to equitable federalism.
However, proponents of smaller provinces often ignore the massive financial, political, and logistical costs involved. Each new province would require its own governor house, provincial assembly, cabinet, civil service, judiciary, police, and infrastructure. In a country already facing a serious fiscal crunch, this will add to the burden.
Worse still, the process of redrawing provincial boundaries is almost always politically charged. Demands for new provinces often follow ethnic, linguistic, or sectarian lines. Such identity-driven divisions risk deepening societal fractures, rather than healing them.
There’s also the constitutional hurdle. Under Article 239(4) of the Constitution, a new province can only be created with a two-thirds majority in the concerned provincial assembly. That effectively gives existing provincial power centres veto power over any proposed division. In other words, no new province is likely to be formed without the consent of the very political elites who stand to lose the most.
Rather than focusing solely on carving up provinces, perhaps the real solution lies in strengthening local governance. Pakistan’s districts and divisions can be empowered with administrative and financial autonomy, allowing for more responsive governance without the constitutional and political drama of redrawing provincial boundaries. Effective local government systems can serve the same purpose as smaller provinces. And unlike new provinces, empowering local governments doesn’t require constitutional amendments or new assemblies. It just requires political will.
Similarly, there’s a need for fairer resource distribution between and within provinces. Mechanisms like the National Finance Commission award must be revisited to ensure equitable development, particularly in neglected regions of larger provinces.
Pakistan’s real challenge is not geography, it’s governance. Creating new provinces without a serious plan for local empowerment, fiscal management, and political consensus could do more harm than good. Instead of redrawing maps, we should focus on redesigning the system that serves all citizens. Governance in Pakistan needs a reset, not in form, but in function. We need a system that delivers.

• State neglects its duties due to political expediency, remarks Anis Haroon
• Mehnaz Rehman cites low literacy levels and ignorance behind such killings
• IGP has directed police to conduct thorough investigations in such cases
KARACHI: Civil society and rights activists have expressed concerns over the poor enforcement of already existing laws to curb the menace of so-called “honour killings”, or karo-kari, amid an alarming surge in such cases in Sindh during the current year, with the majority of victims being women.
According to data, 142 people have been killed in Sindh this year (till September) under the pretext of karo-kari (honour killing), of whom 105 victims were women. The statistics paint a grim picture of gender-based violence deeply rooted in patriarchal norms and cultural justifications.
Data compiled by police reveals that in many of these cases, the perpetrators were the victims’ own family members. These included 38 husbands, 24 brothers, six fathers, and even sons, daughters, mothers, and sisters. Additionally, 46 extended relatives and seven individuals from outside the family, such as neighbours and friends, were also implicated.
 
 

Rights activists have stressed the urgent need for strict measures by the authorities to address this crisis.
Talking to Dawn, rights activist Anis Haroon said there were already sufficient laws to curb “honour killings” but the issue lay in their implementation. It was the responsibility of the state to enforce those laws, but the state “neglects its duties due to political expediency,” said Ms Haroon.
She pointed out that awareness among the public was increasing that so-called honour killing was not an honourable act but rather a crime.
About Sindh in particular, she said that the upper parts of the province were troubled areas where more work needed to be done along with strict enforcement of laws relating to honour killings. She also said that those who violated these laws were often “patronised” by the authorities.
‘Karo-kari has become an industry’
Mehnaz Rehman, a member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, said that in honour killing cases, men often managed to escape punishment, while women were the ones who ended up being killed.
“I believe that karo-kari has become a kind of industry,” she said. “It involves blood money, compensation, and even the exchange of women through jirgas as part of settlements,” she added.
“Low literacy levels and ignorance are among the chief reasons behind such killings. An educated man would not commit such acts. Therefore, we need to educate people more and more on this issue,” she concluded.
Rights advocate and noted lawyer Sara Malkani emphasised the need for greater public awareness around these issues.
She said that the continued occurrence of such incidents highlighted the urgent need to strengthen protection mechanisms. “We must focus on providing shelter and safety, especially for women,” she said. “The police should prioritise their protection, and victims must feel safe and confident to approach law enforcement.”
‘Prevention of honour killings lies with provincial govt’
When contacted in this regard, a spokesperson for the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sindh told Dawn that the prevention of cases related to so-called honour killings was primarily the duty of the provincial government.
“Police department is an investigative body. More work in this regard is to be done by the Sindh government to educate people and spread awareness in society that this [honour killing] is a wrong thing.”
“However, the IGP has directed the police to make such killings more punishable. Now, the SHOs themselves would register cases of honour killings.”
He referred to a recent review meeting held by IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon to examine, among other things, the karo-kari cases.
According to a statement issued after the meeting, it was decided that the investigation of karo-kari cases would be significantly strengthened through a structured and accountable approach. Each case will be registered under the complainantship of the SHO, and a DSP-rank officer will be appointed as the supervisory officer to ensure thorough oversight.
Officers were directed to prepare separate, detailed recommendations for each case, identifying any negligence, collusion, or procedural lapses, along with suggestions for disciplinary actions or punishments.

His plan was cautiously welcomed across the world in the hope that it might end the two-year war. But it was accompanied by doubts whether it would lead to an agreement, be implementable and bring about lasting peace.
The proposal seeks an immediate ceasefire, exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, disarmament of Hamas, deployment of a stabilisation force and gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The plan’s present 20 points advantage Israel, which is why many Palestinians and others saw it as a formula to secure Israel’s goals and objectives.
Some of the eight Muslim countries consulted by Trump, including Pakistan, walked back their earlier enthusiasm by pointing out that the plan announced by the US president wasn’t what he discussed with them in New York. It was apparent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had prevailed on Trump to make significant changes in the plan, infuriating Arab officials involved in negotiations.
This explains Netanyahu’s upbeat remarks at the joint presser with Trump where he said Israel’s war aims are achieved by the plan: for Hamas to be disarmed, Gaza demilitarised and no future Palestinian state to be established.
Subsequently, in a video message in Hebrew he said Israeli forces “will remain in most of the territory” as part of Trump’s plan, and that Israel did “absolutely not” agree to a Palestinian state.
Make-or-break for the peace process was how Hamas would respond to Trump’s plan. Its qualified response was one of constructive ambiguity. The Palestinian group said it accepted some elements of Trump’s plan but made it clear it sought further negotiations on other terms.
In its statement it expressed readiness “to release all occupation captives — both living and the remains — according to the exchange formula outlined in President Trump’s proposal” and create the field conditions for this. Hamas offered to hand over power to “a Palestinian body of independent technocrats based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing”.
It also set out conditions, saying aspects of Trump’s plan concerning Gaza’s future and Palestinians’ “inalienable rights” would have to be decided after consultation with other Palestinian factions on the basis of a “unanimous national position and relevant international laws and resolutions”.

Tough negotiations lie ahead which have to overcome many obstacles.

President Trump swiftly welcomed Hamas’s statement, flipping from his previous threatening posture (of “all hell” breaking out if Hamas didn’t accept his plan) to declaring he believed Hamas was “ready for a lasting peace”. He called on Israel to immediately stop the bombing and in a video message, said “Everybody was unified in wanting this war to end and seeing peace in the Middle East, and we’re very close to achieving that.” Israel’s initial response was to say it was preparing for “immediate implementation” of the first stage of the plan for the prompt release of all hostages.
Intense negotiations lie ahead with many obstacles to overcome and, if agreement is to be reached, concessions for all sides to make. Among the terms Hamas would want to negotiate are details of the Israeli withdrawal and deployment of an international stabilisation force under Trump’s plan.
Hamas’s statement didn’t say anything about the demand for its disbandment. But its position was clearly articulated by a top Hamas official, Mousa Abu Marzouk in an interview with Al Jazeera. He said Hamas would only hand over weapons “if the occupation ends and Palestinians can govern themselves”.
 
 

In its present shape, the Trump plan is light on detail and vague on core issues. The only timeline specified in the proposal is that 72 hours after the agreement is concluded all hostages are to be released. Once they are freed there is no guarantee Netanyahu, untrustworthy as he is, will abide by the rest of the agreement. There is no provision in the plan for a permanent ceasefire.
 
 

No timelines or deadline are given for the phased Israeli withdrawal, which is linked to Gaza’s ‘demilitarisation’, whose progress the US and Israel will determine. Nor is it assured that the withdrawal will be comprehensive. The provision for an Israeli “security perimeter presence” until Gaza is “secure from any resurgent terror threat” is a recipe for indefinite stay by Israeli forces in the territory.
This hardly holds out the assurance of an end to Israeli occupation and permanent withdrawal even if the plan says “Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza”. These terms would have to be renegotiated if Hamas is to come fully on board with the US plan. Trump says Israel has agreed to an ‘initial withdrawal line’ in Gaza, which awaits a nod from Hamas for the ceasefire to take effect. But this will only be a tentative and fragile start to a complicated process.
Details about the international stabilisation force (ISF) will also need to be fleshed out. Will the international stabilisation force have a role in demilitarisation? Its mandate, rules of engagement and exact role and responsibilities will have to be clarified and agreed on. What the plan says is that it will “work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas” (Pakistan should take note as it is said to be considering contributing troops to this force). The plan suggests its role will also be to “prevent munitions from entering Gaza”.
The most controversial part of the Trump plan are the governance arrangements. A committee of Palestinian technocrats and international experts are to be responsible for daily governance. It will be supervised by an “international transitional body” called the “Board of Peace”, headed by Trump himself and including former British prime minister Tony Blair. Palestinians rightly see this as a colonial project that harkens back to the US-British occupation of Iraq. It robs the Palestinians of agency and negates any notion of the Palestinians determining their own future.
The big hole in the plan, consistent with Netanyahu’s vision, is the absence of any provision for a Palestinian state or a two-state solution (supported by almost the entire world but opposed by the US and Israel). There is a vague formulation of a “pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” but conditioned on the Palestinian Authority implementing (unspecified) reforms, that presumably meet US/ Israeli benchmarks.
It is on these elements that consensus will arguably be the most challenging to evolve. The outcome will depend on how much pressure Trump will exert on Netanyahu and whether enough trust can be built among the parties. The hope is that this doesn’t become a lost opportunity for peace.

Yet the true advantage of this shift will not be decided in international forums but in whether stability can be translated into an effective economic recovery and sustained growth.
At the heart of this challenge lies the country’s human resource base. Exports, investment, and competitiveness cannot rely solely on natural resources or borrowed capital; they depend on the capacity of Pakistan’s human resource base to transform and drive an export-led economy based on both a competitive industrial base and value-added services.
We must learn from the emerging economies. Global experience demonstrates that the path to prosperity lies in skills and efficiency. Vietnam embedded training centres inside its industrial parks, producing workers tailored to industry needs. Within two decades, it scaled garments and electronics before moving into higher technology exports.
Bangladesh harnessed women’s participation as a competitive advantage, training millions for garment and later IT services, lifting exports above $40 billion. Malaysia institutionalised consistency through its Economic Planning Unit, aligning skills, industry priorities, and foreign investment across political cycles.

By investing in its people, Pakistan’s exports can be boosted, imports replaced, investment attracted, and income per capita increased

Rwanda, with no resource base, has demonstrated how governance and inclusion could turn Information and Communication Technology, tourism, and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) into national strengths. The lesson is clear: sustainable growth is not only about natural wealth but about human efficiency, technology adoption, and scale.
Pakistan has significant human capital gaps. Shortages exist across the spectrum of vocational training: electricians, welders, dairy specialists, logistics supervisors, nurses, and care workers.
Even basic skills like English communication, problem-solving, and compliance literacy are scarce. Women’s participation stands at just 22 per cent, one of the lowest globally, holding back both competitiveness and household incomes. Academia and industry remain disconnected, with outdated curricula failing to produce graduates who are market-ready and skilled.
To address these gaps, Pakistan should establish a Human Capital and Skills Development Board (HCSDB) under the Federal Government, with provinces and industry as equal partners.
 
 

Governance should be led by federal chairs, with representation from provincial governments, technocrats, academia, industry leaders, and chambers.
The mandate should align training with export demand or import substitution, ensure skills-transfer clauses in existing and potential foreign investments, and integrate human resource planning into the national economic recovery plan.
Multinationals already operating in Pakistan should be engaged, seeking their help to support training programmes, apprenticeships, and internships. Universities and technical institutes should collaborate to co-create curricula with industry, establish joint research labs, and align certifications with international standards.
Digital and IT should be one of the key areas of focus, with a talent ladder that spans from digital literacy and BPO to coding, analytics, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. Relocating BPO operations to second-tier cities would absorb youth and women while boosting IT and services exports.
Training in farm mechanisation, cold-chain logistics, and food certification can increase yields, reduce waste, and expand exports of fruit pulp, dairy products, halal protein, and processed foods. Skilled manpower in agro-processing will also strengthen food security.
Skilled engineers, technicians, and workers can raise quality, lower costs, and boost local employment. Every industrial cluster should be tied to nearby universities and technical institutes, creating live training pipelines linked to actual jobs.
Policy must reshape incentives around skills. Tax credits should be offered to firms that train and hire certified workers, with higher credits for women and new entrants. Exporters who expand certified employment should receive wage-support incentives tied directly to incremental export revenues. Training vouchers should only be redeemable upon verified job placement.
A National Job Exchange should connect certified candidates to employers in Pakistan and abroad, with streamlined visa and relocation processes. A Digital Skills ID should record credentials and job history, recognised globally.
Planning and delivery must be disciplined. The HCSDB should operate with concrete mandates and measurable outcomes. Subject-matter experts, drawn from both global corporates and Pakistani academia with strong industrial linkages, must guide execution with number-oriented deliverables.
In the short term, the aim should be to launch the skills authority, publish a live demand dashboard, and embed training in special economic zones.
In the medium term, the goal could be to certify 250,000 workers annually, place at least 150,000 into jobs, and add $2bn in IT and BPO exports. The country’s human resources development plan must be approved by parliament, ensuring continuity across political cycles.
By investing in its people, Pakistan can boost exports, replace high-cost imports, attract investment, increase per capita incomes, and lay the groundwork for a recovery that is not temporary but transformative. The country’s greatest natural resource is not buried underground. It is its people. Training them is the only road to lasting prosperity.

With age, passions cool and ardour subsides. Patience becomes a virtue, action an aberration.
Litigating in the courts of Pakistan is similarly solid preparation for the travails of old age. Fairly early in one’s career, one learns to suffer days of inaction and the art of doing nothing, while maintaining a façade of activity.
Nearly a year after the 26th Amendment was enacted, the most important constitutional case of this century has been set down for hearing – an exhausting wait, even by our uninspiring standards.
There have been many cases, and some of great importance, but none whose outcome may pose an existential threat to the independence of the judiciary, or revive it as a co-equal institution of state. Indeed, the outcome will determine our constitutional landscape for the foreseeable future.

Through JCP, govt is party to the composition and tenure of every constitutional bench; while simultaneously being a party in every case before these same benches. This is sufficient to impact the confidence of the ordinary litigant in the independence of the judiciary

The petitions raise many issues; and others will inevitably arise. These will include the appointment of judges, including chief justices of high courts and the chief justice of Pakistan; the composition of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP); and, the propriety of lawyer-members of the JCP appearing as counsel to plead before the very judges they appoint, confirm, transfer and promote.
These, and many other such important questions, though ostensibly important, are actually peripheral. It bears reiterating that what lies at the heart of the matter is the survival of the judiciary as an institution, independent of the government. Pivotal in this is the role assigned to the Constitutional Benches – Article 191A envisages that there can be more than one.
It is beyond debate that after the 26th Amendment, these are the most important benches in the Supreme Court. These benches – to the exclusion of all other judges, including the chief justice of Pakistan – have the exclusive jurisdiction to decide all appeals from every high court, challenging the constitutionality of a law, or raising any substantial question of law regarding the interpretation of the Constitution. Every plea of a citizen for the enforcement of his fundamental rights, and every action to prevent overreach of the leviathan is within their domain.
Every case originating in the Supreme Court, references by the president on critical legal and constitutional matters for the court’s advisory opinion, disputes between provinces, or between one or more provinces and the Federation, can be adjudicated only by them.
The chief justice of Pakistan is still the titular head of the judiciary. But in the adjudication of all matters of critical national and constitutional importance – which impact the state and affect the nation – he has no say. He is a mere bystander; sadly irrelevant both to the process and to the determination which follows. In the words of Matthew Arnold, “a beautiful and ineffectual angel, beating in the void his luminous wings in vain”.
Of even greater significance than the marginalisation of the chief justice is the independence of these benches. Security of tenure is one of the main pillars of judicial independence, but the amendment takes a wrecking ball to it. The benches comprise “such Judges of the Supreme Court and for such term as may be nominated and determined by” the JCP.
The judges of the Supreme Court are appointed till they reach the age of 65, or are removed on the recommendation of their peers.
The roster (assignment of cases) has always been an exclusively judicial preserve. After judges have started hearing a case, even the chief justice, once considered the ‘master of the roster’, had no authority to reassign that case to another bench. Any executive or legislative interference in such matters being an infringement of the doctrine of separation of powers, is incontestably unconstitutional.
The JCP, a majority of whose members are not judges of the Supreme Court, can however change the composition of the bench at will. There is nothing to prevent it from doing so mid-hearing.
In the hierarchy of our courts, a civil judge stands at the lowest rung of the judicial ladder. But even he cannot be so shunted around. This is a bird’s eye view of the impact of the 26th amendment on the independence of the bench.
Now for a worm’s eye view: the government is a party to every decision of the JCP regarding the composition and tenure of the constitutional benches. The government is also a party in every case before these benches.
This is sufficient to impact the confidence of the ordinary litigant in the independence of the judiciary. Erosion of trust in the impartiality of judges will follow. When that happens, institutional rigor mortis will set in.

After the Pahalgam episode, the BJP-led government has gone into overdrive to demonise Pakistan, aided by hawkish elements in the Indian media. Perhaps its performance on the battlefield — or lack thereof — during the May skirmishes and the global community’s unwillingness to buy New Delhi’s anti-Pakistan narrative have, along with Islamabad’s diplomatic successes, been a major reason for India’s frustration.
Hence its rulers are intent on sabre-rattling to cover up their inadequacies. Two senior Indian military officials made deplorable remarks recently, which only further vitiate the atmosphere. The Indian army chief, while speaking to his troops, said his country would not show ‘restraint’ and that “the opportunity will come soon”, while threatening this country. India’s air chief said that his forces had shot down several Pakistani jets during Operation Sindoor, when there is no evidence to back his delusional claim.
 
 

It is clear that India’s military men get their cue from their politicians and bureaucrats. For example, there were several terse exchanges between Pakistani and Indian officials at last month’s UN General Assembly. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while defending Pakistan’s military actions during the May clashes, held out the offer of “comprehensive dialogue” with India.
New Delhi’s foreign minister used the same platform, without naming Pakistan, to criticise “a neighbour” as the “epicentre of global terrorism”. Meanwhile, in remarks that were definitely not cricket, the Indian prime minister, following his country’s Asia Cup victory, termed the result “Operation Sindoor on the games field”.
Some commentators believe that the continued hostility towards Pakistan serves domestic political interests in India by shoring up the rabid Hindutva political base, as well as grabbing votes in close elections, such as the Bihar state polls due next month.
Whatever the Indian ruling party’s motivations, its ill-advised rhetoric is making chances for peace in the subcontinent more and more remote. At one time, hawkish lobbies in Pakistan resisted peace with India. Today, the Indian state itself, backed by an array of far-right Hindu groups and pliant supporters in the media, wants to isolate Pakistan.
Once India realises that its efforts to demonise this country will fail, and that the only sustainable path for South Asia’s people is peaceful coexistence, it is welcome to call Pakistan. All outstanding issues can and should be addressed in a frank dialogue.
Until then, Pakistan must remain on alert, and remind belligerent voices in India that it will defend itself, just as it did during New Delhi’s unprovoked aggression earlier this year.

Every summer, citizens brace for rolling blackouts as peak shortfalls rise into the thousands of megawatts. Behind the flickering lights lies a deeper malaise: circular debt in the power sector that has ballooned into trillions of rupees, an import bill for petroleum that drains over $15 billion annually, and a grid so inefficient that nearly a fifth of generated electricity is lost before it reaches consumers. This is not an energy system — it is a fiscal black hole.
Successive governments have tried patchwork fixes, but the crisis has only deepened. Today, the installed capacity of Pakistan’s power system stands at around 46,000 megawatts, yet average actual generation hovers closer to 14,000 to 15,000 megawatts.
The reasons are depressingly familiar: underutilised plants, poor transmission, losses from theft, and above all, the crushing weight of contracts with independent power producers (IPPs) that guarantee capacity payments in hard currency, regardless of whether electricity is generated or consumed. These “take-or-pay” contracts lock the government into paying billions each year even when demand falls short, a structural flaw that feeds directly into the circular debt cycle.
That cycle is staggering. By mid-2025, the government itself acknowledged stockpiles of circular debt in the range of Rs1.6–2.4 trillion. To keep the system afloat, it has had to negotiate a Rs1.275tr (about $4.5bn) bank facility — essentially new borrowing to pay old obligations.

Small modular reactors offer flexibility — a unit can be deployed to power an industrial cluster, a remote mining operation, or even a desalination plant

In effect, Pakistan is mortgaging its future to keep the lights on today. Meanwhile, the annual energy import bill remains in the $15–18bn range, a constant drain on foreign reserves that leaves the economy exposed to global oil shocks.
 
 

Against this bleak backdrop, panels have spread across rooftops and farms, cutting diesel costs and reducing dependency on erratic grid supply. On the surface, this looks like a climate-friendly success. But the picture beneath is more complicated — and more dangerous.
A Reuters investigation earlier this year reported that some 650,000 solar-powered tube wells are now in operation, allowing farmers to pump groundwater at virtually no cost. The result has been an explosion of water-intensive crops like rice, with cultivation expanding by roughly 30 per cent between 2023 and 2025, even as groundwater levels in Punjab plunged to critical depths.
 
 

This is the solar paradox: free energy has removed the natural restraint that diesel once imposed. Instead of conserving scarce water, it has enabled farmers to pump around the clock, accelerating aquifer depletion and threatening Pakistan’s long-term food security. The unintended consequence is that a “green” energy boom is undermining the very resource base on which agriculture depends.

However, SMRs are not an off-the-shelf solution —  commercial rollouts are still at an early stage global and financing will be complex with safety and oversight non-negotiable

Pakistan, then, faces a trilemma: unaffordable energy, unsustainable debt, and vanishing water. What is the way out?
It lies not in abandoning renewables, but in anchoring them with a technology that can provide clean, reliable, round-the-clock power without over-pumping aquifers or draining foreign exchange. That technology is nuclear power — but not in the old model of massive, decades-long megaprojects.
Instead, Pakistan should look seriously at small modular reactors (SMRs) and portable microreactors.
SMRs are designed to be built in factories, shipped in modules, and installed faster and at lower upfront cost than traditional reactors. They offer flexibility: a unit can be deployed to power an industrial cluster, a remote mining operation, or even a desalination plant.
Unlike solar, they are not hostage to the sun’s cycles; unlike gas, they are not tethered to volatile global markets. Nuclear fuel costs are a relatively small share of operating expenses, making reactors far less sensitive to price swings than oil or LNG plants. Some SMR designs also use closed-loop or air-cooled systems, reducing the heavy water demands of conventional plants and making them compatible with arid regions.
For Pakistan, the advantages are compelling. An SMR programme would diversify the energy mix, reduce the dependence on imported fuels, and add dependable baseload power that could stabilise the grid.
It would also strengthen energy sovereignty by building on existing nuclear expertise: Pakistan already operates several large nuclear plants with the support of international partners and has a trained cadre of engineers and regulators. Extending that capability into microreactors is a logical next step.
The challenges are real. SMRs are not an off-the-shelf solution; commercial rollouts are still at an early stage globally, and financing will be complex. Safety, waste management, and international oversight must be non-negotiable. But none of these hurdles are insurmountable.

The assembly’s formation is set to consolidate the power of Sharaa, whose forces led a coalition that toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December after more than 13 years of civil war.
Dozens of members of the local committees were queueing at Syria’s National Library, formerly called the Assad National Library, to cast their vote.
According to the organising committee, more than 1,500 candidates — just 14 per cent of them women — are running for the assembly, which will have a renewable 30-month mandate.

Assembly’s formation is set to consolidate the power of Al Sharaa

Sharaa is to appoint 70 representatives out of the 210-member body. The other two-thirds will be selected by local committees appointed by the electoral commission, which itself was appointed by Sharaa.
But southern Syria’s Druze-majority Sweida province, which suffered sectarian bloodshed in July, and the country’s Kurdish-held northeast are excluded from the process for now as they are outside Damascus’s control, and their 32 seats will remain empty.
“I support the authorities and I’m ready to defend them, but these aren’t real elections,” said Louay al-Arfi, 77, a retired civil servant sitting with friends at a Damascus cafe.
“It’s a necessity in the transitional phase, but we want direct elections” to follow, he said.
Under a temporary constitution announced in March, the incoming parliament will exercise legislative functions until a permanent constitution is adopted and new elections are held.
Sharaa has said it would be impossible to organise direct elections now, noting the large number of Syrians who lack documentation after millions fled abroad or were displaced internally during the civil war.
Final list likely to be out today
Around 6,000 people are taking part in Sunday’s selection process.
Preliminary results are expected to emerge after it ends, with state TV reporting that some centres started counting the votes.
The final list of names is due to be announced on Monday.
Under the rules, candidates must not be “supporters of the former regime” and must not promote secession or partition. Those running include Syrian-American Henry Hamra, the first Jewish candidate since the 1940s.
“The next parliament faces significant responsibilities, including signing and ratifying international agreements. This will lead Syria into a new phase, and it is a major responsibility,” said Hala al-Qudsi, Damascus’s electoral committee member running for a seat herself.
She was focused on the ongoing talks between Syria and Israel, stating that she would “say ‘no’ to any security agreement with Israel that does not serve the interests of the Syrian people”.
In September, Sharaa voiced hope for a security agreement with Israel.
Rights groups have criticised the selection process, saying it concentrates power in Sharaa’s hands and lacks representation for the country’s ethnic and religious minorities.
In a joint statement last month, more than a dozen groups said the process means Sharaa “can effectively shape a parliamentary majority composed of individuals he selected or ensured loyalty from”.

The government initiative follows Thursday’s deadly knife and car-ramming attack on a synagogue in the northwestern city of Manchester.
A pro-Palestinian demonstration in central London went ahead on Saturday despite pleas from Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the capital’s Metropolitan Police to delay it.
The government said police would be authorised to consider the “cumulative impact” of protests when deciding to impose limits on protesters.

London witnesses huge rally despite Starmer’s appeal for postponement

“The right to protest is a fundamental freedom in our country. However, this freedom must be balanced with the freedom of their neighbours to live their lives without fear,” Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in a statement.
Over 1,000 people took part in Saturday’s protest in London’s Trafalgar Square with nearly 500 people arrested for showing supporting for the banned Palestine Action campaign group.
Organisers rejected calls not to gather saying they “stood in solidarity” with the Jewish community over the Manchester attack but that “cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win”.
A day earlier, Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was booed at a vigil for the Jewish victims of the synagogue attack.
“Large, repeated protests can leave sections of our country, particularly religious communities, feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes,” Mahmood claimed.
“This has been particularly evident in relation to the considerable fear within the Jewish community.” Questioned by a BBC television interviewer about the Jewish community’s repeated warnings about the dangers they face, Mahmood admitted she was “very worried about the state of community relations in our country”.
The home secretary added, speaking to Times Radio, that there was a broad “problem of a rise not only in anti-Semitism but in other forms of hatred as well”.
“There are clearly malign and dark forces running amok across our country,” she asserted
Police shot dead assailant Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old UK citizen of Syrian descent, within minutes of the alarm being raised on Thursday.
One person died in the attack outside the synagogue in north Manchester.
Another died after suffering a fatal gunshot, believed by police to have been fired by armed officers as they tackled Shamie.
Three people who were seriously injured remain in hospital, including one who is also believed to have been accidentally hit by police fire.
Counter terrorism police have been granted more time to detain four people arrested on suspicion of terrorism-linked offences over the incident.

CAIRO: Hamas on Sunday called for a swift start to a prisoner exchange with Israel, as negotiators from both sides prepare to meet in Egypt today (Monday) for crucial talks aimed at ending the nearly two-year-long Israeli invasion of Gaza.
Foreign ministers of several countries, including Egypt, said the talks were a “real opportunity” to achieve a sustainable ceasefire.
“Hamas is very keen to reach an agreement to end the war and immediately begin the prisoner exchange process in accordance with the field conditions,” a senior official told AFP.
The diplomatic push follows the group’s flexible response to US President Donald Trump’s roadmap to end the fighting and secure the release of captives held in Gaza, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
Ahead of the discussions in Egypt, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza.
“You can’t release (prisoners) in the middle of strikes, so the strikes will have to stop,” Rubio told CBS News. “There can’t be a war going on in the middle of it.”
Negotiators are due to gather in Sharm El-Sheikh, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressing the hope that the prisoners could be released within days.
Cairo confirmed it would be hosting a delegation from Hamas for talks on “the ground conditions and details of the exchange of all Israeli detainees and Palestinian prisoners”.
The White House said Trump had also sent two envoys to Egypt — his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East negotiator Steve Witkoff.
“During communications with mediators, Hamas insisted that it is essential for Israel to halt military operations across all areas of the Gaza Strip, cease all air, reconnaissance, and drone activity, and withdraw from inside Gaza City,” a Palestinian source close to Hamas said, adding that the group would “also halt their military operations” in parallel.
 
 

According to Trump’s plan, in return for the prisoners, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinian prisoners with life sentences and more than 1,700 detainees from the Gaza Strip who were arrested after the war began.
‘Complete obliteration’
But Trump has warned he will “not tolerate delay” from Hamas, urging the group to move quickly towards a deal “or else all bets will be off”.
“When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal,” he posted on Truth Social.
He also said Hamas will face “complete obliteration” if the group refuses to give up power and control of Gaza, Reuters reported.
When asked if Netanyahu is on board with ending the bombing in Gaza and supporting the US’ broader vision, Trump told CNN on Saturday, “Yes on Bibi.”
In the interview that aired on Sunday, Trump added that he expects to soon know whether Hamas is committed to peace.
He also said talks on implementing a truce for Gaza will take days. “They’re in negotiations right now as we speak. They’ve started the negotiations. It’ll last a couple of days,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We’ll see how it turns out. But I’m hearing it’s going very well,” he added.
Strikes continue
Meanwhile, Israel has continued to carry out strikes on Gaza, in spite of the US calls for a pause. Footage showed thick smoke billowing over the skyline over the coastal territory on Sunday.
Gaza’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas authority, said Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people in Gaza on Sunday, after several attacks through the night.
“The decision to occupy Gaza, the collapse of multi-storey buildings, and the intensity of IDF operations in the city have led to the evacuation of roughly 900,000 residents to the south, creating immense pressure on Hamas and the countries that support it,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a speech on Sunday.
 
 

The UN estimates that around one million people were living in the area before the assault began.
“There has been a noticeable decrease in the number of air strikes (since last night). The tanks and military vehicles have slightly pulled back, but I believe this is a tactical move, not a withdrawal,” said Muin Abu Rajab, 40, a resident of Al-Rimal neighbourhood in Gaza City.
Hayya appears on TV
Before arriving at Cairo, Hamas’ top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya broke his silence during a pre-recorded statement that aired in Qatar overnight, in his first televised appearance since Israel targeted him and other leaders of the group in Doha last month.
The Hamas leader remained defiant in the interview, saying he drew no distinction between those killed in the attack on Doha, including his son, and the tens of thousands who have died during the nearly two years of devastating war in Gaza.
“We hope that their blood will pave the way to victory, the way to Jerusalem, the way to the disgrace of the occupation, and the way to the dignity and triumph of the nation,” he said in the video aired by Al Araby Television Network in Qatar.
Hope for sustainable ceasefire
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of several Islamic countries on Sunday welcomed the latest developments over Gaza, affirming that these represented a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire and to address the critical humanitarian conditions facing people in the Gaza Strip, APP reported.
Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt, today welcomed the steps taken by Hamas regarding Trump’s proposal to end the war in Gaza, said a joint statement of the foreign ministers, shared by the foreign office spokesperson with the media.
The foreign ministers also welcomed the US president’s call on Israel to immediately stop the bombing and to begin implementation of the exchange agreement. They expressed appreciation for his commitment to establishing peace in the region.
They also welcomed the announcement by Hamas of its readiness to hand over the administration of Gaza to a transitional Palestinian Administrative Com­mittee of independent technocrats.
Pakistani citizens
Also on Sunday, the spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was actively engaged with its international partners to ensure the safety and prompt repatriation of its citizens who were illegally detained by the Israeli occupying forces.
In response to media inquiries concerning Pakistani nationals aboard the Sumud flotilla, the spokesperson said in a statement, “Through the diplomatic channels of a friendly European country, we have confirmed that former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan is in the custody of the Israeli occupying forces and is safe and in good health.”
 
 

He added, “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, Senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.”

• Supplier continued delivery to other industries, made ‘dubious’ force majeure claims to escape accountability
ISLAMABAD: Electricity consumers in Pakistan are having to shoulder a financial burden of nearly Rs215 million, mainly due to regulatory weaknesses, it has emerged.
While the capacity trap, currency devaluation and exch­ange-rate volatility are touted as the main factors behind expensive electricity, similar attention is not paid to issues of weak contract enforcement and inadequate regulatory oversight, which are actually forcing consumers to foot the bill for contractual default by private companies.
 
 

In the latest episode that has come to light, a Punjab-based coal power plant faced a significant contractual default by its long-term supplier.
Subsequent decisions by regulators such as the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) and the Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G) allowed the resulting financial burden to be passed directly on to consumers in the form of higher tariffs.
This is just one example of persistent weaknesses in the coal procurement process, which previously made headlines earlier this year, sparking inquiries and leading to partial improvements. However, the issue is far from resolved and continues to add to the public’s financial strain.
Dawn reached out to Nepra with a set of questions on Sept 22. Over the following weeks, the regulator repeatedly promised a written response, but failed to provide one until going to press.
Default on coal supply
The issue at hand stems from the breach of a long-term coal supply agreement between the power plant and its coal supplier in December last year. The contract, awarded through a competitive process, secured a substantial discount of $2.51 per tonne on API-4 specification coal.
This was seen as an improvement over a previously-challenged contract, which only offered a discount of $0.50 per tonne.
However, the supplier defa­ulted on its obligation to del­iver coal against issued purchase orders, citing an alleged ‘force majeure’ as the basis for its non-performance, referencing factors such as congestion at the Richards Bay Coal Terminal in South Africa and, notably, the India-Pakistan conflagration in May.
The claim regarding terminal congestion is noteworthy, as industry experts routinely consider this risk as a foreseeable trade challenge in the international coal market.
However, the use of the India-Pakistan flare-up as an excuse does not hold up, as documentation indicates that other suppliers successfully fulfilled their contractual obligations during the same timeframe.
Additionally, other industries in Pakistan continued to import coal without interruption, raising questions over the enormity of the supplier’s ‘force majeure’ claims.
Interestingly, while it defaulted on the long-term contract with the power plant, the company continued to supply coal to other industries, suggesting the decision was linked to the high discount offered rather than the self-proclaimed ‘force majeure’.
Cost increases
As a direct consequence of the default, the power plant in question was forced to procure replacement coal from the next-ranked supplier, at a significantly higher price. This resulted in an additional cost of $1.86 per tonne being incurred.
When applied to the total defaulted quantity of nearly 372,000 tonnes across eight vessels, this nonperformance by the original supplier generated a verifiable loss of $691,931, equivalent to around Rs197m.
The regulatory response by Nepra solidified the public’s exposure to this financial loss. In its Fuel Cost Adjustment decision of June 26, 2025, the authority green-lit passing the full impact of the Rs197m cost directly into consumer tariff, instead of protecting consumers’ interests by holding the defaulting party accountable, as explicitly outlined in the Coal Supply Agreement.
The contract stipulates that the defaulting party must bear the incremental cost of replacement coal and forfeit its performance guarantee to cover such losses. According to records, the supplier’s performance guarantee was not forfeited, and the recovery of the $691,931 loss was not enforced by either CPPA-G or Nepra.
Despite its ongoing default, the same company was allowed to continue supplying under the long-term tender and participate in, and win, a spot tender for the same plant again on June 11, 2025.
This spot tender secured a discount of only $1.58 per tonne, which was 93 cents per tonne lower than the discount on the defaulted long-term contract. The price disparity created an additional loss of $55,800, about Rs16m, on a single 60,000-tonne supply, placing yet more burden on consumers.
The CPPA-G’s issuance of NOC to the defaulting supplier, both for the spot tender and its continued long-term supplies, illustrates the absence of an effective systemic penalty framework.
Following an earlier episode, a Nepra fact-finding committee had identified “anomalies” in the coal procurement process. The committee’s subsequent report underscored the structural weaknesses inherent in the system, which led to single-bidder scenarios and limited competition.
The report had also acknowledged the absence of requisite regulatory guidelines for long-term coal procurement and recommended the urgent creation of an independent coal regulator to protect consumers from unjustified costs. But even after the passage of eight months, those recommendations remain unenforced.

The incident came the same day as a separate attack on a religious leader left at least five people injured.
According to police, Judge Malik Inayatur Rehman and his security staff came under fire from unidentified assailants near Khari City Hospital.
The judge’s vehicle was hit by at least 12 bullets, but all occupants survived the ambush.
Law enforcement agencies reached the site soon afterwards and cordoned off the area for investigation.
Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan took notice of the attack and directed the home secretary, inspector general of police, and other law enforcement authorities to tighten security across the city.
He instructed them that those involved in the attack be dealt with “iron hands” and brought to justice. The chief minister also urged citizens to remain peaceful and united to foil the designs of elements seeking to disturb the region’s peace.
GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah also condem­ned the attack and called for a transparent investigation. Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate, Deputy Speaker Sadia Danish, Opposition Lea­der Kazim Mesum, lawyers’ representatives, and civil society members also denounced the incident.
Religious leader attacked
Earlier in the day, a religious leader from the proscribed Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) was also targeted near the Central Police Office (CPO).
Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed, who is the emir of the group’s GB and Kohistan chapter was travelling along with police guards and a driver when the convoy came under fire.
According to a GB government statement, Maul­ana Nisar, his driver, and three police personnel assigned to his security sustained injuries.
Police officials said the guards retaliated immediately, injuring some of the attackers, who managed to escape with the help of accomplices.
 
 

CCTV footage showed the assailants fleeing in a Suzuki vehicle they allegedly snatched at gunpoint after their own vehicles became inoperative.
The injured were shifted to a hospital for medical treatment, where their condition was reported to be stable.
Police launched an investigation and took into custody two vehicles used in the attack along with other evidence.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Gilgit Ishaq Hussain said the district police had been placed on high alert following recent security concerns. He added that comprehensive operations were underway to apprehend those involved in the attack.
Protests erupt
Following the incidents, protests erupted across the region. Demonstrators blocked main roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), Gilgit–Shandur Road, and Baltistan Road, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits. Shops and markets in Gilgit remained closed in protest.
Protest demonstrations were reported from Gilgit, Diamer, Nagar, Skardu, Astore, Ghizer, Ghanche, and Shigar, where people from all walks of life participated. Religious leaders from all sects condemned the attacks, describing them as a conspiracy to sabotage peace in the region.
Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON, Engineer Amir Muqam, also condemned the assassination attempt on Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed and ordered a high-level investigation.
In a statement issued during his official visit abroad, Mr Muqam said he had contacted the GB chief minister, chief secretary, and inspector general of police, seeking a detailed report. He said Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed was a respected religious scholar and that the attack was not only on an individual but “an assault on the peace and stability of the entire region.”
The minister directed authorities to use all available resources to ensure the swift arrest of the attackers. “Those involved in this heinous crime will not escape justice,” he said.
Chief Minister Gulbar Khan reiterated that no conspiracy against the peace of Gilgit-Baltistan would be allowed to succeed. He ordered the IG and law enforcement agencies to conduct a transparent investigation and immediately arrest the culprits.
Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Speaker Nazir Ahm­ed Advocate, Deputy Spe­a­ker Sadia Danish, Oppo­sition Leader Kazim Mes­um, cabinet ministers, reli­g­ious leaders from var­ious sects, and civil society activists all condem­ned the incidents and dem­anded a fair and tran­s­parent investigation.

However, the opposition PTI has raised concerns over these “secret deals” with the US, and called on the government to disclose the details of these agreements.
US Strategic Metals (USSM), which signed an MoU with Pakistan in September to invest rou­ghly $500 million to establish mineral processing and development facilities in the country, rece­ntly dispatched its first consignment of mineral samples to the US to advance the deal.
Sources in Washington hope this will pave the way for Pakistan’s formal entry into the global supply chain for critical minerals, a sector of growing importance for global industries and national security.
The sample shipment, prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), includes antimony, copper concentrate, and rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium.
In a statement, USSM described the delivery as “a milestone in the Pakistan–US strategic partnership,” noting that the MOU “establishes a roadmap for cooperation across the entire mineral value chain — from exploration and processing to the establishment of refineries inside Pakistan.”
USSM CEO Stacy W. Hastie said the first delivery “opens an exciting chapter of collaboration between USSM and Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organisation, aimed at expanding trade and deepening friendship between our two countries.”
For Pakistan, the agreement offers a gateway into the global critical minerals economy, with the potential to generate billions of dollars in revenue, create jobs, and promote technology transfer.
 
 

The country’s mineral wealth is often estimated at around $6 trillion, placing it among the world’s most resource-rich nations.
For the US, the partnership promises access to key raw materials while reducing reliance on external monopolies that dominate the global minerals market.
Disclose secret deals
But not everyone is convinced that this and other similar deals will be a boon for Pakistan. In a statement, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram demanded the government to disclose details of alleged secret deals with the United States.
Referring to the USSM shipment, as well as claims published by the Financial Times regarding a supposed plan to offer the Pasni Port to Washington, the spokesperson warned that such “reckless, lopsided, and secretive agreements would further inflame the already volatile situation in the country”.
He demanded that parliament and the nation be taken on board and that “full details of all such deals be made public.” Mr Akram stressed that PTI “would never accept agreements struck at the expense of the people and the state’s interests.”
Military sources have already disputed the claims made in the Financial Times report, calling the proposal “a commercial idea” rather than “official policy”.
He urged the government to learn from the “disastrous consequences” of Mughal Emperor Jahangir’s 1615 decision to grant trading rights to the British at Surat Port, which he said ultimately led to colonial control.
Commenting on simmering political tensions between the PPP and PML-N, Mr Akram stated that the public disagreements were a “well-thought-out plan” to “divert public attention from chronic national issues”.

As of Sunday, 350 trekkers had reached the small township of Qudang, while contact with the remaining 200-plus trekkers had been made, CCTV reported. Visitors to the remote valley of Karma, which leads to the eastern Kangshung face of Everest, were in the hundreds this week, taking advantage of an eight-day National Day holiday in China.
“It was so wet and cold in the mountains, and hypothermia was a real risk,” said Chen Geshuang, who was part of an 18-strong trekking team that made it to Qudang.
“The weather this year is not normal. The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly,” Chen told Reuters.
Snow, thunder and lightning
Snowfall in the valley, which lies at an elevation averaging 4,200 metres, began on Friday evening and persisted throughout Saturday.
The remaining trekkers will arrive in Qudang in stages under the guidance and assistance of rescuers organised by the local government, CCTV reported.
Chen’s party descended from the mountains on Sunday and was greeted by villagers after enduring a harrowing evening of heavy snowfall combined with thunder and lightning. With tears in her eyes, Chen accepted their offers of sweet tea and the promise of warmth, she said.
“Back in the village, we had a meal and were finally warm.” Hundreds of local villagers and rescue teams had been deployed to help remove snow blocking access to the area, where nearly 1,000 people had been trapped, according to an earlier report by Jimu News.
North face of Everest
The CCTV report did not say if local guides and support staff of the trekking parties had been accounted for. It was also unclear if trekkers near the north face of Everest, also in Tibet, had been affected or not.
The north face of Everest, due to its easy access by paved road, regularly draws large numbers of tourists. October is a peak season, when skies usually clear at the end of the Indian monsoon.
Ticket sales and entry to the entire Everest Scenic Area were suspended from late Saturday, according to notices on the official WeChat accounts of the local Tingri County Tourism Company.
To the south of Tibet in Nepal, heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 47 people since Friday.
Thirty-five people died in separate landslides in the eastern Ilam district bordering India. Nine people were reported missing after being swept away by floodwaters and three others were killed in lightning strikes elsewhere in the country.</p><small>2025-10-05 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/052240474ab7a59.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946768/india-hand-pakistan-second-successive-defeat-at-womens-world-cup-with-88-run-victory' target='_blank'><strong>India hand Pakistan second successive defeat at Women’s World Cup with 88-run victory</strong></a><br><p>
Abyan Amir was reporting live from R. Premadasa Stadium.

India eventually finished the match with a comfortable win but at the halfway mark it could have been anyone’s game.
The hosts were bowled for a below par 247 but in the end that turned out to be too much for the Pakistani batters who folded for 159.
There were plenty of stops in between due to bugs, fumigation and the humidity causing frequent drink breaks.
Diana Baig ended up with four wickets and cleaned up India’s tail as well but it was captain Fatima Sana who shifted the momentum after a good start for India in the power play.
Pakistan go into the next encounter with Australia on the 8th with losses next to their name. Fatima Sana’s players need some introspection to their batting approach if they are to compete to go into the next stage of the World Cup.

Speaking after the match, skipper Fatima said: “We gave a lot of runs in the powerplay, extras too. That was the case in the death too. I felt we needed to restricted them under 200.
“We decided to go with specialist batters in the top-five, they need to step up. We need to express ourselves, long partnerships, assess and adapt to conditions. Amin is hard-working, hope she’ll continue to do well.”
Meanwhile, Indian counterpart Harmanpreet said she was “very happy [with the] important win.
“Our bowling was great, Kranti was outstanding; Renuka helped her. We created so many chances, dropped some. But win makes us happy.
“It wasn’t easy to bat on, we wanted to bat long and see how much we got. It’s been raining and there was a hold on the pitch. We wanted to keep wickets in hand, Richa then gave us 30 crucial runs. Right now, I’m happy we won. Just want to go with the momentum when we go back to India. We know how the pitches there are, hope to work our combinations.”
Player of the match Kranti Goud said: “Proud for me, and the people from my village. They’ve got a big screen up.
“Harman asked to remove the second slip as the pace was reducing but I insisted on it and it got Riaz’s wicket. My coaches tell me normal things and I catch onto them.”

Nashra isn’t known for her batting, and Rana keeps it tight to her. Just three runs coming off that one.

Over 41 — Pakistan 155/8

Over 40 — Pakistan 150/8
Rana gets the crucial breakthrough as Sidra falls after a valiant knock of 81. She required support from the other end but it was not meant to be as Pakistan slump to eight-down in the 40th over with just 150 on the board.

She loses shape while trying to hit out Gaud who gets a wicket first ball after her return into the attack. Captain Fatima is the next batter in — she’s a bit of a maverick with the bat and Pakistan need a crucial contribution from her today.

15 OVER ANALYSIS
At the 15th over mark, India have made good use of the swing on offer at Colombo under lights to restrict Pakistan to 30-3.

There were plenty of stops in between due to bugs, fumigation and the numerous drink breaks.
Diana Baig ended up with four wickets and cleaned up India’s tail as well but it was captain Fatima Sana who shifted the momentum after a good start for India in the power play.

Pakistan skipper Fatima Sana is into the attack, and is welcomed with a boundary by the Indian opener Rawal. India are off to a quick start as the pitch seems to be a true surface for batting.

Over 2 — India 20/0
Pakistan’s inform pacer from the first match, Diana Baig, starts off with an expensive over as Indian opener Pratika Rawal hits her for three back-to-back boundaries.

Over 1 — India 8/0
Sadia Iqbal has started the bowling effort for Pakistan. Weather conditions are overcast, and the new ball can move around in the air as a result. India end the over with their first boundary as the in-form Smriti Mandhana gets off the mark in style.

Pakistan have opted to bowl first, with Sadia Iqbal opening for the Green Shirts as they face India in the cricket field yet again on Sunday, this time in the Women’s World Cup 2025.
While India is hosting this year’s tournament, Pakistan will play all their matches of the 50-over World Cup in Sri Lanka under a hybrid model decided in November after India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy.
 






Fatima Sana is leading the Green Team, while Harmanpreet Kaur is captaining the Women in Blue. The game will begin at 2:30pm PKT at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.
As of 2pm (Sri Lanka time), ESPNcricinfo reported that the weather was “dry, although there are dark clouds hovering over the stadium”.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) had said “fans have free entry to all” the World Cup matches being played in Colombo.
 
 

As the rivals meet for a fourth consecutive Sunday on the cricket field, tensions from the recent men’s Asia Cup may spill into the ongoing event as well.
Ahead of all the chatter on the issue of handshakes in Asia Cup, Sana made it clear that her side’s focus was solely on cricket.
Earlier this week, a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official said there was “no assurance” that India and Pakistan players would shake hands during their fixtures.
The semi-finals are scheduled for October 29 and 30, before the final takes place on November 2.</p><small>2025-10-05 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0522213255cc9d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946818/pentagons-hegseth-says-he-has-every-authorisation-needed-for-caribbean-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Pentagon’s Hegseth says he has every authorisation needed for Caribbean strikes</strong></a><br><p>United States Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said he has every authorisation needed for military strikes on vessels just off the coast of Venezuela, allegedly carrying illegal drugs.
Hegseth was speaking in a Fox News interview broadcast on Sunday. The United States killed four people in a strike in the Caribbean Sea on Friday, at least the fourth such attack in recent weeks.
“We have every authorisation needed. These are designated as foreign terrorist organisations,” Hegseth said in an interview on Fox News’ ‘The Sunday Briefing’.
He did not provide more details about the authorisation.
Washington has cited the US Constitution, war powers, designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organisations, the right to self-defence and international law on unlawful combatants as the legal basis for the strikes.
Legal experts and some lawmakers argue that using military force in international waters against alleged criminals bypasses due process, violates law enforcement norms, lacks a clear legal foundation under US and international law and is not justified by the cartels’ terrorist designation.
Hegseth and US President Donald Trump have not provided evidence for claims that the targeted boats were carrying drugs. Trump told Congress last week that he had determined the US to be in “a non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, without providing any new legal rationale.
Critics say the boat strikes are a further effort by Trump to test the scope of his presidential powers. Legal experts have questioned why the military is carrying out these attacks rather than the US Coast Guard, the country’s maritime law agency.
“If you’re in our hemisphere, if you’re in the Caribbean, if you’re north of Venezuela and you want to traffic drugs to the United States, you are a legitimate target of the United States military,” Hegseth said.
Trump said on Sunday that the US military buildup in the Caribbean had halted drug trafficking from South America.
“There’s no drugs coming into the water. And we’ll look at what phase two is,” he told reporters at the White House.
 


Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Sunday told his Venezuelan counterpart that the country condemns the US strikes and is concerned about the dangers of potential escalation in the Caribbean.</p><small>2025-10-05 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0521553581b7c0b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946817/ji-urges-nation-to-stage-street-shows-on-oct-7-for-expressing-solidarity-with-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>JI urges nation to stage street shows on Oct 7 for expressing solidarity with Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman on Sunday addressed a massive rally on Karachi’s Sharea Faisal and called on the nation to take to the streets on October 7 as a show of solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
According to a press release from the JI, the participants of the “Gaza Solidarity March” chanted slogans against Israel and its supporters over the ongoing genocide in the enclave. They were also carrying placards and banners and people from all walks of life participated in the event and formed a chain to express solidarity.
“Any paradigm shift in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine — [which was] set by none other than Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah — will not be tolerated at any cost,” Rehman said in his keynote address, according to the press release.
“On March 23, 1940, two resolutions were passed by the Muslim League — one called [the] Pakistan Resolution and the second one was for Palestine,” he added. “There is only one state and that is Palestine, whereas there is only one leadership in Gaza and that is Hamas.”
The JI chief demanded that the government recognise Hamas as the leadership in the Gaza Strip, while “warning them strongly” against joining the Abraham Accords, a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and Arab states.

“He (Rehman) further said that Israel had totally failed militarily in Gaza as it couldn’t get its soldiers freed by Hamas and was in fact engaging Hamas in one way or another to secure their release,” the statement read.
“Hamas is a resistance movement that represents the people of Gaza. However, the ruling class is not even willing to mention the name … because they are afraid of any movement that comes from the people,” Rehman was quoted as saying. “The ruling elite dislikes any movement that opposes the United States and Israel.”
The JI chief added that Hamas was a legal political movement and if they had taken up arms, it they did so according to the UN Charter. Moreover, he demanded that the government “abandon hypocrisy and double standards” and accept the people of Gaza and Hamas, adding that Hamas offices must be opened in Pakistan.
“On the occasion, he stressed the need [for] another United Nations as the present one became a total failure and agent of the US and Israel,” the press release read.
“It never solved the issues of Muslims. He (Rehman) was of the view that the massacre in Palestine happened not because of Hamas, but because of the cowardly Muslim rulers.”
According to the press release, Rehman said that October 7 is a “symbol of struggle and resistance” and that people around the world will come out of their homes to “express solidarity with the resistance forces and oppressed people of Gaza”.
“On October 7 at 11 am, the entire Pakistan will come out on [the] roads in support of Palestinians and [we] ask the nation to join the global solidarity demonstration,” Rehman was quoted as saying.
The Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced.
Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement.
 
 

US President Donald Trump worked with eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, to formulate a peace plan to end the conflict. The proposal was accepted by both Israel and Hamas, although Tel Aviv’s attacks still continue in the Strip.
Moreover, Israeli forces also intercepted and arrested activists aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla — a fleet of boats trying to deliver aid to the enclave — on October 1, drawing global ire and condemnation. One of the participants arrested was former JI senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who led a Pakistani delegation on the flotilla.</p><small>2025-10-05 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05213043ad591f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946750/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-malaysia-for-comprehensive-talks-on-economic-engagement' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives in Malaysia for ‘comprehensive’ talks on economic engagement</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has arrived in Malaysia for a two-day official visit, according to state broadcaster PTV News.
The broadcaster reported in a post on X that he arrived at Kuala Lumpur’s Banga Raya International Airport, being welcomed by the Malaysian information and communications minister and the Pakistani high commissioner to Malaysia.
PM Shehbaz was then escorted with a royal protocol to his accommodation, where he was welcomed by his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim.
 






“I am extremely delighted to be in Malaysia; I express my gratitude to the prime minister of Malaysia for the warm reception,” PTV News quoted him as saying. “This visit will further strengthen Pakistan-Malaysia bilateral relations.”
 






Upon his departure, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement.
“I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.
Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.
 






Later, a post by the PM Office’s official X account confirmed the premier had departed from Lahore for the three-day official visit.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) earlier said PM Shehbaz would be accompanied by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other federal ministers and senior government officials on the trip.
Sharing details of the visit in a statement, the FO said talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”
Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.</p><small>2025-10-05 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05134854a270b1a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946766/taking-our-cover-to-settle-own-issues-with-pm-sharjeel-accuses-punjab-govt-of-conspiring-against-centre' target='_blank'><strong>‘Taking our cover to settle own issues with PM’: Sharjeel accuses Punjab govt of conspiring against Centre</strong></a><br><p>The latest accusation in the ongoing rift between the PPP and PML-N came from Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon on Sunday when he alleged that the Punjab government was taking his party’s cover to “target” the federal government.
Memon’s PPP and the PML-N, who are coalition partners in the Centre, have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government.
As the row continues between the two sides, Memon alleged while addressing a press conference in Karachi that on the face of it, the Punjab government was “indirectly targeting” the PPP, but their “actual target is the federal government”.
“They are taking our cover to settle their own issues with the prime minister or the federal government. Or they are trying to create an environment to [compel] us not to support the federal government, which would create problems for the federal government,” he claimed.
 






Clarifying that the PPP was supporting the federal government on specific issues and to keep the country’s “political system running”, he asserted that the circumstances that the Punjab government tried to create spoke of their intentions of creating a rift between the allies in the Centre.
“But we will not let this conspiracy of the Punjab government against the federal government succeed,” Memon asserted.
“I do not know why they have these jealousy factors,” he quipped, highlighting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army chief’s recent “successful” visits to Saudi Arabia and the United States. “A person thinks that ‘maybe this should have come in my share, why is it going to the prime minister’.”
The PPP leader further said that while the chief ministers of Sindh and Balochistan usually receive the premier whenever he visits the provinces, “his own Punjab administration neither receives him nor gives him any protocol”.
“If you have any issues with the prime minister, please keep them among yourselves. Do not bring the PPP into it,” Memon said.
Regardless, the Sindh minister said, the focus at the moment should be on providing relief to the flood-hit people. “Even if you had blacked out the news from some places, but if you look on the ground […] especially in southern Punjab, the condition of the people is very bad.”
 






Memon further said: “You say we are doing politics [on the issue]. We are not doing politics. We are genuinely worried for our brothers and sisters in Punjab. Instead, those people who are even putting their pictures on boxes of biscuits are doing politics.”
He recalled that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had asked the Centre to issue an appeal for international assistance and that his party had demanded that immediate flood relief be provided through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
The minister pointed out that the appeal was towards the federal government but it was the Punjab government that was reacting negatively to them, despite the Centre giving the PPP “reassurances”.
South Punjab way better than any rural Sindh area: Bokhari responds
Responding to Memon in a statement, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said she accepted the Sindh minister’s challenge for a debate, with “time and venue of your choice”.
Bokhari alleged that as a foreign minister, Bilawal was “weakening the roots of the federal government, including his party, and the prime minister”. “The house where a father and son do not agree are now trying to hide their sins by making futile taunts against our house.”
She further said that the PPP was “conspiring” against both the Centre and the Punjab government. “You start playing the ‘province card’ when your own performance is questioned,” the information minister said.
 
 

Bokhari asserted that south Punjab was still “way better and developed than any area of rural Sindh”. “Who are you to order Punjab?” she asked.
The minister also took exception to the PPP highlighting water right issues “day and night but telling us that Punjab will use water as per your (Sindh’s) wishes”.
Assailing the PPP for “delayed” work, Bokhari said: “You are still selling the 2002 floods, [while] cheques have started being distributed in areas where surveys have been completed.”
In a post on X, Bokhari said Memon was “more worried about interfering into Punjab’s political and administrative issues because they have decided not to do any work in Sindh”.
“Saying things is easy. Do work if there is. See your conditions; our south Punjab is better than them in every way. Is there any shame?” Bokhari added.
 






Both parties have been engaged in a social media contest today, with the PPP sharing complaints from purported flood-affected people from Punjab and the PML-N countering those by sharing interviews lauding its provincial government.
 






Memon assails Punjab-backed campaign to support vlogger’s anti-Sindh remarks
Memon also indirectly referred to the remarks made last month by YouTuber Rizwan Razi, whose content aired on national electronic media was decried as hate speech against the Sindhi community and led to a war of words between the coalition partners.
 
 

While a Senate committee had grilled Razi for making the derogatory remarks and the PTV had terminated his services, CM Maryam openly came out in support of the vlogger, with a social media campaign launched to express solidarity with him.
During his media briefing, Memon alleged that the Punjab government “staged another drama to divert from this entire matter (of floods), which is extremely unfortunate, damaging, and I think it was handled in a very childish manner”.
Detailing the sequence of events without naming Razi, the PPP leader said the Senate panel’s proceedings were still ongoing when a “campaign strongly in his favour” was launched from the social media accounts of the Punjab government and some of its top ministers.
 


Recalling that Maryam had “urged that the person be forgiven as he had apologised”, Memon questioned how the country’s anti-hate speech and electronic media laws would be implemented if people were to be let go in this manner.
“If you are giving these examples, then release all the people that are sitting in your  jails across Punjab,” he said.
“However, I would say that she is not at fault. Her scriptwriter is leading her onto the wrong path […] and advises her to run campaigns […] Remember a ‘Vote Ko Izzat Do’ campaign was run once, and very good respect was also given,” Memon quipped.
The PPP minister affirmed that whether it was a Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, Pashtun or from any other community, “all live like brothers and respect each other”.
