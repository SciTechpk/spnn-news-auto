Root’s superb innings was ended courtesy of a brilliant caught-and-bowled by Michael Neser, who ended with 4-60.
Will Jacks (27), Brydon Carse (1) and Josh Tongue (0) also departed in the second session at a sold-out Sydney Cricket Ground.
Harry Brook (84) and skipper Ben Stokes (0) fell to Scott Boland and Mitchell Starc respectively, while Jamie Smith (46) was dismissed by part-timer Marnus Labuschagne, all before lunch.
Australia lead the series 3-1 and have already retained the Ashes, with England desperate to keep the momentum going after clawing back a win at the previous Test in Melbourne.
Resuming at 211-3, the day belonged to Root, who started on 72 and reached an almost chanceless century off 146 balls to reaffirm his status as one of the all-time greats.







The 35-year-old began the gruelling series under pressure after failing to make a hundred in Australia over three previous Ashes tours, but he snapped the drought with a majestic unbeaten 138 in the day-night Test at Brisbane.
His exploits in Sydney drew him level with Australian Ricky Ponting to be third on the all-time century-maker list with 41.
Only India’s Sachin Tendulkar (51) and South African Jacques Kallis (45) have more.
Root and Brook came together with England in trouble at 57-3 on Sunday following the demise of Ben Duckett (27), Zak Crawley (16) and Jacob Bethell (10).
Both were eyeing big centuries on a deck ideal for batting.
But Brook only lasted five balls on Monday, adding six to his overnight 78 before dabbing at a Boland delivery and edging into the safe hands of Steve Smith at slip.
It ended a 169-run partnership, not just England’s best of the series but the biggest by either team, surpassing Travis Head and Alex Carey’s 162 in Adelaide.
Stokes only survived 11 balls before getting the faintest of edges off Starc.
The umpire gave it not out but the decision was overturned on review and he was gone for a duck.
Jamie Smith lived dangerously and was fortunate to survive after chipping Cameron Green to Labuschagne at cover on 22. He began walking off but replays showed Green overstepped the mark.
He added another 24 before medium-pacer Labuschagne came on and bagged him in his first over, holing out to Boland.
Will Jacks slammed a six off Labuschagne in the first over after lunch but the run rate slowed significantly when the new ball was taken and Starc and Boland returned.
Root persisted, passing 150 for a 17th time, just one behind the legendary Don Bradman and three short of Tendulkar.
He and Jacks put on 52 for the seventh wicket until Jacks sent a leading edge to Green in the gully off Neser. Root then departed and the tail collapsed.</p><small>2026-01-05 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05100722be6329f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965240/pakistan-china-call-for-more-visible-verifiable-actions-to-eliminate-terrorist-groups-based-in-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China call for more ‘visible, verifiable’ actions to eliminate terrorist groups based in Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and China issued a joint communique on Monday calling for more “visible and verifiable” actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan, and prevent them from using Kabul’s territory for militancy against any other country.
The joint statement came after the conclusion of the 7th round of the Pakistan-China Foreign Mini­sters’ Strategic Dialogue, for which Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar travelled to Beijing.







“The two sides called for more visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country and to endanger any other country,” the statement said.
“The two sides agreed to keep in close communication and coordination on the Afghan issue, work with the international community to encourage the Afghan government to build an inclusive political framework, adopt moderate policies, focus on development, pursue good-neighbourliness, and play a constructive role in helping Afghanistan achieve stable development and integrate into the international community,“ it added.
The statement also said that China commended the measures taken by Islamabad to combat terrorism and protect the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.
“China fully recognised the significant contributions and huge sacrifices that Pakistan made in combating terrorism over the years,” it said.
“The two sides reiterated their commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with zero tolerance, and agreed to further deepen all-round cooperation on counter-terrorism and security, and make concerted efforts to ensure that the China-Pakistan Belt and Road cooperation advances in a secure and smooth manner,” it said.
“Calling on the international community to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation, the two sides expressed their firm opposition to double standards on counterterrorism,” it added.

Though of qualitatively different consequences, economic crises induced by an inability to service foreign debt eroded incomes and crashed growth rates in these two regions.
In Africa, poverty rates went up and poor countries faced stark consequences of disease and malnutrition. In Latin America, the expected transition to upper middle- and high-income status never transpired. Deindustrialisation and stagnant incomes became the norm, leading to what economists now call the ‘middle income trap’. It is of some note that this decade also coincided with entrenched authoritarianism (of the military dictatorship variant) and heightened state repression in both regions, much of it in service of US imperial interests.
While Pakistan’s economy is no stranger to boom-bust cycles, a prolonged period without adequate real income growth has been a rarity. It is true that since the early 2000s, Pakistan’s economy has failed to grow at the same pace as comparator economies. It is also true that much of this lag is tied to domestic political economy dysfunction, given how others in the region appear to be doing better. But the general crisis has been of comparatively sluggish growth (ie, averaged out spurts and troughs), rather than none at all, especially in labour incomes.
That is until this preceding decade (2015-2025). Analysis of recently released Labour Force Survey (LFS) data by economist Ahmed Pirzada and others shows that the last 10 years have seen no labour income growth in real terms. From a baseline of 2015, inflation-adjusted labour incomes (wages) rose by about 15 per cent over a four-year period till 2019 and have since then crashed back to 2015 levels in the subsequent six years.
Much of this is attributable to the inflationary crisis that started in 2019 and escalated between 2021 and 2023 before petering out in the last two years. Average inflation over this time was 15.1 per cent per annum, at least seven percentage points higher than Pakistan’s historical average.

Inflation may have subsided since 2024 but dynamism in the economy is still missing.

The trend of income erosion in real terms is also reaffirmed by the recently released Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) data, publish­ed after a five-year gap. While the survey itself only reports nominal income, adjusting it for inflation confirms the same story as the LFS data, with at least a 17pc erosion on average since 2019.
Parsing through the HIES data also shows a few more interesting trends. The first is that purchasing power stagnation (over a 10-year horizon) or erosion (over a five-year horizon) varied bet­­ween urban and rural households. The former experienced much greater erosion than the latter. In fact, the difference in nominal wage grow­­th between average rural and urban incomes was nearly 20pc.
One can speculate on the causes behind this divergence, but in part it reflects that economic shocks, including those induced by Covid-19, impacted urban households in myriad ways. It also shows that increased rates of urbanisation combined with labour absorption in low-wage, low-productivity sectors, as shown in the recent LFS data such as construction, retail and wholesale trade, and personal and community services, are generating a new ‘precariat’ class that is far more vulnerable to inflationary crises.

 

Relatedly, there is an inequality story at play here as well. If one looks at nominal income grow­­th in the past five years, it was highest for those in the top-most consumption/income quintile and lowest for those in the bottom, across both urban and rural areas. So not only is there widespread erosion of purchasing power, but it is far more operative among low-income households.
Some back-of-the-envelope calculations show that urban households in the top-most quintile lost 11pc of their purchasing power, while urban households in the bottom-most quintile lost 21pc of their purchasing power during the same period. Coupled with faster growth in top-quintile consumption, exacerbating inequality now goes hand in hand with increased precarity.
This data affirms what many have personally witnessed, felt, and experienced in the last few years. Economic opportunities have shrunk, hou­sehold budgets have become considerably more constrained, and families teetering on the brink have been pushed into poverty. The lower middle- and middle-income segment has borne the ig­­no­­miny of rapid downward mobility, while low-income households have become further entrapped in poverty.
Inflation may have subsided since 2024 but dynamism in the economy is still missing. LFS data shows a structural transformation that is pushing people out of agriculture and into waged work. But the destination of this waged work is various service sector industries, most of which do not promise stability, higher productivity, or greater economic mobility. An increasingly large number is now reliant on extended assistance to meet basic consumption requirements, from both the government and informal or family sources.
While it is politically useful and justifiable to blame one specific government or another for inducing a lost decade, the fact is that each government in this period (three in total) has inherited a balance-of-payments crisis, each has had to pursue macroeconomic stabilisation under IMF tutelage, and each has taken a series of expedient decisions that hollow out prospects for sustained growth in the future.
Such shared failure, thus, is a failure to correct dysfunction. And in turn, this failure is rooted in the absence of a viable political project that puts broad-based, welfare-enhancing growth as its primary objective. Instead, Pakistanis have to suffer through the pantomime of short-term geostrategic rent-seeking and the subsequent distribution of those rents to a narrow sliver of the population largely to keep a particular set of actors and their affiliated institution in power.

The district police spokesperson, Qudratullah, said that the vehicle, which was carrying cement factory workers, was targeted by Fitna al Khwarij terrorists near Nawar Khel area on Begokhel road.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
He said the injured had been taken to the City Hospital. He identified the deceased as Faridullah.
The hospital’s spokesperson, Dr Kifayat Bettani, said that two of the injured were in critical condition. He added that the injured also included two women.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
On Sunday, four police personnel, including three traffic cops, were martyred in firing by unknown armed men in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts.
Police said the three traffic policemen were on duty near the Dil Begu Khel area when unidentified gunmen, riding on a motorcycle, opened fire on them. Meanwhile, a cop in Bannu was martyred in firing by unidentified attac­kers in the district’s Kashfi Khel area.</p><small>2026-01-05 04:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695af54aae278.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965222/a-national-agenda-for-2026' target='_blank'><strong>A national agenda for 2026</strong></a><br><p>THE start of the new year is an apt time to look ahead at the overlapping challenges the country faces, identify the core ones and consider what should be done. Needed is a national agenda on which to build a political consensus to help position the country on a sustainable path to durable political and economic stability.
The first order of business should be to establish a calm and peaceful political environment by a truce between the government and opposition. A divided and polarised nation cannot be a stable country. Hard as it may be, given the lack of trust, political parties and other stakeholders should try to de-escalate unending tensions and confrontation that create so much uncertainty and disruption in the country.
PTI seems willing for a dialogue with a government it has never recognised as legitimate. This creates an opportunity that may not last long. PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s recent statement calling for “political reconciliation” is a positive move that should be taken forward.
The government has offered talks from time to time but never shown enough seriousness. It has usually accompanied such ‘overtures’ with rhetoric that demonises the opposition. Moreover, the way it has used parliament as a rubber stamp, bulldozed constitutional amendments through the legislature to undermine an independent judiciary and cracked down on opposition and dissent has laid bare its disregard rather than respect for democracy.

Overlapping challenges facing the country are a test of leadership for all political stakeholders.

Of course, the elephant in the room is the establishment, which seems unreconciled to the idea of an accommodation between the government and opposition. It would much rather have the government keep the opposition off balance and under unrelenting pressure. Recent statements and pressers by the military spokesman taking aim at PTI have been harder-hitting than in the past. This doesn’t suggest softening in the establishment’s stance on encouraging a government-opposition modus vivendi.
The opposition represents a large section of society and enjoys significant electoral support across the country. Actions to exclude it from the political process and repress it do nothing to create political stability. Unilateral rule not only erodes democracy but also undermines effective governance. The country’s federal nature makes it imperative to operate the political system in an inclusive way, not least because the centre has to work with and not against opposition-run provinces.

 

Obviously, economic revival must be on top of the national agenda. While the government has done a reasonable job at macroeconomic stabilisation with the help of an IMF bailout and other external resources, this is a short-term gain and rests on unsustainable factors (borrowing and loan rollovers from friendly countries). The debt burden is high and foreign exchange reserves low in the face of heavy external financing needs ahead (around $23 billion over the next five years). Meaningful reforms to address the economy’s structural problems in the taxation system, expenditure outlays and energy sector are still not in place. The privatisation of PIA is a positive development but there is a long way to go to privatise other loss-making state-owned enterprises that are such a financial drain on the exchequer.
There is as yet no credible plan to help Pakistan break out of the trap of anaemic growth, low savings and investment, high deficits, heavy borrowing and growing indebtedness. Investment, including FDI, remains stagnant. It is widely agreed that Pakistan’s growth model isn’t working. Short-lived growth booms predicated on domestic and foreign borrowing are unviable. Unless this dysfunctional economic strategy changes the transition from stabilisation to growth and investment will not happen. The various stakeholders should put their heads together to frame an economic plan to tackle, not postpone structural problems and evolve a new growth model. An honest diagnosis about why economic growth has been anaemic for four decades is essential.
Investment in human development should receive high priority in the national agenda. But it doesn’t, despite the fact that the country’s growth and development prospects are severely constrained by lack of investment in human capital. In fact, the country today is in the throes of a human development crisis. This is reflected in deterioration in recent years in almost all indicators of literacy, education, health, poverty, gender disparity and other aspects of human welfare. That over 20 million children still have no access to school is a national scandal. The government has twice declared an education emergency but then taken no action. Literacy is stagnant at 60 per cent, which means 40pc of our population is illiterate. Economic progress cannot be achieved with this level of illiteracy.
The scale of poverty is also alarming. It has risen to 44pc according to the World Bank. Health indicators are equally disturbing with health outcomes some of the worst in South Asia A disturbing phenomenon and consequence of malnutrition and poverty is child stunting. According to a WB report, around 40pc of Pakistani children under five are stunted — a shocking number.
The uncontrolled rise in population and lack of government attention to this consequential issue are feeding into and exacerbating Pakistan’s crisis in human development. Population growth at around 2.5pc annually means roughly six million children are added to the population every year. This has far-reaching social and economic consequences. These numbers far exceed our resources and are putting enormous strain on the country’s physical infrastructure, job markets and health and education facilities at a time when the economy is not growing.
Population planning policies are urgently needed. Pakistan’s regional peers have almost all successfully implemented family planning policies. Pakistan hasn’t. Unless the country implements a comprehensive population control policy, whose elements are well-known, a demographic disaster awaits the country. An uneducated and underemployed population boom amidst a youth bulge without adequate opportunities being available is a recipe for social and political instability.
Addressing the security challenge from militancy and terrorism should obviously have urgent priority. Militant violence escalated last year with terrorism-related fatalities reaching a decade high. A comprehensive, whole-of-nation approach is needed in which sole reliance is not placed on kinetic actions but that also involves socioeconomic and political measures well as local community support.
These challenges present a test of leadership for all political stakeholders. Can they rise above their narrow interests to deal purposefully with issues that will determine the country’s fate and fortunes?

Published in Dawn, January 5th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-05 04:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965225/ongoing-threat' target='_blank'><strong>Ongoing threat</strong></a><br><p>VIOLENCE feels routine in Pakistan. The security situation deteriorated sharply in 2025, marking the fifth consecutive year of rising terrorism. According to the Pakistan Security Report 2025 by PIPS, the country recorded 699 terrorist attacks, a 34pc increase over 2024. These attacks killed 1,034 people and injured 1,366, reflecting a 21pc rise in fatalities. Overall conflict-related violence — including terrorist attacks, counterterrorism operations, border clashes, and abductions — rose to 1,124 incidents, up 43pc from 2024. These incidents can no longer be viewed as setbacks. They point to a crisis that is expanding in scale and becoming harder to control.
The most striking shift is who is being targeted. Security personnel now make up a large share of those martyred in terrorist attacks. Police stations, patrols and checkpoints have come under repeated assault. Military units have also suffered. Terrorists appear focused on exhausting the state, stretching its forces thin and undermining morale. The return of suicide attacks, after some quieter years, reinforces this assessment. Such attacks require planning, resources and confidence, all signs of regrouping rather than desperation.
The violence is also geographically concentrated. Almost all terrorist attacks took place in KP and Balochistan. In KP’s southern districts, attacks on law-enforcement agencies have become common. In Balochistan, insurgents have expanded their tactics beyond hit-and-run attacks to include highway blockades, kidnappings and infrastructure sabotage. It has become clear that the western belt remains the country’s main security fault line.
The state has responded with force. Counterterrorism operations increased sharply, killing over 1,000 militants. But this heavy reliance on kinetic action points to a deeper problem. Despite hundreds of operations, attacks are rising.

 

Much of this violence is driven by religiously motivated terrorist groups, particularly the TTP, which has regained much of its strength. Terrorists are adapting quickly, using better weapons, night-fighting equipment and drones, often exploiting local grievances, weak governance and gaps in intelligence coordination. The state, meanwhile, is locked into a cycle of reaction.
There is danger in accepting this as the new normal. While civilian deaths fell slightly, violence against the state is growing. That should offer a lesson. A security policy built mainly on raids and reprisals cannot, on its own, deliver lasting peace, especially when ideological militancy, cross-border sanctuaries and political uncertainty remain unaddressed.
More than firepower is needed to break this cycle. Political clarity, civilian governance in conflict-hit areas, and serious regional engagement are no longer optional. Nor are police reforms, intelligence sharing and judicial follow-through. Without them, the country risks sliding into a permanent state of insecurity.

“We miss our parents and relatives,” said Shah Faisal, 25, who studies medicine in an Afghan university and was hoping to visit his family back in Pakistan during winter break.
But the border has been shut since Oct 12, 2025, leaving many like him with no viable option of making it home.
Flights are prohibitively expensive, and smuggling routes come at too great a risk.

Students, traders and others stranded since October; truck drivers rue their livelihood has dried up

A student representative said there were around 500 to 600 Pakistanis at universities in one Afghan province alone, Nangarhar, who were looking for a way back.
Shah Fahad Amjad, 22, who attends medical school in the provincial capital Jalalabad, called on “both countries to open the road” and let students visit their families.
As the border closure drags on, some are also concerned about their visa status or financial situation.
The crisis has caused problems “for us, who are students in Afghanistan, but also for Afghans who are students in Pakistan”, said 23-year-old Barkat Ullah Wazir, who studies in Jalalabad.
The colonial-era border between the South Asian neighbours stretches more than 2,600km across mountainous terrain.
‘We are displaced’
The border has remained largely closed since the October clashes that killed more than 70 people, with the exception of Afghan refugees and migrants Pakistan has expelled.
Islamabad accused Kabul of harbouring militant groups that launch attacks on Pakistani soil, allegations that the Afghan Taliban denies.
Mediation efforts have failed to produce a lasting agreement, and both sides have warned fighting could still resume.

 

Pakistani shopkeeper Ehsanullah Himmat, 21, had travelled to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar with his family to attend a relative’s wedding, but “now we cannot go back to our home”, he said.
“Fighting broke out, the road was closed,” he told AFP, turning the planned two-day trip into a lengthy ordeal with no end in sight.
“We cannot go via smuggling routes, and other routes exist but they are very long and cost a lot of money” that the family cannot afford, he said.
Now “it is cold, it’s winter, and we are displaced with our children”, Himmat said.
Relatives in Afghanistan have hosted the family, but he said he felt a sense of “embarrassment” for overstaying their welcome.
‘Standstill’
Pakistan’s foreign ministry said last week that nearly 1,200 people had approached its embassy in Kabul requesting assistance to return home, including 549 students.
Just over 300 people had flown back by the end of December, according to the ministry.
Neither government has given any clear signal about when or under what conditions the border could reopen.
At the Spin Boldak crossing point, the road leading into Pakistan is blocked.
Truck driver Khan Muhammad, 39, has been there for weeks on end, unable to work or return to his city of Quetta, about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the border.
“In these two-and-a-half months I haven’t loaded even a single kilo of cargo. Work has come to a standstill,” he said.
“All our livelihoods depend on this gate,” he said, hoping the border would reopen soon.
When it does, “everyone will be able to return to their homes”, he said.

The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has formally admitted applications from Blue Gas (Pvt) Ltd, Essen Gas Marketing & Distribution Ltd and Master Marketing Inte­rnational for licences to undertake the regulated activity of natural gas sales.
In their applications, the companies said they would use the pipeline networks of the two public-sector utilities — Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) — to transport gas produced from local fields to consumers as permitted under the Third-Party Access Rules, the Pakistan Gas Network Code and virtual networks. Such arrangements are allowed under the 2012 petroleum policy, recently amended by the federal cabinet.

 

Ogra has scheduled a public hearing for Jan 16 and invited comments from stakeholders before deciding on the grant of licences.
The regulator has already issued about a dozen licences to private firms for the sale of natural gas, but only one company — Universal Gas Distribution Company (UGDC) — has been able to practically enter into gas sale and purchase agreements with producers, consumers and transporters like SNGPL and begin commercial operations.
SNGPL and SSGCL, which enjoyed a legal monopoly over gas sales and distribution for decades, formally lost exclusivity in 2010. However, the enabling legal and regulatory framework for third-party participation remained weak for much of the following decade, effectively preserving their dominance until last year.
In January 2025, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), led by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, approved the sale of 35 per cent of new gas finds to third-party private entities through a bidding process. The move was aimed at easing liquidity challenges on exploration and production (E&P) companies and attracting $4-5 billion in fresh investment in offshore exploration.
In January 2024, the Council of Common Interests (CCI) — comprising the chief ministers of all four provinces — allowed E&P companies to sell reserves to third parties and directed the petroleum division and gas utilities to develop a framework for the sale of 35pc of unallocated gas to third parties and get it approved by the Ecnec.
The two public-sector gas utilities had been delaying the implementation and lobbied to reverse the CCI decision for almost a year, but Mr Dar-led Ecnec finally concluded that neither the council’s decision could be reversed nor a prospective $4-5bn investment in offshore blocks could be postponed. The government has since awarded around two dozen exploration licences, both in offshore and onshore basins, to local and international firms.

The suspect, a Qawwal, has been accused of giving the event ‘political colour’ as the song was associated with the jailed PTI founder Imran Khan.
In the FIR, the complainant, the Shalimar Gardens in charge, Mr Zameerul Hasan, alleged that the singer, Faraz Khan, deliberately tried to exploit the cultural event and instigate people, as the song was associated with a particular political party. He said a music and cultural night was organised by the Walled City of Lahore Authority, which was a non-political event.
However, he alleged the singer and his companions sang the song, associated with the PTI leader, on the demand of some audience. He told the police that the suspect should have kept in his mind that the event was open to the public, and was attended by people having affiliations with different political parties.
The controversial song posed a potential risk of creating unrest or violence, the complainant said, adding that the suspect and his accomplices were liable to be booked under the law.

“Operation Colombia sounds good to me,” Trump said. He also said that Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela, “looks like it’s ready to fall” on its own without US military action.







He also insisted the US was “in charge” of Venezuela after the seizure of Maduro, but was also dealing with the new leadership in Caracas.
Venezuela’s interim leader Delcy Rodriguez said at the same time that she was ready to work together with the Trump administration, asking the US leader for a balanced, respectful relationship.

 

“We’re dealing with the people who just got sworn in. Don’t ask me who’s in charge because I’ll give you an answer and it’ll be very controversial,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One when asked if he had spoken to Rodriguez.
Pressed on what he meant, Trump said: “It means we’re in charge”.
Asked whether the operation was about oil or regime change, Trump replied: “It’s about peace on earth.”
The US president said elections in Venezuela would have to wait.

 

“We’re going to run it, fix it, we’ll have elections at the right time, but the main thing you have to fix is it’s a broken country,” he said.
As he struck his triumphant tone, Trump also had harsh words for other US adversaries, saying Colombia’s leader was “not going to be doing it very long,” Communist-ruled Cuba was “ready to fall” and that Iran’s leadership will be “hit hard” if protesters are killed.
The Trump administration says it is willing to work with the remainder of Maduro’s government as long as Washington’s goals, particularly opening access to US investment in Venezuela’s enormous crude oil reserves, are met.
Maduro is in a New York detention centre awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges. His capture by the United States has sparked deep uncertainty about what is next for the oil-rich South American nation.
Top officials in Maduro’s government are still in charge and have called the detentions of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores a kidnapping.
“Here, there is only one president, whose name is Nicolas Maduro Moros. Let no one fall for the enemys provocations,” Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said in an audio recording released by the ruling PSUV socialist party.
Images of the 63-year-old Maduro blindfolded and handcuffed stunned Venezuelans. The operation was Washington’s most controversial intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama 37 years ago.
Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino said on state television the US attack killed soldiers, civilians and a “large part” of Maduro’s security detail “in cold blood”.
Venezuela’s armed forces have been activated to guarantee sovereignty, he said.
The Cuban government said 32 of its citizens were killed during the raid.
Vice President Delcy Rodriguez who also serves as oil minister has taken over as interim leader with the blessing of Venezuela’s top court and has said Maduro remains president.
Who will run Venezuela?
Despite the success of the initial US operation, questions mounted over Trump’s Venezuela strategy.
Trump said on Saturday the United States will “run” the South American country of about 30 million people.
But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed on Sunday that Washington is not seeking complete regime change or elections.
The US is fighting drug traffickers, “not a war against Venezuela,” Rubio told NBC‘s ‘Meet the Press’. However, he said a large US naval presence would remain in the Caribbean to enforce a blockade of Venezuelan oil exports for “tremendous leverage”.
With questions swirling on Capitol Hill, an administration official told AFP that Rubio will discuss Venezuela in meetings with lawmakers Monday.
Trump has made clear Washington intends to call the shots in Venezuela, with a focus on securing access to the world’s largest proven oil reserves.
Maduro, a self-described socialist, led Venezuela with an iron fist for more than a decade through a series of elections widely considered rigged. He came to power after the death of his charismatic mentor, Hugo Chavez.
As news of Maduro’s capture rippled out, exiled Venezuelans waved flags and celebrated in plazas from Madrid to Santiago.
About eight million Venezuelans have fled the grinding poverty and political suppression of their homeland.
Rodriguez has long been considered the most pragmatic member of Maduro’s inner circle. But she has publicly contradicted Trump’s claim she is willing to work with the US.
Trump said Rodriguez may pay a bigger price than Maduro “if she doesn’t do what’s right,” according to an interview with The Atlantic magazine on Sunday.
The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that remark.</p><small>2026-01-05 03:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0508313308187dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965208/un-body-to-help-pakistan-develop-its-energy-transition-plan' target='_blank'><strong>UN body to help Pakistan develop its energy transition plan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) will provide policy advisory and technical support to energy financing to assist Pakistan in the development of its Energy Transition Investment Plan (ETIP).
At the request of the government, a scoping mission of UN-ESCAP visited Pakistan recently, and held talks with ministries concerned and development partners to understand the needs, challenges, and opportunities in Pakistan on energy transition financing. The team obtained a deep understanding of entry points to building a strong ETIP and understanding where challenges and opportunities may lie, UN-ESCAP says.
The country’s energy transition is critical for economic resilience, climate commitments, and fiscal stability. Heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, coupled with a circular debt crisis exceeding Rs2.6 trillion, underscores the urgency of shifting to renewables to meet energy needs by 2030. However, challenges like policy inconsistencies, fossil fuel dependency, and limited concessional financing hinder progress.
To bridge this gap, the ETIP can assist Pakistan by working to attract green foreign direct investment and leverage blen­ded finance models that combine public and philanthropic funds to unlock private capital. Concessional funding — including low-interest loans and guarantees — is essential to make renewable energy projects financially viable, especially for underserved communities.
Existing work on Green Euro­bonds, Panda Bonds, and Green Sukuk, alongside pay-as-you-go models should be bolstered to attract investment. There is also a need to investigate how funds support grid modernisation efforts, which are critical to answering Pakis­tan’s circular debt and integrating distributed solar and battery systems into the national energy infrastructure, ESCAP suggests.

 

UN-ESCAP through its Finan­­cing Energy Transition (FET) work which provided targeted technical assistance to Indone­sia, the Philippines and Viet­nam, has expressed its readiness to support Pakistan government with its expertise on the issue in conjunction with ESCAP’s existing work with Pakistan.
ESCAP’s FET work stream has already produced three analytical reports identifying critical gaps in energy transition finance, complemented by country-level capacity-building sessions and sub-regional policy dialogues in Southeast Asia. ESCAP through its expertise on integrated energy transition planning, capacity building, and scenario analysis may help contribute to Pakistan’s ETIP and its efforts on the national energy mix, industrial competitiveness, and progress towards Net-Zero emissions, while leveraging financial instruments such as green bonds and carbon markets, ESCAP says.
Pakistan’s energy mix remains heavily skewed towards fossil fuels, with imported oil, LNG, and coal dominating the power generation landscape – posing persistent challenges to fiscal sustainability and energy security.

According to the Labour Force Survey 2025, female labour force participation (FLFP) remains unchanged at 22.4 per cent. Women’s participation in Pakistan’s labour force increased from 13.95pc in 1990; however, since 2008, it has hovered between 20pc and 24pc.
A deeper dive into the data shows that FLFP in urban areas is at least 10pc lower, highlighting that barriers continue to exist. Why is there a ‘glass ceiling’ for greater female representation? In this respect, it is essential to reassess where we stand in reducing the existing barriers and whether any progress has been made in addressing them.
Research increasingly identifies three key factors that influence FLFP in Pakistan. First, perceived safety in public spaces and workplaces deters women from joining or staying in the workforce. Second, limited safe and affordable public transportation worsens mobility challenges. Third, childcare remains scarce and costly for many families.
Unfortunately, prevailing gender norms compound these issues; when women’s income is viewed as supplementary, they often leave the workforce due to difficulty balancing work and family. To address these barriers, interventions should be inclusive and nuanced, tackling women’s diverse challenges, and policymakers and employers must collaborate to improve FLFP.

Study finds that 77pc of unemployed parents would return to work if childcare options were available

In addressing perceptions of safety, there has been significant progress in legislation that has created an enabling environment to enhance women’s economic participation. This includes the landmark ‘Pakistan’s Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act’ in 2010. In 2022, the law was amended to include an expanded definition of harassment that includes “discrimination on the basis of gender, which may or may not be sexual in nature.” In terms of creating an inclusive culture valuing psychological safety, it is also essential to ensure an awareness of what constitutes harassment and accountability when boundaries are crossed.
Workplaces are legally required to adopt family-friendly policies, including maternity and paternity leave, as well as provincial childcare mandates. However, compliance is not that easy, as many practical challenges remain for both employers and women when they go and return from maternity leave. This means fostering an inclusive environment where women are not penalised by bias and ensuring that teams impacted by maternity leave receive adequate support to manage increased workloads. Furthermore, employers need guidance on implementing the legislation, which leads to confusion and slower uptake.
Regarding childcare provision, a joint study by the United Nations (UN) Children’s Fund, UN Women, and the Pakistan Business Council found that 77pc of unemployed parents would return to work if childcare options were available.
However, an in-house childcare facility is only suitable for organisations with a large workforce. It is also costly and unmanageable for companies with teams spread across a large geographical area, as the number of parents and office space is limited. Hence, a high implementation cost remains a significant barrier for employers, underscoring the need for policymakers to explore cost-sharing mechanisms and collaborative solutions. Solutions suggested in the policy paper include mobile creches, after-school care at pre-primary and primary schools and child care allowances.
Evidence shows that clear policies drive faster results. In 2019, the State Bank of Pakistan introduced a ‘Bank on Equality’ policy to address gender disparities in financial inclusion. The policy required all institutions under the State Bank to adopt a holistic approach, including board-approved gender mainstreaming policies with actionable plans, key performance indicators, and strategies for hiring, retention, promotion, harassment protection, and the development of women-friendly products to improve gender diversity and representation.
To monitor progress, institutions had to collect and report gender-segregated data. This regulatory push has led to steady gains in female representation across the financial sector.
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has also advanced gender equity with key regulations. Since 2017, listed companies must appoint at least one female director. Recently, SECP required gender pay gap statements in annual reports for financial years ending after June 30, 2024. Public pay gap disclosure prompts boards to act on inequities. This encourages data collection and turns diversity goals into measurable outcomes.
These interventions focus on creating inclusive organisations, but challenges remain outside of the workplace. Without addressing external factors like safety and affordable transport, FLFP rates will not rise significantly.
Women continue to face distinct challenges with public transport in most cities. Many resort to costlier private options for better safety and access, which are quickly becoming unaffordable for most women. While some employers provide transport benefits, a level playing field demands a targeted, large-scale solution achievable only through public-sector initiatives.
Grouping all women under a single statistic, on the one hand, may obscure the progress made by some employers; on the other hand, it also highlights the need for a multiplier effect in the overall industry. It also underscores the need to address gender gaps through scalable, comprehensive solutions to increase FLFP.
To do this, it is essential to ensure current regulations are effective in promoting gender participation. Policymakers should systematically review existing policies through a gender lens and also begin to address how barriers compound for women with limited mobility, disabilities, less education, or greater social restrictions.

ISTANBUL/ADEN/DUBAI: Turkiye is ready to help dialogue between Yemen’s factions, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Saudi crown prince in a phone call on Sunday, his office said.
A recent internal conflict in Yemen involves the Saudi-backed internationally recognised government and the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC).
Erdogan told Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman during the phone call that Turkiye “is ready to contribute to efforts aimed at bringing parties together”, according to his office.
Ankara is closely monitoring developments in both Yemen and Somalia, Erdogan said, adding that the preservation of the territorial integrity of the two countries was vital for regional stability.
The phone call comes a day after Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry called for Yemen’s southern factions to attend a “dialogue” in Riyadh.
STC hails talks offer
The STC has welcomed a call for dialogue by Saudi Arabia to end the recent military escalation. The STC said in a statement on Saturday that the Saudi initiative was a “genuine opportunity for serious dialogue” that could safeguard “the aspirations of the southern people”.
Tarek Saleh, a member of the Saudi-backed Yemen Presidential Council, met with Saudi Defence Minister Prince Khaled bin Salman and exchanged viewpoints on Yemen.
They discussed means to bolster joint efforts to support the stability of the country and the region’s security, according to a post on X by the Yemeni official early Sunday.







’80 separatists killed’
At least 80 troops from STC have been killed in fighting with Saudi-backed forces and strikes since Friday, a military official from the group told AFP on Sunday.
Around 152 members of the STC forces were wounded and 130 were taken captive, the official said, giving a preliminary toll of casualties following the start of the operation.
Saudi-backed forces began on Friday operations to retake swathes of territory seized by the STC.
Most of the casualties had occurred in strikes by the Saudi-led coalition that targeted military camps held by the separatists, the official said, including Al-Khasha and Barshid military camps in Hadramout province.
‘Cutting off access’
Yemen’s government on Sunday also accused the separatists of cutting off the city of Aden and warned it would “take all necessary measures” after recapturing territory from them in the east on Saturday.
The government, in a statement from the presidential office to official media, said the STC had taken measures to restrict movement of citizens into Aden and that it had also received reports of a campaign of arrests in the city.
However, the separatists denied having restricted movement into Aden, but the government accusations indicate that hostility between the sides persists despite proposals for a dialogue that had raised hopes of a negotiated solution to the crisis.

ISLAMABAD: In what appeared to be a lost battle, the PIA Employees’ Combined Bargaining Agent (CBA), People’s Unity, has asked the government to put on hold the signing of the airline’s share purchase agreement (SPA) and the transfer of management control to the Arif Habib-led consortium until consideration of its reservations and a counter-offer.
In a letter to PIA’s board of directors, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Privatisation, the union alleged that the privatisation process culminating in the bidding was non-transparent, claiming that employees were not allowed to participate. It said the CBA had the expertise to turn around the loss-making national carrier through professional management and a competent board.

 

People’s Unity President Hidayatullah Khan said the government was repeating “the blunder” of selling the airliner to Arif Habib Group, whose earlier takeover attempt of Pakistan Steel Mills was declared illegal by the Supreme Court two decades ago and which had only recently penalised by the Competition Commission of Pakistan for cartelisation in steel sector.
The union said that, as the CBA, it represented employees and was a key stakeholder. “We applied to participate in the bidding process for healthy competition but were declined by the Privatisation Commission,” Mr Khan said.
He added that the union had “serious reservations” about the privatisation of Pakis­tan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (PIACL) and the transfer of 75pc shares with management control, alleging the process lacked transparency and “valuation of assets”.
The union further alleged that the process — from expression of interest to bidding, approved by the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP) and the cabinet — was conducted “without due diligence”, and claimed it bypassed the Council of Common Interests (CCI).
It also argued that the PIA Act, amended in 2016, authorised the conversion of PIA into a public limited company but did not permit “outright privatisation” through the transfer of majority control.
The union demanded an urgent meeting before the SPA is signed and management transferred “to avoid repetition of blunders” in earlier privatisation efforts.
Quoting the Supreme Court’s 2006 ruling in the PSM case, the union said the apex court had held that the privatisation process was vitiated by acts of omission and commission, including alleged violations of mandatory legal provisions and rules, which affected decisions on prequalification, valuation and the final terms offered and declared the process void and of no legal effect.
People’s Unity also alleged that Arif Habib Group and its facilitators (Public Office Holders) remained unaccountable despite Supreme Court observation and prequalified for PIACL privatisation prior to disposal of its review petition in the PSM case, which is still pending in the Supreme Court.
It alleged that Ayesha Steel Mills, owned by Arif Habib Group, and International Steels Ltd (ISL) were involved in cartelisation and penalised by the Competition Commission of Pakistan in October 2025 and were imposed a fine of Rs1.5 billion.
The union contended that blaming PIA and its employees for the carrier’s performance was unjustified, arguing that outcomes were shaped by the commercial policies and priorities of management and the board.
Threatening to challenge the case before the parliamentary committees and other appropriate courts of law, the People’s Unity pointed out that the PIA Act 1956 (as amended in 2016), the SOEs Act 2023 and the NAB Ordinance required management performance monitoring. “The PIA would have not been in this situation if any system of check and balance and performance monitoring exist,” it added.
It claimed that the PIA workforce had better knowledge and experienced to turn around the airline, if a knowledgeable board of directors and professional management played its role without privatisation.
The CBA offered to provide all technical and financial details with clarifications to the Ministry of Defence, Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), the Privatisation Commission and the parliamentary committees as to how to turn around the PIACL instead of “wasting time and money in unnecessary litigation”.

JERUSALEM/DUBAI: In a message meant to provoke the Tehran regime, Israeli PM Benjamin Netan­yahu said on Sunday that his country stood in solidarity with the people of Iran, as protests over soaring inflation spread across several cities.
Rights groups estimate that at least 16 people have died during a week of violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces.
Deaths and arrests have been reported through the week both by state media and rights groups, though the figures differ. Reuters has not been able to independently verify the numbers.
“We stand in solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people and with their aspirations for freedom, liberty and justice,” Netanyahu said at the weekly cabinet meeting.
“It is very possible that we are stan­ding at a moment when the Iranian people are taking their destiny into their own hands,” he said, according to a statement from his office.
Netanyahu also addressed Tehran’s nuclear programme, saying he discussed it with US President Donald Trump during his official visit this week.
“We reiterated our shared position of zero enrichment on the one hand, and the need, of course, to remove the 400 kilograms of enriched material from Iran and subject the sites to strict and genuine oversight,” Netanyahu said, adding that the conversation took place at the outset of the “dramatic” demonstrations.
Monthly payment
Iranian authorities on Sunday announced they will give a monthly allowance to every citizen in the country to alleviate economic pressure, after a week of protests.
“Individuals can receive an amount equivalent to one million Tomans (approximately $7) per person per month, which is credited to their accounts for four months,” government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani told state TV.
She said the amount will be given to every Iranian for four months in the form of credit that can be used to purchase certain goods and is inte­nded to “reduce the economic pressure on the people.” In Iran, which has a population of more than 85 million people, the minimum wage is roughly $100 (85 euros) and average monthly salaries are around $200.
Iranians mostly use mobile phones and debit cards for their daily purchases instead of cash.
Speaking to state media, Iran’s police chief Ahmad-Reza Radan said that security forces had been targeting protest leaders for arrest over the previous two days, saying “a big number of leaders on the virtual space have been detained”.
The most intense clashes have been reported in western parts of Iran but there have also been protests and clashes between demonstrators and police in Tehran, in central areas, and in the southern Baluchistan province.
Speaking on Sunday, Vice President Mohammadreza Aref said the government acknowledged the country faced shortcomings while warning that some people were seeking to exploit the protests.
“We expect the youth not to fall into the trap of the enemies,” Aref said in comments carried by state media.

Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago club and in a televised interview, Trump characterised his actions as necessary for regional stability while directing personal invective at Latin American heads of state who opposed the operation.
He specifically targeted Colombian President Gustavo Petro with a warning to “watch his a**” and asserted that drug cartels have seized control of the Mexican government.
Trump’s harshest rhetoric addressed Petro, a vocal critic of the US military operation in Vene­zuela. Trump accused the Colombian leader of facilitating drug trafficking into the United States.
“He has cocaine mills, he has factories where he makes cocaine. And yeah, I think I stick by my first statement: He’s making cocaine,” Trump said of Petro. “They’re sending it to the United States. So he does have to watch his back.”
Turning to Mexico, Trump disputed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo’s authority, despite describing her as “a good woman” during an appearance on “Fox & Friends”. He claimed organised crime has superseded her government’s power.
“But the cartels are running Mexico — she’s not running Mexico,” Trump said, warning that regarding the neighbouring country, “something’s going to have to be done.”
The comments drew immediate backlash from the region. Sheinbaum issued a statement saying Mexico “strongly condemns and rejects” the military action against Maduro, urging Washington to cease “all acts of aggression against the Venezuelan government and people”.
Petro previously criticised the intervention as an assault on Latin American sovereignty.
The president also labelled Cuba a “failing nation” and suggested the communist-led island could face increased pressure given its close ties to Venezuela. The Cuban government provided security assistance to Maduro and relies on Venezuelan oil.
“Cuba, as you know, is not doing very well right now,” Trump said. “The people there have suffered for many, many years, and I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about.”
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a long-time critic of the Cuban government, reinforced the president’s stance. Rubio suggested that officials in Havana should be “concerned — at least a little bit”.
Mr Trump framed the administration’s aggressive posture as a push for hemispheric dominance and resource protection following Maduro’s transfer to a New York prison.
“We want to surround ourselves with good neighbours. We want stability. We want energy,” Trump said. “That country has tremendous energy, and it’s very important that we protect it.”

For businesses, mounting pressure to adapt to rule-based management and rapidly shifting market dynamics makes the year ahead highly uncertain.
Persistent political instability, entrenched resistance to reforms that threaten elite privileges and immunity, low-grade insurgency in border regions, climate-related disaster risks, and the enduring spectre of terrorism severely constrain decisive economic actions. These domestic constraints are further compounded by global uncertainty.
Fiscal resource management under the IMF watch has translated into a crushing burden on compliant taxpayers through higher rates, while cuts in relief and development spending have hurt public welfare. At the same time, the cost of running the government has continued to rise unchecked.

The government must exercise caution in its policy choices, ensuring that short-term growth ambition does not undermine long-term economic stability, social equity and institutional resilience

These policies have suppressed savings and investment, undermining growth. With GDP expanding by 3.2 per cent, barely matching the population growth, economic gains are effectively neutralised, resulting in rising poverty, unemployment, and mounting social stress.
Much like earlier PML-N governments, Prime Minister Shehbaz’s administration appears inclined to accommodate business interests on the assumption that growth benefits will naturally trickle down to the broader population.
However, Pakistan’s own history underscores this reality: periods of relatively high growth under General Ayub, Zia and Musharraf were accompanied by widening income and wealth disparities, while the gains proved short-lived and left the economy more fragile and society fractured.
The Shehbaz government must, therefore, exercise greater caution in its policy choices, ensuring that short-term growth ambition does not undermine long-term economic stability, social equity and institutional resilience.
Nobel laureate economist and professor Dr Joseph Stiglitz has consistently argued that progress is inseparable from greater equity. Both individuals and firms must embrace cooperation, ethical norms, and trust that markets function well only within strong government frameworks that promote fairness and shared prosperity.
For businesses, this translates into investing responsibly in a resilient, productive capacity, adopting long-term strategies and accounting for broader social and environmental impact. For individuals, it requires an awareness of how power structures shape opportunity, dignity and economic outcomes, and an active role in advocating policies.
Analysts argue that expecting meaningful government-led relief under Pakistan’s current economic constraints may be unrealistic. Households and firms, therefore, would be better served by focusing on strengthening their own resilience, leveraging internal efficiencies, skills and adaptive strategies, to navigate the economic challenges ahead.
Dr Khaqan Najeeb, former economic advisor to the Ministry of Finance, argues that in 2026, financial resilience will depend less on policy relief and more on fiscal discipline. He advises households to prioritise regular savings, limit consumer borrowing, diversify income sources, and invest in skills that hold value in an inflation-prone economy.
“For businesses and industry, he believes resilience will come from disciplined cash-flow management, prudent pricing, lower leverage, and a relentless focus on cost control and productivity. This includes improving energy efficiency, strengthening supply chains, and leveraging AI and digital tools to streamline operations. Firms that remain lean, adaptable, and risk-aware, he notes, will be best positioned to navigate persistent volatility and uncertainty.
Nasim Beg, a prominent business executive, also emphasises restraint in consumption for individuals and competitiveness as a central priority for firms. He argues that households are best served by maximising savings and allocating investments prudently, with a significant share in debt mutual funds (income and money market funds), some directed toward retirement planning through voluntary pension schemes, and a portion in equity funds. The appropriate mix, he remarks, should vary by age, risk appetite, and financial goals.
For businesses, Mr Beg stresses that long-term viability will depend on strengthening competitiveness, particularly by focusing on export-oriented activities and import-substitution opportunities. In a constrained macro-economic environment, he believes that firms that align their strategies with foreign exchange generation, efficiency and market diversification will be better placed to withstand volatility and sustain growth.
Majyd Aziz, President, Employers Federation of Pakistan (EFP), expects economic stability and sustainability to improve in 2026 despite recent shocks. Reflecting on a turbulent 2025 marked by floods, regional conflict, political instability, terrorism and painful economic restructuring, he believes the outlook is cautiously positive.
Mr Aziz stresses that households and businesses must shoulder primary responsibility for navigating ongoing pressures. He notes that EFP has been sensitizing employers and workers, representing nearly three million people, to tighten belts, avoid wasteful spending, and use resources more efficiently, particularly to protect more vulnerable groups.
For businesses, especially those facing closures, high energy costs, and productivity losses, he advises sharper cost discipline through just-in-time inventories, workforce mentoring, digitisation, renewable energy adoption and waste reduction. For citizens grappling with inflation and job insecurity, he urges collective, community-based coping mechanisms, disciplined consumption, and stronger engagement with elective representatives rather than passive endurance.

Each inflow is celebrated, incentives are justified, and promotional roadshows abound — all based on the assumption that more FDI will inevitably translate into economic growth, jobs, exports, and a stronger external account. However, this assumption is flawed and needs reassessment.
The pitfalls of indiscriminate FDI
Attracting FDI without regard to sector or investor intent is not only symptomatic of weak policymaking but, in Pakistan’s case, also an ineffective strategy. A significant portion of foreign investors in Pakistan is primarily driven by the country’s large domestic market rather than any intent to use Pakistan as an export base.
With over 240 million consumers, Pakistan offers a sizable and relatively protected market, often shielded by high tariffs and a poor competitive environment. For many foreign investors, serving domestic demand is far more appealing than engaging in global markets where competition is intense.
This pattern also mirrors the behaviour of local investors, many of whom focus on the same domestic market without seeking export-oriented growth. Exporters and manufacturers have turned to shopping malls, real estate and sectors such as autos that cater to the home market.

Treating all FDI as equally beneficial and celebrating investments that merely exploit domestic demand reflects a flawed economic strategy

Barriers to export-oriented investment
Pakistan’s business environment is hostile to manufacturing, creating a significant deterrent for both foreign and local investors. The country has some of the highest industrial energy costs in the region. Frequent hikes in electricity and gas prices — usually implemented to manage fiscal pressures — turn energy into a de facto tax on manufacturers and exporters. Where competing economies treat energy as a strategic input, Pakistan has come to rely on it as a revenue source.
Taxation further exacerbates the situation. Exporters face high effective tax rates and navigate a complex, opaque system of withholding taxes, advance payments, delayed refunds, and discretionary enforcement. Despite official rhetoric promoting export-led growth, the tax regime often treats exporters as short-term cash cows, rather than long-term drivers of foreign exchange earnings. Foreign investors turn to countries that offer significantly lower tax rates than Pakistan.
Investor behaviour and policy flaws
Pakistan’s regulatory unpredictability, overlapping jurisdictions, weak contract enforcement, and an intrusive compliance culture further complicate the business environment. Persistent concerns about security, law and order, and inadequate logistics infrastructure undermine Pakistan’s reputation as a reliable platform for export-oriented activity.
Faced with these challenges, foreign investors act rationally by prioritising sectors where competition is weak, such as consumer goods and telecommunications, or where returns are guaranteed by state involvement, as in the energy sector.
While such investments can inflate headline FDI figures, they contribute little to sustainable economic growth or a balanced external account. Such investments tend to offer short payback periods, but when competition increases, investors are quick to withdraw.
The current indiscriminate approach to attracting FDI has failed to generate meaningful structural changes in Pakistan’s economy. While it may yield short-term capital inflows, it does little to foster technological depth or expand export capacity — two key areas where Pakistan’s economy is critically deficient. In some cases, it even crowds out domestic firms, especially those lacking the financial strength or political access enjoyed by multinational corporations.
A new approach
Pakistan needs to reconsider not just the quantity of FDI it attracts, but also the type and purpose of such investments. Instead of pursuing FDI for the sake of inflows, the focus should shift toward using foreign capital to introduce new technologies, enhance standards, increase exports, and reduce dependency on imports — particularly in food items.
Foreign investors expect returns aligned with Pakistan’s risk profile, often seeing returns of more than 100 per cent per annum. Thus, inward market-seeking FDI is swiftly offset by profit and royalty remittances, which over time drain Pakistan’s foreign reserves. The same happens with FDI into utilities or state-owned enterprises that rely on rupee income.
A more credible FDI strategy would prioritise export-oriented sectors where Pakistan holds or has the potential for a comparative advantage. Key sectors to focus on include agro-processing, value-added agriculture, pharmaceuticals, light engineering, tourism, and mineral-based industries, all of which have significant export potential.
By capitalising on Pakistan’s sub-optimally utilised natural resources — water and land — import dependence could also be reduced. The services sector, particularly information technology, could absorb a significant portion of the country’s young workforce, especially in areas less likely to be disrupted by artificial intelligence. Additionally, medical tourism would benefit from partnerships with global healthcare organisations, such as those in the United Arab Emirates.
In textiles, apparel, and fashion, global brands and retailers typically prefer to source rather than directly invest in suppliers. However, with improved security conditions, Chinese apparel companies could relocate their plants to Pakistan to benefit from lower labour costs and avoid high tariffs and import restrictions in Western markets. The recent Service Long March Tyre joint venture with Chinese investment highlights this potential.
Leveraging FDI to open new markets
FDI can also help improve market access for Pakistani exports. For example, a major global food company investing in Pakistan could open doors for local horticultural products in international markets.
Positive FDI impacts are already visible in agriculture, with multinational expertise improving maize cultivation and potato seed quality. A critical area of focus remains the indigenisation of edible oils, which cost Pakistan billions of dollars annually.

 

Barrick Gold’s investment in Reko Diq could also benefit local investors in adjoining mines, although net foreign exchange inflows will take time due to substantial initial investments. By focusing on refining minerals domestically, Pakistan could add significant value rather than merely exporting raw slurry.
Building competitiveness
The primary challenge for investors is not a lack of ambition but a policy environment that penalises productive activity and rewards rent-seeking. Key reforms are needed — competitive energy pricing, a simplified, globally competitive and predictable tax system, prompt tax refunds, better trade facilitation, and a substantial reduction in regulatory harassment. These reforms would do more to stimulate exports than any number of international investment conferences.
This is not an argument against FDI, but rather a call for a more selective approach. FDI should be actively encouraged where it brings new technologies, integrates Pakistan into global value chains, and contributes to export growth. Treating all FDI as equally beneficial — and celebrating investments that merely exploit domestic demand and temporarily boost reserves — reflects a flawed economic strategy.
Domestic consumers are exploited when local or foreign investment, protected by tariffs, produces products that are more expensive and of lower quality than imported alternatives.
Competitiveness cannot be imported through press releases or investment pledges. It must be built domestically by correcting incentives, fostering local capital, and aligning policy with long-term export productivity rather than short-term capital inflows through indiscriminate pursuit of FDI.

However, many bankers insist that it risks becoming a repeat of the yellow cab scheme from the 1990s as it imposes “directed lending” on commercial banks in a weak legal and recovery environment.
“It is a model that has repeatedly failed in Pakistan and sits uneasily with market principles the country has committed to adhere to under the IMF [International Monetary Fund] programme,” argued the head of retail banking at a mid-sized bank who requested anonymity.
Zarkhez-e, also branded as Asaan Digital Zarai Qarza, aimed at expanding collateral-free agricultural lending for smallholders and tenants across the country, was launched by the State Bank (SBP) in October last year. Introduced under the National Subsistence Farmers Support Initiative, the project seeks to provide clean loans of up to Rs1 million to a landowner farmer and up to Rs500,000 to a tenant for a period of one year at competitive market rates.

 

The scheme provides an end-to-end digital lending solution, allowing subsistence farmers and tenants to apply for agriculture loans through a centralised online portal. Following verification and agronomic assessment through the Land Information Management System, applications are forwarded to the applicant’s chosen commercial bank or microfinance bank for approval and disbursement, improving transparency and efficiency.

Banks cannot substitute relationship-based rural finance with unsecure, portal-driven credit mandates and expect similar repayment behaviour

A key feature of the scheme is that at least 75 per cent of financing is disbursed in kind, ensuring the provision of quality agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and diesel through accredited agri-merchants on boarded by banks. The remaining 25pc is disbursed in cash to meet other operational farming expenses.
At the heart of the bankers’ concern is coercion. “Each bank has been given a target by the SBP according to its balance-sheet size to be met within the given timelines. This is not organic credit expansion driven by risk-return considerations; it is verbal and administrative pressure applied by a regulator whose role is supervisory, not credit allocation,” the chief financial officer (CFO) of a big bank maintained, requesting anonymity.
“Nowhere in mature banking systems are private banks compelled to undertake collateral-free lending under regulatory nudges masked as policy reform,” he asked.
Bankers say the scheme’s defining feature — uncollateralised or unsecured lending backed by a 10pc first-loss government guarantee — may sound reassuring, but it is insufficient in Pakistan’s scenario. “Recovery laws remain compromised, enforcement is weak and judicial processes for recovery are notoriously slow. The first-loss cover barely scratches the surface of the credit risk banks face when defaults occur, and legal recourse stretches into years — sometimes decades. Losses beyond that threshold will still sit squarely on banks’ balance sheets,” the retail banker asserted.
Supporters of the scheme argue that risk assessment and collateral decisions are left to lenders themselves. In practice, this autonomy is largely illusory. Once targets are imposed and progress is monitored through an industry-wide digital portal, discretion narrows sharply. “Credit appraisal without enforceable security in a weak recovery ecosystem is not prudent banking — it is policy-driven exposure,” another senior banker who looks after credit risk assessment at his bank contends.
Besides, the proponents of the scheme insist, to mitigate credit risk, all farmers availing loans under the scheme will be covered by group life insurance, equivalent to the loan amount disbursed and outstanding. In the event of a borrower’s death, loan recovery will be effected through insurance.
In addition, crop loan insurance will be mandatory for five major crops, providing protection against yield losses. “That the banks’ money is protected or not is not the real issue here. The bigger question is: should the SBP act on behalf of the government and force banks to lend to a sector where it does not want to or doesn’t have the expertise to?” the CFO wondered. “It’s more about the principles upon which the market economy is founded.”
Some say the IMF is unlikely to view the scheme favourably as it blurs the line between regulation and fiscal policy. Directed credit programmes, especially those carrying explicit or implicit state backing, distort resource allocation, weaken credit discipline and eventually migrate onto the public balance sheet.
“Pakistan’s own history offers ample evidence of how such initiatives morph into liabilities,” another senior banker contended.
Bankers say comparisons with informal lenders further expose the flaws in the “directed agricultural lending” scheme. “Arhtis lend without collateral because they possess local knowledge, enjoy social leverage and possess monitoring capacity that banks lack. Replicating outcomes without replicating incentives and enforcement is wishful thinking. Banks cannot substitute the relationship-based rural finance with portal-driven unsecured credit mandates and expect similar repayment behaviour,” the CFO emphasised.
The political economy surrounding the scheme is worrying. “Agriculture credit has long been vulnerable to political intervention, loan rescheduling pressures and informal signals to go easy on recoveries. Once lending is perceived as state-directed rather than commercially driven, repayment discipline weakens further. What begins as ‘financial inclusion’ quickly degenerates into entitlement,” he added.
Bankers contend that if agricultural finance is to be sustainable, it must be market-based and profitable, not treated as a form of corporate social responsibility. “Banks will lend more when the environment allows them to recover price risk and earn returns,” the retail banking head observed.
Zarkhez-e, in its current form, risks repeating a familiar mistake: using banks as instruments of policy rather than intermediaries of capital. At a time when Pakistan needs credit to support growth, forcing losses through directed lending may achieve the opposite — further shrinking risk appetite and weakening the financial system. True, sustainable reform lies not in coercion, but in creating conditions where lending to farmers makes commercial sense.

The move comes after around 66,154 passengers were offloaded last year despite holding valid documents, particularly at Lahore and Karachi airports, amid a post-2024 Greece boat tragedy crackdown on migrant smuggling, which claimed several Pakistani lives.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered the formation of a special committee to probe the frequent offloading of travellers, which has triggered growing concern and criticism from affected passengers.
Taking to his X account, Naqvi wrote: “Pleased to share that the Federal Investigation Agency (@FIA Pakistan) has launched Pre-Departure Facilitation Desks across all zonal offices with immediate effect.”







According to the FIA, the initiative aims to provide guidance and assistance to international travellers on immigration procedures and clearances, ensuring a smoother and more hassle-free travel experience.
The desks have been established in eleven zones – including Islamabad’s G/6 zonal office — and will be accessible for intending international travellers, as well as through helplines and email services.
An FIA spokesman told Dawn the desks will be operational for international travellers on Saturday and Sunday, with experienced immigration staff deputed to facilitate citizens.
“The immigration staff, headed by the assistant director and assisted by an inspector and a sub-inspector, will be available for citizens to provide them with details of visa documents required to travel, which visa is needed, a return ticket and how much currency they can keep with them, among other details,” he said.
The spokesman said the facilitation desks have been set up at FIA zonal offices for international travellers — both locals and foreigners — seeking travel-related information, with immigration staff available from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Sunday.
“Main zonal offices are located across the country, including Islamabad serving the federal capital territory, Karachi covering Sindh, Lahore covering Punjab, Peshawar covering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Quetta covering Balochistan. Zonal offices are also located in Gujranwala, Faisalabad and Multan,” he added.
Last month, FIA authorities told the National Assembly Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development that it offloaded 66,154 passengers from Pakistani Airports in 2025 compared to 2024’s figure of 35,000.
Initially, FIA authorities were reluctant to share details of the large-scale offloading of international travellers, despite repeated media queries and complaints from passengers who said they were stopped despite holding valid travel documents.</p><small>2026-01-05 02:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04234820f682c69.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965075/indias-abeyance-claim-has-no-standing-under-treaty-law-pakistan-commissioner-for-indus-waters' target='_blank'><strong>India’s ‘abeyance’ claim has no standing under treaty law: Pakistan commissioner for Indus Waters</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Muhammad Mehar Ali Shah on Sunday said India’s claim of placing the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in “abeyance” has no legal basis and that the treaty remains fully in force under international law.
In April 2025, India held the IWT in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”. In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration held that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
Speaking on Geo News‘ programme ‘Jirga’, Shah talked about the legality of India holding the IWT in abeyance and said: “As far as holding the treaty in abeyance is concerned, the word ‘abeyance’ is not recognised under international treaty law. It is a coined term, because we believe India understands that it cannot suspend, breach or terminate the treaty.”
However, he cautioned that India’s continued non-cooperation within the rules-based framework, effectively sidestepping its obligations on self-created grounds, was “alarming”, prompting Pakistan to pursue a formal and carefully calibrated legal and diplomatic response.
“To address this, Pakistan is employing efforts carefully, and whatever steps are being taken are formal in nature,” he said.
He said the treaty was carefully negotiated to withstand political tensions and disputes, stressing that its dispute-resolution mechanism was designed to prevent unilateral actions.



About Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s threats of stopping the flow of Pakistan’s share of water, Shah asserted: “There is no room for stopping or partially stopping Pakistan’s water. This also goes against moral standards.
“Technically, if one party is stubborn on diverting the western rivers flowing into Pakistan, to reduce it to stop it, so naturally, there have been inter-basin transfer examples in the world,” he observed.
“When we gave the three eastern rivers to India, we have been facing consequences since the beginning of the treaty. Sutlej is always dry, barring the flooding season. Ravi is dry,” the water commissioner said.
Shah reiterated that any move by India to reduce water flows to Pakistan “would be considered an act of war”.
“There is no fixed amount of water allocated to Pakistan,” he said, adding that the waters should be available to Pakistan based on the “natural pattern of the western rivers”.
“So far, Chenab, Jhelum and Indus are receiving water in a natural pattern. But since April 24, 2025, India has created three such episodes, which we picked up — twice in May and once in December — when they increased the flow and then decreased it for a few days,” Shah pointed out.

 

Speaking about the procedures stated under the “well-thought-out” pact, Shah said one clause stated that in the face of conflict, Pakistan and India will peacefully solve the water matter. “Otherwise, they will hand it to a neutral party,” he added.
The official noted, “The 12th and last article of this treaty has four provisions. In the last paragraph, it says that with the passage of time, some changes can be made to the pact, but both parties have to mutually agree; otherwise, the pact will remain fully enforced.
“And it clearly says that no one party can unilaterally change it,” the water commissioner stressed.
Asked whether the IWT favoured India, Shah replied that the three eastern rivers — Beas, Ravi and Sutlej — have a “geographic advantage”, unlike the western rivers.
Recalling the history of water disputes between the two neighbours, Shah said India halted the rivers’ flow to Pakistan on March 31, 1948, which Pakistan protested on a bilateral level and took the issue to the United Nations.
After the IWT was agreed upon in 1960, India first violated the pact when it was building the Salal Dam, with which Pakistan had issues, and they were subsequently resolved through the treaty.
“The pact does not have a guarantor as such, but it has its own mechanism,” the official observed.
The water commissioner said the basic feature of the IWT was that the western rivers’ natural flow must not be altered.
“India was allowed to use the western rivers for hydroelectric power generation only in line with the pact guidelines. If there is a violation, then any party can take the matter to a third forum,” Shah said.
Providing an example of such an instance, Shah recalled that Pakistan decided to take the matter to a third forum when India built the Baglihar Dam on the western rivers, “violating five of the conditions”.

 

The official noted there were two third-party forums where conflicts could be taken — “one is a neutral forum, and the other is the Court of Arbitration forum”. The procedure for it, Shah added, was that the water commissioners must inform each other and suggest whether the matter should go to a neutral party or a court.
“So if one party does not agree to going to the court, for instance, then the matter must go to a neutral party, who will decide whether the matter falls within their expertise,” he explained, adding that internationally recognised experts are part of the team when the issue is taken to a neutral forum.
“When the Baglihar Dam decision was taken, it was not in favour of Pakistan. The extent of that decision was only confined to the Baglihar Dam and it did not apply to any future development plans,” Shah said.
The water commissioner highlighted that although Pakistan did not agree with the decision, it was binding under the IWT.
“So in order to stop India from taking future decisions based on the decision of the Baglihar Dam, Pakistan filed a case at the Court of Arbitration for a general interpretation.”
Detailing more water conflicts, Shah said that after Baglihar, Pakistan raised the issue about India constructing the 850 megawatt Ratle Hydroelectric Plant on the Chenab river bilaterally first, and also went to a third forum.

 

The water commissioner then mentioned that Pakistan had also raised objections on the Kiru and Kwar hydroelectric projects in India, whose designs New Delhi shared with Islamabad prior to the April 2025 developments.</p><small>2026-01-04 19:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0420423652c9517.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965071/114-killed-in-week-of-attacks-in-sudans-darfur-medical-sources' target='_blank'><strong>114 killed in week of attacks in Sudan’s Darfur: medical sources</strong></a><br><p>Attacks by Sudan’s army and its paramilitary foes on two towns in the western Darfur region over the past week have killed 114 people, medical sources told AFP on Sunday.
Since April 2023, Sudan has been gripped by a war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which in October seized the army’s last holdout position in Darfur.
The RSF has since pushed west to the Chadian border and east through the vast Kordofan region, where a drone strike on the North Kordofan capital of El-Obeid on Sunday caused a blackout in the key army-controlled city.
A medical source reported Sunday that 51 people were killed the day before in drone strikes attributed to the army on the North Darfur town of Al-Zuruq, 180 kilometres (112 miles) north of the RSF-overrun state capital El-Fashir.
The strike hit a market and civilian areas, the source said.
Al-Zuruq, under RSF control, is home to family members of RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the former deputy of his now rival, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.
“Two of the Daglo family were killed, Moussa Saleh Daglo and Awad Moussa Saleh Daglo,” an eyewitness to the burial told AFP.
Both the RSF and the army are accused of targeting civilian areas, in what the UN has called a “war of atrocities”.
RSF fighters advancing westward towards the border with Chad last week killed another 63 people in and around the town of Kernoi, a medical source in the local hospital told AFP on Sunday.
“Until Friday, 63 were killed and 57 injured… in attacks launched by the RSF around Kernoi,” they said, speaking on condition of anonymity for their safety.
Local sources told AFP that 17 people were still missing.
The entire Darfur region is largely inaccessible to reporters and is under years-long communications blackout, forcing local volunteers and medics to use satellite internet to get news to the world.
According to the United Nations, over 7,000 people were displaced in just two days last month from Kernoi and the nearby village of Um Baru.
Many are from the Zaghawa group, which has been targeted by the RSF.  Members of the group have fought in the current war alongside the army in a coalition known as the Joint Forces.
‘Attacked by drones’
Since the war began, tens of thousands have been killed and millions displaced.
Much of the worst fighting has been in Darfur, reviving memories of mass ethnic atrocities committed in the 2000s by the Janjaweed, the RSF’s predecessor.
The war’s fiercest violence is currently unfolding in Kordofan, Sudan’s vast oil-rich southern region that links Darfur to the capital Khartoum, which the army recaptured last year.
Drone strikes on North Kordofan capital El-Obeid caused a power outage, the national electricity company said.
“El-Obeid power station … was attacked by drones, leading to a fire in the machinery building, which led to a halt in the electricity supply,” the company said.
Following its victory in El-Fasher, the RSF has sought to recapture Sudan’s central corridor, tightening its siege with its local allies around several army-held cities.
Hundreds of thousands face mass starvation across the region.
Last year, the army broke a paramilitary siege on El-Obeid, which the RSF has sought to encircle since.
The Joint Forces said last week they had retaken several towns south of El-Obeid, which, according to a military source, could “open up the road between El-Obeid and Dilling” — one of South Kordofan’s besieged cities.
Since mid-December, some 11,000 people have been displaced from North and South Kordofan states, according to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration.
The war has forced more than 11 million people to flee internally and across Sudan’s borders, many of them seeking shelter in underdeveloped areas with a lack of nutrition, medicine and clean water.</p><small>2026-01-04 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04195102c56d0e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965070/cm-afridi-clarifies-his-only-stance-is-acting-upon-imrans-directives-to-run-kp-prepare-for-street-movement' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi clarifies his ‘only stance’ is acting upon Imran’s directives to run KP, prepare for street movement</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday clarified that his “only stance” was to implement PTI founder Imran Khan’s directives to run his province and prepare for the party’s street movement.
Afridi had previously announced that Karachi was his next destination for galvanising party supporters after he concluded his three-day visit to Lahore, where he also met with the families of jailed senior PTI leaders.
In a post on social media platform X earlier today, the KP chief minister said, “I have only one stance. My leader (Imran) has directed me to prepare for a street movement, along with running the administrative affairs of my province.
“God-willing, I will implement them in letter and spirit. Any other news attributed to me would be someone’s personal assumption,” he added.







About his upcoming visit to Karachi, CM Afridi said Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, “respecting democratic values and his office’s dignity”, has invited him for a meeting.
Afridi said he had thanked Murad for the invitation and told him that he would meet “the people of my province, and if they had any sort of concerns or issues”, he would definitely meet the Sindh chief minister to resolve those.
While the KP CM had earlier stated January 9 (Friday) as the date for his planned trip to Karachi, in his statement today, Afridi said he would pay a visit to Mazar-i-Quaid at around 4pm on January 11 (Sunday).
Afridi’s latest statement highlighting his focus on the street movement comes after it was reported that he had said he was ready to hold talks with the establishment on provincial matters and improve relations.
But, at the same time, he also said that Imran had not instructed him on anything regarding talks with the establishment, and that the ex-premier had assigned the task to Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Senator Allama Raja Nasir, according to media reports.
His reported remarks were from his interaction with journalists in Peshawar on Friday.
Afridi was also reported to have said that if “any ceremony or meeting takes place, he would definitely meet” Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
During his visit to Lahore, CM Afridi had cast doubt on the government’s sincerity in holding talks with the PTI and said he was actively making efforts to initiate the party’s street movement by reaching out to multiple stakeholders.
Asked whether he believed issues with the federal government could be resolved through talks, Afridi had said during his Lahore visit that Imran had assigned the responsibility for “dialogue or protest” to the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP).</p><small>2026-01-04 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04191808baa7e6d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965069/three-injured-after-back-to-back-quadcopter-attacks-on-school-in-north-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Three injured after ‘back-to-back quadcopter attacks’ on school in North Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: At least three people, including a school principal and Rescue 1122 official, were injured on Tuesday when unknown assailants targeted a private school with “back-to-back quadcopter attacks” in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali, local sources said.
For months, banned militant organisations in the region have been using improvised munitions like quadcopters to drop explosives, targeting security forces and civilians.
According to local sources, the incident took place in Khasokhel village, where “explosives were dropped from the quadcopter onto the premises of Al-Fatah Public School, injuring the school’s principal and security guard.”
Soon after the incident, a Rescue 1122 medical team reached the site to provide first aid and evacuate the injured.
However, rescue officials said that while rescue personnel were engaged in relief work, another quadcopter dropped a mortar shell near the scene, injuring a Rescue 1122 worker.
“All the injured were provided initial medical treatment and later shifted to Bannu for further care, where their condition was stated to be stable,” a Rescue 1122 official said.
Sources said that the attack triggered panic in the area, forcing people living near the school to rush out of their homes in fear.
Residents strongly condemned the attack on rescue workers, calling it “highly deplorable”. Rescue officials said their personnel reached the area despite serious security threats and continued their duties under life-threatening conditions.
A local told Dawn that targeting a school through a drone attack was “an act of hostility against education and a dangerous assault on the lives of innocent children.”
Government authorities confirmed that an investigation into the incident was underway, while no militant group had so far claimed responsibility for the attack.
Parents and social figures of the area expressed grave concern over the incident, stating that attacks on educational institutions and emergency service providers were unacceptable. They urged the government to take immediate and effective security measures to ensure the safety of students, teachers, and civilians in the region.
There has been a history of targeting schools, especially girls’ schools, in several parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as the militants in the region don’t consider girls’ education legitimate as per their ideology.
Earlier in December, the terrorists blew up a government girls’ school in Mir Ali, North Waziristan district, by planting explosives during the night hours. Around 250 girls were enrolled at the school.
In the same month, the lives of over 600 school-going children were put at risk when unidentified militants blasted a government primary school by planting explosives.</p><small>2026-01-04 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04190952bd0b68b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965059/fm-dar-wang-yi-term-pak-china-friendship-vital-for-regional-peace-stability' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar, Wang Yi term Pak-China friendship ‘vital’ for regional peace, stability</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Sunday termed Pakistan-China friendship “vital” for regional peace and stability as both leaders co-chaired the 7th round of the Pakistan–China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Beijing.
Dar reached Beijing on Sat­urday at Wang’s invitation, primarily to co-chair the strategic dialogue.
Following the dialogue today, the Foreign Office (FO) in a statement on social media platform X said: “Highlighting the salience of the All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, both leaders reaffirmed that the Pakistan–China friendship is vital for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region and for the two countries.
“They also agreed to enhance coordination at bilateral and multilateral fora,” the FO added.
The two sides reviewed the entire spectrum of Pak–China relations and discussed “key issues at the regional and global levels”. The FO further said views were exchanged on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), trade, multilateral cooperation, and people-to-people exchanges.
“The two leaders also agreed to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Pakistan–China diplomatic relations,” the FO added.







In a separate post, the FO said Dar and Wang jointly unveiled the logo for the 75th anniversary of Pakistan-China diplomatic relations, “marking the start of year-long celebrations to commemorate this historic milestone in a befitting and memorable manner”.







The sixth round of the strategic dialogue was held in Islamabad in Aug­ust, with Yi visiting the capital and meeting Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Pres­ident Asif Ali Zardari.
At the time, China had affirmed its commitment to working with Pakistan on promoting regional peace, development and stability.
Other high-level meetings
Dar, who serves as the deputy prime minister as well, also held meetings with Chinese dignitaries in Beijing earlier today, with exchanges mainly focusing on bilateral ties, according to statements issued by the FO.
Among those Dar met was Chinese Executive Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.







“The two sides reaffirmed their shared commitment to further deepening the Pakistan–China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership,” the FO said, adding that the Chinese executive vice premier “appreciated Pakistan’s consistent support to China on issues of core interest”.
Both leaders noted the historic significance of the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between their countries and agreed to utilise this milestone to chart a forward-looking vision for enhanced cooperation, including under the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the statement said.
Vice Premier Ding conveyed New Year greetings to the leadership and people of Pakistan, it added.
A separate FO statement said Dar also met the minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Liu Haixing.
Dar congratulated Minister Liu on the successful convening of the 4th Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, the statement said.







It added that the two sides “expressed satisfaction with the steady and forward-looking trajectory of bilateral relations while reviewing party-to-party exchanges, regional developments, and progress on various projects under CPEC”.
They also agreed to jointly commemorate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China in a “befitting and meaningful manner”.
Dar, who is visiting Beijing at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Yi, was received at the airport by China’s Special Representative on Afghanistan Ambassador Yue Xiaoyong, Pakistan’s ambassador to China and officials from the Pak­istani Embassy.
75th year of Pak-China diplomatic ties
Apart from the Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue, Dar was also set to attend events marking the beginning of the 75th year of Pakistan-China diplomatic ties, with both countries planning initiatives and commemorative activities throughout 2026, the FO previously said.
The dialogue was the “highest consultative mechanism betw­een Pakistan and China, providing a structured platform to review the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation, as well as regional and international developments of mutual interest”.
As per the FO, during the dialogue, the two foreign ministers were also to announce a series of initiatives and commemorative activities to mark the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
It had added that the visit formed an important part of the regular high-level exchanges between the two countries and reflected their shared determination to broaden and deepen their cooperative partnership, while reaffirming their mutual commitment to regional peace, stability, and sustainable development.</p><small>2026-01-04 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04163314f9e2696.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965066/5-family-members-including-two-children-rescued-after-falling-into-open-drain-in-karachi-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>5 family members, including two children, rescued after falling into open drain in Karachi: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Five members of a family, including two children, were rescued on Sunday after falling into an open drain in Korangi’s Mehran Town area, according to Rescue 1122 officials.
A Rescue 1122 spokesperson said the Central Command and Control received the alert and immediately dispatched a water rescue team and trained divers to the site.
“The rescue team carried out a rapid operation and rescued all five affected individuals, who were heading to attend a wedding ceremony,” he said.
The spokesperson said all affected individuals were rescued and taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre by ambulance for medical treatment.
However, one of the women rescued from the drain was reported to be in critical condition, the spokesperson added.
The spokesperson told Dawn that four people – two women and children – were on their way to attend the wedding ceremony. Upon reaching the corner of the street to board the bus, they ascended over a rain drain near the mosque covered with slabs; however, it could not bear their weight, and all four persons fell into it.
A male family member, who rushed to the spot and jumped into the drain to rescue the women and children, was also swept away.
The spokesperson said that the drain was around 50-100 feet deep.
Karachi Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad also took notice of the incident and confirmed the rescue of all five family members. He further said that all affected individuals were taken to the hospital for medical treatment.
The statement from his office said that an immediate rescue operation was launched at the site on the directives of the deputy mayor.
“The affected individuals were safely pulled out of the drain,” it said.
He said Rescue 1122 teams were promptly dispatched to the location and carried out the operation efficiently.
Murad added that the protection of human lives was the top priority of the city administration and appreciated the timely coordination and cooperation of emergency response agencies during the incident.
Open drains in Pakistan persist due to poor urban planning, lack of maintenance, and weak enforcement of safety standards. During rains, they become invisible hazards, leading to fatal falls, drownings, and injuries, particularly among children.
A week ago, an eight-year-old boy who was playing outside his home drowned in an uncovered manhole in Mehran Town.
Earlier in December, a three-year-old boy, Ibrahim, also fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal. His body was recovered more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.
According to the Edhi Foundation, 27 people had lost their lives after falling into open manholes and ditches in the metropolis last year.</p><small>2026-01-04 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/041039212a7bc2f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh will not play T20 World Cup matches in India, decision taken in context of BCCI’s ‘extreme communal policy’</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh will not play their T20 World Cup matches in India after its cricketer Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the countries.
Kolkata Knight Riders said on Saturday they had released the Bangladesh bowler after being told to do so by India’s cricket board (BCCI).
Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the February 7-March 8 tournament being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.
The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), after an emergency meeting on Sunday, said it had “formally requested” the International Cricket Council (ICC) shift its team’s games to Sri Lanka.
“The Board of Directors resolved that the Bangladesh National Team will not travel to India for the tournament under the current conditions,” a BCB statement read.
It said its decision was made due to “growing concerns regarding the safety and security” of its players, and based on its government’s advice.
“In light of this decision, the BCB has formally requested the International Cricket Council (ICC), as the event authority, to consider relocating all of Bangladesh’s matches to a venue outside India.”
After the BCB’s emergency meeting, Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul said, “We welcome this decision taken in the context of the extreme communal policy of India’s cricket board.”
Earlier, Nazrul had said, “We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances.”
“The days of slavery are over,” he had said.
Nazrul said he had ordered the BCB to inform the ICC that “where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup”.
Nazrul said he would also ask that the IPL be blocked from Bangladeshi broadcasters. “I have requested the information and broadcasting adviser to stop the broadcasting of the IPL tournament in Bangladesh,” he said.
Kolkata Knight Riders, majority-owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, subsequently said that Mustafizur’s “release has been carried out following due process and consultations”.







BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters late on Saturday: “The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind.“
Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.
But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old player.
Worsened relations between India, Bangladesh
The developments come against the backdrop of soured political relations between India and Bangladesh after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.

 

India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.
Last year, the ICC allowed India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to sour relations with hosts Pakistan.
Pakistan will also play all their matches of the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, as part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.
On Sunday, cricket news site Cricbuzz reported that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur’s release.
The ICC did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.</p><small>2026-01-04 13:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04180037125e931.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965067/more-staff-deployed-at-islamabad-m-tag-centres-as-over-120000-vehicles-registered-ahead-of-jan-15-deadline' target='_blank'><strong>More staff deployed at Islamabad M-Tag centres as over 120,000 vehicles registered ahead of Jan 15 deadline</strong></a><br><p>Additional staff have been deployed at M-Tag centres in Islamabad as over 120,000 vehicles have registered ahead of the January 15 deadline.
The M-Tag is a prepaid radio frequency identification (RFID) sticker for a car windshield that automates toll payments. As a vehicle passes through a toll plaza, scanners identify the vehicle and entry point; upon exiting, the system automatically deducts the fare from the balance, eliminating the need to wait in long queues.
To ensure the security of the federal capital and link vehicles with electronic monitoring, the administration has decided that vehicles without M-Tags will not be allowed to enter Islamabad from the now-extended deadline of January 15.
With 12 days remaining before enforcement begins, authorities in Islamabad have reported steady progress in the M-Tag registration drive. Officials said 120,447 vehicles have been fitted with M-Tags so far, while 3,392 vehicles were registered in the last 24 hours alone.
Excise and Taxation Department Director General (DG) Irfan Memon said arrangements at all M-Tag centres have been strengthened to handle the rising number of visitors as the deadline approaches.

 

Additional staff have been deployed and sufficient stock of tags has been ensured to avoid shortages, he said, adding that the steps were meant to reduce waiting time and allow citizens to complete the process in one visit.
DG Memon said the extension provides sufficient time for vehicle owners to comply and warned that after January 15, action would be taken against vehicles without M-Tags at 12 entry points across the city.
These checks will be carried out with the support of Safe City systems, which have already completed the installation of M-Tag readers at designated locations, he added.
Officials said the electronic readers were now active and integrated with monitoring systems. The setup is intended to identify vehicles entering the city without valid tags. Authorities said this will help enforce compliance and improve traffic oversight.
Officials noted that the daily figures at registration centres have increased as awareness grows and the deadline draws closer. The department expects further rise in registrations over the coming days.
The M-Tag initiative is part of broader efforts to streamline vehicle records and support digital enforcement. By linking vehicle data with electronic systems, authorities aim to improve identification at checkpoints and entry routes. Officials said the system will also assist in managing traffic flow and tracking violations.
Citizens have been advised to bring the required documents when visiting M-Tag centres to ensure quick processing.
According to official guidelines, the vehicle owners must present only two documents at designated M-Tag registration points. These documents are the vehicle registration card or registration book, and the computerised national identity card (CNIC) of the vehicle owner. Copies may be required for record purposes, but original documents must be shown at the counter.
Officials said incomplete documentation remains a common cause of delays and urged applicants to prepare in advance.
The excise department reiterated that the deadline extension was final and encouraged vehicle owners to utilise the remaining 12 days. “The purpose is facilitation, not inconvenience,” DG Memon said, adding that compliance before January 15 will help citizens avoid checks and penalties once enforcement begins.
The authorities also appealed to residents not to wait for the final days, as last-minute rush could increase queues at the registration centres. They said spreading visits over the remaining period would help maintain smooth service.
The department reiterated its commitment to facilitating citizens while preparing for enforcement measures set to begin after January 15.</p><small>2026-01-04 13:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/041250148554a57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965057/3-on-duty-traffic-policemen-martyred-in-firing-by-suspected-terrorists-in-kps-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>3 on-duty traffic policemen martyred in firing by suspected terrorists in KP’s Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>LAKKI MARWAT/ BANNU: Three traffic police personnel were martyred in firing by suspected terrorists in the Serai Naurang area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district on Sunday.
Qudratullah, spokesperson for the district police officer (DPO), told Dawn the three traffic policemen were on duty near the Dil Begu Khel area when “unidentified terrorists, who were on a motorcycle”, opened fire on them.
As a result, they died on the spot, the spokesperson said.
Ticketing officer in-charge Jalal Khan was among the martyred, he said, adding that two other personnel were identified as Azizullah and Abdullah.
The bodies were moved to Naurang Hospital, and police have launched a search operation at the site of the incident, Qudratullah said.
Later in the day, the funeral prayers of the martyred traffic cops were offered at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines with official honours. Police and district administration officers, the bereaved family members and other residents attended the prayers.

A statement issued by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s office said he condemned the attack and termed the incident “unfortunate”.
“Sacrifices of the martyred policemen will not go in vain. Enemies of the countries cannot succeed in their nefarious designs by such cowardly acts,” the statement quoted him as saying.
He added that policemen were on the front line in the fight against terrorism and had been rendering sacrifices.
The CM said that attackers would be brought to justice and the provincial government was standing with the police.
He extended condolences to the bereaved families and prayed for the departed souls.







Separately, a police constable was martyred in firing by unidentified attackers in the Kashfi Khel area of KP’s Bannu district, spokesperson for the Bannu DPO Asif Hasan told Dawn.
He said that martyred constable, Rashid Khan, was leaving his home for work on Sunday morning when armed assailants, who were on a motorcycle, shot him.
Following the incident, a large contingent of police reached the scene, cordoned off the area, and collected evidence, the spokesperson said. A search operation was also launched to arrest the attackers, he added.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his deep grief over the martyrdom of policemen in the firing incidents in Lakki Marwat and Bannu, a statement issued by the PPP said.
The president paid tribute to the cops’ sacrifices and prayed for their high ranks. “The services and sacrifices of policemen and security forces to establish law and order are worthy of pride,” he was quoted as saying.







Attacks in recent months
Law enforcement personnel have increasingly come under attack in KP in recent days.
Last month, five policemen were martyred when a police vehicle was ambushed in KP’s Karak. In response to the attack, a large police contingent, including the Counter-Terrorism Department’s commandoes, had launched an operation to hunt down the attackers. Eight terrorists were killed in that operation.
On December 1, two policemen embraced martyrdom and five others were injured in a suicide bombing and a gun attack in Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts.
In late November, three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in KP’s Hangu.
Similarly, a police head constable was martyred when unidentified assailants had opened fire at him in Mohammad Akbar village in the jurisdiction of Gul Imam police station of Tank district on November 9.
Prior to that, on October 24, three cops, including a superintendent of police, were martyred when back-to-back blasts had rocked Hangu.</p><small>2026-01-04 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/041116243a0c65b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965054/unsc-to-meet-on-monday-amid-alarm-over-us-action-in-venezuela-concerns-about-risks-to-international-system' target='_blank'><strong>UNSC to meet on Monday amid alarm over US action in Venezuela, concerns about risks to international system</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency session on Monday amid mounting international alarm over the United States’ military action in Venezuela and concerns that the crisis has now moved beyond bilateral tensions.
On Saturday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that the crisis in Venezuela could undermine the foundations of international law by setting a “dangerous precedent“ for similar actions in the near future.
The meeting was requested by Colombia and supported by China and the Russian Federation, with Venezuela also formally appealing to the Council. According to the Council presidency, the session will be held under the agenda item “Threats to International Peace and Security,” and the secretary general is expected to brief the members.
In a statement issued through his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, Secretary General Guterres said he was “deeply alarmed by the recent escalation in Venezuela, culminating with today’s (Saturday) United States military action in the country, which has potential worrying implications for the region.”
The statement added: “Independently of the situation in Venezuela, these developments constitute a dangerous precedent.“
“The secretary general continues to emphasise the importance of full respect — by all — of international law, including the UN Charter,” Dujarric said. “He’s deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected.”
Beyond bilateral tensions
The decision to convene the Council reflects a growing view among several UN members that the crisis has moved beyond bilateral tensions and now poses broader risks to regional stability and the international system itself.
The US operation, carried out overnight on Saturday, marks the most direct American military intervention in Latin America in decades. Washington has framed the action as a decisive move against an authoritarian leader accused of narco-terrorism and criminal activity.
US President Donald Trump publicly confirmed the operation, adding that the United States would “run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” signalling an interim American role in Venezuela’s governance.
For many governments, however, the manner of Maduro’s removal — rather than his record — lies at the heart of the controversy.
The secretary-general’s office has stressed that even severe political crises do not negate the legal restraints imposed by the UN Charter.
“Full respect — by all — of international law” remains essential, Dujarric said, warning that departures from those principles weaken the rules-based international order.
Venezuela has sharply condemned the US action, describing it as a violation of sovereignty and an act of aggression. In a letter to the Security Council, Venezuela’s UN ambassador Samuel Moncada wrote that the operation amounted to “a colonial war aimed at destroying our republican form of government, freely chosen by our people,” and at imposing “a puppet government that allows the plundering of our natural resources, including the world’s largest oil reserves.”
Moncada cited the UN Charter directly, recalling that it states: “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”
China and Russia have echoed those concerns in unusually blunt language. China’s foreign ministry said it was “deeply shocked and strongly condemns the use of force by the US against a sovereign country and the use of force against the president of a country.” It added that China “firmly opposes such hegemonic behaviour by the US, which seriously violates international law, violates Venezuela’s sovereignty, and threatens peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean,” and called on Washington to “abide by international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.”
Russia’s foreign ministry described the operation as an act of aggression. “This morning, the United States committed an act of armed aggression against Venezuela,” it said, adding that “the pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded.” Moscow warned that Latin America must remain “a zone of peace” and insisted that Venezuela be allowed “to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, interference from outside.”
Both Beijing and Moscow have stressed that their objections are rooted not in support for Maduro personally, but in the defence of what they describe as core principles of international law.
Reactions across Latin America have been shaped by a long history of external intervention. While some governments have welcomed Maduro’s removal as the end of a repressive era, others have warned that the US action risks renewed instability. Colombia, which requested the Council meeting, has highlighted concerns about border security and possible displacement.
At the legal level, the episode has revived debates about the limits of unilateral action. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter requires member states to refrain from the use of force except in self-defence or with Security Council authorisation. Critics argue that neither condition clearly applies in this case, and that criminal indictments or law-enforcement objectives do not constitute a recognised legal basis for military intervention.
The concern articulated by Guterres and echoed by several Council members is that normalising such actions could erode the already fragile consensus around international law. If powerful states are seen as free to remove foreign leaders by force without multilateral approval, diplomats warn that the principle of sovereign equality risks being hollowed out.
Expected positions inside the council
Inside the Council chamber, diplomats expect sharp divisions that mirror public statements already on record. The UN Secretariat is likely to reiterate the secretary general’s warning that the situation “constitutes a dangerous precedent” and that “full respect — by all — of international law, including the UN Charter” remains essential.
China is expected to repeat its position that the use of force against Venezuela “seriously violates international law” and threatens regional peace, while Russia is expected to maintain that the action amounts to “armed aggression” and that Latin America must remain “a zone of peace.”
Venezuela is likely to press its argument that the operation violated the Charter’s prohibition on the use of force and amounted to a “colonial war.” The United States, for its part, is expected to defend the operation on security and criminal grounds, while opposing any Council outcome that characterises the action as unlawful.
Historical parallels and legal context
The debate has revived memories of earlier unilateral interventions that divided the Security Council, including Panama in 1989 and Iraq in 2003, where legality, legitimacy and precedent became central points of contention. In each case, opponents argued that bypassing the Council weakened the collective security framework, while supporters argued that exceptional circumstances justified exceptional measures.
What distinguishes the current case, diplomats note, is the explicit removal and detention of a sitting head of state, raising questions about whether international law is being reshaped by practice rather than consensus. For critics, the concern is that repeated departures from the UN Charter restraints may gradually normalise actions once considered extraordinary.
The Security Council meeting is therefore expected to do little to bridge differences, but much to place competing interpretations on the record. Any resolution critical of the United States is likely to face a veto, limiting formal outcomes. Still, diplomats say the debate itself matters, as it will shape how this episode is cited in future crises.
Beyond New York, Venezuela faces an uncertain transition. Maduro’s capture by the US has created a political vacuum, and questions remain about governance, legitimacy and public consent. Regional governments are watching closely for humanitarian fallout and renewed migration pressures.
In that sense, the crisis is no longer only about Venezuela or the United States. It has become a test of whether the post-war system designed to restrain the use of force can still command respect — or whether, as several diplomats fear, it is steadily being eroded by unilateral action justified by power and expediency.</p><small>2026-01-04 10:36</small></div><hr>
