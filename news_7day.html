<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/692a17da7b3b5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958073/punishing-afghans' target='_blank'><strong>Punishing Afghans</strong></a><br><p>A MAN identified as Rahmanullah Laka­nwal may have doomed the fate of all Afghan refugees in the US. This week, just as Ame­ricans were rushing to travel for the Thanksgiving holiday, a shooting took place at a metro station close to the White House.
It is alleged that Lakanwal, who had travelled thousands of kilometres from his home in Washington state, shot a female member of the National Guard, who died later, and a male guardsman. Other Natio­­nal Guard members shot and injured Lak­anwal, ending the attack. Nati­onal Guard members have been deployed in Wash­ing­ton, D.C. since the past several weeks on the orders of President Donald Trump to address what he has called a “crime emergency”.
Reports reveal that 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who entered the US in 2021 through the Operation Allies Welcome initiative, was granted asylum this year. He had worked with the CIA in Afghanistan before the Taliban returned to power. This fact is of no use to the Trump administration that has pounced on the attack as a means of questioning the entry of Afghan refugees fleeing Taliban rule into the US.

 

In the hours after the attack, officials of the Trump administration, such as FBI director Kash Patel, alleged that thousands of refugees had been admitted to the US under the Biden administration and questioned the vetting process. In fact, refugees and visa holders coming to the US undergo thorough vetting. Politically, this spin on the unfortunate and tragic attack has provided Trump an opportunity to reinforce his anti-immigrant rhetoric — a welcome break for a beleaguered administration under criticism for its poor economic numbers.
In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Trump stated: “We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefits to our country.” He said, “If they can’t love our country we don’t want them.”

Trump has been given an opportunity to reinforce his myopic stance.

The crackdown then proceeded swiftly. In a post on X, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service announced that “processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely… .”
Media reports say the pause is likely to affect all Afghan nationals trying to stay in the US by seeking asylum or even through a green card. It will even affect Afghans who helped the US in its 20-year war in Afghanistan. Many of them remain stuck in third countries waiting for their visas to be processed through the Special Immig­rant Visa programme, one of the few pathways left for Afghan refugees who were promised safety in the US for their role in the war.

 

On Thursday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover.”
The crackdown on immigrants has been the centrepiece of this administration’s highly visible and intentionally horrific actions since day one. The attack — while tragic — was not unlike many other shootings that take place daily in the US. But it has given the administration another argument to stop all immigration to the US particularly where it involves black and brown immigrants.
Just a few days before this announcement, the USCIS ordered that Haitians in the US, who enjoyed TPS or temporary protected status owing to the upheavals in that country, would no longer be able to avail it after early next year. The crackdown on Afg­hans (and there are rumours that this will extend to Som­­­ali refugees) fits in­to the larger Trump­i­­an vision of the Uni­ted States as a white and Christian nation.
The losers, of cou­r­se, are the Afghans who chose to side with the Americans and believed that their safety would be assured. This one act committed by one man — who may well be mentally ill rather than radicalised — is enough to doom them all.

 

Just as the colonists once did so too are the neo-colonists doing — abandoning their promises and rendering the sacrifices made for them worthless as they move on to new missions and forget old wars. This is particularly true given that the ascendance of the Taliban in Afghanistan is a constant reminder to the US that a two-decade war and trillions of dollars were largely a waste of resources and yielded no victory at all.
Thousands of Afghans and others will likely now never get to the US. In a seeming instant, their presence has been tainted, they have been labelled unwanted and they will once again have to find some way to fend for themselves in a hostile and xenophobic world.

A teary-eyed Rashina narrates her ordeal.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

KARACHI: After going underground in Pakistan as an illegal alien for 18 years, a 65-year-old Sri Lankan woman, will now be able to return home to her children in Colombo, thanks to concerted efforts by Edhi Foundation, Saylani Welfare Trust and human rights advocate Zia Ahmed Awan.
Speaking at a press conference at the Edhi headquarters at Meethadar on Friday, Rashina could not hold back her tears as she thanked all for coming to her aid. “I’m a poor woman. The government of Pakistan had imposed a 22 lac rupees fine on me for illegally overstaying in Pakistan. I didn’t even have money to pay for my return ticket to Sri Lanka, what to say of the heavy fine,” she said. “But God is great. God sent me help in all these people who made it possible for a destitute widow to reunite with her orphaned children,” she said.
Sharing her story, Rashina said that she is a born Muslim from Sri Lanka, who found employment as a telephone operator at a travel agency in Kuwait. It was there that she met Javed Iqbal of Mian Channu, Punjab. “We fell in love and got married. Later, we moved to Saudi Arabia where we lived for some 15 years. We have three children, two daughters, Mumtaz and Aneesha, and a son Mohammed Rafay,” she said.
In Saudi Arabia, later, when her husband lost his job, he desperately tried to find another but being unable to do so he was deported to Pakistan while Rashina was deported to Sri Lanka with their children. “Leaving my children in the care with my family in Colombo, I came to Pakistan on a visit visa to meet my husband in Mian Channu. But his family would not accept me. We left Punjab to come to Karachi where we found a small rented place. I know I should have returned to Sri Lanka when my visa expired but by then my husband had become seriously ill. His liver was failing. Then he passed away. That was in 2007. I have tried to return home to my children since then but I couldn’t without first paying a 22 lac rupees fine imposed on me for overstaying my welcome,” she informed.

Rashina set to reunite with family in Colombo following legal aid and charity support

“Having no place to go I would turn up at Saylani Welfare Trust for meals. There I met a volunteer, Anis Abdul Hafeez, who offered me a place to stay with his family in Surjani Town because I had no place to stay. When I fell sick, I reached out to Saylani again, and their chief trustee Arif Lakhani arranged for my heart bypass surgery. My hospital stay and medical bills were also taken care of by Saylani. They also tried to find me legal help. But we were getting nowhere. Not knowing what else to do, I started protesting outside the Karachi Press Club,” she said.
Speaking on the occasion, Faisal Edhi said: “That was when some journalists alerted my son Saad Edhi about Rashina’s plight. “I then reached out to our regular legal counsel Advocate Zia Ahmed Awan for help,” Faisal Edhi told Dawn.
Advocate Zia Awan said that they reached out to the Ministry of Interior but to no avail. “Hope finally came when we approached the Constitutional Bench of the Sindh High Court which ordered for the Interior Secretary to appear before it. That was when Rashina’s hefty fine was waived and she was ordered to leave Pakistan within 15 days,” the able advocate reported.
As Arif Lakhani of Saylani had already got her Sri Lankan passport renewed, it was only a matter of him buying her a one-way air ticket to Colombo. With that arranged, Rashina is now all set to board her flight back home from Karachi on December 2.
“You are all welcome to Colombo. You will stay with me there. My children, who are half Pakistani, and I will love to have you,” Rashina told Zia Awan, Faisal Edhi, Arif Lakhani, Anis Abdul Hafeez and even the members of the media who had come to cover her story.
Speaking on the occasion, Faisal Edhi and Advocate Awan urged the government to look into waiving off the hefty fines imposed on aliens stuck in this country only because they don’t have money to pay the fines.
“When they want to go home we should also not let such hurdles come in their way,” Faisal Edhi said.

The recent by-election in six national and seven Punjab assembly constituencies was no exception. These seats — with the exception of the National Assembly seat NA-129 in Lahore — had fallen vacant after the conviction, and subsequent de-seating (as per the law), of some PTI-supported legislators. The Lahore NA seat became vacant after the demise of Mian Azhar, a senior PTI leader.
The PTI had decided that since it did not consider the conviction and disqualification of its legislators legitimate, it would boycott the by-election except for the seat in Lahore which did not become vacant because of the incumbent’s disqualification.
NA-18 in Haripur was, unlike the other 12 constituencies located in Punjab, a part of KP and had fallen vacant after PTI MNA and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub was convicted and subsequently disqualified. The election in the constituency was not boycotted either but it is not clear whether the party granted an exception to this constituency because it was located in KP and therefore felt more confident of winning this seat.

 

This constituency turned out to be the only one where a keen contest was observed and the 42 per cent voter turnout closely matched the 45pc in 2024. Although TV reports of partial constituency resu­lts indicated a very close contest between the PTI and PML-N candidates who had been exchanging the first and second positions for quite some time, it was the PML-N candidate who eventually won — with a big margin of about 40,000 votes. The same candidate had lost to the PTI candidate by a margin of 80,000 votes in 2024.
Among the constituencies boycotted by the PTI, NA-185 in Dera Ghazi Khan was probably the only one where a lively contest was observed. Apparently, it was possible because two traditional rival tribes of the area — the Legharis and the Khosas — were facing off.

 

Mehmood Qadir Leghari, as an independent candidate, had secured over 49,000 votes and was runner-up to the PTI’s Zartaj Gul in 2024, but he almost doubled his tally to 93,000 as the PML-N’s candidate and won the by-election. The PPP’s Dost Muhammad Khosa, who had secured over 26,000 votes in 2024, also increased his votes to over 39,000 in the by-election as runner-up. As the voter turnout was about 33pc compared to about 50pc in 2024, it seemed that PTI voters had at least partially abstained in this contest.
In the remaining national and provincial assembly constituencies, PTI voters effectively boycotted the by-polls as voter turnout plummeted to an average 28pc in 13 constituencies, which is half of the 56pc turnout in 2024. PML-N candidates increased their polled votes in 13 constituencies from 698,459 or 27pc of the total votes polled to 957,945 or 64pc of the total votes polled — an increase of over 37pc.
Fortunately, the by-elections passed off without any incident of major violence but, as usual, there are charges of poll rigging by the unsuccessful candidates, mostly in NA-18 (Haripur), NA-129 (Lahore) and NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan).
The electoral process in Pakistan, sadly, doesn’t enjoy a great deal of public trust. It is, however, difficult to pass judgement on the fairness of the recent by-elections as no evidence about the alleged rigging has been made public. An analysis of the by-election results can, therefore, be undertaken based on the official results.

It is difficult to comment on the fairness or otherwise of the recent by-elections at this stage.

The most interesting contest took place in NA-129 Lahore, in the heart of Punjab, where decisive future electoral battles will be fought. It was surprising that a close contest was not witnessed in this constituency where only 19pc voters turned out compared to 54pc in 2024. It seems that PTI voters had decided on their own to boycott the by-election, despite the fact that a PTI-supported candidate was in the field.
The PML-N candidate won the election with a comfortable lead of about 34,000 votes by securing around 61pc of the total votes polled. The same PML-N candidate could secure only 34pc of the votes and was defeated by a margin of about 32,000 votes less than two years ago. There is ample room and need for analyses of this turnaround.
The key question remains why PTI voters did not come out to vote or why the party failed to mobilise them despite the fact that their candidate was in the run. Are voters disillusioned with Pakistan’s electoral system or the leadership of their party or both? Or are they in a neutral zone of transition before they switch to the other side as is a common phenomenon in such cases?

 

The answer to these questions may also explain whether public opinion in Punjab is undergoing a change.
Are the efforts of the federal and Punjab governments to project their performance through an onslaught of media publicity making the desired impact? Is it recovery from the brink of bankruptcy and relative economic stability? Is it overpowering India in the short May conflict? Is it successful diplomacy after the war, which led to US President Donald Trump praising the Pakistani civil-military leadership and Saudi Arabia signing a defence pact with Pakistan? Is it the almost-daily inauguration of projects and programmes in Punjab?
Or is it the PTI’s despondency that its leader may not come out of prison and the party may not come to power in the near future? Or is it a combination of some or all of these factors affecting voters’ mindset? Electoral results of a single constituency may not be sufficient to reach a definite conclusion and we may have to wait and observe some upcoming contests.

Capital formation cannot by revived simply by doling out regulatory, legislative and policy concessions to a privileged few, while keeping the playing field uneven for the rest. The example of the Special Investment Facilitation Council is instructive in this regard.
More than two years after its creation, the SIFC — a special purpose vehicle with enough authority to effectively override regulations and policies in order to facilitate foreign investment — has delivered less than what was hoped. The irony is that even after recognising the limitations of their approach, policymakers appear determined to persist with it.
Reflecting on the SIFC’s efforts to attract FDI at a Pakistan Business Council conference in Islamabad, its national coordinator hinted at a ‘strategic shift’ in approach. At the moment, the shift appears limited to an acknowledgement that foreign investors will come only when local investors are engaged. Full support was offered to local “sectoral tycoons”, but the SIFC has yet to commit itself to the long-standing structural reforms needed to improve the investment clime.

 

If anything, Pakistan’s investment crisis is holding back its future, despite the country’s economic potential and abundant business opportunities. Low investment carries serious consequences: it weakens productivity, heightens reliance on imported goods and, in Pakistan’s case, it remains a major driver of recurring balance-of-payment troubles.
Although the economy has stabilised under the IMF programme over the last couple of years, growth cannot be expected to take off unless policymakers start looking beyond short-term fixes and resolutely pursue deep reforms to lift investment to the regional average.
Historical data shows a steady decline in both private and public investment in Pakistan. In contrast, regional economies have consistently expanded private investment in infrastructure and productivity while successive governments in Islamabad relied on consumption-driven growth spurts, instead of addressing structural impediments to capital formation. Even Sri Lanka boasts a significantly higher investment-to-GDP ratio of nearly 23pc.
No country can hope to attract sustained investment by selectively offering incentives to compensate for an uneven playing field marked by policy inconsistency, bureaucratic red tape, opacity, inequitable taxation, weak institutions and regulatory unpredictability.

 

The recent exit of several multinationals from the country underscores this reality: they did not leave due to lack of business opportunities but because policy and regulatory obstacles made operations increasingly unviable.
Unless the government reforms the investment regime to guarantee every investor — local or foreign, small or large — an equal opportunity to succeed based on their market performance, it will not be able to stem this trend.

Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Imran Shoukat and SSP Serious Crime Investigation Wing Imran Qureshi detailed the successes at a press conference at the Police Lines, emphasising a broad crackdown on crime to protect citizens’ lives and property.
In one major success, the Serious Crime Investigation Wing dismantled an interprovincial gang that stole vehicles from Sindh and brought them to Balochistan, arresting four members and recovering 20 vehicles.
The wing also solved five blind murder cases and arrested suspects in several robberies, seizing stolen goods, cash, weapons, mobile phones and a large quantity of narcotics.
Overall, Quetta police arrested 12 suspects in various murder, theft and robbery cases. The arrests included three suspects in the murder of Imad Kakar: a woman identified as Atiya Rehman, Roman Ilyas and Babar Ali.

The shop from which the unlicensed murder weapon was purchased has been sealed, officials said.
Detailing other operations, DIG Shoukat said police arrested suspects Abdullah and Ibrahim for looting more than Rs20 million from a warehouse after holding a guard hostage in the Sariab area. More than 80 per cent of the stolen goods were recovered.

 

In a separate house robbery case, police arrested Fayyaz Ali, Sabir Ali and Muhammad Salman, recovering over Rs7m in gold jewellery, valuables and cash. In another incident, suspects Najibullah, Janan and Rahmatullah were arrested for snatching Rs11.8m, which was also recovered.
Officials said cases have been registered against all arrested suspects and legal proceedings have been initiated.
DIG Shoukat issued a stern warning against illegal activities, linking them to terrorist financing and vowing to hold his own officers accountable.
“Money generated from drugs and illegal Iranian petrol is being used for terrorism,” Shoukat said, adding that station house officers (SHOs) have been directed to eradicate all illegal activities, including gambling and the sale of Iranian petrol.
“If illegal activities are found during raids, the SHO of that area will be suspended and action will be taken against him.”
Both officials paid tribute to officers who have died in the line of duty and stressed that public support is crucial for lasting security.

The move must be carried out before the next routine flight, according to a separate bulletin to airlines, threatening cancellations or delays during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year in the United States and beyond.
Airbus said in a statement a recent incident involving an A320-family aircraft had revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls.
“Airbus acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers,” it said. Industry sources said the incident that triggered the unexpected repair action involved a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on Oct 30, in which several passengers were hurt following a sharp loss of altitude.
Flight 1230 made an emergency landing at Tampa, Florida, after a flight control problem and a sudden uncommanded drop in altitude, prompting an FAA investigation. JetBlue and the FAA had no immediate comment. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency is due to issue an emergency directive mandating the fix, Airbus said.
For about two-thirds of the affected jets, the recall will result in a relatively brief grounding as airlines revert to a previous software version, industry sources said.
Still, that comes at a time of intense demands on airline repair shops, already plagued by shortages of maintenance capacity and the grounding of hundreds of Airbus jets.

Two blasts
Meanwhile, there were reports about two blasts at Major Chowk in Mastung.
Officials confirmed the two explosions and said no loss of life was reported. After the blasts, an exchange of fire took place between armed men and security forces.

ISLAMABAD: Amid a noisy protest in the Senate for a second day by PTI senators, the government on Friday assured the House that former prime minister Imran Khan was in good health with no threat to his life and blamed Afghan and Indian media for circulating “false” reports about Mr Khan’s health.
The ruckus by PTI lawmakers, alarmed by social media reports about Mr Khan’s condition, dominated the day’s proceedings. They chanted slogans and hit their desks, demanding that family members, doctors and lawyers be allowed to meet with Mr Khan after what they called a “complete blackout for weeks”.
Syed Ali Zafar, the PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate, sought an explanation from the government about the reports.



“The tension level of the public has risen so high that there will be an explosion if the matter was not resolved immediately,” Mr Zafar warned. He added that the party’s senators would not participate in proceedings until a minister provided a clear response.
“We will not become part of the proceedings till the minister concerned comes and responds,” he said before PTI senators staged a walkout.
While the government gave no assurance on allowing visits, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry rejected the social media reports as baseless.

 

Imran Khan “is in good health, facing no threat to his life, and is being provided with all facilities”, Chaudhry said, relaying information from the superintendent of Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where the ex-premier is being held.
The minister claimed Afghan media initially spread the “fake stories,” which he said were then amplified by Indian media.
The minister’s statement failed to satisfy the opposition. “We will not let the proceedings continue,” one lawmaker said. “You cannot threaten like this,” Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani responded.
The proceedings were briefly adjourned when the House was found to be one member short of a quorum. After business resumed, PTI members continued their protest, chanting “release Imran Khan”.
Meanwhile, the government laid the money bill — the Income Tax (Third Amendment) Bill, 2025 — before the House, to make recommendations on it to the National Assembly, as required under Article 73 of the Constitution.
The chair referred the bill to the Standing Committee for Finance and Revenue for further consideration
Later in the session, PTI Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, when called upon to move an item on the agenda, spoke instead on Imran’s health and rejected claims that meetings with the former leader were taking place, saying their leader had been kept behind bars unjustly and on frivolous charges.
The session chairman, Shahadat Awan of the PPP, eventually deferred the remaining agenda items after a minister expressed an inability to respond in the noisy environment. He then adjourned the House to meet again on Monday at 4pm.

• Execution of Palestinians in Jenin termed ‘summary execution’
• E4 condemns settlers’ violence in occupied West Bank
JERUSALEM/DAMASCUS: Israeli military killed 13 people in a raid on a village in Syria on Friday which Damascus called a criminal attack, and in the occupied West Bank it injured three Palestinians in its ongoing operation in a Palestinian refugee camp.
The Israeli military claimed six soldiers were wounded, three of them severely, during an incursion in the village of Beit Jinn.
Israel frequently bombed Syria when it was ruled by Assad and stepped up its military operations in the country after he was ousted, citing goals that include keeping fighters away from the frontier.
Syrian state news agency SANA, which reported 13 people killed and dozens wounded, said Israeli forces shelled Beit Jinn and Israeli troops entered the village. Residents confronted the Israeli forces, which responded, leading to “violent clashes”.

 

Syria’s foreign ministry said the Israeli attack killed more than 10 civilians, including women and children, damaged property and forced residents to flee their homes, accusing Israel of committing a “full-fledged war crime”. Walid Akasha, a local official in Beit Jinn, denied there were any terrorist factions there.
Meanwhile, Najat Rochdi, the UN’s Deputy Special Envoy for Syria, condemned Israel’s incursion as “a grave and unacceptable violation of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, further destabilising an already fragile environment”.



Three injured in West Bank
Separately, Israeli continued its military operation in Far’a refugee camp in occupied West Bank, injuring three people on Friday. According to Al Jazeera, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society transported three injured people out of Tubas.
Israeli tank fire injured one child in the Rafah area, according to local Palestinian media reports. Israeli forces have started tearing down homes and buildings in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.
The operation follows an earlier warning from the Israeli military that troops would raze 24 structures in the camp, which it said is required for “operational” purposes.
‘Summary execution’
The United Nations said on Friday that the killing of two Palestinians, shot dead in occupied West Bank while seemingly surrendering to Israeli forces, was an “apparent summary execution”.
“We are appalled at the brazen killing by Israeli border police yesterday (Thursday) of two Palestinian men in Jenin,” UN rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told reporters in Geneva, calling the incident “yet another apparent summary execution”.
He said UN rights chief Volker Turk was calling for “independent, prompt and effective investigations into the killings of Palestinians”, and for those responsible for killings and other violations in Israeli-occupied West Bank to “be held fully to account”.







Meanwhile, France, Germany, Italy and UK have demanded Israel to abide by international law and protect Palestinians in West Bank as illegal Israeli settler attacks reached their peak in nearly two decades.
According to Middle East Monitor, the foreign ministers of four countries, commonly known as the E4, in a joint statement strongly condemned the massive increase of settler violence against Palestinian civilians and called for stability in the occupied West Bank.

Information Minister Atta Tarar’s assertion prompted an indignant response from the PTI, which maintains that their court-decreed schedule of meetings — on Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured.
In separate remarks, Parliamentary Secretary Barrister Danyal Chaudhry also termed the KP CM’s demand “to seek political guidance from a convicted individual… a clear violation of prison laws”.
But what does the jail manual actually say about prisoners’ visitation rights, and do political prisoners enjoy more leeway than others? These and other ancillary questions have doubtless popped up in the minds of many observers.

Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings

Former and current prison officials Dawn spoke to said that all prisoners in Punjab’s jails — including political prisoners confined — are allowed meetings with five people per week, including their lawyers and relatives. In addition, they are allowed 30 minutes of phone time per week.
Even condemned prisoners are eligible to meet their lawyers and family members once a week, along with 30 minutes of phone time, which is exercised through the several public call offices (PCOs) that are operational in Adiala jail.

 

Official say jail authorities have the ability to conduct ‘automatic monitoring’ of prisoners’ phone conversations, so they can listen to any communication made by any prisoner, when necessary.
In addition, political prisoners are kept in special cells under strict security, and their medical check-up is supposed to be conducted on a daily basis to ensure that they are in good health.
‘Subjective’ rules
However, the rules stipulate that these meetings are linked to the “prisoner’s behaviour”, i.e. their obedience to prison rules, making their enforcement necessarily subjective.
According to officials, certain serious offenses, such as terrorism and involvement in anti-state activities, could render an inmate ineligible for these provisions.
A retired senior officer from the prison department told Dawn that according to the rules, the decision whether or not to allow an incarcerated or under trial prisoner access to his/her lawyers or relatives was at the discretion of the concerned jail superintendent.
If the incarcerated prisoner’s behaviour is ‘not good’, it will be up to the jail authorities to disallow meetings or telephonic conversations.

 

In addition, the visitation rights of any prisoners, especially political ones, can be suspended if the government apprehends unrest or a law and order situation.
This could be a major stumbling block for the PTI, as prison authorities have repeatedly complained about the conduct of Mr Khan’s visitors, especially taking issue with the press conferences that Aleema Khan or others hold after meeting with the incarcerated party founder.
In recent weeks, these have often culminated in sit-ins and protests outside the prison, which the jail authorities could cite as a potential law and order risk.
In his remarks, Barrister Danyal Chaudhry maintained that jail meetings are only possible under judicial orders. However, the PTI maintains that in spite of a court-ordered meeting schedule, jail authorities were arbitrarily disallowing meetings with the inmate.
However, PM’s aide Senator Rana Sanaullah seemed to strike a softer note, voicing his support for meetings between incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his family members, albeit subject to certain conditions.
“There should be permission for meetings and they should definitely take place, but a 90-minute press conference cannot take place after an hour’s meeting; no law allows this,” he told Geo News on Friday.
Past precedent
One official said that many political prisoners — like PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz and son-in-law Safdar Awan — had availed the telephone facility during their imprisonment, thanks to ‘good behaviour’.
The PML-N leader used to keep a stopwatch with him while talking to his family members or others to monitor the time, he recalled.

 

In addition, a seasoned journalist who had visited several political prisoners in different jails across the country in the past — such as Javed Hashmi and ex-PM Yousuf Raza Gilani — said that visitors were only allowed to meet prisoners with their consent.
He explained that, on scheduled meeting days, prisoners generally provide the jail authorities with a list of their guests or visitors, which is then scrutinised and approved by the jail superintendent.
At times, the journalist recalled, they had to identify themselves as “family members” or “a friend of the prisoner” to avoid being denied access.
Party infighting over who controls the all-important list, which contains the names of those who would be allowed to meet the prisoner has also not helped the PTI’s cause, as Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and Barrister Ali Zafar have previously found themselves at odds over the issue.

ISLAMABAD: Dema­nd­ing that the government allow the jailed Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) fou­n­der Imran Khan to meet his sisters and party leaders, the opposition alliance warned the authorities on Friday of countrywide protests if the government did not mend its ways.
“We have stopped Sindhis, Baloch, Pashtuns, and Punjabis from taking to the streets against the government and its policies; otherwise, they would come out and create problems for the rulers,” said Pakhtu­nkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) President Meh­mood Achakzai during a joint press conference with other opposition leaders outside Parliament House.
He said the government had turned parliament into a rubber stamp and that National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq was taking dictation from elsewhere. He said people were being killed in the tribal areas, yet the NA speaker did not allow the opposition to speak on this grave issue.
He questioned why Imran Khan was kept in jail and why he was not being allowed to meet his sisters and party leaders. “The chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is sitting outside Adiala Jail, but no one is paying any heed to his request to meet the PTI founder,” he said.
Democracy buried
Speaking on the occasion, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said democracy had been buried in the recent by-elections.
He claimed that the results of a by-election in Haripur, where the wife of former opposition leader Omar Ayub was contesting, had been changed. “The result on Form 47 was different from the one altered on a computer,” he alleged.
Barrister Gohar said the opposition wanted to remain part of parliament and the democratic system, but the alleged rigging in the by-elections had made this difficult.
“As far as I know [Imran] Khan, he will not allow us to be part of parliament anymore,” he added.

In a statement issued in Geneva, the human rights chief said the latest constitutional amendment, like the 26th amendment last year, had been adopted without broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society.
Turk warned that the amendments run counter to the separation of powers that underpin the rule of law and safeguard the protection of human rights in Pakistan.
“Under the changes adopted on November 13, a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) has been given powers over constitutional cases, replacing the previous authority of the Supreme Court, which will now only deal with civil and criminal cases,” the statement read.
It added that the systems for appointing, promoting and transferring judges changed in a manner raising “serious concerns about undermining the structural independence of Pakistan’s judiciary”.
Turk noted that the president and prime minister had already assigned the chief justice and the first set of FCC judges.







“These changes, taken together, risk subjugating the judiciary to political interference and executive control,” Turk was quoted as saying.
“Neither the executive nor legislative should be in a position to control or direct the judiciary, and the judiciary should be protected from any form of political influence in its decision-making.
“A core measure of judicial independence is a tribunal’s insulation from political interference by the government. If judges are not independent, experience shows that they struggle to apply the law equally and to uphold human rights for all in the face of political pressure.”
The UN also noted that the 27th amendment establishes lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrest for the president, field marshal, marshall of the air force and admiral of the fleet.
“Sweeping immunity provisions like these undermine accountability, which is a cornerstone of the human rights framework and democratic control of the armed forces under the rule of law,” Turk was quoted as saying.
“I am concerned that these amendments risk far-reaching consequences for the principles of democracy and rule of law which the Pakistani people hold dear.”

 

On November 13, the president signed the 27th Constitutional Amendment into law hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The House first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on November 10 and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate to consider the latest changes.</p><small>2025-11-29 02:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/290713363208540.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958092/cybersecurity-act-essential-to-national-security-says-it-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Cybersecurity Act essential to national security, says IT minister</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Information Technology (IT) and Telecom Shaza Fatima Khawaja said the Cybersecurity Act 2025 was essential for national security and reflected the government’s whole-of-nation approach to cybersecurity, marking a major reform initiative.
She noted that the Act will establish the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) to lead nationwide incident response and thr­eat intelligence, while exp­ansion of the Pakistan Computer Emergency Res­ponse Team (PKCERT), and the development of secure digital public infrastructure under the Digital Economy Enhancement Project (Deep) will further strengthen national cyber resilience.
Ms Khawaja was add­ressing a gathering at FAST National University, Islam­abad, on the theme ‘Securing Pakistan’s Digi­tal Frontier: CyberShield, Policy & the Future’. The event was hosted by the FAST Public Policy and Res­earch Society (FPPRS).

 

She added that Pakis­tan’s long-term objective is to build a cyber-resilient, innovation-driven dig­ital nation where secure infrastructure, technological excellence, and human cap­ital development adva­nce together.
The minister underscored that Pakistan’s digital transformation is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, bringing with it the critical responsibility of safeguarding national digital infrastructure and citizen data.
She highlighted Pakistan’s Tier-1 ranking in the ITU Global Cybersecurity Index as a reflection of the collective commitment of the government, academia, and youth toward building a secure digital future.
The minister said Pakistan is rapidly advancing toward AI-driven cybersecurity, dark-web moni­toring, and cloud security under the Cloud-First Policy, along with secure digital identity frameworks.
She also referred to the recent Marka-i-Haq, calling it a defining moment in which the armed forces, national institutions, and cyber experts stood united with remarkable resilience.

 

She emphasised that Pakistan’s effective and coordinated cyber warfare response during this period demonstrated exceptional national strength and technological capability, adding that Marka-i-Haq proved the cyber domain is the first line of defence in the modern era, and Pakistan has shown it can safeguard its digital frontiers with confidence and competence.
The minister also toured FAST-NU Islamabad’s IC Design Lab along with Director Dr Waseem Shahzad, Dean Dr Sadia Nadeem, and Fast Public Policy and Research Society (FPPRS) President Zainab Inam Cheema, and met scholars enrolled in Ignite’s flagship training initiative, “Training in IC Design & Verification.”
Under this Ignite-funded programme, 30 young engineers — including seven female participants — are undergoing a rigorous 10-month training course covering IC design, verification, and fabrication processes.
Implemented by FAST-NU, the programme offers hands-on training aligned with global semiconductor industry standards.

ISLAMABAD: With a 256 per cent surge in current account deficit, the government on Friday expressed cautious optimism over the country’s economic outlook with stubborn inflation in 5-6pc range due to pressure on food prices and agriculture production.
In its economic update and outlook for November, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) said the industrial activity continued to strengthen amid implementation of reforms.
However, all major fiscal indicators — FBR collection, non-tax revenue, budget surplus and primary surplus — were down as percentage of GDP. The report showed the tax-to-GDP ratio was slightly lower at 2.96pc in first four months of 2025-26 when compared to 3pc last year. Non-tax revenues were also reported at 2.32pc of GDP against 2.63pc in comparable period.
Fiscal surplus was also down this year at 1.63pc of GDP against 1.65pc last year while primary surplus was reported at 2.7pc this year when compared to 2.8pc last year.
The ministry said the crop outlook showed mixed trend and hoped the ‘adequate input availability and government support measures’ to stabilise supplies as the rabi season progressed.
The current account deficit swelled to $733 million during July-October 2025-26 from $206m recorded last year, showing an increase of 255.8pc, the MoF said but claimed that the current account deficit remained “within the expected range, on the back of steady export growth and strong remittance inflows despite the increase in import demand to meet the production requirements”.
Overall, the economy is projected to maintain its positive momentum, supported by continued structural reforms, digital transition, governance improvements, on the back of ongoing efforts toward fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stabilisation, the report observed.
It said the key indicators were showing improvement as fiscal discipline was maintained through stronger revenue mobilisation and prudent expenditure management. However, the report showed expenditure growth at 11.9pc outpacing revenue growth of 11.4pc.
It said the higher remittances and expanding Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector and IT exports strengthened the economic outlook. Backed by healthy realisation of State Bank of Pakistan’s profits due to record interest rates, the ministry said the public debt declined by over Rs1.371trillion, marking the first quarterly reduction in more than five years.
“This decline reflects strategic use of surplus funds for early retirement of costly debt, thereby reducing refinancing and rollover risks and strengthening macroeconomic stability,” it noted.
Elaborating the mixed agriculture outlook, the report said the sugarcane production for the current season had been estimated to show an increase of 0.6pc to 84.74 million tonnes from 84.24m tonnes last year despite floods.
On the other hand, cotton output is estimated at 6.85m bales, down 3.3pc from 7.08m bales. Similarly, rice production declined by 3.2pc to 9.41m tonnes from 9.72m tonnes and maize production by 6.7pc to 8.43m tonnes from 9.03m tonnes last year.
However, mung and chillies production increased by 14.9pc and 0.5pc to 150,800 and 114,400 tonnes, respectively, from last year.
During 4MFY26, agricultural credit disbursement increased by 18.6pc to Rs845.3bn from Rs712.8bn last year.
The imports of agricultural machinery and implements increased by 23.5pc to $49.3m during from $39.9m in 4MFY25. The LSM output rose 4.1pc during July-September of the current fiscal year with 15 sectors recording positive growth, including textile, wearing apparel, non-metallic mineral products, food, coke & petroleum products, electrical equipment, automobile and tobacco.
On the positive side, service exports grew by 15.9pc to $3bn compared to 12pc import growth to $4.2bn, with a service trade deficit of $1.2bn against $1.1bn. IT exports were up by 19.6pc to $1.4bn.
The report confirmed that during the first quarter of FY26, net federal revenues increased by 2.4pc to Rs4.117tr compared to Rs4.019tr last year. However, the FBR’s collection rose 11.4pc to Rs3.835tr during 4MFY26. On the expenditure side, total outlays increased by 11.9pc during July-September to Rs2.779tr. Consequently, the federal fiscal balance recorded a second time surplus of Rs1.338tr, compared to a surplus of Rs1.536tr. The primary balance also improved in absolute terms, posting a surplus of Rs3.497tr, up from Rs3.202tr in the corresponding period.
Merchandise exports increased by 2pc ($10.6bn) in first four months but were overwhelmingly outpaced by 9.6pc growth in imports ($20.7bn), resulting in a $10.1bn trade deficit, compared to $8.5bn last year, showing a 19pc surge.
Remittances increased by 9.3pc to $13bn, led by inflows from Saudi Arabia (24.2pc share) and the United Arab Emirates (20.7pc). Net FDI inflows declined by 26pc to $747.7m in first four months led by $226.7m from China and $120m from Hong Kong.

Imran has been in jail since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence on corruption charges. His family and party members have protested outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding a meeting but have been repeatedly denied despite orders from the courts.
Imran’s sister Aleema Khan filed a contempt of court petition against the Adiala jail superintendent and others over their failure to comply with an earlier Islamabad High Court (IHC) order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for the incarcerated former premier.
Speaking on the matter in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’, Sanaullah said: “There should be permission for meetings and they should definitely take place, but a 90-minute press conference cannot take place after an hour’s meeting; no law allows this.”
He further said that political discussions could also not take place in the meetings, saying that no law allowed a prisoner to lead, plan and guide movements on the outside from jail.
The senator maintained that it was not permitted for family members to hold press conferences outside the prison premises and for a barrage of messages to appear on social media against the state and officials.
Sanaullah argued that the IHC’s order to facilitate meetings was also contingent on similar conditions as he laid out.
“They (Imran’s family and legal team) should sit down with jail authorities and settle matters,” he said, saying that the process of meetings should be better conducted without violations from either side.
Sanaullah later said the meetings were not being allowed because they were not being conducted in accordance with the law. “The meeting should be in accordance with the law,” he maintained, reiterating that there should be no violation from either side.
The contempt petition was filed after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, along with several other PTI members, staged an overnight sit-in outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi. The sit-in was staged as CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the eighth time on Thursday.
Previously, Imran’s sisters, including Aleema, had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
The PTI ended its latest sit-in on Friday morning, with the KP CM announcing that they would be approaching the IHC, where Aleema filed the contempt plea.
Meetings not subject to whims or wishes: Barrister Aqeel
Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said meetings could not be held on anyone’s ‘whims or wishes’.
He said meetings could only be held under existing prison rules and the prerogative in this regard rests with the superintendent.
Malik added that the prison administration could curtail a prisoner’s privilege to have meetings “in the public interest” if a necessary cause was found.
However, he did not elaborate on the criteria by which the Adiala jail superintendent decides when to allow meetings or not.
Malik also maintained that the rules prevented any political discussion.
Questioned about the KP chief minister’s threat to launch a protest on Tuesday if a meeting was not allowed, the minister said the government would take the necessary measures in such a situation.</p><small>2025-11-28 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28233835d3b47c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957949/afghan-suspect-in-us-national-guard-shooting-to-be-charged-with-murder' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan suspect in US National Guard shooting to be charged with murder</strong></a><br><p>An Afghan national accused of shooting two National Guard members will be charged with first-degree murder, a US official said Friday, after one of the soldiers died of her wounds as Donald Trump pledged to suspend migration from “third-world countries.”
The announcement marks an escalation in charges facing the assailant, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who the US media said was part of the “Zero Units” — a CIA-backed Afghan paramilitary force.
“There are certainly many more charges to come, but we are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree,” Jeanine Pirro, the attorney for Washington, DC, told the Fox News programme ‘Fox & Friends’.
“It is a premeditated murder. There was an ambush with a gun toward people who didn’t know what was coming.”
Pirro’s announcement comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi pledged on Thursday to “seek the death penalty” against Lakanwal, describing him as a “monster.”



Pirro said Lakanwal opened fire with a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver on a group of guardsmen on patrol just a few blocks from the White House on Wednesday, the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday.
Sarah Beckstrom, a 20-year-old West Virginia National Guard member deployed in the US capital as part of Trump’s crackdown on crime, died from her wounds, the president said on Thursday. He said the other soldier wounded in the attack, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, was “fighting for his life”.
“We still have hope,” Pirro said of Wolfe. “He’s still in critical condition. We are doing everything we can to assist his family.”
The shooting has brought together three politically explosive issues: Trump’s controversial use of the military on American soil, immigration, and the lingering legacy of the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan — America’s longest war.
‘Rigorous reexamination’
Late on Thursday, Trump pledged on Truth Social to “permanently pause” migration from “all Third World Countries” and threatened to reverse “millions” of admissions granted under his predecessor Joe Biden, in a new escalation in his anti-immigration stance.
When asked which specific nationalities would be affected, the US Department of Homeland Security pointed AFP to a list of 19 countries — including Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran and Myanmar — facing US travel restrictions under a previous order from Trump in June.
Separately, Joseph Edlow, Trump’s director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said on Thursday he had ordered a “full-scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.” When asked to specify the countries, the USCIS referred AFP to the same list of 19 countries.

More than 1.6 million US green card holders, roughly 12 per cent of the total permanent resident population, were born in the countries listed, according to the latest immigration data available on the agency’s ‘Eligible to Naturalise Dashboard’ analysed by AFP.
Afghanistan, which has over 116,000 green card holders, is also affected by a total halt of immigration application processing, ordered by the Trump administration after the shooting.
CIA director John Ratcliffe said the suspect, Lakanwal, had been part of a CIA-backed “partner force” fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.
He added that he had been brought to the United States as part of a program to evacuate Afghans who had worked with the agency after the Taliban toppled the American-backed government in 2021.
Lakanwal had been living in the western state of Washington with his family and had driven across the country to the capital, officials said.
The heads of the FBI, CIA and Homeland Security and other senior Trump appointees all insisted that Lakanwal had been granted unvetted access to the US because of lax asylum policies in the wake of the chaotic final US withdrawal from Afghanistan under former president Biden.
However, AfghanEvac, a group that helped resettle Afghans in the US after the military withdrawal, said they had undergone “some of the most extensive security vetting” of any migrants.</p><small>2025-11-28 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28222323bfe3eee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957947/lesco-restores-power-to-lahores-bahria-town-after-payment-of-dues' target='_blank'><strong>Lesco restores power to Lahore’s Bahria Town after payment of dues</strong></a><br><p>The Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) restored power supply to four housing projects in Bahria Town Lahore after the society’s administration paid outstanding bills amounting to Rs682 million.
“The power supply has been restored to four Bahria town projects, including main Bahria Town near Mohlanwal,” a Lesco spokesperson told Dawn.
The power supply was suspended yesterday, inviting criticism from the residents, who also announced holding a protest demonstration in front of the Bahria Town offices after Friday prayers on this issue.
According to Lesco CEO Mr Ramzan Butt, the last date for bill payment was November 21, which was extended to November 23 on the request of the housing society’s officials.
After failing to pay, the officials had requested another day’s extension and continued securing more until Wednesday.
“Since the final and last date was November 27 (yesterday), they, instead of paying bills, approached the court, reportedly. But before they could get the court decision, we disconnected the power supply to four projects, including the main Bahria town (near Mohlanwal) that alone has dues of over Rs530m,” Butt explained to Dawn.
In 2024, Lesco had disconnected the power supply to Bahria Town over the non-payment of more than Rs762m in electricity bills.
The real estate company has come under scrutiny before as well for power issues. In June last year, scores of residents in Bahria Town’s operations in Islamabad petitioned against overbilling and deductions by the management on electricity generated through solar power.</p><small>2025-11-28 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28220245afa8b9b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957945/monument-to-first-man-in-space-yuri-gagarin-unveiled-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>Monument to first man in space Yuri Gagarin unveiled in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>The Russian Embassy on Friday announced that a monument to Yuri Gagarin, the first man to travel to space and return, was unveiled in Islamabad’s Fatima Jinnah Park.
Gagarin became the first man in space in April 1961, when he uttered the famous words “Let’s go” as his Vostok rocket blasted off from southern Kazakhstan. After a voyage lasting just 108 minutes, the 27-year-old cosmonaut ejected from his capsule and parachuted down into a field in the Saratov region of central Russia.
According to a post on X, the unveiling ceremony was attended by Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev, Power Minister Awais Leghari, Russian Ambassador Albert P Khorev, Pakistani Ambassador to Russia Faisal Niaz Tirmizi and pilot-cosmonaut Elena Serova.
“This is the greatest feat in our shared history. A huge number of scientists are engaged in space research. Let this work benefit all countries of the world,” the statement read, quoting Tsivilev.
The post added that the unveiling was scheduled to coincide with the 10th meeting of the Russia-Pakistan Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation.
The embassy extended its gratitude to the International Charitable Fund “Dialogue of Cultures-United World” for providing a bust of Gagarin, the St Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange for its support in installing it and Pakistani authorities for their assistance in this project.
Tsivilev also announced that next year, a Russia-Pakistan conference on cosmonautics and space infrastructure would be held in Islamabad.

The border, which connects Lahore with the Indian city of Amritsar, is the only active land crossing between the two neighbours. It was closed to general traffic following a brief but intense military conflict earlier this year.
The high commission identified the prisoners repatriated today as Asghar Ali, Ramzan and Muhammad Idrees, saying that it would continue working towards the “release and repatriation of all Pakistani prisoners in India”.







The Foreign Office (FO) told Dawn the identities of the arrested fishermen and when they were taken into custody.
Ramzan, 43, from Lahore, was arrested in 2010 by India on charges of illegally crossing the border and possessing narcotics. After receiving consular access, his status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in February 2011.
Meanwhile, Muhammad Idrees from Narowal was arrested in 1995 for allegedly crossing the border illegally and was awarded 16 years of imprisonment. He was verified as a Pakistani national in 2005, 10 years after his arrest.
Asghar Ali, 39, from Sadiqabad, was arrested for allegedly crossing the border illegally in 2002. His status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in 2006.
Earlier this month, the fisherfolk community in Pakistan called for the immediate release of fishermen imprisoned in India during a conference at a festival in the coastal belt of Badin, while in September, a Pakistani national imprisoned in India, Raqib Bilal, was repatriated via the Wagah border.
In July, the foreign ministries of Islamabad and New Delhi exchanged lists detailing the number of prisoners held in each other’s countries.
According to a statement from the FO in September, “The government of Pakistan handed over a list of 246 Indian or believed-to-be-Indian prisoners (53 civilian prisoners and 193 fishermen) to a representative of the Indian High Commission, Islamabad.
“Simultaneously, the government of India shared a list of 463 Pakistani or believed-to-be-Pakistani prisoners (382 civilian prisoners and 81 fishermen) to a diplomat from the High Commission for Pakistan, New Delhi,” FO added.
Fishermen are frequently arrested and jailed by the authorities in both Pakistan and India. On November 1, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that a fisherman from Pakistan was arrested by the Indian Coast Guard and coerced into carrying out tasks for New Delhi’s intelligence agency.
The minister said that law enforcement agencies had apprehended a fisherman named Ijaz Mallah while he was out fishing in the sea.
“In September this year, when he was out fishing, he was arrested by the Indian Coast Guard and after the arrest, he was taken to an undisclosed location and was coerced and forced to do some tasks for the Indian intelligence agency,” he said.
Also, this month, the fisherfolk community called for the immediate release of Pakistani fishermen imprisoned in India, as dozens of families continue to suffer while their loved ones remain behind bars in the neighbouring country, despite constitutional protections and bilateral obligations regarding unintentional crossings of the maritime boundary.
Pakistani fishermen released and repatriated earlier this year reported being tortured by Indian authorities, including hard labour, beatings and being burned with metal plates.</p><small>2025-11-28 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/282135515d15c75.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957943/fm-dar-elected-chairman-of-economic-cooperation-organisations-council-of-ministers' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar elected chairman of Economic Cooperation Organisation’s council of ministers</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar was on Friday elected chairman of the Economic Cooperation Organisation’s Council of Ministers (ECO-COM), according to the Foreign Office (FO).
The ECO was founded as the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD) in 1964 by Pakistan, Iran and Turkiye, before it changed its name in 1985. The organisation’s website states that its purpose is “to create amenable and conducive conditions for the continued promotion of sustainable economic development in the region”.
The 10 member states include Pakistan, Iran, Turkiye, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
According to an FO statement, today’s meeting of the COM was held virtually and Dar underscored the body’s important role in fostering prosperity, economic integration and connectivity in the region.
“He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the ECO Vision 2025 and expressed Pakistan’s intent, as incoming chair of the ECO COM, to work closely with member states in finalising the ECO Vision 2026-2035,” the FO stated.
“The deputy prime minister/foreign minister emphasised Pakistan’s priority to strengthen multimodal transport corridors, harmonise customs frameworks, and align transport systems for seamless regional integration,” it added.







According to the FO, Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to key regional connectivity projects, including the Islamabad–Tehran-Istanbul Rail Corridor, the Eurasian Multimodal Corridor and the Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan Railway.
The FM recalled the Regional Transport Ministers’ Conference in Islamabad last month and noted that Pakistan is “actively shaping regional transport cooperation in road, rail, maritime and digital connectivity”.
“He (Dar) also highlighted Pakistan’s liberalised visa policy, enabling easier access for businesspersons and tourists from 126 countries,” the statement read.
Dar stressed the need for ECO members to bolster cooperation in various sectors and spheres, including sustainable transport, transit trade, customs harmonisation, climate-resilient infrastructure and counter-terrorism.
In an address to the meeting, he said that Pakistan sees the ECO as a useful platform to reinforce ties among members through multilateral engagements.
“Pakistan remains steadfast in its efforts to advance the goals of regional connectivity through integrated and efficient transport corridors,” he said, adding that establishing transport corridors in the region was a key goal of Islamabad’s.
“Despite the above efforts, we all need to acknowledge that there is significant untapped potential for improving the sustainability of transport and transit trade among the ECO regional countries,” he said, outlining four key areas  of focus:

Full implementation of the Transit Transport Framework Agreement (TTFA);
Development of a coordinated multimodal transport network;
Simplification and harmonisation of customs and border procedures through capacity building and technology transfer; and
Promotion of sustainable and climate-resilient transport systems aligned with our international environmental commitments.

Relations between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban are at their lowest point in the four years since the group came to power. Border crossings bet­ween the two countries have remained closed since October 11 and trade has been at a standstill following ground fighting and Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600-kilometre frontier that killed dozens on both sides in the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.
Following those clashes, Turkiye and Qatar stepped in to mediate. The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire, while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks. The third round concluded without any concrete agreement.
The situation deteriorated again following Afghan accusations of Pakistani airstrikes earlier this week, which the military and government ministers denied. The Afghan side also threatened retaliation.
Questioned about the threat and the shaky ceasefire during his weekly press briefing, FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said: “The ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan does not imply a traditional ceasefire implemented after two belligerent states in a war or a conflict situation. Pakistan-Afghanistan ceasefire implied that there would be no terrorist attack by Afghan-sponsored terrorist proxies into Pakistan. There have been major terrorist attacks after this ceasefire.”
“So, interpreting in that sense, the ceasefire is not holding because the ceasefire was about ceasing terrorist attacks inside Pakistan by TTP, FAK, and Afghan nationals using Afghan soil.”

 

He continued that “if Afghan nationals are attacking, as they did so in Islamabad and elsewhere, so we cannot be very optimistic about the ceasefire, which, in any case, I mentioned, is not the traditional ceasefire between the two states, but to be understood in the context of terrorist attacks from Afghanistan.”
The spokesperson said that security forces remained fully alert and the military’s preparedness was robust in response to any alleged threat from Afghanistan.
“The security challenges we face would be addressed with the seriousness that they merit.”







The spokesperson was also questioned about allegations from the Afghan Taliban about Pakistan harbouring the banned militant Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group to which he responded that it was an “outrageous” claim.
“It is a figment of the imagination of the Afghan Taliban regime. Afghan side wants to externalise this menace of terrorism, which inherently is on their own soil and of their own making. They want to externalise it to Pakistan, naming various organisations. Any extremist terrorist element in Pakistan is treated, is dealt, as per our laws. This statement, of presence of any ISIS in Pakistan is totally baseless.”
Even before this week’s current flare-up in tensions, the information ministry earlier this month said that all terrorists involved in an attack on Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan were Afghan citizens.
The attackers had targeted the main gate of the college and gained entry to the educational institution, but a timely response from security forces averted a major tragedy. Government ministers had linked the attack to Afghanistan and said it was orchestrated from there.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had also said that a suicide bomber who carried out an attack outside the Islamabad district and sessions court building was “not a Pakistani national”.
Twelve people were killed and 36 were injured in the suicide blast outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accused Afghanistan and India of involvement in terrorism, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies following the two incidents.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had also subsequently said that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after the incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2025-11-28 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28200054298fcc0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957928/24-pti-leaders-workers-temporarily-detained-by-karachi-police-after-kpc-protest' target='_blank'><strong>24 PTI leaders, workers temporarily detained by Karachi police after KPC protest</strong></a><br><p>Police on Friday detained 24 PTI leaders and workers following a protest at the Karachi Press Club (KPC), held to demonstrate the party’s concerns over former prime minister Imran Khan’s well-being.
Reports about Imran’s ill health had swirled on social and foreign media a day ago, prompting both government and PTI leaders to dismiss the rumours and state that the former prime minister — currently held incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adial jail — was doing well.
Several PTI workers, including women, carried banners bearing slogans in favour of the former premier as they moved towards KPC today. The party workers and leaders chanted slogans and delivered speeches.







Authorities had sealed all routes leading to the KPC by placing barricades and parking vehicles.







A sizeable police presence was noted at the KPC and in the surrounding areas, supported by women personnel.
PTI Sindh spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar said 20 PTI workers and leaders were detained; however, South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza later told Dawn the number was 24.







Among the detainees was the party’s provincial president, Haleem Adil Shaikh.







Bozdar said the party’s Insaf lawyers’ forum representatives arrived at Preedy Police Station and held talks with officials. Subsequently, all detainees were released.














South Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mahzoor Ali also confirmed that all protesters were released.
He said police took action as the crowd was ‘charged’ and the force feared they might indulge in vandalism and create a law and order situation.
“Therefore, the police just removed them, but they were not arrested,” the SSP said.</p><small>2025-11-28 15:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/281855302f4aaa5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957921/pakistan-gets-offers-in-tender-to-buy-100000-tonnes-of-rice-for-supply-to-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan gets offers in tender to buy 100,000 tonnes of rice for supply to Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>The lowest price offered in the tender from the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) to purchase 100,000 metric tonnes of rice for supply to Bangladesh was estimated at $394.95 CIF liner out, European traders said on Friday.
CIF liner out terms include cost, insurance, and freight shipping to a port in Bangladesh, as well as the seller’s unloading costs.No purchase has been reported and offers are still being considered, they said.Reports reflect traders’ assessments, and further price and volume estimates are still possible later.
The lowest offer was reportedly submitted by the company Jhulay Lal.
There were 11 participants in TCP’s tender, with other prices ranging from $397.25 to $424.80 a tonne CIF liner out, traders said. Bangladesh has been undertaking a series of import tenders in the past weeks to cool local prices.
The TCP tender seeks long-grain white rice to supply to Bangladesh. Price offers have to be valid for 21 working days after submission.
The rice must be available for shipment within 45 days of contract award. Traders regarded the tender as an effort to bring Pakistani rice into Bangladesh’s import supplies, with market expectations that Indian-origin rice will be used to supply some recent purchases by Bangladesh.</p><small>2025-11-28 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28184326295b2ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957920/nasa-rover-records-first-evidence-of-lightning-on-mars' target='_blank'><strong>Nasa rover records first evidence of lightning on Mars</strong></a><br><p>A Nasa rover has recorded evidence of lightning on Mars for the first time, its microphone picking up the sounds of tiny “zaps” whipped up by the dust storms constantly sweeping across the planet.
Scientists have long debated whether electrical discharges could be sparking in the dusty and little-known Martian climate - but proof has been hard to come by.
It turns out that Nasa’s Perseverance rover, which has been roaming the red planet since 2021, was inadvertently recording the sounds of lightning, according to a study published in Nature this week.
These are far from the thundering, kilometre-long lightning bolts we see on Earth.
Instead, they are “little zaps” similar to “what you might feel in dry weather when you touch your car door and there’s a bit of static electricity,” lead author Baptiste Chide of France’s CNRS research centre told AFP.
While low in energy, these discharges are happening “absolutely all the time — and everywhere” on Mars, the planetary scientist said.
The process starts when tiny grains of dust rub against each other. They become charged with electrons and release this energy in electrical arcs a few centimetres or even millimetres long, sending off an audible shock wave.

Here on Earth, dust storms and dust devils in desert areas also create electrical fields, but they rarely build up into electrical discharges.
However, on Mars, “because of the very low pressure and the composition of the atmosphere, the amount of charge that needs to accumulate to generate a discharge is much smaller,” Chide explained.
This phenomenon has been theorised since Mars first started to be explored and has been reproduced in the laboratory.
Chide said it had been “such an important issue for Martian science” that an instrument on the European Space Agency’s Schiaparelli lander was dedicated to searching for it. Unfortunately, the spacecraft crashed while trying to land on Mars in 2016.
Since then, “it was somewhat of a forgotten area for Martian exploration,” Chide said.
That is, until “by chance” the microphone on Perserverance’s SuperCam recorded signals of what appeared to be electrical discharges, he added.
Daniel Mitchard, a lightning expert at Cardiff University not involved in the study, commented in Nature that the research provided “persuasive evidence of dust-induced discharges”.
But because the discharges “were only heard and not seen,” he expected debate between scientists on the subject “to continue for some time”.
Electrified astronauts?
The research could shed some light on the mysterious Martian climate.“Dust drives the Martian climate”, similar to the water cycle on Earth, Chide said. For example, a season of dust storms will have begun by the end of the year.
The electrical discharges could also kick off a process that destroys organic molecules — which are the building blocks of life — on the Martian surface.
It could also explain the surprisingly rapid disappearance of methane on the planet — a phenomenon that has baffled scientists. It may also have implications for future Mars missions.
Scientists will now be able to design their instruments to better protect the future robots sent to Mars, Chide said. There are also plans for humans to finally set foot on the planet’s red surface.
“In the long term, isn’t there a risk that the suits of the astronauts who stay on the Martian surface for a long time will be damaged by these discharges?” Chide asked.
“We will have to ask ourselves this question. “</p><small>2025-11-28 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2818172342a1706.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957918/new-air-traffic-control-tower-to-be-built-at-karachis-jinnah-international-airport' target='_blank'><strong>New air traffic control tower to be built at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) has launched a project to build a new air traffic control (ATC) tower and a modern rescue and firefighting station (RFFS) at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, a PAA press release said on Friday.
According to the press release, the design phase of the project is expected to be completed within six months, with a two-year construction period for the tower and the station.
“The facilities will be designed and constructed by MM Pakistan in [a] joint venture with CEMOSA and Fairbanks Architects from Spain, bringing international expertise in airport planning and communication and navigation/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) systems integration,” the press release read.

It added that senior architect Bruce Fairbanks and CNS/ATM specialist Juan Cruz Canabate participated in a four-day workshop at Jinnah International, where they interacted with local aviation professionals to establish design parameters and decide on project requirements.
“After evaluating three potential locations, sites for both the ATC Tower and the new fire station have been finalised, ensuring alignment with operational, safety, and future development considerations,” the PAA said.
Jinnah International is one of the busiest airports in the country and serves as the main hub for flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines. According to aviation monitor FlightRadar, 64 tracked flights departed from Karachi on November 27.</p><small>2025-11-28 13:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2818263517d854f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957919/putin-to-discuss-privileged-partnership-with-modi-on-india-visit-next-week' target='_blank'><strong>Putin to discuss ‘privileged partnership’ with Modi on India visit next week</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss all aspects of their countries’ “privileged strategic partnership” when Putin visits New Delhi next week, the Kremlin said.
India, a major buyer of Russian oil, has also bought its weapons for decades, though a top defence official said the country had bought US arms worth nearly $30 billion in the past decade and aims to produce more of its own equipment.
“They (the Russians) have been our friends through both fair and foul weather, and we are not going to sort of stop our defence cooperation with them anytime soon, but I do want to stress that India follows a policy of strategic autonomy,” Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said in New Delhi on Friday.
India was diversifying its suppliers, he told an industry event, adding: “But more than anything else we are trying to ensure that we increasingly do spend the bulk of our money within the country.”
Putin last visited India in December 2021, just a few months before Russia went to war in Ukraine the following February.
“This visit is of great importance, providing an opportunity to comprehensively discuss the extensive agenda of Russian-Indian relations as a particularly privileged strategic partnership,” the Kremlin said in a statement.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged Modi to stop India’s buying of oil from Russia. In August, he imposed an additional tariff of 25 per cent on Indian goods in what Moscow said amounted to illegal trade pressure on New Delhi.
Trade and refining sources said this week that India’s December oil imports from Russia were set to hit their lowest in at least three years, off November’s multi-month highs, as refiners sought options to avoid breaching Western sanctions.
During his state visit from December 4 to 5, Putin will hold talks with Modi and have a separate meeting with President Droupadi Murmu, the Kremlin said, saying a number of unspecified intergovernmental and commercial documents would be signed.

The ruling PML-N secured close to 64 per cent of the total votes polled in the by-elections for six National Assembly constituencies held on Sunday as it emerged victorious on all seats. Five constituencies were located in Punjab and one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. These seats, except for one, were vacated due to the disqualification of the opposition PTI MNAs.
The PML-N also won six out of seven Punjab Assembly seats in the province by securing 82.41pc of the polled votes. On the seventh seat, it had not fielded its candidate in PP-269, Muzaffargarh, against PPP nominee Alamdar Qureshi.
The elections monitor had issued its by-election observation report a day earlier. In an accompanying press release, it noted: “The November 23rd by-elections for 13 National and Punjab Assemblies constituencies, though largely well-managed, were marked by recurring violations of campaigning restrictions, gaps in results transparency and a worryingly low voter turnout.”
The monitor also noted that “weak enforcement of campaigning restrictions” was among the persistent issues flagged in all polls. Furthermore, it said the overall turnout fell by 23 per cent for both men and women and only one constituency recorded a turnout of above 50pc.
It explained that at 238 (64pc) polling stations, at least 465 party camps were observed in close vicinity to the stations and transportation facilitation was observed at 184 (49pc) polling stations.
“Party camps were seen issuing voter slips at 216 (91pc) polling stations, and campaign material was found inside 16 (4pc) polling stations. While most polling stations had basic accessibility infrastructure, arrangements for women, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and transgender voters were inconsistent.”
Referring to organisational preparation and setup for the by-elections, Fafen said around 89pc of presiding officers, 79pc of assistant presiding officers and 77pc of polling officers reported receiving training from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
“Ballot security and secrecy were generally upheld,” Fafen noted, adding that all four required ballot box seals were intact at 1,072 (98pc) booths and secrecy screens were properly placed at 1,044 (96pc) booths.
It stated that its observers closely monitored 366 polling booths and found polling organised and peaceful at 340 (93pc) booths, while only four (1pc) were described as disorganised or poorly managed.
Fafen noted that polling officers were observed performing key legal tasks such as verifying National Identity Cards (NIC), applying thumb marks, recording voter details and updating electoral rolls. However, at 92 (25pc) booths, they did not announce voter names and serial numbers as required under election laws.
“At 10 (3pc) booths, at least one eligible voter was turned away due to an expired NIC.”
Fafen added that assistant presiding officers “generally followed” proper ballot issuance procedures, but at 107 (29pc) booths, they pre-signed ballot papers, and at 102 (28pc) booths, they pre-stamped them.
“Although not illegal, these practices may increase the risk of ballot misuse,” Fafen pointed out.
“Of the 79 polling stations selected for counting observation, access to observers was denied at two. Presiding officers did not provide the Result of the Count (Form 45) to polling agents at six (8pc) polling stations and to observers at 13 (17pc) stations. Form 45 was also not displayed outside 15 (19pc) polling stations.”
“Similarly, Ballot Paper Account (Form 46) was not provided to polling agents at 15 (19pc) stations and observers at 17 (22pc) stations and it was not posted outside 16 (21pc) stations. At 33 (43pc) polling stations, presiding officers did not ask polling agents to sign the result forms.”
Fafen further said that around 97pc of polling agents interviewed during the observation process expressed satisfaction with the polling process, while only two expressed concerns. However, it said that all 137 polling agents interviewed after the counting phase reported satisfaction with the counting process.
The monitor also said it had deployed 122 trained and accredited observers, who conducted a “comprehensive observation” of opening, voting and counting processes at 373 polling stations and their 1,088 polling booths, including 626 male and 462 female booths. The observers also interviewed polling staff, security personnel, and 833 polling agents.</p><small>2025-11-28 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/281741286d42d63.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957915/fcc-to-hear-arshad-sharif-murder-case-on-dec-3' target='_blank'><strong>FCC to hear Arshad Sharif murder case on Dec 3</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on Friday fixed a date for the Arshad Sharif murder case, where the request for an independent probe into the killing would be heard.
Prominent journalist Sharif was shot in the head when Kenyan police opened fire on his car in October 2022. He had left Pakistan in August 2022 after multiple cases of sedition were registered against him in different cities.
The suo motu case was taken up by a six-member constitutional bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan in the Supreme Court. However, after the passage of the 27th Amendment and the formation of the FCC, it was granted jurisdiction over both constitutional and suo motu cases.
On Friday, the FCC cause list showed that a hearing had been scheduled for December 3, with the attorney general, the Islamabad inspector general of police (IG), and the foreign secretary among other respondents.
It will be heard by a two-member bench comprising Justices Aamir Farooq and Rozi Khan Barrech, regarding an “independent and transparent investigation into the murder of renowned journalist Arshad Sharif in Kenya”.
In August last year, former chief justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa explained that the Arshad Sharif murder case was not fixed before a five-judge larger bench as it did not require any constitutional interpretation.
In July 2024, the top court had referred the case back to the three-judge committee constituted under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 to re-fix it before a five-judge bench.</p><small>2025-11-28 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28144133c861415.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957904/bond-of-respect-is-greater-than-politics-na-speaker-again-stresses-need-for-dialogue-with-opposition' target='_blank'><strong>’Bond of respect is greater than politics’: NA speaker again stresses need for dialogue with opposition</strong></a><br><p>National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq again ostensibly made an offer of talks to the opposition, telling a group of parliamentarians visiting him on Friday that dialogue was the way to resolve issues.
He made similar offers to facilitate dialogue between the government and the opposition, the PTI, in the past as well. But, no substantial headway has been made so far, and differences between the two sides largely remain unresolved.
A handout issued by the NA Secretariat today said Sadiq met with opposition members of both houses of Parliament in his chamber in Parliament House soon after the adjournment of the NA session due to lack of quorum.
The visiting opposition members included Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Senator Faisal Javed, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser and PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan. MNAs Iqbal Afridi, Atif Khan, Sardar Latif Khosa and Jamal Ahsan Khan.







“Our bond of brotherhood and mutual respect is greater than politics. I have been in contact with you brothers since 2014. Politics does not last a lifetime — it ends eventually,” said the speaker according to the handout.
Sadiq said the members of Parliament “should have a relationship that lasts throughout life”.
The speaker further stated that he had always advocated for dialogue, stressing that dialogue was the means to resolve issues.
PTI’s Barrister Gohar, during the meeting, raised the issue of PTI founder Imran Khan’s family members not being allowed to meet the incarcerated leader, said the statement.
It added that the opposition members “appreciated” the speaker’s efforts to facilitate dialogue between the two sides.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.
After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides had commenced dialogue in the last week of December last year to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations, the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024, and the release of PTI prisoners.
The Shehbaz government had once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February as NA Speaker Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped.
However,  a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the PTI.
Qaiser alleged the government had started raids to round up the PTI workers, and dozens of them had reportedly been arrested across the country.
In early August, the dialogue offer was again extended by government ministers and Speaker Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue in the NA.
The PTI members welcomed the offer for talks but questioned the government’s authority to initiate dialogue.
More recently, Sadiq reiterated his offer on November 13 to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties.
The offer was made by the speaker at a time when the opposition members belonging to the PTI were protesting in the assembly during the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill.</p><small>2025-11-28 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28105854ed6b895.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957889/trump-says-us-will-permanently-pause-migration-from-all-third-world-countries' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US will ‘permanently pause’ migration from ‘all third world countries’</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Thursday unleashed a series of posts on Truth Social that could dramatically reshape US immigration policy, declaring that he will “permanently pause” migration from “all third world countries” and calling for “reverse migration” to remove certain immigrants.

Until the system stabilises, no new immigrants from these countries will be allowed entry,” Trump wrote.
He did not identify any countries by name or give any specifics about what he meant by “permanently pause”. However, his posts signal a sweeping crackdown that could affect millions of residents from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and which could also alter refugee, Green Card, and other immigration programmes.
The development comes a day after the US government abruptly halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghan nationals, following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House. Trump had earlier announced that Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two National Guard troops shot, had died, while the other soldier was “fighting for his life”.
In his posts, he also declared he would denaturalise migrants who “undermine domestic tranquillity, and deport any foreign national who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western civilisation.
Trump argued that US immigration policies had weakened the country despite technological progress and said the nation needed time “to fully recover” from what he called an immigration onslaught.
His posts outlined measures to terminate “millions” of admissions granted under his predecessor Joe Biden, including those signed by “sleepy Joe’s autopen”. He further said he would remove anyone he deemed “not a net asset” to the US or “incapable of loving our country”.







“Those who fail to contribute positively or respect American values will not be allowed to remain. The goal is to ensure that only individuals who strengthen the nation are permitted to live and work here,” he said.
Trump stressed that these reforms would not stop there.
“Only reverse migration can fully cure this situation. Individuals who have entered the US illegally or disrupted American society will be encouraged to return to their home countries. This step is presented as the only way to restore law, order, and stability in the US,” he said.
He also pledged to end all federal benefits for non-citizens, in an effort to ease the financial burden on American taxpayers.
“All federal benefits and subsidies for non-citizens of our country will be ended. This includes welfare, health care, and other support programmes that previously went to migrants. The policy is meant to stop the financial burden on American taxpayers and prioritise citizens first,” he said.
In one post, Trump attached a picture of Afghans being airlifted and wrote: “This is part of the horrendous airlift from Afghanistan. Hundreds of thousands of people poured into our country totally unvetted and unchecked. We will fix it, but will never forget what crooked Joe Biden and his thugs did to our country!”







The US president added that “these goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal and disruptive populations”.
On Thursday, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Joseph Edlow announced that the president had ordered a “full-scale, rigorous reexamination” of every Green Card issued to immigrants from 19 countries listed in a June presidential proclamation.
These countries include Afghanistan, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, and Venezuela — but not Pakistan.
“The protection of this country and of the American people remains paramount, and the American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration’s reckless resettlement policies,” Edlow wrote on Truth Social.
Millions of Green Card holders and permanent residents from these countries could face scrutiny, even if they have lived in the US for years.
Trump had immediately linked the shooting of the two National Guard soldiers to immigration, stating that the shooter, identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had been flown into the US in September 2021 and later had his status extended under Biden-era policies.
CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed that Lakanwal had worked with US forces in Kandahar and was admitted as part of partner forces, but described the admission as part of “the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan”.
The Pentagon confirmed the deployment of an additional 500 National Guard personnel to Washington, adding to the 2,200 already stationed in the capital.
USCIS also suspended all immigration requests from Afghan nationals pending a review of vetting and security procedures, leaving roughly 200,000 Afghans in limbo.
In his posts, Trump also framed immigration as “the single greatest national security threat,” asserting that the previous administration had admitted “20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world.”
“Any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country… If they can’t love our country, we don’t want ’em,” he said, signalling that his administration intended to pursue aggressive enforcement measures.
The combined directives point to an unprecedented federal review of immigrants, refugees, and Green Card holders from third world countries, potentially affecting millions of families abroad who seek to migrate or are already in the United States.
