The eight franchises have started bidding on spinners, following the conclusion of the previous round, which saw wicket-keepers being auctioned off.
Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.



Bangladeshi spinner Rishaad Hossain was sold to Rawalpindi for a bid of Rs30m.
Next up were Mamoon Imtiaz, Ali Majid, Momin Qamar, Peter Hatzoglou, and Arif Yaqoob, who did not receive any bids. Faisal Akram was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for the final bid of Rs12.5m.
Sahibaza Farhan sold off to Sialkot Stallionz
The bidding on wicket keepers began with Azam Khan — at the base price of Rs11m. With the final bids of Rs31.5m by Sialkot Stallionz and Rs32.5m by Karachi Kings, the latter managed to secure Khan.







However, Sialkot Stallionz bagged Sahibzada Farhan against Karachi Kings, with a bid of Rs57m.







Next up were Sri Lankan cricketer Dinesh Chandimal and West Indies’ Johnson Charles, both of whom went unsold.
Team Rawalpindi bags Naseem Shah; Haris Rauf with Lahore Qalandars
At the outset of the bidding for fast bowlers, Muhammad Ali was sold off to Hyderabad Houstan Kingsmen in a last-minute bid of Rs21.5m against Rawalpindi’s Rs20.5m.
Next up was Chris Jordan, who went unsold after receiving zero bids.
Lahore Qalandars regained fast-bowler Haris Rauf at Rs76m against the Rawalpindi team’s Rs74.5m bid.
Muhammad Hasnain, at the base price of  received no bids.
Karachi Kings put in the first bid for Naseem Shah at Rs65m, followed by Islamabad United bidding Rs66.5m.
After a series of back-and-forth bids between the two, Rawalpindi came in at a bid of Rs86.5m, following which Karachi Kings bowed out.







David Warner goes to Karachi Kings
The second round began with Barbadian cricketer Kyle Mayers at the base price of Rs11m, who went unsold after no bids were made.
New Zealand’s Colin Munroe went unsold as well. Karachi Kings bagged Australian batsman David Warner at Rs79m after a round of back-and-forth bidding with Peshawar Zalmi.







South African batsman Rilee Rossouw was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for Rs55m.
Islamabad United bags all-rounder Faheem Ashraf
The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.







The second all-rounder to be auctioned was Imaad Wasim at Rs42m, followed by Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz at the base price of Rs11m; however, no bids were made by any of the teams.
All-rounders Hussain Talat, Asif Afridi, Danish Aziz, and Muhammad Zeeshan at the base price of Rs11m received no bids as well.
At the outset of the ceremony, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) PSL Salman Naseer addressed the audience.
“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.
“PSL and PCB team have burnt out midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.
PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.
In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).
The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:

Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m
Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m
Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m
Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m

“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.
Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.
PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.
Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.
The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”
“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.
PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.
“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”
“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.
The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.</p><small>2026-02-11 09:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/111305488861886.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972522/fm-dar-once-again-underscores-dialogue-diplomacy-in-phone-call-with-iranian-fm-araghchi' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar once again underscores dialogue, diplomacy in phone call with Iranian FM Araghchi</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Foreign Minister of Iran Abbas Araghchi over the phone once again on Wednesday, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
According to a post by the FO on social media, the two leaders “discussed regional developments and underscored the importance of dialogue and diplomacy”.
They agreed to continue close engagement and coordination, the statement added.







The two foreign ministers have engaged in multiple phone calls since the start of the new year.
Earlier in January, the two foreign ministers had spoken on the phone, during which Dar expressed concern over the evolving regional situation.
Alongside that call, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also spoke with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian on the same day, with the two leaders exchanging views on the “evolving regional situation”.
Dar and Araghchi had also already spoken the weekend prior, when Dar received a call from Araghchi while on a visit to Dubai.

 

Dar had expressed his hope for peace and stability in Iran in another phone call with the Iranian foreign minister, in which the two diplomats discussed the situation in Iran and the wider region.
Pakistan, Turkiye remaining ‘in close coordination’: FO
Separately, earlier today, the FO said that the foreign minister also held a telephone conversation with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.
“The two leaders exchanged views on regional and international developments, discussed matters of mutual interest, and agreed to remain in close coordination,” it said.







According to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkiye has been working hard to prevent US-Iran tensions from tipping the Middle East into a new conflict, as the two adversaries signal that disagreement over Tehran’s missile arsenal threatens to torpedo a deal.
Tensions have run high amid a US naval buildup near Iran, following the violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.
Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded that Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast.
Turkiye was doing its best to prevent an escalation, said Erdogan, who has spent years cultivating a close relationship with Trump while expanding Ankara’s diplomatic influence across the Middle East and beyond.
Turkiye, which shares a 530 kilometre border with Iran, has often expressed opposition to military operations targeting the Islamic Republic.
The country had originally been expected to host a round of talks between the US and Iran in Istanbul in an attempt to de-escalate the dispute. However, the meeting was later shifted to Oman.</p><small>2026-02-11 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/07152851a0a1103.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971430/systemic-rot-how-a-system-of-corrupt-officials-and-politicians-is-usurping-karachis-prime-real-estate' target='_blank'><strong>Systemic rot: how a ‘system’ of corrupt officials and politicians is usurping Karachi’s prime real estate</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Around 4.30pm on Feb 25 last year, an altercation took place between two groups of people on Mai Kolachi Road, near the US consulate. While the details of the brawl itself are unclear, the bone of contention was allegedly a three-acre chunk of prime real estate located just off the thoroughfare. One of its two co-owners, builder and developer Javed Iqbal had employed a local JUI-F leader named Jibrail Khan, 32, to work there as a supervisor. Several sources claim that the huge plot is coveted by extremely powerful individuals at the top of the political food chain.
Some days earlier, this party had sent in their supporters to occupy the plot. On Feb 25, Jibrail got into a heated confrontation with them. An FIR was filed against him for rioting armed with a deadly weapon, kidnapping and attempted murder. Several other FIRs (copies of which are in Dawn’s possession) were also filed against him in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, including Shikarpur, Moro, Qazi Ahmed and Nawabshah for various crimes, ostensibly committed within the span of a few weeks, including theft of cattle, cash and a motorbike. He was arrested, taken to Central Jail and a few weeks later, transferred to prison in Nawabshah.
According to an individual close to Jibrail, who originally hails from KP, “He’s never been anywhere in Sindh except for Karachi”. Even after he was acquitted by a Shaheed Benazirabad court, with the judicial magistrate in his order saying there had been an abuse of power and that Jibrail had been falsely implicated, he continued to be detained in the same prison.
The plot’s co-owner, Mr Iqbal, alleges that a fake FIR was filed against him as well and he was detained by the Counter Terrorism Department police for four days, during which, he says, he was ordered to surrender the plot in writing. He refused; ultimately, he obtained relief from the Sindh High Court.
Political big guns soon became involved. Rashid Mehmood Soomro, secretary general of JUI-F Sindh, issued a strongly worded statement on social media in Jibrail’s defence, describing the dispute as one in connection with a plot which “two big crocodiles are rushing to grab”. He denounced one of them as “someone who perhaps believes he owns Sindh, owns the country, and thinks he can use brute force to grab land…”; he warned that if the matter was not resolved quickly, Sindh would go up in flames.



This is the tip of the iceberg that illustrates the lawlessness prevailing in Sindh, where an entire system allegedly operates free from the constraints of the law and institutional guardrails, beholden only to its political masters and their whims, and existing solely to rake in eyewatering fortunes for everyone involved.
While the sources of this wealth are many and varied, Karachi’s precious real estate is the gift that keeps on giving, and it is the focus of this report. Sources within the political leadership, bureaucracy and civil society speak of a city divided up into zones, with a trusted front man (sometimes several) presiding over receipts from each area under his control. Among these are a seasoned medical professional, a civil servant active in brokering land deals, a business group that allegedly handles all the ‘earnings’ generated in the province, etc.
Given the heft of the personalities involved, most sources were unwilling to speak on the record, but there is sufficient documentary evidence and on-ground reporting by Dawn to support their statements. Certain names have been changed to protect the individuals’ identity. With the law having been weaponised to silence the media, drawing too clear a picture can be fraught with risk, so readers are invited to connect the dots where possible.
King of the West?
In a country where political fortunes can go through cycles of boom and bust, Ali Hassan Brohi — also known as Ali Hassan Zehri because of his Baloch tribal ancestry — has suffered a setback of sorts. On Feb 3, he tendered his resignation from the Balochistan cabinet. But, given his powerful connections, this may be only a bump in the road.
There was a time he was said to be on the run and allegedly in the crosshairs of the ‘encounter specialist’ — Rao Anwar, then SSP Malir. Fast forward to December 2024, he was sworn in as Balochistan’s minister for agriculture and cooperatives. His recent setbacks in that province notwithstanding, he is arguably one of the most powerful people in Sindh, rumoured to have the ear of no less than the president himself.


Letter of resignation by Ali Hassan Zehri to CM Balochistan.

Hailing from Bandhi, Nawabshah district (since renamed Shaheed Benazirabad), he was once, as a prominent politician told Dawn, in the employ of an octroi tax collector in Bolari, district Jamshoro.
“He wasn’t even a manager, but a helper. However, according to the contractor, he was extremely sharp.” Showing a political savvy that was to stand him in good stead, Mr Brohi developed contacts with low-level PPP workers and over time, with senior party leaders in Nawabshah. With the help of his connections, alleges the politician, Mr Brohi gradually worked his way out of small-town Sindh to providing muscle for the PPP in connection with Karachi’s pricey real estate — but then, there was a falling out.
Several sources confirmed to Dawn that Mr Brohi made a run for Balochistan; police close to the Sindh-Balochistan border had received orders from SSP Rao to ‘intercept’ him, and they fired upon his vehicle in the Mochko area, but he made it across. There he sought shelter with certain political and tribal heavyweights, two of whom are said to have paved the way for his rapprochement with his former benefactor several years later when they joined the PPP.

 

Until then, though, Mr Brohi’s travails were far from over. On May 20, 2020, English and Urdu newspapers carried a public notice by the deputy commissioner, district West (the DC office is the most senior in the district revenue department). The notice declared Mr Brohi “an extremely notorious individual” and claimed he had grabbed over 3,000 acres of state and private land worth billions of rupees. It read: “For his immense crimes of forgery and land grabs, Ali Hassan Brohi is under a comprehensive and impartial inquiry by this office. A significant number of fake entries managed by Ali Hassan Brohi in the revenue record of district West have been found, which will be conveyed to higher authorities with recommendations for cancellation and penal action after completion of scrutiny.” The notice asked for public assistance in gathering further information.


Public notice published in a national daily, declaring Mr Brohi “an extremely notorious individual” and claiming he had grabbed over 3,000 acres of state and private land worth billions of rupees.

On the orders of Owais Muzaffar Tappi who was believed to run the system at the time, the then DC West Fayyaz Solangi retrieved the lands that Mr Brohi had allegedly grabbed. However, as this story will later show, Mr Solangi would come to regret following those orders so faithfully.
In 2021, FIA’s corporate crime circle, Karachi office, instituted an enquiry based on what it claimed was a reference from the DIG CTD, Sindh, in which Mr Brohi and eight others were named on the basis of an FIR (no 811/2021) filed in Karachi. Briefly, the FIR accused Mr Brohi of having taken Rs20 million from drug dealers to bribe two policemen with Rs7m to get two of his alleged front men to spring three Nigerian nationals from custody. According to the FIA’s brief, subsequent enquiries brought to light 14 FIRs dating from 2007 till 2020, in which Mr Brohi is named as the accused in eight, while the rest nominate two other individuals described as his “front men”.
The charges against him include terrorism, murder, attempted murder, rioting armed with a deadly weapon, dacoity, causing hurt and criminal intimidation, among others. The document also names nine “front men” of Mr Brohi in whose name the latter had “acquired/ purchased various properties in different areas” of Karachi. These findings, according to the brief, are based on only a partial record, some of it obtained from the digitised records compiled by the Land Revenue Management Information Systems (LARMIS), Board of Revenue (BoR), Sindh. Mr Brohi did not respond to questions put to him in writing by Dawn regarding these allegations and other claims about him by sources quoted in this report.
(Of the eight FIRs in which Mr Brohi is nominated as the sole accused, police sources contacted by Dawn were able to confirm three FIRs from their record, plus two more registered in 2021 that are not listed in the FIA brief.)
In conclusion, the brief says that in December 2021, the enquiry was transferred to FIA headquarters in Islamabad. The story of that transfer is revealing in its brazen conflict of interest.
In March 2021, Mr Brohi’s wife, Samina Mumtaz Zehri was elected to the Senate on a reserved women’s seat. According to a senior political leader, her election was managed by former ISI chief Faiz Hameed, who had her vote shifted to Hub from Karachi and presented her as a Senate candidate from the Balochistan Awami Party. (The BAP is well known to have the military establishment’s backing.) After her election, Ms Zehri became a member of the standing committee on interior. At its meeting on Oct 22, 2021, the minutes of which are in Dawn’s possession, the members made several recommendations. One of these reads: “Senators Rana Maqbool Ahmed, Azam Nazir Tarar and Muhammad Talha Mahmood were of the considered opinion that Dr Farooq, deputy director of FIA, Karachi has now become a controversial officer and the case pointed by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri should be transferred to Islamabad and interrogated…” The case in question was the FIA’s inquiry into Ms Zehri’s own husband.
As per its letter dated Dec 27, 2021 acknowledging the standing committee’s decision, the DG FIA’s Islamabad office directed that the enquiry report be submitted for perusal to the DG, FIA within a fortnight. The DG FIA did not respond to repeated requests in writing from Dawn as to the fate of the enquiry.

On Nov 4, 2024, Senior Vice President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry Saquib Fayyaz Magoon wrote to Chief Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah about a complaint forwarded to him by President, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industries Jawed Bilwani. The complaint, by businessman Shoaib Razzak Makkad and also dated Nov 4, 2024, was enclosed with the letter to the chief secretary.
Mr Makkad in his complaint stated that he was a partner in Salina International, a salt manufacturing business. According to him, he was “in possession of land measuring 54.3 acres since 2019” in Mauripur, district Keamari. “…[O]n June 28, 2024, Tapedar … and Tapedar …, notable front men of Ali Hassan Brohi, with some unknown people came with heavy weapons and … encroached on the entire land. They are still today residing [there] with heavy weapons.”


Saquib Fayyaz Magoon’s letter to chief secretary Sindh.

A senior government officer told Dawn, “In districts West and Keamari, without Ali Hassan’s NOC, neither DC, nor SSP, nor mukhtiarkar, nor some ACs — such as of Manghopir and Mauripur — can be appointed.” This view was corroborated by sources in the police, bureaucracy, business sector and PPP itself. A seasoned bureaucrat said that even after lease papers for a particular housing society in district West had been signed, “the AC and mukhtiarkar wouldn’t make an entry in their mutation registers because they don’t do anything unless specifically ordered by Ali Hassan.”
(A mukhtiarkar is a BoR official just below the assistant commissioner, responsible for processing and issuing documents related to land revenue, which makes this an extremely powerful post.)
This is not to suggest that Mr Brohi is the only one whose name crops up in context of allegedly questionable land dealings. However, given his political profile, he is arguably the most prominent among these individuals.
Dirty business
Before moving on to the other actors in the sordid saga of land grabbing in Karachi, a brief note on how land ownership is created followed by some instances of shady real estate dealings that Dawn has uncovered.
The Board of Revenue, Sindh is original custodian of all the land in the province. Aside from revenue collection and maintaining land records in Sindh, BoR allots land to individuals, societies and various institutions and development authorities such as Karachi Development Authority (KDA), Lyari Development Authority (LDA), Defence Housing Authority, etc to develop schemes for specific purposes.
Relevant revenue officials ‘survey’ an area of state land and divide it into blocks with each given a unique identifier called a “survey number”. The surveyed land can then be allotted according to a procedure specified under the Sindh Colonisation and Disposal of Government Land Rules, 2005. Unsurveyed land is termed ‘na class’ land, which belongs to the original owner, the state, which holds it in trust for the public. Na class or unsurveyed land is distinguished on BoR maps by a different colour and different sequence of numbers than surveyed land.
But evidence that rules of procedure are being violated with breathtaking impunity — and with full knowledge of the authorities — lies scattered all across Karachi. Districts West (particularly in Halkani, Bund Murad and Jam Chakro), Keamari (which was carved out of the original district West in 2020), East and Malir have become increasingly attractive for builders. “To make a project viable inside the city is quite difficult because you can’t find big chunks of land there, and whatever land that does exist there is expensive,” says Hamid Khan* of the Association of Builders and Developers of Pakistan (ABAD). “That’s why builders tend to focus on the suburbs.”
No doubt there are countless examples of illegal land use within Karachi proper, including encroachment on amenity plots, by elements connected with all political parties — PPP, MQM and ANP (during the latter two’s heyday in the city), and even by the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan for a period. For reasons of space, however, this report focuses on Karachi’s outlying areas and encroachments within recent years.
Dawn Investigations visited multiple sites in district West, as well as the huge development scheme known as Hawkesbay Scheme 42 in district Keamari. Where until some years ago there were vast stretches of empty land dotted with goths (rural settlements), dozens of gated housing schemes are now coming up, many boasting little more than an entrance, a boundary wall and a booking office where dubious claims about the builders’ title to land are made.
Take Al-Jannat City by MAA Construction & Builders Pvt Ltd in deh Halkani, for example. Mohammed Aqeel in the booking office informs the Dawn correspondent, who approaches him as a prospective investor, that there are 575 residential plots of 120 sq yards each available here, and a number of commercial plots. The proposed layout plan displayed in the booking office shows the project as being spread across 32.8 acres on survey numbers 57, 58, 59 and 61. The salesperson says six families are already residing in the society while around 20 houses are under construction. Residential plots cost between Rs3 to 3.5 million, with all sales final. Calculated at Rs3.3m each, the residential plots alone add up to at least Rs1.84 billion.


A masterplan of the housing society is plastered on a wall inside the Al Jannat City office.

“If you delay buying for a month, the price could cross four million rupees,” cautions Mr Aqeel. “Construction has been picking up pace here and there’s no other leased project nearing completion in the area.” He adds: “We have been issuing sub-leases to owners of the plots.” The question is: how is that possible when the land on which Al-Jannat City is coming up does not even belong to the builder?
Mr Aqeel claims LDA has leased the land to the builders, but tellingly, he refuses to show the lease. “Not until you purchase a plot,” he says firmly. (Deh Halkani is part of what is known as Scheme 43, which the BoR has given only as a ‘controlled’ area to LDA. The Authority itself has no lease for it.)
To delve deeper into the builder’s claims, Dawn GIS department referred to the digitised data in LARMIS. The apex court in 2012 banned the mutation of public land in Sindh, but in 2019, it partially lifted the ban in areas where the land record had been digitised. Thus, one can reasonably assume that the LARMIS data, where it exists, is up to date.
It turns out that survey numbers 57, 58, 59 and 61 actually lie on the other side of the road from where Al-Jannat City is coming up. The project is located on what is entirely state land. Interestingly, taken together, these survey numbers almost mirror the dimensions of the project itself.
A short drive away on the main road is Alvisha Housing Society by the same builder, located opposite the Ijtema Gah where a mammoth religious congregation gathers every year. The salesman at the project office tells the correspondent that 120- and 160-sq yard residential and 200 sq yard commercial plots are available for sale in blocks A, B and C. In block C, a 120 sq yard plot costs Rs2.8m lump sum, and Rs3.6m on a 42-month installment plan.
When asked about official approvals, one of the two men present says that for the time being, the plots in block A, where the office is located, are being offered on sale to “those who have faith in the builder” and not to the general public. When asked why that is so, he admits that the “paperwork for block A is not 100 per cent complete, unlike blocks B and C.”
He lays out the society’s proposed layout plan on the desk; it lists the survey numbers (86, 87, 88 and 89) on which it is being constructed. Frontline Marketing, which is handling the project, shares with Dawn an NOC issued by LDA which also mentions the same survey numbers, 86 to 89.
However, Dawn’s GIS department has determined that these survey numbers lie quite some distance away, in the direction where the men in the sales office vaguely indicated that blocks B and C will come up. Moreover, Alvisha’s block A is actually situated on survey numbers 96 and 97. It is not known what is the reason for this discrepancy.


Maps showing the Alvisha and Al-Jannat housing schemes.

But revenue officials tell Dawn this kind of discrepancy is very common. One explains it thus: “Sometimes there are other claimants to the land; sometimes builders will use ownership of one piece of survey land to falsely claim ownership over other surveyed land, or even over unsurveyed land; another ploy is to get a fake allotment of unsurveyed land and, after possession, go to the revenue department for a survey number.”
Dawn’s letter to MAA Construction & Builders Pvt Ltd was returned. Another letter with questions to Frontline Marketing received no response either.
With around 60 projects in Karachi, GFS Builders & Developers is one of the big players in Pakistan’s real estate market. Supported by a slick marketing campaign, its numerous smooth-talking salespersons push discount offers, and district West is dotted with a number of their projects. A closer look at North Town Residency Phase-2 exposes some shocking facts.
According to an ‘NOC’ for sale and advertisement of plots in NTR phase 2 issued by the Sindh Building Control Association, the project measures 30 acres on land bearing survey numbers 363 to 367 “out of na class no 294 in deh Halkani”. The BoR map submitted to the Supreme Court in 2013 clearly shows this entire area — which falls partly in deh Halkani and partly in deh Bund Murad — as being na class (or unsurveyed/state land). The LARMIS website currently shows the same situation in deh Halkani. The map for deh Bund Murad is missing. Dawn received no response to questions it sent in writing to the GFS CEO.

(Dawn repeatedly contacted the DC West; Senior Member Board of Revenue, Sindh with a cc to the Chief Secretary, Sindh; Member, Land Utilisation, BoR; and Project Director, LARMIS to ask about the provenance of the survey numbers in connection with the aforementioned housing projects. There was no response from any of them except for LARMIS Assistant Director, Coordination, Hafeezullah Abbasi. Mr Abbasi informed Dawn over the phone that LARMIS does not possess the data in question. “We can only digitise the data that we have been provided.”)
Filthy rich
Interestingly, the above-mentioned na class number — no 294 — from which piece of land GFS representatives claim that survey numbers 363 to 367 have been carved out for its North Town Residency-Phase 2, crops up in a complaint to NAB about huge tracts of land being illegally taken over and sold. A list of suspicious sales/allotments was enclosed with the complaint, mentioning the survey/na class numbers, area and value, and ‘sellers’ and ‘purchasers’ of the land in question. According to this, 82 acres on na class numbers 284 – 294 were illegally sold/allotted to GFS.
The dubious transactions listed in the complaint to NAB involve nearly 1,500 acres, including around 1,150 acres of state land. On Oct 11, 2023, NAB wrote to DC West informing him about the complaint it had received regarding “illegal sale/ allotment of government land”, and asking him to furnish NAB with a comprehensive report by Oct 23, 2023.


Letter written by NAB to the DC West, informing him about the complaint it had received regarding “illegal sale/ allotment of government land” in the district and seeking a comprehensive report by Oct 23, 2023.

Repeated attempts to seek NAB’s official response to this complaint went unanswered. Sources told Dawn that NAB had initiated a formal enquiry based on the allegations in this complaint, but recently, 166 cases, enquiries, references and complaints relating to the departments of revenue, local government and food had been transferred to Sindh’s Anti-Corruption Establishment.
The list enclosed with the complaint to NAB lays bare how predatory networks have hollowed out governance in Sindh — like locusts stripping bare every field they descend upon. Those who acquired the land allegedly through illegal sale/allotment include a number of well-known builders and developers. And among those accused of supplying them the land — the ‘sellers’ — are Ali Hassan Brohi, an SHO and a mukhtiarkar.
The cop is Ghulam Hussain Korai, then SHO Manghopir in district West. Consider just one of the parcels of land that he, jointly with one Yousuf Brohi, is accused of grabbing: 200 acres of state land in deh Bund Murad which was, as per this document, worth an eye-watering Rs4 bn.
An SHO can be a grade 14 (sub-inspector) or grade 16 (inspector) officer, whose monthly salary is at the most Rs120,000. In December 2024, after complaints by a number of businessmen about brazen land grabbing in Karachi became too vociferous to ignore, the powers that be ordered the Sindh government to address the issue.
Inspector Korai was among five police officers who were subsequently transferred to desk jobs at the police headquarters. (A number of revenue officials were also transferred, though often replaced, say sources, with others of equally ill repute but boasting strong ties with those who matter in the provincial leadership.)
In response to Dawn’s questions, Inspector Korai described the allegations against him as “false, fabricated, and baseless … the [Association of Builders & Developers] have withdrawn their application, and the issue has been resolved accordingly.” He enclosed a letter from ABAD with his response. An excerpt from it reads: “… due to unavoidable circumstances the complainant currently displaying a lack of coordination with ABAD regarding their submitted complaints … We hereby request to withdraw the complaint against him.” Dawn was unable to confirm the nature of the “unavoidable circumstances”. Mr Korai remains without any posting. Sources say he has been sanctioned several times for misconduct.
There is on the same list one Ejaz, described as mukhtiarkar Scheme 33, who is alleged to have handed over in a fraudulent manner seven acres in Scheme 33 itself to an undisclosed builder and developer. This appears to be a reference to Aijazul Hassan Khan. Incidentally, Mr Aijaz was among 11 mukhtiarkars suspended in 2023 for land fraud.
It is difficult to overstate the cruel irony in this situation. While public land gets siphoned away by unscrupulous builders hand in glove with rapacious elements from the ruling elite and corrupt government officials, affordable public sector housing schemes almost never go beyond the blueprint.
Hawkesbay Scheme 42, Karachi’s oldest public sector project, is a stark example. This scheme was started in 1984 for the low- and middle-income segment by KDA and transferred to LDA in 1996. Over four decades later, much of it is still undeveloped and without electricity or water. Many original allottees remained unable during their lifetime to take possession of their plots, which they had paid for with their hard-earned money.
Scheme 42 even includes a block exclusively for overseas Pakistanis, but they too have nothing to show for their investment till today. And yet, those with no right to the land but plenty of clout have staked their claim to the overseas block by building a boundary wall around its perimeter, repeatedly. Each time the wall is bulldozed by the authorities, it comes up again within no time.
An illegal housing society called Aashqan-e-Mustafa has materialised along the Suparco Road which cuts through Scheme 42. Two front men of an MPA are said to be handling transactions.

When a Dawn Investigations team visits, a man strolls up, asking if they are interested in a plot and if so, to take their queries to Madina Real Estate nearby. There are 100- or 120-square yard plots available for sale here, says the realtor: “a 400-sq yard commercial plot alongside the main road costs Rs6.5m with cash payment over three months.” When asked whether the society has a lease from the development authority, he replies: “No, it’s not leased but this is part of the Gothabad Scheme, so you’ll get a sanad if you buy here.” This means the government had notified this piece of state land for a goth situated here — ostensibly in this case, Kachelo Goth. However, sanads can only be issued to the original residents of a goth. Incidentally, Kachelo Goth actually lies around 2km away.

Predictably, the Gothabad Scheme over the years has become another vehicle for corruption since it began in 1987 to provide housing to the deserving indigenous population in rural Sindh. Gothabad mukhiarkars began issuing fake sanads, even multiple sanads to one individual to enable the latter to claim title over a large area.
Mohammed Shahnawaz at the Aashqan-e-Mustafa housing society site office in fact claimed that buyers would be given backdated sanads because “sanads stopped being issued after 2012”. Dawn received no response to questions addressed in writing to the proprietors of Aashqan-e-Mustafa.
In June 2014, during Supreme Court hearings into the Karachi unrest case, BoR submitted a report stating that 59,803 acres of state land had been encroached upon. Backroom land deals are not mere irregularities — they are a fundamental breach of public trust. State land is not for the government to bestow upon whomever it favours, which is why a recent Sindh High Court judgement underscored that, in the interest of transparency, state land must be disposed of through an open auction.
Fake NOCs, no paper trail
All the housing societies investigated for this report happen to fall under LDA. Ahmed Saeed*, who is very familiar with the LDA’s workings, reveals that the Authority has in umpteen instances showed ‘na class’ land (ie unsurveyed land which cannot be allotted to anyone and on which no project can be constructed) as survey land. He alleges that everyone, including BoR, is party to the fraud.
According to him, the landgrabber writes to the Director General LDA to request an NOC for the layout plan on what they claim is their land. The DG sends the letter to the relevant DC, asking for clarification on the status of the land in question. The DC forwards it to the mukhtiarkar who takes out a report which then goes back to the DC, who forwards it to the DG confirming the land does indeed belong to the interested party.
“The official fee for approval of the layout plan is Rs1.3m per acre, and the bribe for showing na class land as survey land is Rs500,000 per acre,” says Mr Saeed. “But because the letters have been sent around by hand, not by a dispatcher, there’s no trail. LDA will say they did this on BoR’s say-so; if you ask BoR for verification, they’ll say this is state land and they never gave approval for it. You show them the correspondence — and they’ll say it’s fake, but they all know. They’re all involved.” In other words, classic smoke and mirrors.

 

At his office, a rather harried-looking DG LDA Safdar Bughio, tells Dawn: “Our planning department verifies ownership through the concerned DC office; it’s BoR that checks whether the builder has ownership or not. When they confirm ownership title, then our planning department does the technical work on it [to issue NOC for layout plan].”
LDA planning department head, Mohammed Arbab, toes a similar line: “Our mandate and function is the KBTPR [Karachi Building and Town Planning Rules]. We are only a town planning agency. The identification of the land is done by the DC, title verification is done by the DC, record of survey numbers is with the DC.”
However, Mr Bughio concedes there are some illegal housing societies. “It is also our responsibility to stop them. We do stop them, but officially we deal only with those who come for [layout plan] NOCs from us. But definitely I will soon start a programme in which we will take on the responsibility of dealing with them.”
As for Mr Arbab, when pressed further on the issue, he says: “Qabzay bhi wohi log kartay hain … na class land pay jin kay hukoomati links hotay hain.” (Encroachment on state land is done by those who have government connections.)
Other cogs in the wheel
There are nevertheless some public servants who try to discharge their duty with at least a degree of integrity. In instances where the mukhtiarkar concerned takes action and issues a notice to a suspected land grabber, the latter can approach the anti-encroachment tribunal. The Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010, empowers anti-encroachment tribunals headed by a retired district and sessions judge or an advocate of 10 years’ standing to determine the rights of the parties involved.
Too often, though, the only anti-encroachment tribunal in Karachi has given questionable decisions. In fact, several sources told Dawn that encroachers go to the tribunal with fake/ forged documents to establish title to the land they have grabbed by obtaining a stay order. “It’s simple,” says Umair Rafiq*, a senior bureaucrat. “Go meet the court reader, file an application quickly and get a stay. Then anyone who visits that land becomes guilty of contempt. You just pay one or two million rupees for this.”
Dawn has in its possession the copy of an order in suit no 15/ 2024, issued on July 23, 2024, by Muneer Bhutto, district and sessions judge and, until recently, presiding officer of the anti-encroachment tribunal. The plaintiff is Al-Faiz Builders Pvt Ltd while the defendants include officials from BoR, SBCA, LDA, anti-encroachment police personnel, etc.

 

In his interim order, the presiding offer restrained “the defendants, their agents and anyone on their behalf from eject[ting], evict[ing], dispossess[ing] the plaintiff from the suit property ie 32 acres land na class No 42 situated at Deh Methan, tapo Manghopir, district Keamari”.
Interestingly, the same presiding officer (now heading the Karachi Water & Sewerage Tribunal) was the focus of a complaint made earlier that year. In a letter dated Jan 30, 2024, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the DC East wrote to the Sindh High Court Registrar, the Member Inspection Team-II (a body that handles complaints against judicial officers in the district and lower courts), requesting further action on a complaint against Mr Bhutto that had been forwarded to him by the assistant commissioner East. With his letter, he enclosed a report submitted by a mukhtiarkar of Karachi East, Muhammad Irfan Lashari.
Mr Lashari in his complaint alleged that the presiding officer had granted a stay to land grabbers on 500 sq yards of state land at Fateh Mohammed Gabol Goth that had been reserved by the Sindh government for a dispensary for the local residents. In fact, he said in his report, possession had already been given to the health department representative with documentation to the effect. According to him, through the stay order, a contempt of court notice against him and letter of suspension, he was “pressurised to follow the unlawful order passed by the presiding officer of the tribunal. … The stay orders … not only provide cover to the land grabbers but also encourage them to usurp more state land in connivance with support of presiding officer of the said tribunal and his staff…”
Nothing came of this complaint. In fact, sources said that a “fake case” had been filed against the DC concerned, his properties were attached and he was declared an absconder.
(On Oct 15, 2025, in a development unrelated to Mr Lashari’s complaint, Muneer Bhutto was found guilty of misconduct after an enquiry by MIT member Justice Muhammad Faisal Kamal Alam of the Sindh High Court that began in 2021. Concluding that Mr Bhutto had “misused” his “senior official position”, the MIT imposed on him “the minor penalty of withholding of annual increment for a period of three years”.)
Despite repeated attempts, Mr Bhutto refused to receive Dawn’s letter with questions regarding the above allegations.
Nothing oils the wheels of elite capture like a corrupt bureaucracy. Seasoned bureaucrats hold that officers were generally appointed on merit in Benazir Bhutto’s time, but this changed after her assassination in December 2007. “As soon as PPP’s victory in the 2008 election seemed assured, officers began to get calls from the PPP leadership telling them to refrain from recruitment and from making any appointments,” says Rashid Saleem*, a retired assistant commissioner. “As soon as they came in, they began to recruit their own people.”
The passage of the 18th Amendment, say old-school bureaucrats, removed the guardrails entirely. “The 2012 recruits were rapidly promoted and are now in grade 19. Soon they’ll be in grade 20, secretary level. God help Sindh when that happens,” says Mr Saleem.

 

According to several senior civil servants, the Sindh Public Service Commission’s (SPSC) examination process has become seriously compromised, with ‘favoured’ candidates awarded inflated scores in the oral segment while deserving candidates are failed despite strong written performances. Each recruitment, appointment and promotion has a price, they claim.
Journalist Imdad Soomro has extensively investigated corruption in the SPSC. “To get recruited into a department, one has to pay between Rs5m to Rs10m,” he alleges. At the other end of the spectrum are the top posts, such as assistant commissioner, excise and taxation officer, DSP, mukhtiarkar, etc for which candidates must sit the Combined Competitive Examination or CCE. The ‘rates’ are higher for such “kamanay walay [lucrative] posts” as Mr Soomro puts it. According to him, to become AC or ETO, one must pay Rs80m; appointment as mukhtiarkar entails a bribe of Rs40m.
According to a retired official, “There’s an exam called the revenue qualifier exam for clerical staff who have served three years in the Revenue Department. Clerks have paid Rs15m to Rs20m to become assistant mukhtiarkar. Close to 30 clerks have become assistant mukhtiarkars in this manner.”
Often, all it takes for career advancement is to cultivate a mutually beneficial relationship with a political patron. Dawn was told that in one land development authority, an individual on a contingency contract as a watchman was now a grade-19 officer on an extremely important post.
The great Karachi land grab
Real estate in Karachi has been the cause of much disorder and violence. The final JIT report looking into the murder on March 13, 2013 of Perween Rahman, director of the Orangi Pilot Project, offered a revealing commentary.

 

Referring to the period between 2006-2012, and the ethnic conflict between Pashtuns and Mohajirs, it noted that cadres of both MQM and ANP were heavily involved in various criminal activities, especially land grabbing, as were the Taliban who were a potent militant force in Karachi at the time. “… whatever their stated political differences, all three groups worked hand in glove … Big developers … would ally themselves with these groups, using the militant wings of these groups as their ‘muscle’, in order to forcibly seize land. Anyone who came in their way was either threatened, or if they refused to back off, killed. …[O]ften murders that were declared as being politically motivated or acts of terrorism, were in actual fact land disputes that were made to look like political killings to cover up the real facts. The state apparatus, in the shape of the land revenue administration or the police, was either too weak, or complicit in the face of the great Karachi land grab.”
It was against this backdrop that the then Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in 2012 while hearing the Karachi ‘badamni’ (unrest) case, banned the Sindh government from effecting mutation, allotment, or transfer of any government land in Sindh until the province’s land record — huge amounts of which was destroyed in the rioting following the murder of Benazir Bhutto — was digitised. (The court conditionally lifted the ban in 2019 in instances where the record had been computerised.)
But the ban meant little in the areas of Karachi where state land was plentiful.
During retired Justice Maqbool Baqar’s tenure as chief minister Sindh in the runup to the 2024 election, an enquiry was held into allotments and mutations made by BoR Sindh between 2012 and 2023. That is, after the Supreme Court ban. Some of the findings are as follows.
In Manghopir, district West, there were forged entries and fake allotments in land record; an incident of arson was committed in 2021 by revenue officials, including mukhtiarkars and tapedars, “to deliberately destroy fake entries kept by the revenue officials in collusion with private beneficiaries”.
In deh Bund Murad, also district West, the enquiry found that “Government land worth billions of rupees in various na class … was illegally transferred to private individuals… .” Numerous revenue officials were named as being complicit and acquiring assets beyond their means. None of them appears to have been prosecuted.
According to the 2018 JIT report on money laundering worth billions of rupees through fake bank accounts, 562 acres of state land in Sindh, including 363 acres of Pakistan Steel Mill land, were “illegally allotted to private builders causing a loss of Rs4.14 billion to the national exchequer”. The report also alleged that Bahria Town Ltd had remitted Rs10bn into the fake accounts as kickbacks for grabbing thousands of acres of state as well as private lands for its projects in Karachi.
In 2023, a member of Sindh’s caretaker cabinet told Dawn: “[During the previous government,] the sub registrars and mukhtiarkars in Karachi would collect 600 to 700 million rupees per month for ‘upward’ distribution. They had a free hand. Even if someone’s land was legal, they would still charge according to the ‘system’ at the rate they had set, eg Korangi, Rs300,000 per acre. By transferring mukhtiarkars, we disrupted that system of collection.”
Under the caretaker setup, per one government official, security agencies were said to have taken up the task of ‘cleaning the system’. Officials were assured that “qabzas will not happen like before”. A number of people were even put on the ECL, unofficially if not officially. But despite those claims, rather little has changed in the way that real estate is occupied in the city. The faces may be different, but the practices remain the same.
Thus, individuals like Mr Brohi have even greater sway than before; they are fixtures in the corridors of power, protected by their formidable patrons. According to a bureaucrat, “Even DIGs, senior government officials will go out of their way to maintain good relations with them.”
Perhaps that is why Fayyaz Solangi, the former DC West who placed that damning notice in the newspapers against Mr Brohi back in 2020, put in another notice on July 8, 2025 — five years later — in Urdu, English and Sindhi newspapers containing a grovelling apology, and stating that an enquiry had not established allegations of land grabbing against him. An excerpt from the notice reads “…I had already apologized to him in person and directed my staff to issue corrigendum to this effect but unfortunately the same [was] not published on a timely basis and I was transferred…”


Former DC West Fayyaz Solangi’s public apology to Mr Brohi published in Dawn on July 8, 2025.

That shameful apology was a step too far, even for a severely compromised bureaucracy. Two days later, the former DC West swiftly found himself reduced to officer on special duty by the chief secretary Sindh. Mr Solangi did not respond to Dawn’s repeated requests for comment.
As for Jibrail Khan, the JUI-F local leader who ran afoul of certain political bigwigs, the intercession of his party leadership appears to have magically made the FIRs against him melt into thin air. Even though he has yet to obtain bail in all the cases, he is out of prison. The ‘system’ knows when compromise is a better closing gambit.

False statements attributed to political leaders are seeking to provoke outrage, while unrelated images are being used to create the illusion of foreign backing or geopolitical tension.
At the same time, AI‑generated visuals are being deployed to frame political figures in staged scenarios, including fabricated meetings and conspiracy theories.
Experts have warned that these tactics may fuel partisan hostility and shape public opinion ahead of the February election, as many voters are exposed to fake news.
Dr Din M Sumon Rahman, Head of Media Studies and Journalism at the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB), said, “The main intention behind a disinformation campaign is to manipulate voting choice. Disinformation neatly feeds the confirmation bias of a decided voter’s choice.”
The key target of disinformation are swing voters, he said.
“Voters who don’t know whom to vote for, don’t have a strong opinion, are provided with disinformation that influences them to vote for a certain political party. In this process, they use religion, violence and many other aspects for provocation,” added Sumon, also founding editor of fact-checking organisation FactWatch.In one-month from mid-December 2025 to mid-January 2026, The Daily Star documented 220 cases of disinformation circulated by various party-aligned actors.
Entities that appear to support Jamaat-i-Islami top the list, with half of the documented instances of disinformation (96) coming from them within this limited dataset. The Awami League-aligned groups follow with 78, and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-aligned actors 38.
Together, these 220 posts received over 2 million engagements (likes, comments, and shares) within the first 24 hours after they were published, showing how fast such content can reach voters.
Jamaat-aligned entities dominate the engagement share, accounting for more than 1.8 million interactions (90.68 per cent). The AL and the BNP-aligned actors trail far behind with 5.13pc and 3.57pc of the total engagement, respectively.
Targeting rivals
Data show that disinformation in the election season is not random noise but a deliberate tactic aimed at political rivals.
Findings show the Jamaat‑aligned entities directed four of every five (78pc) pieces of disinformation at the BNP, once an ally but now the main political rival. These posts aggressively framed BNP and its leadership as extortionists and criminals, attempting to position Jamaat as the morally superior alternative.
For example, Uttorbongo Television, which released an AI video featuring a staged interview with an elephant handler who falsely claimed the BNP was the “real extortionist.”
BNP‑aligned actors countered in equal measures, targeting Jamaat with 80pc of their disinformation campaign.
These contents frequently questioned Jamaat’s Islamic credentials and portrayed the party as a threat to the Hindus.

Meanwhile, pro‑Awami League entities mostly targeted the interim government and student coordinators. Examples include a widely shared claim that Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus was plotting a civil war.

Across the political divides, defamation was the dominant weapon. Of the 220 pieces of documented disinformation, 155 were categorised as defamatory. Nearly 90pc of all defamatory content spread by Jamaat-aligned entities targeted the BNP, while almost all defamatory content from BNP-aligned actors focused on Jamaat.
Both sides accused each other of criminality.
On December 21, 2025, a high‑engagement post falsely alleged that BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and his brother ran a multimillion‑taka scheme to smuggle Awami League leaders across the border. But there was no evidence provided against the claim.
Jamaat‑aligned actors also promoted conspiracy narratives, saying the BNP is willing to compromise national interests for Indian favour, including a fabricated story that Tarique Rahman had agreed not to purchase weapons without India’s permission.
BNP‑aligned pages attacked with their own “moral‑corruption” narratives, including a fabricated post accusing Chhatra Shibir activists of partying and drinking after inciting nationwide unrest over Osman Hadi’s killing.
Pro‑Awami League actors, meanwhile, focused on undermining student coordinators, Jamaat, and the interim government. One post falsely claimed that student coordinators attended a DJ party after Osman Hadi’s funeral.
Tactics employed
Nearly 59pc of the analysed posts were manipulative content, which twisted truth into a false narrative.
For example, on January 5, 2026, BNP‑aligned political analyst Maruf Mallick made one such post, distorting the findings of the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. Although the official report stated that most individuals still missing were from the BNP, Maruf reframed this to allege a “secret understanding” between the Awami League and Jamaat‑Shibir, claiming detainees linked to Jamaat had been quietly released.
This pattern was widespread. Of the 62 manipulative posts pushed by Jamaat-aligned entities, 48 targeted the BNP, while pro‑BNP actors produced 18 such posts, almost all aimed at Jamaat.

Beyond outright fabrication, political actors also distorted facts by presenting information out of context. Unlike fabrication, which relies on complete falsehoods, decontextualisation manipulates authentic information to construct a misleading narrative.

Among the content analysed, 27 posts fell into this category, where real statements or events were reframed to serve partisan agendas. For example, one video post claimed to show a scene where a BNP leader harassed a freedom fighter. However, the video appears to show someone asking another person to change his seat.
Entities that appear to support the Awami League mostly pushed narratives of minority persecution, exaggerating isolated incidents into claims of widespread violence, and invoking calls for foreign intervention.
Medium used
While videos remain the dominant vehicle for disinformation, recent patterns show the growing popularity of photocards. Of the 220 disinformation items analysed, 104 were videos and 44 photocards.
Roughly one‑third of the disinformation posts relied on forged documents or fabricated quotes, with 75 such instances identified. These were split evenly between pro‑Jamaat and pro‑Awami League pages and users.

Deepfakes and other AI‑generated content formed the second most common category, totalling 58 documented cases.

Pro‑Jamaat entities produced the highest number in this category with 27 instances, followed by pro‑BNP actors with 17, and pro‑Awami League entities with 14.
Methodology
The 220 posts analysed were collected by monitoring a watchlist of 615 Facebook pages and profiles known for spreading disinformation and hate speech. The watchlist was compiled through a rigorous, political party-blind selection process involving manual monitoring, targeted keyword searches, and cross-referencing with independent fact-checking resources.
Political alignment was assessed by manually reviewing the most recent 30 posts of each actor before data collection began in mid-December. No official party links were examined.
In the watchlist, 27.4pc appeared AL-aligned, 25.57pc Jamaat-aligned and 14.5 BNP-aligned. The others included National Citizen Party, meme pages, unaffiliated content creators and other foreign entities.

Addressing FC headquarters during her visit to Balochistan on Tuesday, she paid tribute to those serving in Balochistan under difficult and dangerous circumstances.
In her speech, which was aired on Wednesday, Maryam shared that she found out a few months ago that the FC required Rs10 billion for “capacity building”.
“I was asked to contribute whatever Punjab could,” she stated. “I decided it was not a favour … it was a responsibility. I said we will provide them the entire Rs10bn.”
The chief minister highlighted that the allocation aimed to enhance operational readiness and strengthen security efforts in Balochistan, particularly in light of recent threats and attacks.
CM Maryam’s visit came in the wake of a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days. Security forces had responded by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in the province.
During her speech, Maryam expressed deep concern for the safety of security personnel and acknowledged the sacrifices being made daily to defend the country.
“I worry about your safety because you are fighting for me, for the nation, and for this country … and you are sacrificing your lives,” she told the FC gathering.
“Despite the challenges you are facing here, fighting for your people, I salute your bravery from the depths of my heart,” she said.
“On behalf of Nawaz Sharif, who has special love for Balochistan, and on behalf of the people of Punjab, I not only thank you but salute you. Balochistan is not alone — Punjab stands with Balochistan at every moment.”
‘Whoever weakens Pakistan is worst enemy, whether external or internal’
The Punjab CM also issued a stern warning against forces attempting to destabilise the country.
Maryam stressed that there should be no “grey area” in the people’s or the political leadership’s minds, calling for an “indiscriminate decision”.
“Whoever weakens Pakistan is not a friend but the worst enemy, whether external or internal,” she declared.
Highlighting the evolving nature of threats, she stressed that the country was facing not only conventional terrorism but also “fifth-generation warfare” and psychological operations aimed at attacking the nation’s unity and mindset.
“It’s not just physical warfare that we are facing. We are facing fifth-generation warfare, which is psychological warfare. They have come with great preparation and attacked our minds,” Maryam said.
Calling for political honesty and clarity, she emphasised the importance of acknowledging past realities in the fight against terrorism.
Recalling the Islamabad incident, the Punjab CM stated that even places of worship were not spared.
“Until some of our leaders keep calling terrorists ‘our brothers’ — [which happened] from 2018 to 2022 — […] I am not saying anything political, but this is a decision that the nation must make,” she added.
“The day the Islamabad attack happened, I immediately posted on my Twitter account that we ought to make a tough decision as a nation, which is that we must call black if it is black, and white if it is white; there is no grey area in our minds,” Maryam said.
She stressed that such elements must be dealt with firmly and without ambiguity.
“If such people remain in Pakistan under the cloak of political parties and leaders, our soldiers will continue to be martyred,” she contended.
She added, “Our country would remain in conflict […] if it would be said ‘terrorists are our brothers; not only open the doors for them but also open their offices here’. […] There must be clarity.”</p><small>2026-02-11 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1112074298530b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972504/10-dead-after-shooter-opens-fire-at-high-school-in-canada' target='_blank'><strong>10 dead after shooter opens fire at high school in Canada</strong></a><br><p>Ten people including the shooter are dead after an assailant opened fire at a high school in western Canada on Tuesday in one of the country’s deadliest mass casualty events in recent history.
The outburst brought to Canada the type of mass shooting more common in the neighbouring United States, and was carried out by a shooter described as female, police said.
Six people were found dead inside a high school in the town of Tumbler Ridge in British Columbia, two more people were found dead at a residence believed to be connected to the incident, and another person died on the way to hospital, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said.
At least two other people were hospitalised with serious or life-threatening injuries, and as many as 25 people were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said.
A suspected shooter was also found dead from what appears to be a self-inflicted injury, police said, adding they did not believe there were any more suspects or an ongoing threat to the public.
“It’s hard to know what to say on a night like tonight. It’s the kind of thing that feels like it happens in other places and not close to home,” British Columbia Premier David Eby told reporters.
Police released almost no details about the shooter except to say the person was described as a female — potentially an unusual development as mass shootings in North America are almost always carried out by men.
A police active shooter alert said the suspect was described “as female in a dress with brown hair.”
Police Superintendent Ken Floyd later confirmed at a news conference that the suspect described in the alert was the same person found dead in the school. Police did not say how many of the victims may have been minors.
Tumbler Ridge student Darian Quist told the public broadcaster CBC that he was in his mechanics class when there was an announcement that the school was in lockdown.
He said that initially he “didn’t think anything was going on,” but started receiving “disturbing” photos about the carnage at the school.
Then “it set in what was happening”, Quist said.
He said he stayed in lockdown for more than two hours when police stormed in, ordering everyone to put their hands up before escorting them out of the school.
Darian’s mother Shelley Quist, also interviewed, said she embraced her son when they finally connected after the site was declared safe.
“He’s not going to be out of my sight for a while now,” she told the CBC.
‘Tight-knit community’
Tumbler Ridge is a remote municipality with a population of around 2,400 people in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in northern British Columbia, approximately 1,155 km (717 miles) northeast of Vancouver.
Images of the town show a snow-covered landscape filled with pine trees.
Tumbler Ridge Secondary School has 160 students in grades seven through 12, roughly ages 12 to 18, according to its website.
The school was closed for the rest of the week and counselling will be made available to those in need, school officials said.
Officials said the town’s small police force was on the scene within two minutes of receiving a call, and that victims were still being assessed hours after the incident.
“This is a small, tight-knit community with a small RCMP detachment as well, who responded in two minutes, no doubt saving lives today,” Nina Krieger, British Columbia’s public safety minister, told reporters.
‘Horrific violence’
In response to the shooting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney postponed a planned announcement in Halifax on Wednesday for a new Defence Industrial Strategy and subsequent trip to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, a spokesperson said.
“I am devastated by todays horrific shootings in Tumbler Ridge, B.C. My prayers and deepest condolences are with the families and friends who have lost loved ones to these horrific acts of violence,” Carney said on X.







British Columbia Premier David Eby called the violence “unimaginable”.
The shooting ranks among the deadliest in Canadian history.
In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a gas station about 90 km (60 miles) from the site of his first killings.

Terrorists launched a late-night assault on the Khonia Khel Police Post in the district’s Wazir sub-division with heavy weapons, intending to seize control of the facility.
A large number of attackers attempted to surround the police post, however, police personnel deployed at the installation were alert and responded to the threat promptly.
The effective response by the law enforcers forced the militants to retreat.
On the directives of RPO Bannu Sajjad Khan and DPO Bannu Yasir Afridi, additional police contingents, along with Quick Response Force (QRF) and Rapid Response Force (RRF) units, were immediately dispatched to the scene, compelling the militants to flee.
According to a press release issued by the police, three terrorists were killed and nine others were injured during the operation, dealing a significant blow to their network.
One of the slain militants was identified as terrorist commander Umar Azam alias Khizmeti, while another was identified as Shahidullah. The identification process of the third militant is underway.
During the exchange of fire, one police officer sustained minor injuries but is reported to be out of danger.
Police further stated that, in an apparent attempt to avenge the killing of their associates, militants also tried to attack Ahmadzai Police Station and Fateh Khel Police Post last night. However, both attempts were thwarted, and the attackers fled the scene.
RPO Bannu Sajjad Khan praised the bravery and professionalism of the police personnel and announced commendation certificates and cash rewards for the officers involved.
He reiterated that operations against anti-state elements will continue without discrimination.
Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security forces coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.
Violence in Bannu has included attacks on police and jirga members, prompting targeted operations by police and security forces in various localities to disrupt militant networks.</p><small>2026-02-11 08:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/111234380f2b190.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972516/gold-silver-climb-as-us-yields-fall-on-softer-retail-sales' target='_blank'><strong>Gold, silver climb as US yields fall on softer retail sales</strong></a><br><p>Gold and silver prices rose on Wednesday as US Treasury bond yields fell after data showed December retail sales growth stalled, signalling a softening economy ahead of key jobs data.
Lower US yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding non‑yielding assets such as gold, and they often accompany macroeconomic shifts, like expectations of slower growth or looser policy, that tend to support precious metals.
Spot gold was 0.7 per cent higher at $5,057.23 per ounce by 04:23 GMT.
US gold futures for April delivery gained 1pc to $5,081.40 per ounce.
Spot silver was up 2.3pc at $82.56/oz, after falling more than 3pc in the previous session.
“Over the last couple of weeks, (precious metals) became very dislocated from fundamentals, so it pretty much decoupled from interest rate policy. Yields being lower are obviously supportive of gold today,” said Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com.
US yields fell on Tuesday after a raft of data suggested the economy may be softening, giving the US Federal Reserve more room to cut interest rates.
US retail sales were unchanged in December as households scaled back spending on motor vehicles and other big-ticket items, potentially setting consumer spending and the economy on a slower growth path.
“After soft retail sales numbers, there’s the expectation that perhaps, further and deeper rate cuts may be needed more imminently than previously thought,” Rodda added.
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Beth Hammack, however, said on Tuesday that the US central bank faces no urgency to change the setting of interest rates this year amid a “cautiously optimistic” outlook for economic activity.
Investors expect at least two 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2026, with the first one expected in June. Non-yielding bullion tends to do well in low-interest-rate environments.
Investors await the non-farm payrolls report for January, due later in the day, and inflation data on Friday for more cues on the Fed’s monetary policy path.

The latest remarks by the US president came during an interview with Fox Business, which was aired on Wednesday.
The host was praising Trump’s “reciprocity policy” in trade and using tariffs for that when the US president chimed in: “And that’s being very nice and gentle. Look, I settled eight wars. Out of the eight wars, at least six were settled because of tariffs.”
Trump then explained: “In other words, I said, ‘if you don’t settle this war, I’m gonna charge you tariffs because I don’t wanna see people getting killed.’ And they said, ‘no, what does this have to do with it?’ I said, ‘you’re gonna be charged.’”
“Like India and Pakistan would’ve been a nuclear war in my opinion. They were really going at it. Ten planes were shot down. They were going at it,” he added.
Over the past 10 months, the US president has stated numerous times that aircraft were shot down during the conflict — albeit without specifying whose.
Initially stating that five jets were shot down, Trump gradually raised that number to seven in October, and then eight in November.

  @dawn.today US President Donald Trump said that a conflict between India and Pakistan “would have been a nuclear war” and suggested the two countries “were really going at it.” In remarks during an interview with Fox News, Trump claimed that “ten planes were shot down” during the confrontation and said he believed the situation could have escalated to nuclear conflict “without tariffs.” DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com   

During the interview, Trump quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as praising him for “saving at least 10 million lives when he got us to stop fighting”.
“Because, see, they were going to nuclear, in my opinion. Without tariffs, that (ceasefire) wouldn’t have happened,” the US president asserted.
He also recalled Armenia and Azerbaijan’s decades-long conflict, which saw tensions reduce when Trump brokered an initial peace agreement in August 2025.
During the interview, Trump also termed “every single” US president during the last 50 years as “bad on trade”.
“But I’m not bad on trade. I’m real good on trade,” he boasted.
US ties with Pakistan, India
During his Oval Office meeting with Trump in September 2025, PM Shehbaz had thanked the US president for his role in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in their four-day military conflict in May 2025.
Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared in April 2025 when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was, without evidence, blamed on Islamabad, which strongly refuted the allegations.
The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in May with the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries.

 

He has also praised Chief of the Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on several occasions, calling him a “highly respected general”, a “great fighter” and “my favourite”.
India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.
After what some saw as strained relations between the US and India after failed talks, Trump earlier this month announced a “trade deal” with New Delhi.
Days later, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also made a three-day official visit to the US, where he held talks with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><small>2026-02-11 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/111229198934664.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972514/indian-cricketer-abhishek-sharma-hospitalised-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-game-with-namibia' target='_blank'><strong>Indian cricketer Abhishek Sharma hospitalised ahead of T20 World Cup game with Namibia</strong></a><br><p>Prolific Indian opener Abhishek Sharma has been hospitalised with an upset stomach ahead of the group match against Namibia at the T20 World Cup, a cricket board official said on Wednesday.
The explosive left-hander is key to India’s chances of defending their title at the 20-team tournament and is doubtful for the Group A fixture on Thursday in New Delhi.
The 25-year-old was admitted to a Delhi hospital on Tuesday after he missed training with a stomach issue he carried from the opener in Mumbai, the official told AFP on condition of anonymity.
India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate acknowledged the concern on Tuesday, saying the batsman had “still got a few issues with his tummy”.
“We hope that he’ll be available for the game in a few days’ time.”
Abhishek was out for a duck in India’s win over the United States but has been a strong performer in the lead-up to the tournament.

 

India play arch-rivals Pakistan in a blockbuster on Sunday.
On Monday, the Pakistani government announced it was withdrawing its decision to boycott the match with India, which had been taken previously in the wake of Bangladesh’s replacement by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India.
Pakistan’s decision to move forward with the much-anticipated game came after protracted negotiations between the ICC and the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, consultations among national leaders, and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.</p><small>2026-02-11 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/11115029e11e73e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972510/us-trade-office-removes-controversial-map-of-india-from-social-media-after-pakistan-protests' target='_blank'><strong>US trade office removes controversial map of India from social media after Pakistan protests</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: The United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) office has removed a controversial map of India from its official X (formerly Twitter) account after Pakistan lodged a strong diplomatic protest over the depiction of internationally-recognised disputed territories as part of India, diplomatic sources told Dawn on Wednesday.
The map, which accompanied a USTR press release announcing a framework for an interim US-India trade agreement, showed the entire Jammu and Kashmir region — including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan — within Indian boundaries. It also depicted China’s Aksai Chin region as part of India, despite the fact that the area is claimed by China and remains disputed.
It was posted on the site on Friday evening, but had been removed by Monday evening, which was also the first working day after the weekend.
Diplomatic sources said Pakistan conveyed its protest both to the US Embassy in Islamabad and to State Department officials in Washington, stressing that the map contradicted the long-standing and stated US position that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory whose final status must be determined in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.
Officials familiar with the matter said the map appeared to have been taken from Google Maps, as was the case with a separate map used by the USTR in a press release on a trade deal with Bangladesh.
The maps merely showed territorial outlines and did not name any specific areas. However, Pakistani officials pointed out that even an outline map, when issued by an official US government body, carries political and diplomatic weight — particularly on an issue as sensitive as Kashmir.
The concern was heightened after Indian media outlets seized upon the map as evidence of an alleged shift in US policy, portraying it as an implicit endorsement of India’s claims over disputed territories.
Pakistani officials said this narrative made it imperative for Islamabad to immediately remind Washington of its traditional and consistent position on Kashmir, and to ensure that no such misinterpretation gained traction.
Although the USTR press release remains available on its website and social media platforms, the specific map of India has since been withdrawn.
By contrast, the map attached to the USTR’s press release on a trade arrangement with Bangladesh remains online, reinforcing the view that the India map was posted mistakenly.
The controversy emerged as Washington and New Delhi announced, over the weekend, a framework for the first phase of a bilateral trade agreement aimed at boosting two-way commerce.
According to a joint statement, the US will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, having already removed an additional 25pc punitive duty. Reciprocal tariffs are also expected to be lowered to similar levels.
Pakistani officials said the protest was unavoidable, particularly in light of India’s unilateral actions of August 2019, when New Delhi revoked the special status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir — a move Pakistan rejects as illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of international law.
Islamabad maintains that any official depiction suggesting Indian sovereignty over the disputed region undermines the UN-recognised status of the territory and weakens international commitments to neutrality.
The inclusion of Aksai Chin within Indian territory further compounded concerns, as it misrepresented another unresolved territorial dispute and ran counter to Washington’s stated position of not taking sides in conflicts between India and China.
US officials have not publicly commented on the removal of the map. Pakistani diplomats say the episode highlights the need for constant vigilance, as even seemingly technical or symbolic representations by influential international actors can have serious diplomatic consequences on an issue as sensitive and consequential as Kashmir.</p><small>2026-02-11 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/11110208b63afe3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972505/local-pml-n-leaders-residence-attacked-in-bajaur' target='_blank'><strong>Local PML-N leader’s residence attacked in Bajaur</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Unidentified assailants attacked the house of a local PML-N leader, Nawabzada Waheeduddin Khan, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district late on Tuesday night, damaging the main gate, police and party sources said.
The bombing occurred at around 1:30am at Waheed’s residence in the Haji Lawang area on the outskirts of Khar tehsil.
According to preliminary investigations, the attack was carried out with hand grenades allegedly thrown by unknown assailants.
A senior police official told Dawn that a team from a nearby police post was immediately dispatched to the area to search for the attackers.
He added that an investigation was underway to determine the motive behind the attack and identify those responsible. No group had claimed responsibility for the incident at the time this report was filed.
In a post on his official Facebook page, PML-N provincial senior vice-president Shahabuddin Khan strongly condemned the attack on the house of his brother and party leader.
“Thanks to Allah that no loss of life was reported in the attack,” he wrote, urging the federal government, police, and other law enforcement agencies to conduct an immediate inquiry and bring the perpetrators to justice. He said such cowardly acts would not weaken their resolve.
Waheed, a member of the notable Nawab of Khar family, was not at home at the time of the attack and is currently in Peshawar. Expressing concern over the incident in a social media post, he said his family members were safe.</p><small>2026-02-11 06:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/110944189c3fb85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972368/traffic-courts-to-be-established-in-sindh-for-swift-disposal-of-e-challan-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Traffic courts to be established in Sindh for swift disposal of e-challan cases</strong></a><br><p>• Sindh cabinet approves plan to designate existing consumer courts as traffic courts in every district• Murad asks Karachi mayor, transport and LG ministers to review proposal to use 18 acres of former Aladdin Park for Red Line bus depot
KARACHI: The Sindh cabinet has decided to set up special traffic courts across the province by empowering existing consumer courts to deal with cases pertaining to traffic violations under the new e-challan system.
The cabinet meeting, chaired by Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, discussed the issue and approved the designation of consumer courts as traffic courts.
However, the decision was subject to the approval of the Sindh High Court.
According to a press statement, the CM told his cabinet members that after consultation with the Sindh High Court chief justice, the “jurisdiction of Traffic Courts will be conferred upon existing Consumer Courts in every district”.
He was of the view that the decision would allow specialised and rapid trial of traffic-related offences without the immediate need for constructing new judicial infrastructure.
Bus depot at former Aladdin Park land
To reduce project costs and expedite construction, the cabinet deliberated on a critical issue pertaining to “land-use change” for the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line project.
The cabinet was requested to approve the utilisation of 18 acres of the former Alladin Park for an at-grade bus depot.
Officials briefed the meeting that by shifting from a previously proposed underground facility to an at-grade depot, the project will save approximately Rs4 billion and reduce construction time.
The CM directed the transport and local government ministers and Karachi mayor to sit together and decide the matter in the interest of the city.
The meeting also reviewed progress on the project’s corridor road works, noting that K-Electric is expected to complete all utility relocations by the end of February.
The cabinet was informed that major sections like the Mosamiyat flyover and an underpass at Numaish would be completed by next month.
Digital property registration for overseas Pakistanis
To facilitate the Pakistani diaspora, the Board of Revenue presented before the cabinet the Sindh Registration (Amendment) Bill, 2025.
Under the proposed amendment, Sindh is set to scale up online sale deed executions at Pakistani missions and embassies. The amendment to Section 38 of the Sindh Registration Act, 1908, will exempt overseas Pakistanis from physical appearance at registration offices.
Verification will be conducted via an integrated e-Registration system, allowing for thumb impressions and facial recognition at any sub-registrar office or People’s Service Centre, regardless of jurisdiction.
The cabinet also reviewed and approved the transition of the provincial e-stamping system from the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) to the Sindh Information Technology Company (SITC).
A five-year Master Service Agreement with SITC was proposed at a service charge of Rs7 million per month, featuring a 10 per cent annual escalation. Future upgrades by SITC will include a mobile application, paperless stamp duty, linking issuance with CNICs, and two-factor authentication.
The system will be integrated with major entities, including DHA, CDC, and insurance companies, to streamline provincial revenue collection.
‘Protected forests’
To combat climate change and meet global environmental obligations, the Forest and Wildlife Department sought cabinet’s approval for a massive expansion of protected areas.
After a thorough discussion, the cabinet declared 163,902 hectares (405,002 acres) of intertidal land in Sujawal district as “Protected Forests”.
The CM said these areas serve as a natural shield against cyclones and tidal waves while storing “blue carbon” at rates three to five times higher than tropical rainforests.
While global standards suggest a 25pc forest cover threshold, only 10pc of Sindh is currently declared as a reserved or protected forest.
This move will significantly add to the 566,298 hectares already protected in the Indus Delta, the CM said.

Headed by FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, a three-judge bench, also comprising Justice Ali Baqar Najafi and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah, took up a set of appeals filed by the federal government.
The appeals challenge the IHC’s initiation of contempt proceedings against government officials and seek to overturn the May 16, 2025 order allowing amendments to an already settled petition relating to Dr Aafia Siddiqui, nearly a decade after its disposal.
Additional Attorney General Rashid Hafeez represented the government, while Advocate Imran Shafeeq appeared on behalf of Dr Fowzia, to whom the court also issued notice.

FCC takes up govt appeal challenging ‘judicial overreach’ and its foreign policy implications

Earlier, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan of the IHC had put the PM and the entire federal government on notice, seeking an explanation from the cabinet for not supporting Dr Fowzia’s legal efforts in the US.
In its appeal, the government argued that the IHC’s direction permitting amendments to the pleadings amounted to judicial overreach and undermined the finality of concluded litigation.
It maintained that reopening a settled matter after such a long lapse violated settled principles of law.
Dr Aafia was convicted by the US district court for the southern district of New York .
Her sister Dr Fowzia had approached the IHC expressing concern for Dr Aafia’s life, safety, and physical and mental wellbeing, citing a lack of consistent and reliable updates about her condition in custody.
The government contended that by allowing the amendments, the high court failed to consider the serious legal and foreign policy implications of the revised relief sought, which, it said, squarely fell within the exclusive domain of the executive and engaged Pakistan’s obligations under international law.
It asserted that the respondent sought the amendments with mala fide intent, describing the move as a counterblast aimed solely at keeping the petition alive.

 

In the amended petition, Dr Fowzia sought a declaration that the government had constitutional and international law obligations to take all necessary measures for Dr Aafia’s release and repatriation.
The appeal stated that these concerns had already been addressed, noting that in October 2024 the PM had written a formal letter to the US president in support of Dr Aafia’s clemency petition. This was followed by the dispatch of a high-level state delegation. The government also made efforts to negotiate bilateral and multilateral treaties for the transfer of prisoners, but US authorities declined to enter into any such agreement.
The government argued that the IHC had overlooked the applicability of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 (VCDR) and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, 1963 (VCCR), both of which have the force of law in Pakistan under the Diplomatic and Consular Privileges Act, 1972.

This information was placed before the lower house of the parliament by Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry while responding to a calling attention notice moved by Anjum Aqeel of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz on the matter.
The minister was responding on behalf of Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
The minister, however, clarified that none of these students were stranded at any border point.

Says efforts being made for their safe return

Dr Chaudhry further informed the lawmakers that about 1,100 Pakistani students had already returned to the country since the closure of border with Afghanistan. Majority of these students, he said, were brought back to the country by air whereas only about two dozen of them managed to enter Pakistan through land routes.
The minister said the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul was making every effort to facilitate the return of these stranded students, who had been studying in medical colleges in Kabul and Jalalabad.
According to state-run news agency APP, the minister said Pakistan decided to close the border after the Afghan government failed to provide assurances that cross-border infiltration and firing from Afghan soil would be halted.
He added that before October 2025, when the border remained open, a large number of Pakistani students regularly travelled via land routes to pursue their education in Afghanistan. However, the border was closed in October 2025, following repeated cross-border attacks.
He further informed the House that Pakistan held several rounds of talks with the Afghan Taliban authorities, including meetings in Doha and later in Turkiye. While Afghan representatives acknowledged that attacks originate from Afghan soil, they did not offer firm assurances to end cross-border terrorism or dismantle militant safe havens.
The minister said Pakistan could not allow a situation where cross-border terrorism continued while trade and movement remained open, adding that border crossings with Afghanistan were closed as a security measure.
Meanwhile, members belonging to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Muttehida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) expressed their serious concerns over the problems being faced by the passengers at Karachi and Islamabad airports due to the lengthy immigration process by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials.
Seher Kamran of the PPP claimed that 51,000 passengers had been so far off-loaded at Karachi airport.
The members alleged that many people with valid documents had been offloaded whereas hundreds of passengers had missed their flights due to lengthy procedure.
MQM’s Aminul Haq also pointed out the miserable and “pathetic condition” of Karachi Airport, stating that not a single rupee had been spent to improve the facilities at the airport or to expand it.
Responding to the concerns shown by the members, the parliamentary affairs said the government was formulating a policy to manage certain airports under a public-private partnership model. He said the UAE had already showed its interest in running the Islamabad Airport after the government’s decision to outsource it.
The minister assured the members that he had noted down all the concerns raised by the members, stating that he would convey them to the relevant authorities for prompt action.
Earlier at the outset of the sitting, opposition member Junaid Akbar pointed out lack of quorum, forcing Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah to suspend the proceedings after a headcount. The proceedings remained suspended for nearly 40 minutes.

The analysis led by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations further claimed deep structural imbalances in food availability that undermine nutrition, public health, and long-term development outcomes.
Results of the analysis were presented at the National Results Dissemination Workshop on the Integrated Roadmap for Sustainable Food Systems Transformation in Pakistan.
The FAO-led analysis was carried out in collaboration with the UN Resident Coordinator, the national food security and research ministry, and UN partners WFP, Unicef, IFAD and WHO.

Strategic reallocation of subsidies by government urged to boost production, accessibility of nutrient-rich foods

The analysis said while Pakistan’s overall food energy availability is adequate, the national food supply falls short of what is needed to support healthy diets in line with the National Food-Based Dietary Guidelines of 2018.
Significant gaps persist in the availability of key food groups, including fruits and vegetables, pulses and legumes. These shortages directly weaken efforts to address malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and diet-related diseases.
The food system of the country is characterised by a substantial oversupply of cereals and grains, sugar, and edible oils, far exceeding levels recommended for healthy diets. This imbalance reinforces cereal-heavy consumption patterns, limits dietary diversity, and contributes to the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the analysis shows.
Grains and cereals dominate food consumption, across rural and urban areas alike, with particularly high reliance in rural households. While this ensures calorie intake, it comes at the cost of diet quality. Milk and milk products are the second most consumed food group nationally.
Urban and national averages are similar; rural consumption is slightly lower. Consumption of vegetables remains moderate, but fruit intake is consistently low, especially in rural areas signalling widespread micronutrient gaps. Protein sources beyond dairy remain limited. Consumption of meat, poultry, and eggs remains low overall and is especially limited in rural areas. Consumption of pulses remains insufficient to compensate for low animal-source foods.
The analysis highlights concerning trends in sweets and snacks consumption. Rural households consume more free sugar and fats than urban households, reflecting reliance on inexpensive, energy-dense foods. Provincial differences are stark, with particularly high sugar consumption obser­ved in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Complementary market data show that sales volumes of processed foods in Pakistan have nearly doubled in recent years, pointing to rapid dietary shifts with serious public health implications.
These dietary patterns are contributing to Pakistan’s double burden of malnutrition, where undernutrition coexists with rising obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
According to national and international estimates from various data sources, diabetes affects 34.5 million people in Pakistan, including one in three adults. NCDs now account for 58 per cent of all deaths nationwide. Cardiovascular disease alone claims nearly 400,000 lives annually.
Experts warn that without decisive action to improve food system, these trends will continue to place immense strain on health systems and economic productivity.
In its recommendations, the analysis emphasised the need for targeted government incentives and a strategic reallocation of subsidies to boost the production, affordability, and accessibility of nutrient-rich foods, particularly fruits, vegetables, and pulses to promote healthier diets across the country.
It urged the government to consider increasing taxes on sugar and sugary beverages and confectionery, with revenues reinvested in nutrition and healthy food programmes, and offer tax incentives or preferential procurement for companies that meet sugar reduction targets.

ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday reluctantly conceded that the industrial sector had, for the first time, been fully freed from cross-subsidy to compete globally, as it disclosed a higher-than-previously known financial impact of the newly imposed fixed charges on residential electricity consumers.
At an almost one-way public hearing on Rs4.04 per unit average cut in power rates for industrial consumers and imposition of fixed charges on residential consumers, industrial consumers, power division and the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) were all praise for each other for a long overdue “great move” and “first step in the right direction”.
No representative appeared on behalf of more than 28.5 million residential consumers who will be subject to the fixed charges.
The power division team, led by Additional Secretary Mehfooz Bhatti and comprising the chief financial officer of Power Planning and Manage­ment Com­pany (PPMC), Naveed Qaiser, reported that fixed charges would be collected from residential consumers at the rate of Rs200-675 per kilowatt a month and not Rs200-675 per connection per month.
This means the charge will be linked to the sanctioned load regardless of consumption. A consumer with a 2kW sanctioned load would pay Rs400 per month at a Rs200 per kW rate, while a 5kW consumer would pay Rs2,500 per month at Rs500 per kW. A 6kW sanctioned load would attract Rs4,050 per month at Rs675 per kW.
Mr Qaiser said it was also for the first time that a two-part tariff would be charged to consumers to cater for the Rs2.56 trillion annual fixed cost of capacity. While the move reduces about Rs101bn cross-subsidy from industrial consumers, the recovery of fixed charge would increase by Rs132bn, to Rs355bn (10 per cent) from Rs223bn (7pc) at present, excluding 18pc GST and other surcharges and duties.
He said that about Rs31bn to be collected through fixed charges would be used to reduce the variable tariff of consumers using more than 300 units per month to minimise their incentive to move away from the national grid, while the remaining Rs101bn would be used to ease the industrial burden.
Mr Bhatti said the industrial tariff would now come down to around 11.50 cents per unit from around 13, although it was still higher than regional competitors, but involved no cross-subsidy.
Separately, the financial advisory firm Optimus Capital Management worked out the average power tariff for protected consumers in the first 100-unit slab, increasing by 76pc or Rs8 per unit due to the fixed charge. The average cost for 101-200 units in the protected category would see an increase of Rs4 per unit (or 31pc).
For the non-protected category, Optimus estimated a 74pc increase — about Rs16.50 per unit — for the first 100 units, followed by a 21pc increase (about Rs6 per unit) for the 101-200 unit slab.
It said the net average tariff, including fixed charges, would rise for all domestic consumers, including by 13pc for 201-300 units, 6.5pc for 301-400 units, 5.8pc for 401-600 units per month and about 5pc for consumption above 600 units. The only net reduction — about 7pc — would apply to time-of-use consumers with sanctioned load above 5kW.

WASHINGTON: A day after the eight-member Muslim bloc condemned illegal Israeli measures to annex the West Bank, several Western nations — including staunch ally the United States — have come out against Tel Aviv’s move to tighten its grip over the occupied Palestinian territory.
The Israeli security cabinet had voted on Monday to allow Jew­ish settlers to buy West Bank land dir­e­ctly, and to extend greater control over areas where the Palestinian Authority exercises power.
“As the president has clearly stated, he does not support Israel annexing the West Bank,” a Tru­mp administration official said.
“A stable West Bank keeps Isr­ael secure and is in line with this administration’s goal to achieve peace,” the official said, when asked about the Israeli actions.
UN Secretary-General Anto­nio Guterres warned that this decision was eroding the prospect for a two-state solution.
He reiterated that all Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and their associated regime and infrastructure, have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of international law, including relevant UN resolutions.
Such actions, including Israel’s continued presence in the occu­pied Palestinian territory, are not only destabilising but also unlawful as recalled by the Inter­national Court of Justice, a statement issued by the UN chief said.
France also condemned the Israeli security cabinet’s decisions aimed at expanding Israel’s control over the West Bank, calling the move “contrary to international law and represent[ing] a dangerous challenge to the Oslo Accords and the Hebron Protocol”.
“These measures, along with the approval of the E1 project and the publication of a tender for that project, are fueling momentum for annexing the West Bank and as such, represent a serious attack on the two-state solution. At a time when international efforts are focused on implementing phase two of the Gaza peace plan, these decisions are detrimental to current peace efforts and threaten to raise tensions,” the French foreign ministry said in a statement
The usually-neutral Swiss government also weighed in, saying Israeli “settlement activities are illegal under international law”.
Meanwhile, the Arab League Council is expected to convene today (Wednesday) — at the request of the State of Palestine — to discuss ways to confront the recent Israeli expansion of its occupation of the West Bank.
Israel starts ‘clearing’ West Bank
On Tuesday, Anadolu Agency reported the Israeli army had demolished Palestinian structures and assaulted several residents in the occupied West Bank.
Military bulldozers brought down three homes belonging to two Palestinian families in the town of Barta’a, southwest of Jenin in the northern West Bank, citing a lack of building permits, the official news agency Wafa said.
In the nearby Ya’bad town, Israeli forces assaulted several young men after raiding the area and storming several shops there, the outlet said.
Separately, four Palestinians were injured after they were assaulted by Israeli forces during demolition operations in Silwan town in occupied West Bank, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said.
According to the Wadi Hilwah Information Center, Israeli for­ces raided the town and demolished walls surrounding houses in the al-Bustan neighborhood.
A building material store was also razed by Israeli forces in the Bir Ayoub neighborhood in the same town. Two people were detained during the raid.

Cumulative sales rose 43pc to 111,377 units in 7MFY26, up from 77,686 units in 7MFY25. Myesha Sohail of Topline Securi­ties said the sharp MoM surge was largely driven by new-year registrations, as customers typically delay deliveries to secure January registrations for better resale value.
The strong YoY growth was supported by new market entrants, lower interest rates, easing inflation, and improving macroeconomic sentiment, she said.
Sazgar Engineering Works Ltd (SEWL) reported all-time high sales of 2,004 units in January, up 72pc MoM. SEWL sales in 7MFY26 were 9,214, up by 49pc YoY.

Tractor demand shrinks, truck and bus sales surge to record high

Indus Motor Company (IMC) and Honda Atlas Cars Ltd (HCAR) recorded 43-month high sales in January, she added.
HACL posted growth of 64pc YoY and 86pc MoM to 3,620 units in January. Honda City and Civic models sales rose 69pc YoY and 93pc MoM to 3,364 units, which were a 43-month high. BRV and HRV models surged by 14pc YoY and 25pc MoM to 256 units in January. HACL sold 15,659 units in 7MFY26, up by 68pc YoY.

 

IMC posted a 52pc YoY and 119pc MoM growth to 5,060 units. Corolla, Yaris and Cross sales together went up 90pc YoY and 93pc MoM to 4,078 units. Meanwhile, Fortuner and IMVs fell 17pc YoY but rose to 982 units in January from 196 units in December 2025. Total IMC sales during 7MFY26 were 25,623, showing a growth of 61pc YoY.
In 2 and 3-wheelers, sales increased by 31pc YoY and 13pc MoM to 181,790 units in January, marking an all-time high. This took cumulative 7MFY26 sales to 1.1m units, up 32pc YoY.
Atlas Honda Ltd (AHL), the maker of the popular CD70 bike, yet again recorded all-time high monthly sales of 157,059 units in January.
Tractor sales posted a decline of 9pc YoY and 26pc MoM to 2,505 units in January, while total sales (Fiat and Millat) in 7MFY26 fell by 23pc to 15,434 units YoY.
Truck and bus sales surged by 77pc YoY and three times MoM to 1,101 units in January, to an all-time high. During 7MFY26, total sales surged by 92pc to 4,633 units YoY.
Myesha Sohail expects positive momentum in auto sales to continue in 2026, supported by lower interest rates and new hybrid and plug-in hybrid models.

Trump said the United States should own “at least half” of the still under-construction Gordie Howe International Bridge that links the Canadian province of Ontario with the US state of Michigan.
Work on the $4.7-billion bridge — named after the late Canadian-born National Hockey League great Gordie Howe — started in 2018 and it is due to open later this year.
“I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them, and also, importantly, Canada treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve,” Trump posted on Truth Social.
“We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY.”







The 79-year-old Republican complained that Canada owned both sides of the bridge and used “virtually” no US products to build it. According to a factsheet issued by the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, the bridge was financed entirely by Canada and will be jointly owned by the governments of Canada and the state of Michigan.
“And now, on top of everything else, Prime Minister (Mark) Carney wants to make a deal with China — which will eat Canada alive. We’ll just get the leftovers! I don’t think so,” Trump added.
Washington threatened to slap 100 percent tariffs on Canada after Carney visited Beijing last month and sealed a preliminary trade deal with China. The US leader meanwhile repeated the outlandish claim that Beijing would “terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada.” Trump has clashed with Canada over trade since returning to office in January 2025. He previously called for the United States to annex Canada but has largely dropped that claim in recent months.

The South African government said in November it had received “distress calls” from 17 men who were trapped in the epicentre of the fighting in Ukraine’s Donbas region after being tricked into joining mercenary forces.
“President Ramaphosa and President Putin pledged their support to the process of returning Sou­th Africans fighting alongside Russ­i­an forces in Ukraine,” the president’s office said in a statement.
“In this regard, teams from both sides will continue their engagements towards the finalisation of this process,” it said. Ukraine’s foreign minister said in November that more than 1,400 citizens from 36 African countries had been identified among the Russian ranks.

Kenya deplores use of citizens as ‘cannon fodder’ in war

An investigation spoke to four Kenyans recently returned from Russia who said they were tricked by a Nairobi recruitment agency into travelling to Russia under false promises of well-paying jobs. In December, Kenyan authorities said around 200 citizens had been sent to fight in Ukraine, of whom 23 had since been repatriated.
This is an underestimate, said the four Kenyan recruits. The daughter of South African former president Jacob Zuma is among several accused of recruiting men to join Russian mercenaries in the Ukraine war. Pretoria warned its citizens last year not to fall for recruitment scams, after multiple social media influencers shared campaigns promising young women jobs in a Russia-based programme that has been accused of abuses.
‘Cannon fodder’ Kenyans
Kenya on Tuesday condemned as “unacceptable” recruiters luring Kenyans to Russia with promises of lucrative jobs, only to send them to Ukraine’s front lines as “cannon fodder.”
In recent weeks, mounting reports indicate that Kenyans deceived into travelling for high-paying work in Russia are dying on the battlefield, with others sustaining serious wounds.
An investigation published this week revealed the web of deception into which four men with no military background fell — forced to sign contracts with the Russian army and swiftly sent to the front lines in Ukraine. “It’s unacceptable for them to be participants in this conflict,” junior foreign minister Korir Sing’Oei said.
The four, three of whom returned wounded, were given contracts written in Russian. One had expected to work as a salesman, two as security guards and the fourth as a high-level athlete.
“These individuals are used as cannon fodder on the war front,” Sing’Oei said. “No Kenyan would voluntarily enter into that kind of engagement.”

In an interview with several European newspapers, the French leader said the European Union should not mistake a lull in tensions with Washington for a lasting shift despite a pause in US threats over Greenland, trade and technology.
Macron urged EU leaders to use a summit in a Belgian castle this week to inject fresh energy into economic reforms to bolster the bloc’s competitiveness and strengthen its ability to stand up to China and the United States on the world stage.
When there’s a clear act of aggression, I think what we should do isn’t bow down or try to reach a settlement,” Macron told Le Monde, the Financial Times and other newspapers in comments published on Tuesday.

French president warns of renewed friction with US, urges EU to use ‘Greenland moment’ to push reforms

“We’ve tried that strategy for months. Its not working, Macron said the Trump administration was being “openly anti-European” and seeking the EU’s “dismemberment”. He said he anticipated further tensions with the Trump administration, including over Europe’s regulation of digital technology.
“The US will, in the coming months that’s certain attack us over digital regulation,” Macron added, warning of potential US import tariffs from US President Donald Trump should the EU use its Digital Services Act to control tech companies.
Europe needs protection
Europe needed to be more resilient in the face of a double challenge from the United States and China, Macron said. “We have the Chinese tsunami on the trade front, and we have minute-by-minute instability on the American side. These two crises amount to a profound shock a rupture for Europeans,” he continued.

 

Macron, whose second term finishes in spring 2027, renewed his call for the EU to embark on more common borrowing to help the bloc of 27 nations invest at scale and challenge the hegemony of the US dollar.
“World markets are increasingly wary of the US dollar. They’re looking at alternatives. Let’s offer them European debt,” Macron said, adding that Europe’s democratic institutions were a major asset for investors at a time when the US was “drifting away from the rule of law”.
The EU used joint debt in 2020 to re-boot the European economy after the Covid-19 pandemic, but French attempts to make such tools permanent have faced stiff resistance from Germany and other more frugal northern member states.
Thursday’s summit will include discussions around French-led plans for a Made in Europe strategy that would set minimum requirements for European content in locally manufactured goods. The approach has split EU countries and alarmed automakers.
“For me, the economic strategy to make our Europe a power lies in what I call protection, which is not protectionism, but rather European preference,” Macron said.

“Pakistan is listening, and Pakistan is acting,” Mr Akhtar said, assuring Japanese firms that their issues would be taken up “in partnership with stakeholders” to ensure continued, mutually beneficial cooperation.
Mr Akhtar was speaking at the Japan-Pakistan Business Seminar 2026, which brought together government officials, business leaders, universities, and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Pakistan, Japan Interna­tional Cooperation Agency and the Japan External Trade Organisation.
He said the automotive sector remained one of the most visible and impactful areas of economic cooperation between Japan and Pakistan, noting that Japa­nese automakers had been operating in the country for decades and had played a central role in shaping its industrial landscape.
“Japanese automakers have been at the forefront of Pakistan’s automotive industry, creating jobs, transferring technology and supporting local supply chains,” Mr Akhtar said. Companies such as Toyota, Suzuki and Honda, he added, had contributed not only to vehicle production but also to parts manufacturing, logistics, dealerships and service networks.
Mr Akhtar acknowledged, however, that recent engagements with Japanese automakers had highlighted concerns about tax refunds and export-related hurdles, underscoring the need for continuous dialogue and streamlined processes to support long-term growth.
“We are committed to addressing these concerns in partnership with stakeholders, ensuring that Japan’s industrial participation in Pakistan remains robust, competitive, and mutually beneficial,” Mr Akhtar said.
Japanese Ambassador to Pakistan Akamatsu Shuichi said Japanese automotive companies had made a substantial and lasting contribution to Pakistan’s economy and would continue to do so.
“Japanese automotive companies have created more than 100,000 jobs in Pakistan and have established domestic supply chains to localise automotive components,” he added.

ISLAMABAD: A United Nations Security Council report has warned that the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) enjoys preferential treatment among terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, heightening concerns among member states that the outfit could pose an extra-regional threat.
The warning was contained in the 37th report of the UN Security Council’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, covering the period between July and December 2025.
The report stated: “In Afghanistan, the de facto authorities continued to provide a permissive environment for a range of terrorist groups, notably Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.”
It drew a direct comparison between the operational space available to the TTP and that afforded to other militant groups, and linked this disparity to a sharp deterioration in Pakistan’s security situation.
“TTP, however, was accorded greater liberty and support from the de facto authorities, and consequently, TTP attacks against Pakistan increased, amplifying regional tensions,” the report said. Of more than 3,500 terrorist attacks attributed to the TTP last year, over 2,100 were recorded in the second half of the year.
According to the monitoring team, the TTP “operates as one of the largest terrorist groups in Afghanistan”, reflecting its entrenched presence across multiple provinces and its sustained ability to plan and execute cross-border attacks.
The TTP is believed to have a strong presence in Afghanistan’s eastern and south-eastern border provinces, including Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost, Paktika — including the Barmal district — and Paktia. There are reports of new or expanded training centres in these locations, often under the influence of networks such as the Haqqani Network.
Various UN Security Council Monitoring Team assessments indicated that the TTP benefited from Taliban tolerance or active support, including access to safe houses, such as guesthouses in Kabul for senior leaders, movement passes, weapons permits and logistical assistance. These arrangements persist despite internal Taliban debates that have at times viewed the TTP as a liability due to strained relations with Pakistan.
Conservative estimates placed the number of TTP fighters in Afghanistan at around 6,000, with the group recruiting from Afghan Taliban ranks and receiving operational enhancements.
‘Extra-regional threat’
Member states, the report said, were increasingly alarmed not only by the scale of TTP’s activities but also by the direction in which the group could be heading. “Some member states expressed concern that TTP may deepen its cooperation with Al Qaeda-aligned groups in order to attack a wider range of targets, potentially resulting in an extra-regional threat,” the report noted.
These concerns were situated within a broader ecosystem of collaboration between terrorist groups in Afghanistan. The report said that Al Qaeda “acted as a service provider and multiplier for other terrorist groups in Afghanistan in terms of training and advice, principally to TTP”.
Member states feared that deeper cooperation could lead to more structured alliances, joint planning and access to a wider pool of fighters and resources, expanding the range of potential targets beyond Pakistan.
While the report did not state that the TTP was currently carrying out attacks outside the region, it reflected growing international concern that Afghanistan’s permissive environment under Taliban rule could allow the group, with Al Qaeda’s backing, to acquire capabilities and ambitions extending beyond South Asia.
The report also cautioned that Al Qaeda’s regional affiliate was adapting its posture. “There were concerns that AQIS was increasingly focused on external operations. Such operations would likely be unclaimed or deniable operations, perhaps as part of the umbrella group Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan (not listed), which declared itself in April, so as not to create difficulties for the Taliban as hosts of AQIS.”
Detailing the footprint of Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, the report stated, “Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) remained active in south-eastern Afghanistan, where the Haqqani Network exerts considerable influence. Osama Mahmoud, the ‘emir’ of AQIS, and Yahya Ghauri, his deputy, were reported to be in Kabul, with the media cell of AQIS based in Herat.”
‘ISIL-K remains resilient’
The report noted that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) remained resilient in 2025 despite sustained counterterrorism pressure and losses.
According to the report, “Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan was under sustained counterterrorism pressure, but it retained a potent capability, coupled with intent to conduct external operations.”
The monitoring team said the terror outfit faced significant losses as a result of security operations by regional states and continued military action by the Taliban inside Afghanistan. These pressures reduced the overall number of attacks but did not dismantle the group’s operational base or its ability to regenerate.
The report noted that ISIL-K “was active mainly in northern Afghanistan, particularly Badakhshan, and areas close to the Pakistani border”, where it maintained networks of cells to project a regional threat and, potentially, operations beyond the immediate region.
Despite being under pressure, the group retained “significant operational and combat capability and the ability to rapidly replace fighters, including through online recruitment”, according to the report.
The campaign against ISIL-K also pus­hed it to seek alliances with other armed factions across Afghanistan as it adapted to the evolving security environment.
The monitoring team said ISIL-K continued efforts to expand its reach through technology, noting that ISIL and Al Qaeda “continued their efforts to build cybercapabilities”, a trend that member states saw as enhancing propaganda, recruitment and operational planning.
The monitoring team’s assessment that the group’s strong recruitment pipelines and expanding cyber capabilities in 2025 pointed to enabling factors that may have contributed to its ability to plan and execute the Feb 6 gun-and-bomb attack on a Shia mosque on the outskirts of Islamabad.
The report also pointed to growing concerns about militant collaboration. Member states reported that the Balochistan Liberation Army collaborated with the TTP and ISIL-K “through shared training camps and resources, coordinating attacks and meetings between commanders”.

It is a question that should be central to every debate around the poor air quality, congestion and broken infrastructure in Pakistan’s cities. 
French philosopher Henri Lefebvre described this relationship as the right to the city — the idea that urban life should be shaped by those who live it, not merely managed by those who govern it. To have a right to the city is to have a voice in how it grows, breathes and welcomes, and to recognise a shared responsibility for its care.
In Lahore and Karachi, as well as other urban centres, this balance has faltered. Pakistan’s cities have been stretched and strained by unchecked expansion, real-estate development and the logic of consumption. What we are witnessing now is environmental exhaustion, but also a deeper alienation between people and place. 
Re-examining the right to the city, then, is less about demanding entitlements and more about asking how to rebuild a reciprocal, living relationship with the urban world we inhabit.

Pakistan’s major cities are expanding rapidly — and dying slowly. Lahore’s air is unbreathable, Karachi’s natural defences are vanishing and citizens have been reduced to consumers in cities that no longer belong to them. What would it take to reclaim urban life?

LEFEBVRE’S URBAN COVENANT
When Lefebvre first wrote about this urban covenant in the late 1960s, he was not speaking in the context of policy or development. He was responding to something more intimate — the growing sense that modern life was pulling people away from the places that once gave them meaning. 
In post-war Europe, rapid industrialisation and suburban expansion were transforming cities into machines for efficiency, production and profit. Lefebvre saw that, in this process, ordinary people were losing not only access to urban space, but also their sense of belonging to it.
Lefebvre believed that the city should be understood as a living entity, one that is the outcome of countless human experiences, encounters and routines. Streets, markets, parks and neighbourhoods take shape from daily life. To speak of the right to the city, then, is to insist that those who experience the city every day should also have a say in how it evolves. It calls for participation, for claiming urban space not as property but as a shared project.
Lefebvre also warned against what he called “the bureaucratic society of organised consumption”, where urban life becomes defined by what can be bought, owned or controlled. In such a system, citizens are reduced to consumers and the city is treated as a commodity or as something that is to be managed, not experienced. Roads are built to move traffic, not people. Public spaces start to shrink. Consequently, planning becomes an exercise in control rather than care.
For Lefebvre, reclaiming the right to the city meant recovering the creative and collective spirit of urban life. It meant understanding that the city is not a finished product handed down by planners and politicians, but a shared expression of human presence. It also implied a responsibility to participate, to care and to ensure that urban growth serves life rather than consumes it.



 
WHEN GROWTH OUTPACES CARE
More than half a century after Lefebvre first wrote about the right to the city, his ideas resonate most clearly in places far from where they were conceived. Across much of the developing world, cities have grown into vast, restless organisms, expanding faster than their capacity to sustain life. 
Pakistan’s urban centres are no exception. Lahore and Karachi, in particular, embody what happens when growth outpaces care, and when the logic of profit replaces the logic of belonging.
Both cities have become laboratories of the same experiment: how far can urban expansion stretch before it begins to consume the very conditions that make city life possible? 
In Lahore, the pursuit of comfort and connectivity has come at the cost of the air itself, while in Karachi the hunger for land and infrastructure has eaten into the coastline, stripping the city of its natural buffers. Both cases show that the crisis of Pakistan’s cities is not only one of governance or environment, but also a crisis of relationship between people and place.
Over the past two decades, Lahore’s boundaries have stretched endlessly outward, swallowing farmland and orchards to make room for housing colonies, motorways and shopping districts. Flyovers and “signal-free corridors” promise convenience but privilege cars over people, sealing the city into a cycle of dependence on private transport. The loss of tree cover, unchecked industrial emissions and constant construction dust have all converged to create an atmosphere that is, quite literally, unbreathable. The urban economy runs on the very practices that poison it.
REBUILDING THE COVENANT 
Public response has followed a familiar pattern: each smog season brings a wave of outrage, brief school closures and the occasional fine for factories or farmers. But these gestures only address the symptoms. 
The deeper problem lies in how Lahore imagines progress. It is a city that celebrates what it can build, not what it can sustain. Development is measured in visible infrastructure rather than in liveability or air quality. The right to the city here has been replaced by the right to consume it, a right exercised through cars, gated housing, and air conditioners struggling against the very heat and pollution they help create.
In this way, Lahore’s crisis is not only environmental but ethical. The right to the city has collapsed into the right to private comfort, even when that comfort collectively suffocates us. To reclaim it would mean rethinking what we owe to the air we share — the simple, communal right to breathe.
In such a model, the citizen is reduced to a customer. Public space becomes a privilege, mobility a commodity, and environmental damage an accepted cost of living. The city, once a space of gathering and imagination, now mirrors the inequalities it sustains. Those who can afford it, retreat into enclaves insulated from decay, while those who cannot are left to endure it.
Cities survive on a delicate covenant between people and place — a shared understanding that the health of one depends on the other. That covenant has frayed. What remains are cities that function but feel alien to their inhabitants. To reclaim the right to the city is to recognise that the relationship between people and place is not fixed but chosen. It can be rebuilt if we begin to see cities not as products of authority but as collective works in progress.
In Lahore, that might begin with reimagining mobility, building for people instead of cars, restoring tree cover and treating clean air as a shared right, not a seasonal luxury. Cities are at their best when they invite people in, when streets belong to pedestrians, parks to families and the air to everyone. 
The right to the city, in the end, is not a claim to ownership but to belonging. The right to the city, at its heart, is the right and the duty to keep it alive.
