The Punjab Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat made the announcement in a post on the social media platform X.







Earlier this month, the Punjab government announced the winter vacation schedule for public and private schools in the province.
According to a notification by the School Education Department, the break will be from Dec 22 to Jan 10.
In Sindh, all schools and colleges will remain closed for winter vacations during the last week of the month, starting from Dec 22 till Dec 31.
Meanwhile, in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the provincial government last week announced that winter vacation for the educational institutions will start from Jan 1 in the summer zone and run till Jan 15. In the winter zone, educational institutions will remain closed from Dec 23 till February 28.</p><small>2025-12-22 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2217242107fc4d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962632/bangladeshi-student-leader-shot-in-khulna-report' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladeshi student leader shot in Khulna: report</strong></a><br><p>A Bangladeshi student political leader from the National Citizen Party (NCP) was shot and injured in Khulna on Monday, according to The Daily Star.
The development comes after Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka on December 16 while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He died last Thursday in Singapore after six days on life support.
According to The Daily Star, the injured 42-year-old Mohammad Motaleb Sikder is the NCP’s divisional chief in Khulna.
“Miscreants opened fire targeting his head around 11:45am (10:45am PKT) near Gazi Medical College Hospital in the city,” the paper reported, quoting Rafikul Islam, the officer-in-charge of Sonadanga Model Police Station. “He was rushed to Khulna Medical College Hospital in critical condition.”
Quoting the officer, the publication reported that Sidker was “out of danger”, as the bullet entered through one side of his ear, pierced the skin, and exited through the other side.
Following the attack on Hadi, violent protests broke out and several buildings, including those housing leading newspapers Prothom Alo and The Daily Star, were set on fire and vandalised, according to authorities.
In November, gunmen on motorbikes attacked a Bangladesh political rally, killing one person and wounding two others, including a candidate, as campaigning for February’s landmark elections was underway.
The shooting took place at a rally of the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), attended by hundreds in the port city of Chattogram, police said.</p><small>2025-12-22 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22170045b8982b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962630/local-bodies-polls-to-be-held-on-party-basis-punjab-govt-informs-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>Local bodies polls to be held on ‘party basis’, Punjab govt informs LHC</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday told the Lahore High Court (LHC) that the upcoming local government (LG) elections in the province would be held on a “party basis”.
An assistant advocate general (AAG) shared this information during a hearing of petitions filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI)-backed lawmaker Sheikh Imtiaz and others, who have challenged the Punjab Local Government Act 2025 (PLGA).
The law officer also filed a report on behalf of the local government secretary, which revealed that any political party wishing to contest the LG polls “may allow its candidates to contest elections for any political office on its ticket”.
“Section 55 of the PLGA does not, in any manner, put any party at a disadvantage compared to others,” he said.
At this, LHC Justice Sultan Tanvir Ahmad asked whether the petitioners’ grievances had been addressed as the government, represented by the AAG, itself had said that the LG elections would be party-based.
In this regard, the petitioner’s lawyer said that if that was the case, “then our concern to the extent of one point stands resolved”.
He requested that the government’s reply be made part of the record.
The judge also heard Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) Director General (Law) Khurram Shahzad, who said the ECP was a constitutional body “ready to fulfil its duties”.
“The commission had written nearly 80 letters to the government over the past four years regarding holding local government elections and would conduct polls under whatever law the government enacted,” he maintained.
“The Punjab government had given a Jan 10 deadline for election preparations,” an ECP official added.
Justice Ahmad questioned why the advocate general’s office had not filed a formal reply to the petitions. He directed the advocate general to submit a reply by Tuesday.
“Certain provisions of the impugned Act appeared to be inconsistent with the Constitution,” the judge observed.
The judge also commented that the matter needed to be decided “promptly”.
In October, the ECP had announced holding the elections in the last week of December under the 2022 law.
Only after the ECP’s strong intervention and its announcement to hold local government elections under the PLGA 2022 in the last week of December did the Punjab government steamroll the new PLGA 2025 through the Punjab Assembly in just five days.
Responding to the developments, PTI legislators held detailed discussions with party lawyers and agreed to challenge the new Act in court.
In 2019, the then PTI-led Punjab government dissolved the local government institutions. These were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on December 31, 2021. Consequently, the elections were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022.
Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold polls within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.</p><small>2025-12-22 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22164901634848b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962629/fencing-champion-banin-nasry-sets-sights-on-olympics-after-gold-at-national-games' target='_blank'><strong>Fencing champion Banin Nasry sets sights on Olympics after gold at national games</strong></a><br><p>National champions are typically forged from years of rigorous training, determination and a foray into the sport in childhood. But Umul Banin Nasry is anything but typical.
Her journey to fencing stardom began with one element; curiosity. Barely one month after taking up the sport, she won gold at the national fencing championships, although her gold medal at last month’s 35th National Games holds a sense of greater grandeur for her.
Now, as the 21-year-old awaits her international debut and a chance to become Pakistan’s first fencer at the Olympics, her journey is intentional, fuelled by an unwavering commitment to training and family support in defiance of societal disapproval.
It all began five years ago. Banin was intrigued by some women at her college in Quetta practicing “weird stepping movements”, only to find out it was for a sport called fencing. She tried her hand at it — quite literally — and immediately fell in love with a sport she had only seen online. Her coach signed her up for the 4th National Fencing Championships, where her unexpected gold medal solidified her commitment to the sport and a departure from flag football that she had also played at a national level.
She entered the mindset of a champion right after becoming one; five hours of training every day — “there’s no days off, no excuses” — and a daily schedule that revolved around her desire for excellence in the sport.
In the lead up to the national games, Banin spent all day training at Ayub National Stadium. Even when the Covid-19 pandemic brought the world to a halt, Banin would show up to an empty stadium to train.
“The first time I competed, I was up against athletes who trained abroad and had experience I was nowhere close to,” she told Dawn over the phone from Quetta, where she had promptly resumed training after claiming four medals at the national games in Karachi, including two golds. It was the final jewel in her national crown after she won silver at the National Games in her hometown in 2023.
“I trained till I became mentally invincible, telling myself that my opponents are just athletes like myself, nothing else.”
Her literal journey in the sport was costly. Roundtrip transportation from her house till Ayub National Stadium where she trained cost one thousand rupees per day, which was unaffordable. The only solution was to walk for nearly 30 minutes from her house till a checkpost and then taking a rickshaw to the stadium from there. Men stared at her as she walked alone. Society whispered about how and why her family had allowed her to take up a sport like this, oblivious to her national accolades.
But her family was unwavering in their support from the start. After all, she belongs to Pakistan’s Hazara community that boasts exceptional talent in football and martial arts, where Banin’s younger brother is provincial Taekwondo champion. Younger sister Maheen followed in her footsteps and took up fencing, winning a bronze for team Navy at the National Games.

Banin credits her eldest brother with her sporting success. The only non-athlete sibling in the family, Arif Nasry filled the financial gaps for Banin by scouting for sponsors and getting two ahead of the National Games. He meticulously manages her social media accounts to promote her through a digital platform. Government recognition has been sparse, and appreciation for her provincial and national triumphs has been empty promises of cash prizes that have never materialised.
But Banin’s biggest cheerleader has been Haji Muhammad Qasim, secretary of the Balochistan Fencing Association. He arranges for the athletes’ equipment which only comes from abroad and is not locally manufactured. He staunchly defends his athletes when their families complain that medals are meaningless and sports have no value.
“Without him, I don’t think I would have gotten as far as I have,” Banin said, her voice heavy with genuine admiration for her guru.
Of course, her coach Mehmood Sharif is the main driving force. Just a couple years older than Banin, 23-year-old Mehmood himself is a two-time national champion and recently represented Pakistan at the Islamic Solidarity Games in Riyadh.
The competition would have been Banin’s international debut, but a lack of funds delayed her dreams till 2026. She’s hoping to travel to Iran at the start of next year for intense training for a couple months before making the national team for the Commonwealth Games in July and Asian Games in September.
“My journey has just begun,” Banin said less than a week after her national triumphs.
She admitted that having access to electrical fencing equipment — the kind used in competitions for scoring and precision — gave her an edge in the sport compared to manual equipment typically used in training. It’s almost as if everything has aligned for her to reach greater heights in the sport, despite the socioeconomic hurdles in her way.

She already knows her Olympic debut will be a tribute — and beacon of hope — to the women who weren’t allowed to fulfill their passions like she was.
“When I make it big on the international stage, I want to silence all those who say that women don’t belong in sports and are immoral if they do.
“What men can do, women can do too, and I want all those women who are forced to sit at home to know that.”

For people like me, it is often marketed as a great equaliser; an assurance that with the right device, disability is not a barrier. Access is just a download away, we are told.
But growing up, I realised that this flashy narrative, wrapped in lofty guarantees, was merely a mirage — out of reach for me.
For a family like mine, buying tech was expensive. My mother worked tirelessly to purchase devices she hoped would level the field for my visually impaired brother and me. But even when she managed to get them, a more invisible barrier persisted: hardly any technology could speak our tongue.
A profound disconnect
While I could listen to English books through screen readers, reading or writing in Urdu — the language of home, of emotion, and of identity — remained a distant dream. I longed to read novels on my own, to write my own stories, to revise schoolwork without leaning on someone else’s eyes.
That dream became especially far out of reach during O-levels, when I was barred from sitting the Urdu exam simply because no accessible technology existed to support the process.
Urdu is compulsory for university admissions in Pakistan, and, like many visually impaired students, I found myself locked out of a gateway to higher education. Not because I lacked talent, but because the tools did not exist.

 

Today, decades later, much has improved, and for that I am grateful. But the truth is that progress has been slow, inconsistent, and unfairly distributed. My research with visually impaired communities across Pakistan reveals that the very barriers I encountered at that time continue to persist to date.
Many participants described a profound disconnect from technology, particularly those without English proficiency. We often assume that access to a smartphone equals access to the world. For some of us, that assumption remains painfully untrue.
Across Pakistan, Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, Balochi, Saraiki, and dozens of other languages are spoken every day. The country is home to at least 80 languages and nearly 27 million people with disabilities, many of whom depend on technology for education, employment, and basic communication.
When the tools they rely on cannot understand their language, the consequence is not mere inconvenience. It is exclusion: systemic, silent, and on a massive scale.
The myth of inclusive technology
What does that look like day to day? The accessibility audits carried out in the Accessibility, Language, and Tech for the People (ALT) project paint the picture clearly.
Starting with screen readers: on Windows, the commonly used E-Speak Urdu TTS engine performs so poorly that even the simplest tasks become laborious. Several participants said the voice was so robotic and unclear that reading long-form content became overwhelmingly difficult.
Starting with screen readers, on Windows, the commonly used E-Speak Urdu TTS engine performs so poorly that even the simplest tasks become laborious. Several participants noted that the voice was so robotic and unclear that reading long-form content became extremely difficult.
On Android, the picture is slightly better, and Google’s speech services provide clearer Urdu pronunciation. But typing remains an obstacle even then because the system does not read individual letters aloud, and therefore, users are unable to confirm what they have written. Yet another obstacle.
On iPhones, things get even more complicated. There is no built-in Urdu TTS at all.
This leaves visually impaired users with no option but to change system settings manually every time they want a message to be read in Urdu, or worse, have to rely on clumsy third-party tools. One participant put it starkly: writing even a single sentence in Urdu using the available synthesisers was “a terrible experience” and felt nothing like the smooth, accessible typing they were used to in English.
Beyond language itself, application accessibility is equally inconsistent. People often assume that because an app works perfectly for sighted users, it must work for everyone. But the audits show a very different reality.
Daraz, one of Pakistan’s most widely used shopping platforms, remains deeply problematic. Product images lack descriptions. Buttons are unlabelled. Tab navigation is inconsistent. Product details are sometimes impossible to access without help. Checkout processes fail to provide feedback, leaving users unsure whether an action has been completed. Several testers described having to rely on sighted assistance or apps like “Be My Eyes” just to finish an order.
Ride-hailing apps mirror these challenges. InDrive is relatively better, but nearly all such apps fail in one crucial area: live location tracking. For visually impaired passengers, this isn’t a bonus feature; it’s essential for safety and independent travel. Yango, for instance, makes even entering a location difficult because of inconsistent labelling. Bykea has similar navigation issues.
Food delivery apps, on the other hand, are a mixed bag. Foodpanda is usable for many tasks, but placing an order or chatting with a rider can become difficult due to unlabelled options or delayed keyboard feedback. Some testers could search for restaurants easily, only to find themselves blocked at the final step because the “place order” button wouldn’t register with their screen reader.
Banking apps, perhaps the most essential tools of modern life, show the widest range.
SadaPay is frequently praised for its smooth and intuitive accessibility. But Easypaisa and JazzCash — two financial lifelines for millions — can be nearly impossible to navigate. Users described crowded interfaces, unlabelled buttons and processes so convoluted that beginners “give up out of frustration and demotivation”.
Think about what that means: in 2025, millions of blind or visually impaired users still cannot send money, order food, track a ride, or buy groceries without assistance. We often talk about accessibility as if it’s a checklist — add alt text here, label a button there, job done.
But accessibility isn’t a feature. It’s a commitment. A philosophy. A willingness to build with the most marginalised users in mind, not as an afterthought but as a starting point. Right now, the digital world is being shaped around English-speaking, sighted, neurotypical users. Everyone else is left to catch up.
Redefining accessibility
For me, participating in the ALT project helped reclaim some of the marginalisation I grew up with. The project examines how language politics, disability and technology intersect in South Asia. Though these countries share deep histories and cultures, we found that barriers vary, and that solutions must be community-driven, co-created and grounded in the lived realities of disabled people.
Time and again, participants expressed a desire to separate themselves from colonial linguistic hierarchies. They don’t want to centre English; they want to centre their languages — to read the news in Pashto, to type in Punjabi, to browse a website in Sindhi, to write poetry, read novels and order food in Urdu without fighting their phone every step of the way.

 

And yet, big tech companies have been slow to respond. Apple still doesn’t offer Urdu TTS support. Android has made improvements, but it remains far from ideal. Community whispers about “something new coming soon” have circulated for years, only to fade away as researchers hit barriers, lose funding or abandon the project. The cycle repeats.
Pakistan deserves better. South Asia deserves better. Every language deserves digital visibility, not only the global ones. And most of all, every disabled person deserves the dignity of independent access.
Accessibility, in its current form, has too narrow a definition. It must widen linguistically, culturally and technologically. Because when technology fails people who need it most, it isn’t just a technical issue — it’s a question of justice, dignity and belonging.
The promise of technology as a saviour isn’t entirely wrong. But it will remain a myth until it serves us in the languages we live in, speak in, and dream in.</p><small>2025-12-22 12:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22150746d469b8c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962627/shc-extends-order-under-which-ku-decision-to-cancel-ex-ihc-judge-jahangiris-degree-remains-suspended' target='_blank'><strong>SHC extends order under which KU decision to cancel ex-IHC judge Jahangiri’s degree remains suspended</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) extended on Monday an interim order that suspended a Karachi University (KU) syndicate and Unfair Means Commi­ttee’s declaration cancelling the law degree of former justice Tariq Mehmood Jahnagiri, who was removed as an Islamabad High Court (IHC) judge last week.
Jahangiri has found himself mired in a fake degree controversy since last year and has been facing legal proceedings in the SHC and IHC over the matter. While an IHC division bench, led by Chief Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, ruled on December 18 that his degree was “invalid” and his elevation to the high court was “without lawful authority”, the SHC extended today its order under which KU’s August 2024 decision to cancel his degree remains suspended.
The order has been suspended until the next hearing, the date for which will be decided later.
The decision was taken by a two-judge bench, comprising Justices Yousuf Ali Saeed and Abdul Mobeen Lakho, as it heard a contempt plea filed against the KU Vice Chancellor (VC) Professor Khalid Mehmood Iraqi and Registrar Imran Ahmed Siddiqui.
Separately, Jahangiri‘s lawyer Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed said while speaking to the media at the court that “we filed a contempt application against KU as it concealed from the IHC“ the SHC order that suspended the varsity‘s “proceedings” in the case, as well as its decision to cancel Jahangiri’s law degree
During the hearing, KU VC Iraqi and Registrar Siddiqui appeared before the court and submitted affidavits.
The KU registrar argued that “now that the IHC has issued the final verdict, the contempt of court plea should be dismissed as it has become ineffective”.
He told the court that KU had not taken any action in compliance with SHC‘s October 3 order to suspend the cancellation of Jahangiri’s law degree.
“The IHC sought KU’s records via the Higher Education Commission,” he said.
Vice Chancellor Iraqi told the bench that the degree records were presented in court without any “alteration”.
The court directed Barrister Ahmed to receive replies submitted by the parties.
For his part, Barrister Ahmed argued that the case “should be heard soon”, highlighting the “urgency” of the matter.
Justice Saeed observed: “Today is the last day of this bench; the bench will hear the case as per the roster after the winter vacations.”
Following this observation, the bench extended its interim order till the next hearing.
During his media talk, Barrister Ahmed said the bench had observed that it was their last working day today and suggested that an “urgency application” may be filed later by Jahangiri’s side.
The lawyer also contended that while IHC CJ Dogar observed in his ruling on December 18 that the SHC had barred KU from taking any further action, it was not the case. “KU was not just stopped from further action, but their cancellation order had been suspended”.
He further added that “legally, the order remains suspended to date. IHC has taken a decision based on something which does not exist. A judge has been removed from office on [the basis of] an order that was suspended and remains suspended”.</p><small>2025-12-22 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2216122726a3059.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962628/pakistan-played-fearless-not-careless-cricket-to-win-under-19-asia-cup-says-head-coach' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan played ‘fearless, not careless’ cricket to win Under-19 Asia Cup, says head coach</strong></a><br><p>Head coach Shahid Anwer said that Pakistan had achieved their goal of playing “fearless but not careless cricket” after they won the Under-19 Asia Cup with a crushing victory over India on Sunday.
Opener Sameer Minhas led the way for Pakistan at the ICC Academy Ground in Dubai with a breathtaking 172 to set up a massive 191-run victory for his side.
“We began a process on June 17 [this year],” recalled Shahid at a news conference in Islamabad on Monday, following the team’s arrival and a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif where a Rs10million cash award was announced.
“It was an unprecedented step … we called up 70 players, conducted trials and gave each player four matches each and then they participated in a regional One-day tournament,” he added.
“The top performers, 30 of them, then took part in a five-month long camp … that’s how the team was made.
“We wanted to play fearless but not careless cricket. We wanted a united team and the result is in front of us.”
Team mentor and manager Sarfaraz Ahmed, who led Pakistan to the Under-19 World Cup crown in 2006, hailed a “team effort”.







“We had players that had the potential to do something big,” said Sarfaraz.
“The coaches did a lot of hard work and the players responded … our job was to give them the confidence to play to their full potential. My message to them was to play their natural game, and in a way that they remember it for the rest of their lives.”
Captain Farhan Yousaf said the players had the full backing of the team management.
“We spoke about playing fearless cricket and the management backed us to play our natural game,” he said.
“We were told us that any loss will be our [management’s] concern, while any victory will be attributed to your efforts. Our morale never went down.”
Shahid pointed to the fact that the coaching staff was lucky to have been blessed with qualified players.
“In age group cricket, most of the work is on basics,” he said. “We were lucky in the sense that these players had two qualities that we only needed to polish: one that they didn’t give up and second that they were adaptable.”
Sameer’s stunning ton was naturally one of the major talking points at the news conference and the batter said that he stuck to his natural game.
“I was focused on doing well and making runs in the final and that helped me,” said Sameer.
The political rivalry between India and Pakistan, more often than not, spills onto the cricket field and Sarfaraz said he made sure his players did not make any vile gestures in response to their counterparts.
India skipped the customary handshakes; a practice they have been carrying on since the men’s Asia Cup T20 earlier this year while one of their batters, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, made a ‘shoe-pointing’ gesture after his dismissal.
“India’s behavior regarding the game was not good, and their players’ conduct was unethical,” he said. “But we celebrated the victory, displaying sportsman’s spirit.”</p><small>2025-12-22 11:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/221231512594073.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623/bangladesh-rejects-indias-dismissal-of-protest-outside-its-high-commission-in-delhi-as-misleading-propaganda' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh rejects India’s dismissal of protest outside its high commission in Delhi as ‘misleading propaganda’</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh has rejected India’s dismissal of a protest outside its high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”, saying the incident was “highly regrettable“.
According to Bangladeshi media, around 20 to 25 protesters gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Saturday evening. According to mission officials, the protesters raised anti-Bangladesh slogans and issued threats against the Bangladesh high commissioner, Prothom Alo reported.
In response, the Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal issued a statement on Sunday saying India had taken note of “misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident”.
“The fact is that about 20-25 youth gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on December 20 and raised slogans in protest against the horrendous killing of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh, while also calling for the protection of all minorities in Bangladesh,” he said.
According to Prothom Alo, Das — a garment factory worker — was beaten to death on December 18 in Mymensingh, Bangladesh on allegations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire. It reported that 10 people had been arrested in connection with the incident.
“There was no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time. The police stationed at the spot dispersed the group after a few minutes,” the Indian official said.
“Visual evidence of these events is available publicly for all to see. India is committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions/posts in its territory in accordance with the Vienna Convention,” he added.
“India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh. Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities. We have also urged that the perpetrators of the barbaric killing of Das be brought to justice,” he said.
In response, the Bangldesh foreign ministry issued a statement, saying that the “unjustifiable incident at the Bangladesh High Commission residence in New Delhi on December 20 is highly regrettable and cannot be accepted as ‘misleading propaganda’”.







“The miscreants were allowed to carry out their activities right outside the perimeters of the high commission, creating panic among the personnel inside the complex,” it said, adding that the commission was not made aware of the event beforehand.
The statement, however, took note of the Indian government’s “commitment” towards the safety of Bangladeshi diplomatic posts in India.
Bangladesh also rejected “an attempt of the Indian authorities to depict an isolated attack on a Bangladeshi citizen, who happens to belong to the Hindu community, as attacks on minorities“.
The statement said that the government “promptly apprehended the suspects in this incident“. It noted that “the intercommunal situation in Bangladesh is better than in many other parts in South Asia”.
“Bangladesh believes that it is the duty of all governments in the region to ensure protection of minorities in their respective countries,” the statement added.
Ties between the two countries have been frosty since former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising last year.
Dhaka has repeatedly asked for her extradition so that she could stand trial for her alleged crimes, with Delhi responding that it was examining the requests.
On Thursday, protesters, seeking the repatriation of Hasina, were stopped from marching towards an Indian diplomatic mission.
A day earlier, India’s foreign ministry had conveyed its concerns over the “deteriorating” security environment in the country, following protests triggered by the killing of a prominent youth leader.</p><small>2025-12-22 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22142326498978b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962624/moscow-car-blast-kills-russian-general-hours-after-us-talks-on-plan-to-end-ukraine-war' target='_blank'><strong>Moscow car blast kills Russian general hours after US talks on plan to end Ukraine war</strong></a><br><p>A car bomb killed a senior Russian general in southern Moscow on Monday morning, the latest high-profile army figure to be blown up in a blast that came just hours after Russian and Ukrainian delegates held separate talks in Miami on a plan to end the war.
Kyiv has not commented on the incident, but Russian investigators said they were probing whether the blast was “linked” to “Ukrainian special forces”.
The attack was similar to other assassinations of generals and pro-war figures that have either been claimed, or are widely believed to have been orchestrated, by Ukraine.
Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, 56, head of the Russian General Staff’s training department, was killed when the bomb, which had been placed under his parked car, detonated in a residential quarter of southern Moscow.
AFP reporters at the scene saw a mangled white Kia SUV, its doors and back window blown out. The frame was twisted and charred from the blast.
The scene had been cordoned off by security forces, and investigators were sifting through the debris. Eyewitnesses reported a loud bang.
“We absolutely didn’t expect it. We thought we were safe, and then this happens right next to us,” local resident, Tatiana, 74, told AFP.
“The windows rattled, you could tell it was an explosion,” said Grigory, 70, who also declined to give his surname.
“We need to treat it more calmly. It’s the cost of war,” he added.
Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it was “working through various lines of enquiry into the murder. One of them involves the possible organisation of the crime by Ukrainian special services“.
Sarvarov fought in the Russian army’s campaigns in the North Caucasus, including Chechnya in the 1990s, according to his official biography on the defence ministry’s website.
He also commanded Russian forces in Syria in 2015-16.
Talks intensify
The Kremlin said Putin had been informed about Monday’s killing, which came after three days of talks in Miami as the United States intensifies its efforts to broker an end to the four-year war.
Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov and US special envoy Steve Witkoff hailed “progress” in the negotiations on Sunday.
Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev also met with the US team, which included Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law.
Witkoff had also called those meetings “productive and constructive.”
An initial 28-point plan to end the war put forward by Trump adhered to Moscow’s core demands, triggering panic in Kyiv and European capitals.
Ukraine and its allies have since been working to refine the plan, though Kyiv says it is still being asked to make massive concessions, such as giving up the entire eastern Donbas region to Russia.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed scepticism over whether Russia really wants to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands and decimated eastern and southern Ukraine.
The Kremlin on Monday also denied that it wanted to recreate the Soviet Union, seize the whole of Ukraine and more land in eastern Europe after Reuters reported that US intelligence had concluded Putin seeks much more than just control over eastern Ukraine.
Since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has been blamed for several attacks targeting Russian military officials and pro-Kremlin personalities in Russia and in Russian-controlled Ukrainian regions.
General Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy of the General Staff, was killed in a car blast near Moscow in April.
In December 2024, Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian radiological, chemical and biological defence forces, was killed when a booby-trapped electric scooter exploded in Moscow, an attack claimed by Ukraine’s SBU security service.
A Russian military blogger, Maxim Fomin, was killed when a statuette exploded in a Saint Petersburg café in April 2023.
And in August 2022, a car bomb killed Daria Dugina, the daughter of ultranationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22121748c1a5c82.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962621/lhc-cj-suspends-operation-of-punjab-land-protection-ordinance' target='_blank'><strong>LHC CJ suspends operation of Punjab land protection ordinance</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Aalia Neelum issued an interim order on Monday to suspend the operation of the newly enacted Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Ordinance, 2025, which empowers deputy commissioner-led committees to decide property disputes.
Justice Neelum issued the ruling during a hearing of petitions by Abida Parveen and others that challenged decisions pertaining to property disputes taken under the ordinance. Through her interim order, she also suspended decisions taken under the new legislation to take away the possession of properties.
Expressing her disapproval of the law, she remarked: “Someone should inform the government that if this law remains in force, even Jati Umra (the Sharif family residence) could be vacated within half an hour.
“It appears that some people want to hold all powers.”
Questioning the purpose of the law, CJ Neelum asked how could a revenue officer hand over the possession of a property in a matter pending before a civil court.
The judge observed that the new law had dismantled the civil setup, civil rights and judicial supremacy.
“If it is up to the authorities, they would even suspend the Constitution,” she added.
Justice Neelum further pointed out that in case of a deputy commissioner handing over the possession of an individual’s house to someone else under the new law, the affected person did not have the right to appeal.
“The new law does not allow the high court to grant a stay in such matters,” she noted.
The Punjab chief secretary and other government officials were present at the hearing today, but the Punjab advocate general did not appear before the court. The court was told that the principal law officer was ill.
On this explanation, Justice Neelum remarked that she, too, was ill and had been advised bed rest, but was in the court presiding over proceedings.
The CJ then said that a full bench would be constituted to further proceed on the matter adjourned the hearing.
Separately, a Punjab law officer explained to Dawn that the Punjab government could challenge the LHC’s interim order before the Supreme Court under its appellate jurisdiction.
The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the provincial government could approach the Federal Constitutional Court as well, since that case involved a question of law.
“The government may also request the proposed full bench to review the stay order. However, its chances of obtaining relief through that route are relatively slim,” he added.
The ordinance in question was approved by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on October 31 and mandates the resolution of land disputes within 90 days.
It has been challenged before the LHC, and during a previous hearing on the matter, Justice Neelum had questioned the involvement of a newly-created force under the Punjab Enforcement Regulatory Authority (Pera) in such matters.
She had also commented that “patwaris (revenue officials) and ACs (assistant commissioners) seem to have developed a desire to become judges”, and questioned the jurisdiction of a patwari to take cognisance of a matter already pending before the Supreme Court.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22071815af0e74e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962594/cdf-field-marshal-munir-awarded-king-abdulaziz-medal-for-his-efforts-to-advance-pak-saudi-ties' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir awarded King Abdulaziz medal for his efforts to ‘advance Pak-Saudi ties’</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia’s Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz has conferred the King Abdulaziz Medal of Excellent Class on Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for his efforts to “advance Pak-Saudi ties”, it emerged on Monday.
According to a report by Saudi Gazette, the medal has five classes; excellent, first, second, third, and fourth. It is usually awarded to those who have rendered outstanding services to Saudi Arabia or one of its institutions.
The official Saudi Press Agency reported late on Sunday that CDF Field Marshal Munir was given the medal in honour of his “distinguished efforts to strengthen the strategic relationship and cooperation between the two nations”.
The report added that the ceremony took place during the Saudi minister’s reception of CDF Field Marshal Munir in Riyadh.
“Prince Khalid congratulated Field Marshal Munir on his appointment as Pakistan’s chief of defence forces, wishing him continued success in his new role,” the report added.
“During the meeting, the two sides reviewed the historical Saudi-Pakistani relations and the strategic cooperation in the defence field, discussing efforts to establish the foundations of international peace and security, as well as issues of common interest,” the publication reported.
Separately, in a post on the social media platform X, the minister said, “Upon the directive of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques [the title held by the Saudi king], I presented Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir with the King Abdulaziz Medal of Excellent Class for his distinguished efforts to enhance our cooperation and advance the Saudi-Pakistani relations.”







Later on Monday morning, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that during the meeting, the two sides held discussions on matters of mutual interest, including regional security dynamics, defence and military cooperation, strategic collaboration, and evolving geopolitical challenges.
“The interaction reaffirmed the deep-rooted, historic, and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it said.







It further said that the medal was the kingdom’s “highest national honour”.
“The honour recognises Field Marshal Munir’s distinguished military service and leadership, as well as his central role in advancing defence cooperation, strategic coordination, and institutional linkages between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it said.
“It also reflects his contributions toward regional peace and stability, including sustained collaboration in counter-terrorism and security,” it added.
Earlier this year, Islamabad and Riyadh had signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
In November, the Saudi armed forces chief had relayed the kingdom’s desire to elevate its defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.
On December 3, Field Marshal Munir had also expressed satisfaction with the “robust defence collaboration” underway between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2211562026b2bf3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962619/multans-nishtar-hospital-sacks-doctor-for-misbehaving-with-patients-family-after-video-goes-viral-on-social-media' target='_blank'><strong>Multan’s Nishtar Hospital sacks doctor for misbehaving with patient’s family after video goes viral on social media</strong></a><br><p>Multan’s Nishtar Hospital has sacked a doctor working as an additional house officer for misbehaving with a patient’s family, a video of which had gone viral on social media, it emerged on Monday.
In the video, the family members could be heard saying that the patient had passed away after doctors refused to give her a blood transfusion. When the video panned to the doctor in question, he raised his arm, showing his middle finger and walking away. A large crowd could also be seen in the video.
The doctor, identified as Qasim Jamal, was suspended from duty on Dec 19, a day after the incident occurred. Meanwhile, an inquiry committee was also formed to probe the incident.
Subsequently, the hospital issued a notification the same day stating that the doctor had been terminated with immediate effect for misconduct, and violating hospital rules and professional ethics.
In the incident report dated Dec 20, the director of the Accident and Emergency Department said that the patient was admitted to the hospital in a critical condition on Thursday. It said she was in the process of being stabilised after being treated at the department and was to be transferred to a different ward for blood transfusions.
However, the patient’s condition deteriorated to a point where transfusions were no longer feasible, leading to agitation among her attendants, it said.
“Attendants misbehaved with [the] doctor as well as staff on duty,” the report said. “After that, [the] doctor also misbehaved and [showed an] inappropriate gesture to the attendants,“ it said.
It added that treatment was given to the patient “properly and accordingly”.
Meanwhile, the doctor in question also issued a detailed statement on Dec 20 in response to the incident, saying that his reaction was merely a “symbol of protest” against what he called continuous attacks and harassment by the patient’s family.
Regarding the treatment of the patient, he said that her condition had been “very critical and active treatment was ongoing” but her condition deteriorated. He said that they attempted to resuscitate her but she was later declared dead.
He said that the patient’s attendants then started misbehaving with doctors and staff, creating chaos in the emergency room. He added that there was “complete negligence on the part of the security staff, who allowed over twelve men with mobile cameras to enter the restricted area of ​​the emergency room”.
He said that while he and the other staff were treating over a dozen other patients, the attendants continued to “shout, abuse, threaten and harass” him, including getting physically violent.
“After repeated humiliation, verbal abuse, physical threats and four consecutive attempted attacks, it was impossible for any human being to remain unaffected,” the doctor said.
“My reaction was the result of continued provocation, not an unprovoked act. I state clearly that I did not abuse, misbehave or physically attack anyone. I did not utter a single word of profanity. My response was calm and disciplined,” he said.
“I admit that I was under severe mental stress and anger at that time. Protesting is a fundamental right of every individual and employee, and I exercised this right peacefully and non-violently,” he said.
He added that the hospital rules did not clearly refer to silent gestures as violations of the law, saying, “If I had used abusive language or physical assault, it would certainly have been a violation of medical ethics, but that was not the case.”
The doctor said that suspension without investigation was unfair and requested that he be reinstated in order to complete his training.</p><small>2025-12-22 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/221100307bc6415.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962614/alleged-bondi-shooters-conducted-tactical-training-in-new-south-wales-countryside-police-say' target='_blank'><strong>Alleged Bondi shooters conducted ‘tactical’ training in New South Wales countryside, police say</strong></a><br><p>Two suspects in last week’s deadly mass shooting at Australia’s Bondi Beach trained for the attack in the countryside, police alleged in court documents on Monday, as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese vowed tougher laws against hate speech and extremism.
Father and son Sajid Akram and Naveed are accused of targeting a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach, killing 15 people in the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in almost three decades.
Sajid, 50, was shot and killed by police during the attack. An Indian national, he entered Australia on a visa in 1998.
His 24-year-old son, Naveed, an Australian-born citizen, was moved from hospital to jail on Monday, police said.

 

Police documents released on Monday said the two had carried out “firearms training” in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting.
Pictures were released showing the accused firing shotguns and moving in what authorities described as a “tactical manner”.
The pair also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said.
And they made a nighttime “reconnaissance” trip to Bondi Beach just days before the killings, documents showed.
Australia observed a minute’s silence at 6:47pm (12:47pm PKT) on Sunday —exactly a week since the first reports of gunfire.
On Monday, Albanese said he would push for tough new laws creating “an aggravated offence for hate preaching”.
“We’re not going to let the ISIS inspired terrorists win. We won’t let them divide our society, and we’ll get through this together,” Albanese told reporters.
“As prime minister, I feel the weight of responsibility for an atrocity that happened whilst I’m prime minister, and I’m sorry for what the Jewish community and our nation as a whole has experienced,” he said.

 

“The government will work every day to protect Jewish Australians, to protect the fundamental right as Australians that they have to be proud of who they are, to practice their faith, to educate their children and to engage in Australian society in the fullest way possible,” he added.
Crackdown on guns, ‘terrorist symbols’
Australia’s federal government has flagged a suite of reforms to gun ownership and hate speech laws, as well as a review of police and intelligence services.
Albanese also announced last week a sweeping buyback scheme to “get guns off our streets”.
It is the largest gun buyback since 1996, when Australia cracked down on firearms in the wake of a mass shooting that killed 35 people at Port Arthur.
And the government of New South Wales — where the shooting took place — recalled its parliament for two days on Monday to introduce what it called the “toughest firearm reforms in the country”.
“We can’t pretend that the world is the same as it was before that terrorist incident on Sunday,” New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told reporters.
“I’d give anything to go back a week, a month, two years, to ensure that didn’t happen, but we need to make sure that we take steps so that it never happens again.”
The new rules will cap the number of guns an individual can own to four, or ten for exempted individuals like farmers.
There are more than 1.1 million firearms in the state, officials said.
The legislation would also ban the display of “terrorist symbols”, including the flag of the Islamic State, which was found in a car linked to one of the alleged shooters.
Authorities will also be able to prohibit protests for up to three months following a terrorism incident.

 

Minns said on Monday he would also look into stricter hate speech legislation next year, including restrictions on the phrase “globalise the intifada”.
The phrase is a common chant at pro-Palestinian rallies and refers to past uprisings against Israeli forces in the occupied territories.</p><small>2025-12-22 06:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191405567cbaaab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961661/women-claiming-the-road-in-peshawar-defining-a-quiet-scooter-revolution' target='_blank'><strong>Women claiming the road in Peshawar, defining a quiet scooter revolution</strong></a><br><p>When Saba, a social media influencer, first began riding a scooter on Peshawar’s roads, the public instantly reacted to the novel sight. As she moved through the city, she explained, people stared at her, visibly shocked to see a woman riding a two-wheeler on her own. The attention, however, did little to dampen her spirits. She kept her focus on the road ahead.
“My family’s support gave me the confidence to ignore those reactions and focus on my way,” she told Dawn.
Motorcycles dominate Pakistan’s roads, far outnumbering cars. According to a study by the Gallup Pakistan Digital Analytics Platform (GDAP) and data from the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), more than 20.4 million motorcycles were sold between 2007 and March 2025, compared to just 2.6m cars. Pakistan’s two-wheeler market is now the world’s ninth largest, recording the strongest growth among the top 50 global markets in 2025.

Despite this dominance, it is very rare to see women riding motorcycles or scooters, particularly in cities like Peshawar, often perceived as conservative. For Pakistani women, travelling on a two-wheeler is governed by socially sanctioned rules. And even though they’re unwritten, these norms are rigid. For example, a woman may not grip the handlebars herself, and as a passenger, she is expected to sit side-saddle behind a male rider. Any other posture is widely regarded as a violation of female modesty.
Defying the norms
Women like Saba, undeterred by such conventions, are quietly reshaping Peshawar’s streets. She believes the city is becoming safer and more accepting of women’s presence on the roads.
“I believe my decision has encouraged others. We can ride a scooter safely in Peshawar, as this is not immodesty; we can ride a scooter within our limits,” she said.
Saba hopes more women will push past stereotypes and barriers with confidence and determination. “I have not had to deal with any negativity or harsh words from others.”

Official figures, however, portray how rare such visibility remains. The Pakistan Digital Census 2023 shows women make up 49 per cent of Peshawar’s 4.7m population, around 2.3m residents. Yet traffic police data for 2025 indicates only 1,931 women hold driving licences in the city.
Each woman travelling through Peshawar on a scooter, therefore, is not merely a commuter but a pioneer in a quiet shift.
Research on women’s use of scooters in Pakistan suggests that ownership and use of two-wheelers can symbolise autonomy and challenge gendered norms. Studies on urban transport show how harassment and safety concerns on public transit restrict women’s mobility, making personal transport a more viable option.
“People often label Peshawar as a typical city, but my goal is to raise awareness that Peshawar’s females are just as capable as those in other cities. That is why I decided to take the first step and start riding a scooter,” said Saba.
“I have a car and a driving licence, but a scooter is very easy to ride. I can attend meetings and run errands without any difficulty.”
Empowerment through mobility
Dr Zafar Khan, a sociology lecturer at the University of Peshawar, says the sight of women riding scooters or motorcycles signals not only a socio-cultural shift but also empowerment.
“There was a time when even women driving a car was not acceptable here, but now we can see a change, with some women even riding motorcycles or scooters,” he told Dawn.

He noted that personal transport enables women to manage daily responsibilities independently. “In this patriarchal structure, their dependency on men will decrease. Motorcycles can help with tasks such as dropping children at school, commuting to college or university, or even going to the gym,” he said.
Dr Khan added that mobility also has economic implications. “If women are working, their commute becomes easier. At the university, I see several women riding motorcycles and scooters, and when I saw a girl on a bike for the first time, my first thought was, ‘change is coming’,” he said.
The academic stressed that broader societal and government support is essential. “If society, along with the government, supports women in such initiatives, it can reduce their dependence on others and protect them from harassment on public transport. Providing a safe environment will allow women to become more socially and economically empowered.”
Role of family support
Citizens of Peshawar have also stressed the importance of enabling women riders. Tahir Naeem, a native now living in Islamabad but visiting the city every weekend, said: “Females should have safe spaces. An alternative mode of transport is a good opportunity. It gives independence, reduces reliance on others and is economical.”

He added that family support is crucial for such changes to take root.
This was evident in the experience of Huma, a University of Peshawar student. She moved from riding a bicycle in childhood to riding a motorcycle in 2020, encouraged by her father.
“If the family supports you, no one can say anything,” she told Dawn. Growing up in a joint family, her father ensured that no one interfered with her decision. His backing gave her the freedom to pursue independence.
“People appreciate me for riding a motorbike, and it is a confidence booster. I feel safe riding at night, too. I have never faced negativity, though people do get shocked when they see me riding for the first time,” she said.
“Riding my bike has made my life much easier. I am independent and can get around without relying on anyone else.”
Huma also had a message for other young women: “Riding a bike has been a game-changer for me. It is about being independent and free. Many girls stop themselves because of what people might say.”
‘Change will take time’
Peshawar-based journalist Jamaima Afridi told Dawn that, being from and working in the area, she understands the challenges women face in the city. “Whenever something is unfamiliar or uncommon in society, it is bound to be challenging,” she said.
“I think this will become normal only when such women come forward and practise the basic right to freedom of movement. Over time, people will get used to it.”
She reflected on her own experience, recalling a cycling rally she organised in her village. “It drew a lot of criticism, but it also made people realise that women should have the right to cycle,” she said.
Afridi emphasised that creating public debate around women riding bicycles or motorcycles is the first step toward building space for their mobility.
“The initial women taking this step will face difficulties: stares, criticism, claims that they are ‘ruining the culture.’ But with time, it will improve. The key is that as many women as possible practise this right, creating visibility and normalising it,” she said.
A quiet revolution
The number of women riding scooters in Peshawar may still be small, but their visibility signals something larger: a shift in how women are claiming space in a city that is, gradually, learning to make room for them.
“My Peshawar is wonderful,” Saba said with a sigh, “and it is getting better for girls.”

Spot gold rose 1.2 per cent to a record $4,391.92 an ounce, while spot silver climbed 2.7opc by 0344GMT to hit a historic high of $69.23.
Bullion has gained 67pc so far this year, shattering multiple records and breaching the $3,000 and $4,000 per ounce milestones for the first time. It is poised for its biggest annual gain since 1979.
Silver has surged 138pc year-to-date, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by robust investment inflows and persistent supply constraints.
“With December usually producing positive returns for gold and silver, seasonality is on their side,” said StoneX senior analyst Matt Simpson.
“Given that gold has already risen 4pc this month and we’re nearing the end of the year, bulls may want to tread with caution as volumes are to deplete and odds of profit-taking are also likely on the rise.”
Traditionally viewed as a safe-haven asset, gold has been supported by heightened geopolitical and trade tensions, steady central bank buying and expectations of lower interest rates next year.
A softer dollar has provided an additional tailwind by making the metal cheaper for overseas buyers.
Markets are currently pricing in two US rate cuts for next year despite the Federal Reserve signalling caution. Non-yielding assets such as gold tend to benefit in lower interest rate environments.
Simpson said two Fed rate cuts were pencilled in for 2026, with a faster US jobs slowdown and a shift to a more dovish Fed likely to add further upside to gold.

The directive was issued by Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah while chairing a meeting of officials representing the KMC, zoo and relevant departments.
The meeting reviewed the existing conditions, management practices and future planning related to exotic animals housed at the zoo.
Mr Shah emphasised that the government was committed to ensuring animal welfare, ethical management and compliance with international best practices concerning captive wildlife.
He stated that uncontrolled breeding of exotic species, especially big cats, posed serious challenges in terms of animal welfare, space constraints, safety and long-term management, and needed to be addressed without delay.
During the meeting, the KMC and zoo authorities were directed to initiate immediate measures to halt the breeding of exotic animals and develop a clear, time-bound plan in consultation with qualified wildlife experts.

 

The chief secretary underscored the need for expert guidance to ensure that all actions taken were scientifically sound, humane and aligned with conservation principles.
He further instructed that a comprehensive assessment of existing exotic animals at the zoo be carried out, including their health, habitat conditions and future care requirements.
“The focus should remain on responsible wildlife management, discouraging unnecessary captivity and breeding of exotic animals, and promoting practices that prioritise animal well-being and public safety,” he noted during the meeting.
It might be recalled that three lion cubs were born at the zoo last month.

The latest IMF estimates suggest Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) receipts rose from 8.9 per cent of GDP in the fiscal year 2023-24 to 10.3pc in 2024-25, but still missed the Fund’s programme target of 10.7pc.
For the current fiscal year, the IMF projects FBR revenue at 11.1pc of GDP, which would then remain flat at that level until FY30.

 

In absolute terms, FBR revenue increased from Rs9.3tr in FY24 to Rs11.74tr in FY25, with a massive shortfall. For the current year, collections are projected at Rs13.98tr, implying a shortfall of Rs328 billion under existing assumptions.
The IMF noted that tax revenue collection in FY25 fell short by Rs1.224tr relative to budget projections and by Rs524bn relative to the lender’s first review target. About Rs850bn of the shortfall relative to the budget reflected faster-than-expected inflation deceleration and lower-than-expected GDP growth in FY25.

Forecasts provincial taxes to offset stagnant federal collections

The inflation deceleration at the end of FY25 led to a revenue shortfall of Rs157bn relative to the first IMF review target. The remaining portion of about Rs380bn was broadly linked to administrative and enforcement challenges that remained unaddressed throughout FY25, chiefly because of prolonged settlement of tax court cases that delayed the recovery of significant revenue amounts.
Overall revenues, including non-tax receipts, rose sharply to 15.9pc of GDP by the end of FY25 from 12.6pc in FY24. The Fund attributed the increase mainly to stronger receipts from the petroleum levy and State Bank profits.
The IMF expects the petroleum levy to remain a key source of revenue, rising from Rs1.02tr in FY24 to more than Rs2.2tr by FY30. It projected the levy’s contribution at about 1.1pc of GDP over the medium term, rising to around 1.2pc in the current and next fiscal years before easing back.
The Fund projected direct taxes to remain unchanged at 5.5pc of GDP through FY30, while the sales tax ratio is expected to hover around its existing level of 3.5-3.6pc of GDP.
It said major contributions are projected to come from provincial taxes on the expectations of successful implementation of the agriculture income tax and sales taxes on services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to increase from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27, rise further to 1.6pc of GDP in FY28 and then stay flat until FY30.
In absolute numbers, the four provinces that collected Rs929bn in FY25 are expected to deliver Rs1.22tr during the current fiscal and further improve their collection to Rs1.77tr in FY27. They would build upon this base to collect Rs2.5tr in FY28, Rs2.8tr in FY29 and cross Rs3.1tr in FY30.
The Fund said projected FBR collections would depend on advancing reforms to raise revenues through tax policy simplification and base broadening, supporting fiscal sustainability and creating space for climate resilience, social protection, human capital development and public investment.
It noted that FBR revenues rose 26pc year-on-year in FY25 to 10.3pc of GDP, a historically high level, but overall tax revenue still fell short of the target by 0.3pc of GDP, largely due to delays in resolving court cases over disputed taxes (0.4pc of GDP) and lower-than-expected inflation. Lower-than-budgeted federal subsidies and grants, estimated at 0.2pc of GDP, helped offset the impact of the revenue shortfall.
The IMF said provinces had begun implementing new agricultural income tax (AIT) regimes, including measures to strengthen compliance and address underreporting.
“However, significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, notably fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities,” the Fund observed, adding that the provinces have also ensured that all services, except for a limited list of exemptions, are subject to GST.
It said the cross-country evidence suggests that countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc, as has been the case for Pakistan over a long time.
In this way, the Fund projected the consolidated fiscal deficit at 5.4pc of GDP in FY25, easing to 4pc this year, before declining to 3.2pc in FY27 and FY28, and then to 2.8pc in FY30.

According to the programme circulated by the Privatisation Commission on Sunday, bids will be submitted between 10:45am and 11:15am, while bids will be opened at 3:30pm, a process that will be shown live on television networks, as decided by the government.
The three bidders are: a consortium comprising Lucky Cement Limited, Hub Power Holdings Lim­ited, Kohat Cement Com­pany Limited, and Metro Ventures (Private) Limi­ted; a consortium comprising Arif Habib Corporation Limited, Fatima Fertiliser Company Limited, City Schools (Private) Limited, and Lake City Holdings (Private) Limited; and Air Blue (Private) Ltd.
Chairman of the Privatisation Commission and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation, Muhammad Ali, said during a YouTube interview that Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd had decided to quit the bidding process for PIA.
Mr Ali explained that on Tuesday, after submission, the sealed bids will be placed in a transparent box, following which the board of the Privatisation Commission will meet and fix the reference price.
Thereafter, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) will meet and approve the reference price, which will be announced during the opening of the bids.
He further explained that if bids are higher than the reference price, there would be an open auction. However, if the bids are less than the reference price, priority will be given to the highest bidder.
About the next step, the adviser said that the federal cabinet will approve the transaction within days, followed by the signing of the documents which the Privatisation Commission has received from the bidders. After the signing of the documents, the commission will have 90 days to fulfill some procedures, including the transfer of properties, liabilities and leased aircraft.
Transaction structure
As per the transaction structure, the bidding will be on the basis of a 75 per cent stake in PIA. Out of the 75pc bidding amount, 92.5pc will go to PIA instead of the national exchequer, while only 7.5pc will go to the national exchequer.
He said 25pc of PIA shares will remain with the government, which will be a valuable asset. However, the successful bidder will have the option to acquire the remaining 25pc after payment or leave it with the government.
According to Mr Ali, the valuation of the remaining 25pc shares of PIA will take place after the decision on the 75pc stake. The government has given bidders the option to decide whether to pay for the remaining 25pc within 12 months with a 12pc premium.
The bidders will have to take a decision on the 75pc stake on Tuesday, whereas for acquiring the remaining 25pc , they would have to take a decision within 90 days.
He said the bidders had sought to make payment for the 75pc stake over one year; however, the government did not agree to this proposal. If the performance of PIA declines within a year, the bidder would decide against the purchase, and if performance improves, the bidder would decide in favour, which would be unfair to the government, he said.
He said the winning bidder will deposit two-thirds of the bid within 90 days, while the remaining one-third will be deposited within a year.
Mr Ali said the revival of PIA would have an impact on GDP growth and the economy as a whole.
Pakistan has the lowest contribution of the aviation industry to GDP. Compared to 18pc in the UAE and 8.5pc in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan’s aviation sector contributes only 1.3pc to GDP. However, due to the potential in PIA, this percentage would increase considerably, he said.
Of PIA’s 34-aircraft fleet, only 18 aircraft are currently in operation. However, PIA has air service agreements with 97 countries, besides landing rights in over 170 countries.

 

PIA’s current net profit is Rs11 billion, with equity of Rs30bn. He said liabilities of Rs26bn will remain with PIA, and bidders will pay these over five years.
About the employees, he said that under the proposed agreement, no employee can be fired for one year. Employees’ pensions and perks are fully protected, while the pension liabilities of retired employees, including medical benefits and discounted tickets, will be borne by the holding company.
He said that in 2011, PIA had 11,500 employees, which has now reduced to 6,500, a reduction of 5,000 employees over five years.
Mr Ali said PIA is such an asset that if not properly managed, colossal sums of money will be lost; however, if run with proper management, it could generate mammoth earnings. With a country of 250 million people, PIA has customers, destinations, routes and landing slots.
What is required, he said, is investment, the addition of aircraft and efficient management, which the government cannot provide.
The type of decision-making required at PIA can only be undertaken by the private sector, and if the airline is properly managed, PIA could return to its glory days, Mr Ali remarked.

The latest approvals come days after the United Nations said the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank — all of which are illegal under the international law — had reached its highest level since at least 2017.
The Israeli government’s decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69, according to a statement from the office of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
“The proposal by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defence Minister Israel Katz to declare and formalise 19 new settlements in Judea and Samaria has been approved by the cabinet,” the statement said, without specifying when the decision was taken.

Decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69

Smotrich is a vocal proponent of settlement expansion and a settler himself.
“On the ground, we are blocking the establishment of a Palestinian terror state,” he said in the statement.
“We will continue to develop, build, and settle the land of our ancestral heritage, with faith in the justice of our path,” he said.
UN chief condemns move
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel’s “relentless” expansion of settlements in the occupied territory.
It “continues to fuel tensions, impede access by Palestinians to their land and threaten the viability of a fully independent, democratic, contiguous and sovereign Palestinian State”, he said earlier this month.
Since the start of the war in Gaza, calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state have proliferated, with several European countries, Canada and Australia recently moving to formally recognise such a state, drawing rebukes from Israel.
Sharp increase in settlements
A UN report said the expansion of settlements was at its highest point since 2017, when the United Nations began tracking such data.

 

“These figures represent a sharp increase compared to previous years,” Guterres said, noting an average of 12,815 housing units were added annually between 2017 and 2022.
“These developments are further entrenching the unlawful Israeli occupation and violating international law and undermining the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,” the UN chief said.
Excluding east Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank, along with about three million Palestinian residents.
Smotrich’s office said the 19 newly appro­ved settlements are located in what it descr­ibed as “highly strategic” areas, adding that two of them — Ganim and Kadim in the nort­h­ern West Bank — would be re-established after being dismantled two decades ago.
Five of the 19 settlements already existed but had not previously been granted legal status under Israeli law, the statement said.
While all Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory are considered illegal under international law, some wildcat outposts are also illegal in the eyes of the Israeli government.
Many of these, however, are later legalised by Israeli authorities, fuelling fears about the possible annexation of the territory.
US President Donald Trump has warned Israel about annexing the occupied West Bank.
“Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened,” Trump said in a recent interview to Time magazine.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, and violence there has soared since the Gaza war erupted in October 2023.
Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 1,027 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank alone since the start of the fighting in Gaza, according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian health ministry figures. At least 44 Israelis have been killed in the occupied West Bank in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations during the same period, according to Israeli data.

Under the initiative, farmers will be able to apply digitally through the Zarkheze app for financing of up to Rs1 million. After verification and agronomic assessment, applications will be forwarded to the bank chosen by the farmer for processing.
The programme provides that 75 per cent of the financing will be disbursed in kind for the purchase of agricultural inputs through banks’ pre-approved agri-vendors. Farmers will also receive advisory services through the Land Information Management System (LIMS).
Officials said the product was designed not only to provide financing but also to improve productivity by ensuring access to quality inputs and advisory services.
To encourage banks to increase lending to small farmers, the government has offered 10pc first-loss coverage and an operational cost subsidy of Rs10,000 per borrower for the net increase in banks’ outstanding borrowers.
Commenting on the initiative, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said it was part of the government’s push for financial inclusion and rural development, adding that it would support national food security goals.

 

SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad said Zarkheze “is a pivotal step in improving the small farmers’ access to finance”.
He stressed that digitising the credit process would reduce hurdles for small farmers and make formal lending more accessible and timely, while also supporting the goal of promoting digital payments in the rural economy.
PBA Chairman Zafar Masud said the banking industry would continue to work closely with the Ministry of Finance and the SBP to expand outreach and streamline processes for farmers across the country.
“By leveraging advanced technology and innovative credit assessment methods, we aim to improve access to finance for smallholder, particularly landless, farmers operating within a largely undocumented sector,” he added.
The Zarkheze application is available on the Google Play Store. Farmers may also visit their nearest bank branch for assistance with digital onboarding.

Since 2015-18, the federal government has upgraded FBISE through a Rs50 million project, “Modernisation and Standardisation of Examination System.”
The project was a brainchild of Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal.
According to documents, the project was completed in three years “with accomplishment of all set targets.” After completion of the project, the then PML-N government wanted to replicate it across the country. However, with the change of its government the plan could not be executed. 

Planning, education ministries and FBISE working on proposed project, says board chairman

According to documents, a series of meetings of the project steering committee represented by all provinces was held in 2018-19, but no tangible progress could be made due to lack of interest by the provinces.
“After completion of the PML-N tenure in 2018, the new government of PTI did not prioritise this project and provinces too did not show any seriousness and the project was surrendered in 2019,” said an official source.
He said now, once again, the Planning Ministry is headed by Ahsan Iqbal and Dr Ikram Ali Malik, who had executed the project from 2015-18, is the chairperson of FBISE. 
“So the government with the support of FBISE wants to provide same facilities and technology to all the 30 examination boards in the country,” the official said.
FBISE has completed concept papers for launching the new project and soon a presentation would be given to the planning minister. According to the working paper, the estimated cost of the project is Rs2 billion. Under the proposed project, three data centres with resources will be set up in provinces. Besides other facilities, provision of scanners and PC for scanning, customisation of software, delivery and training are part of the new project.
When contacted, the FBISE chairperson said on the direction of the federal government, the board was extending technical help to all the 30 boards. 
“Recently, we conducted a training workshop for all boards and we are also transferring technology to the boards. But for executing all the plan, new resources and manpower are required; therefore, a new project has been planned,” he said and added that in the new project all components of previous project of FBISE (2015-18) had been added in addition to new items.  
Sharing the details of new items, Dr Malik said the use of Artificial Intelligence in assessment process, introduction of verbal communication, certification on educational assessment for highly qualified persons, academic and resource audit, post-examination analyses and publication of examiner reports were part of the proposed project.
“Ministries of Planning, Education and FBISE are working closely on the proposed project and soon FBISE will give a briefing to planning minister in this regard,” he said. 
To a query about willingness of provinces, he said all provinces were excited to modernise their educational boards.
Recently, State Minister for Federal Education Wajiha Qamar while addressing participant of a workshop organised by FBISE called for forward-looking vision and introduction of technology-driven reforms in the national examination system. She said the government will always be supporting all educational boards in embracing digital transformation, which will lead to transparent, credible and student-centred examination processes.

The date coincides with the second anniversary of the 2024 general elections, in which the current PML-N government rose to power.
Claiming that the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before, the TTAP also decided to form a committee headed by Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, with Haleem Adil Sheikh, Zain Shah and others to constitute committees at the provincial and district level.
The TTAP announced that it will also organise conferences at all provincial headquarters and engage bar councils, civil society and the public for efforts for the restoration of the Constitution, rule of law and democracy in Pakistan.







Those who attended today’s conference included TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, PTI leaders Asad Qaiser and Salman Akram Raja, Balochistan National Party (BNP) chief Akhtar Mengal and others.
CM Afridi, who also attended the conference, told media persons that, as per the directions of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, the preparations for the countrywide movement have been started.
“We will meet every person and will tell them to wait for the second call. We will go to Rawalpindi, Lahore, KP and other parts of the country,” he said while replying to questions.
According to the declaration from the conference, as democracy was not possible without free and fair elections, an effort would be made to ensure free and fair elections.







Participants demanded the immediate appointment of a neutral chief election commissioner and next elections be held under a reconstituted Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
They also demanded an independent investigation into the February 8 elections and to identify and punish “responsible personalities”.
Participants were of the view that the judiciary was dismantled through the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments and alleged that conscientious judges, including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Athar Minallah, and Lahore High Court Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza, were forced to leave the institution, with arrangements made to sideline the remaining judges.
They further alleged that most recently, action was taken against Islamabad High Court Judge Justice Tariq Jahangiri, who was removed from his office over a fake degree. The conference claimed that these officials demanded to restore the judiciary in accordance with the original 1973 Constitution.
The conference also condemned the convictions against the PTI founder and his wife and the “inhumane treatment” of Imran’s sisters, including “their being attacked by water cannons.”
Additionally, the participants demanded the release of prisoners, including Imran, his wife Bushra Bibi and PTI leaders Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Ejaz Chaudhry, Yasmin Rashid and Sarfraz Cheema, among others.







TTAP also condemned the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), alleging that it was passed to curtail media freedom, additionally showing concerns over the economic strangulation of Dawn Media Group.
Moreover, the participants expressed complete solidarity with journalists who “lost their jobs under the system” and denounced the narcotics case against journalist Matiullah Jan. The cases registered against lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatha, were also condemned.







The opposition was also of the view that statements and reports regarding the deployment of Pakistan’s armed forces in Gaza reflected “alarming non-transparency”. They demanded that the nation be taken into confidence before any decision was made.
The conference additionally cited the World Bank, claiming that over 44 per cent of Pakistan’s population lived below the poverty line, while the International Monetary  Fund (IMF) reports indicated corruption amounting to Rs 5,300 billion. They assailed the government for failing to curb unemployment, inflation, and poverty and lacked a roadmap for relief.







The TTAP also expressed concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in Sindh and Balochistan and demanded the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other Baloch detainees.
The opposition alliance demanded the implementation of unanimous resolutions passed by the KP Assembly Jirga and the release of outstanding federal dues to the province. It also called for lifting the ban on the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement.
They said under the 18th Amendment, minerals belonged to the provinces and that entering into international mining agreements without taking provincial governments and local populations into confidence violated it.
The TTAP also demanded the immediate restoration of student unions across the country.
In view of the ongoing national crisis, the conference unanimously agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.</p><small>2025-12-21 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/21202125fb39d81.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962452/security-forces-neutralise-9-terrorists-in-two-separate-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces neutralise 9 terrorists in two separate KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed nine terrorists as a result of two separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On 19 December 2025, nine khwarij belonging to Indian proxy fitna al khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It added that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists in the Dera Ismail Khan district of the province.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, four khwarij were sent to hell.”
Per the statement, the second IBO was conducted in the Bannu district. “In ensuing fire exchange, five more khwarij were effectively neutralised by the security forces.”
The ISPR said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain terrorists, who had remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, law enforcement agencies, and the target killing of innocent civilians.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as a relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” it said.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.
Last week, security forces had killed 13 terrorists in two operations in Mohmand and Bannu districts of the province.</p><small>2025-12-21 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/211426295b05440.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962442/pakistan-rout-india-to-clinch-u-19-asia-cup-title-as-sameer-minhas-and-ali-raza-star' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rout India to clinch U-19 Asia Cup title as Sameer Minhas and Ali Raza star</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan produced a dominant all-round performance to thrash arch-rivals India by a massive 191 runs in the final of the U-19 Asia Cup at the ICC Academy Ground on Sunday, claiming the prestigious title in emphatic fashion.
Opener Sameer Minhas lit up the first half of the match with a record-breaking 172 — the highest individual score in a U-19 Asia Cup final — propelling Pakistan to a formidable 347 for 8 after being asked to bat first.
In reply, India’s much-vaunted batting line-up crumbled spectacularly, folding for a paltry 156 in just 26.2 overs as pacer Ali Raza ripped through the order with figures of 4 for 42.
The victory marked a sweet redemption for Pakistan, who had suffered a heavy defeat to the same opponents in the group stage and had entered the final as underdogs against an unbeaten Indian side.
Instead, it was Pakistan who delivered a clinical display, overwhelming India in every department to lift the trophy amid jubilant celebrations.
India captain Ayush Mhatre won the toss and elected to bowl, perhaps hoping to restrict Pakistan on a surface expected to assist the seamers early on.
However, the decision backfired spectacularly as Sameer launched a brutal assault from the outset. After Hamza Zahoor fell early for 18, Sameer combined with Usman Khan (35) and Ahmed Hussain (56) in substantial partnerships — 92 for the second wicket and 137 for the third — to put Pakistan in complete command.
The right-hander brought up his century off 71 balls and raced to 172 off 113 deliveries, studded with 17 fours and nine sixes, before falling to a slower ball from Deepesh Devendran in the 43rd over.
A late flurry of wickets — five falling for 45 runs in the final overs — prevented Pakistan from reaching 400, but their total remained the highest ever posted in a U-19 Asia Cup final.
Khilan Patel was the pick of India’s bowlers with 2 for 44, while Devendran claimed 3 for 83.
Chasing 348, India started explosively, racing to 21 in the first over off Ali Raza, with Vaibhav Suryavanshi smashing a six and four in an over that also included a no-ball and extras.
Suryavanshi continued the onslaught, striking three sixes and a four in his blistering 26 off 10 balls.
But the introduction of spin and disciplined pace turned the tide irreversibly.
Captain Mhatre (2) holed out to mid-off, Aaron George (16 off 9) miscued a pull, and Suryavanshi nicked behind — all falling to Raza and Mohammad Sayyam as India slipped to 49 for 3 in the fifth over.
The collapse deepened. Vihaan Malhotra (7) was bowled attempting a rash pull off Abdul Subhan,
Vedant Trivedi (9) found short midwicket, and Abhigyan Kundu (13) upper-cut to deep third. Kanishk Chouhan (9) and Khilan Patel (19) offered brief resistance, but regular strikes kept India on the back foot.
Lower down, Deepesh Devendran provided late entertainment with a quickfire 36 off 16 balls, including six fours and two sixes, but his dismissal — skying one to point off Raza — ended any lingering hopes.
Subhan (2-29) and off-spinner Huzaifa Ahsan (2-12) chipped in effectively, while Sayyam supported with 2 for 38.
India’s innings lasted a mere 26.2 overs, underscoring Pakistan’s bowling dominance and fielding sharpness after the break.
The margin of victory was the largest in a U-19 Asia Cup final, completing a comprehensive rout.
Man of the Match Sameer was hoisted onto his team-mates’ shoulders as Pakistan celebrated wildly, while India, unbeaten until the final, were left to rue a day when nothing went right.</p><small>2025-12-21 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/69474bb7d20dc.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962166/the-assassination-of-liaquat-ali-khan' target='_blank'><strong>THE ASSASSINATION OF LIAQUAT ALI KHAN</strong></a><br><p>In a mystery, the sleuth must be believably involved and emotionally invested in solving the crime.
  — Diane Mott Davidson
On Tuesday, 16 October, 1951, around 4 pm, the first prime minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan, was going to address a public meeting in Company Garden in Rawalpindi. As he walked to the microphone and uttered the words“Baraadaraan-i-Millat”  [Brothers of the Nation], a man named Said Akbar, sitting on the ground near the dais, fired two bullets at him in rapid succession with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. 
Chaos and mayhem suddenly erupted in the meeting. Khan Najaf Khan, the Deputy Superintendent of Police who had personally supervised the security arrangements, yelled in Pashto, “Who fired the shots? Shoot [him]!”. Within seconds, a police inspector, Mohammad Shah, came running with his service revolver drawn and shot Said Akbar five times at close range, in such a haphazard manner that he missed one shot altogether. 
As Said Akbar was lying on the ground dying, he was also stabbed more than 26 times with spears by Muslim League volunteers. The recording equipment of Radio Pakistan was on and captured the sounds of the firing and the chaos for one minute and 13 seconds, and then fell silent. The entire shooting episode ended within 48 seconds. The recording is available online. Liaquat Ali Khan was taken to the Combined Military Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. 
The assassin, Said Akbar, was my father, who had come to Rawalpindi from Abbottabad on 14 October. 

One of Pakistan’s founding fathers and the country’s first prime minister was assassinated at a public gathering 74 years ago. Despite the formation of an Inquiry Commission and two other police investigations — one by Scotland Yard — until today, there has been no satisfactory closure regarding those tragic events. Now, the son of the assassin has penned his own investigation into the events in the shape of a book, which provides, for the first time ever, his family’s perspective as well as delves into the weaknesses of the official accounts and spans Pakistan’s tumultuous history — from the first war over Kashmir, the Rawalpindi Conspiracy and internal friction within the new state’s functionaries.

INTELLIGENCE FAILURES
Neither the CID (Criminal Investigation Department) nor the police personnel had any prior knowledge of Said Akbar’s presence in Rawalpindi, let alone at the public meeting. All police and CID claims about keeping Said Akbar under surveillance in Rawalpindi for three days prior to the murder, upon close examination, turned out to be false; stories that were fabricated after the tragedy. No CID or police official was able to establish Said Akbar’s identity in the public meeting.
Soon after the incident, Inspector Abrar Ahmad went around checking hotels in Rawalpindi Saddar to see if Said Akbar had stayed in any of them, when, after two hours, he got lucky at Grand Hotel, where Said Akbar was staying. The hotel clerk immediately identified and confirmed that the body was that of Said Akbar, who was staying at the hotel. That led police to Abbottabad and, by nightfall, with the help of a few men from the neighbourhood, they arrived at Said Akbar’s home.
Said Akbar’s eldest son, 11-year-old Dilawar Khan, was with the father in Rawalpindi, and was sitting in front of him in the public meeting. He heard the shots and saw the prime minister fall. He turned around to ask father why the prime minister had fallen and what was happening and saw the chaos erupting and people attacking his father. He got scared and ran away, leaving his shoes behind.
The assassination of the prime minister was a sudden, unexpected and shocking event for Pakistan. In the days following the incident, when the police and the CID officials started to examine the circumstances of the crime, they had no prior information about the incident, no relevant intelligence reports, and no leads to follow.

COMMISSION OF INQUIRY
On 25 October 1951, the government appointed a ‘Commission of Inquiry’, consisting of Mr Justice Mohammad Munir, judge of the Federal Court, as the president, and Mr Akhtar Hussein, Financial Commissioner, Punjab, as his associate. The Commission examined 66 witnesses in 38 sessions, 23 in Lahore and 15 in Rawalpindi. Four months later, on 28 February 1952, the Commission submitted its report to the chief secretary, Government of Punjab. From the final version of the report, 73 names, clauses and sentences were omitted, mostly for security reasons. This obfuscated the report and made it look quite weak.
The Commission looked at five major factors to see if they had any bearing on the assassination. It examined at length various documents about Said Akbar, from January 1947, when he and his older brother, Mazrak Zadran, surrendered to the British authorities in North Waziristan, till October 1951. 
These pertained to their detention under the Bengal Regulation III of 1818, which determined their official status, starting in British India and then in Pakistan, and records of all the places they visited in Pakistan. Nearly all of this was irrelevant to the tragedy in Rawalpindi as the Commission did not find any valuable clues in Said Akbar’s travels, his contacts with people, and his lifestyle.
Next, the Commission examined the security arrangements at the public meeting, the circumstances under which the prime minister was killed, and recorded statements by witnesses. In some cases, after much rambling discussions, the Commission concluded that certain CID and police personnel made false statements. High-ranking officials, such as Khan Najaf Khan, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Rawalpindi, gave evasive answers to questions of the Commission. It was Najaf Khan who suggested, supervised and approved the security arrangements at the public meeting. 
Other officials either lied or gave exaggerated accounts to the Commission to protect themselves. Inspector Mohammad Shah, who had shot and killed Said Akbar, was not questioned by the Commission.


The weapon Said Akbar used for the assassination was a semi-automatic pistol of this model, German-made 9mm Walther P38, which he had bought from a tribesman in 1948, who was returning from the war in Kashmir | The Assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan: 1947-1952

 
POSSIBLE MOTIVES
The Commission also examined possible motives for the crime. It considered three: first, that Said Akbar killed the prime minister in a fit of insanity, but could not find any evidence to support it. 
Second, he did so out of resentment over the prime minister’s policy regarding Kashmir. In fact, some time in the summer of 1951, Said Akbar had volunteered to raise a lashkar [band of fighters], pay for their food and other expenses, and lead them in the jihad to liberate Kashmir, but the Commission considered Said Akbar’s offer a “hoax” and rejected it.
Third, that he did not like the un-Islamic lifestyle of the prime minister and because his wife, Begum Ra’ana Liaquat Ali, did not observe purdah [veil] in public. But this also turned out to be a baseless story.
It then examined various theories of conspiracy to see if Said Akbar was part of any of them but did not provide details of any conspiracy and discarded each of them and, in fact, stated its inability to uncover any conspiracy. 
Police searched Said Akbar’s home three times and took away all items they considered important, including books, documents, air gun, money, mother’s gold, photos etc. A summary of the items was given in the Inquiry Report. 
The public was not satisfied with the findings of the Commission because it failed to fulfil its own mandate and provide transparent answers to the very questions it was tasked to investigate. The two important questions for which the Commission could not find answers were: what was Said Akbar’s motive? And if the murder was the result of conspiracy, then who were his accomplices?
POLICE INVESTIGATIONS 
The task of the Commission was to examine the circumstances of the crime, and not to identify any individuals who might be implicated, because that was the task of criminal investigation by police. 
There was only one police investigation conducted in 1951-2, in Lahore, when our family was taken there. We were kept there for about five months, during which time mother was questioned through an interpreter. It was this investigation that the Inquiry Commission alluded to but gave no details, as it was on-going at that time. 
Scotland Yard’s official Cecil Edwin U’ren referred to the same investigation as “headed by Chaudhry Mohammad Hussein, Superintendent of Police, CID, Lahore, and his team.” He quoted extensively from the Munir-Hussein Inquiry Report, but did not include any information from Chaudhry Hussein’s report and, what is more, did not even discuss his own conclusion with him. 
The public and the media raised further questions about the U’ren report. The prime minister’s widow, Begum Ra’ana Liaquat Ali, strongly reacted to the U’ren Report and raised several questions, but no one in Pakistan, whether the police, politicians or journalists, provided satisfactory answers.
The report by Chaudhry Mohammad Hussein and his team allegedly got destroyed when the plane carrying the police Inspector General Etezazuddin, crashed in August 1952. But curiously, Scotland Yard’s official Cecil Edwin U’ren was given access to it in 1954-5. That is because the documents pertaining to the investigation were safe and available. All the statements about the documents being destroyed were deliberate attempts by the government to protect unnamed army officers and government officials, and divert public attention from the case.

MY INVESTIGATIONS
The Inquiry Report at best described the circumstances under which the prime minister was killed. It provided sufficient background information for me to see the gaps and discrepancies in the description of events and flow of information. The assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan was the result of a well-planned conspiracy by the plotters. Said Akbar indeed had accomplices in Abbottabad, in Rawalpindi, and right at the public meeting on 16 October, 1951.
This work is driven by numerous questions that are explored in the chapters of the book. These are questions that have been asked multiple times since 1951, but not answered truthfully. For example, why would Khan Najaf Khan yell an order in Pashto at the public meeting in Rawalpindi, to shoot the person who fired the shots? 
How did Dilawar Khan, Said Akbar’s son, come up with the story that his father had seen Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi in a dream on 13 October, 1951, who told Said Akbar to kill Liaquat Ali Khan? In fact, it was the police who repeatedly instructed Dilawar what to say and how to answer investigators’ questions.
Because the police had to find a motive for the crime, they invented the story of Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi and put it in Dilawar’s head. The police created that story from a document taken from Said Akbar’s home during one of the searches, which had names of Muslim warriors, including Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, written on it.
Over the decades, the Liaquat Ali Khan murder turned into a mystery, the result of some deep-rooted conspiracy, which no one seriously attempted to solve. The major reason was the investigation report by Chaudhry Mohammad Hussein that was deliberately never made public, and no other truthful statements came from the government. The Munir-Hussein inquiry and that by U’ren of the Scotland Yard went in two different directions, while exploring the same incident.
The former did not answer the questions it formulated to explore. The latter concluded that Said Akbar committed the crime because he was socially isolated, void of any reasoning, and had inherited some kind of criminal genes.
For me, it has been like solving a dozen separate but related puzzles, in which each one the actors played different roles. But when connected, the small puzzles make a giant puzzle, one that sheds light on the dark corners of the tragedy and attempts to provide transparent answers.
KASHMIR AND SAID AKBAR
The goal of the book is to find the hard and transparent answers of the case in plain and easy language. It attempts to inform and educate the readers and let them rethink and have a fresh look at history. 
It neither glorifies Liaquat Ali Khan as a martyr nor condemns Said Akbar as the assassin. Here Liaquat Ali Khan is presented as a politician who had both his loyal followers and rivals in the government, but he also committed blunders, particularly his decision to accept the ceasefire agreement in Kashmir, which also sealed his fate.
The prime minister was a refugee from India, and Said Akbar was a refugee from Afghanistan, who had no personal grudge against the prime minister and no motive to kill him. He had no cultural roots in Pakistan and was not savvy in Pakistani politics. But he became interested in the Kashmir war solely because the social and political atmosphere in Pakistan was awash with pro-Islamic and anti-Hindu speeches, media stories and Friday’s sermons in mosques. 
The constant clamour of jihad to liberate Kashmir from Hindu-domination naturally influenced young Said Akbar, who had seen Kashmiri refugees in Abbottabad and the Pashtun tribesmen who went to fight in Kashmir.
Religion played a nominal role in Said Akbar’s life in Afghanistan as, over the centuries, Islam had been adapted and blended with Pashtunwali, the Pashtun code of social and moral conduct. Being a good Pashtun naturally meant being a good Muslim. In Pakistan, he became interested in religion starting in mid-1949 and began to learn about Islam, but his goal was personal and pragmatic, not scholarly. 
He sought meaning in his life, to make sense of the social and political turmoil in Pakistan, and to understand the fervour of jihad in Kashmir through religion and Iqbal’s poetry. These provided the justification for jihad in a simple and pragmatic sense.
It is important to note that the ceasefire agreement in Kashmir came into effect on 1 January, 1949, and hostilities stopped. However, Said Akbar’s interest in jihad started in mid-1949. Curiously, this is also the period when Maj Gen Akbar Khan, ringleader of the Rawalpindi Conspiracy, first spoke openly about overthrowing Liaquat Ali Khan’s government.
Said Akbar knew many tribal fighters from his Zadran tribe, some of whom visited him. It was during this period that Said Akbar became acquainted with men who were active in the war in Kashmir, and those who hated the ceasefire agreement that the prime minister had accepted, and therefore lost the chance to march on to Srinagar.
Some of these people eventually persuaded Said Akbar, in the summer of 1951, to assassinate the prime minister and, in the process, became his accomplices and facilitators.
I have taken it upon myself as my moral and ethical duty to uncover the truth to the best of my ability. It is something that I owe to the people of Pakistan, to my family, and to myself, while living thousands of miles away in the United States.
THE RAWALPINDI CONSPIRACY
Political assassinations are well-planned, meticulous operations by the plotters, their accomplices, facilitators, and those who carry out the deeds. Secrecy is the key to the success of such operations. Whether the crime is successfully committed or it fails, the news, stories and conspiracies later become part of public discussions. The plotters and accomplices remain hidden from the public eye. That is what happened in October 1951.
The Rawalpindi Conspiracy was the first coup attempt to topple the government of Liaquat Ali Khan and eliminate him. But it failed. On 9 March, 1951, the ringleader, Maj Gen Akbar Khan, and his collaborators were arrested. That was because, earlier in February, an insider of Akbar Khan’s group, Inspector Askar Ali, CID Peshawar, informed I.I. Chundrigar, governor of North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), who informed the prime minister.
The documents of the Rawalpindi Conspiracy presented in the court showed that “late Hon’ble Liaquat Ali Khan, along with his personal attendants… would be called and cleared.” That is, arrested and executed. The list also included the name of the first Pakistani Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Gen Ayub Khan, who “was shocked that he was to be shot.” When the first attempt failed, many officers thought of taking a bold action.
In the second week of May (1951), Maj Hassan met some other officers in Rawalpindi who were also apprehending arrest, and there was some talk of confronting the authorities and taking some desperate step. But the idea was given up. There was no leadership, and the suspected officers were far too demoralised and isolated from the top command to undertake the dangerous course of mutiny.
The trial of those accused in the Rawalpindi Conspiracy started on 15 June, 1951 and, four months later, on 16 October, 1951, the prime minister was assassinated in the same city.
I came across the Munir-Hussein Inquiry Report (1952) in the Asia Collection of Hamilton Library at University of Hawai’i at Manoa, in 1998. Since 2007, I have read the Report many times and re-read parts of it more than 30 to 35 times, taking copious notes on small individual events. In the process, it started to dawn on me that there were discrepancies in the recording of many events. 
In 2010, I bought a copy of the Rawalpindi Conspiracy. Many events described in the book coincided with changes in Said Akbar’s life, and some of the people mentioned in the book were also known to Said Akbar.

THE U’REN REPORT
In November 2016, I went to London to visit the British Library and Scotland Yard, looking for a copy of Cecil Edwin U’ren’s Report (1955). After a few days of searching, I was told that the report was in the National Archive. About a month later, the National Archive put the photocopy of the report on a website and allowed me access to it for a fee. 
I finally downloaded a photocopy of the report as it was published in Dawn on 25 June, 1955, along with other related documents, and the response by Begum Liaquat Ali Khan, the widow of the prime minister to the U’ren Report. The report is a photocopy of the columns in Dawn and does not have chapters and page numbers.
U’ren concluded that Said Akbar alone plotted to assassinate Liaquat Ali Khan, and that no one else was involved in any conspiracy. His report exonerated the police officials, satisfied the politicians, but very cleverly avoided getting involved in the controversies of the case. He expressed sympathy with police personnel for the undue duty-related stress they had to suffer during the investigation. He spuriously questioned Inspector Mohammad Shah, who had shot and killed Said Akbar, and did not even meet Khan Najaf Khan, Deputy Superintendent of Police.
The only valuable piece of information in the U’ren Report was that the police investigation conducted in 1951-2 was not destroyed in the plane crash in August 1952, because U’ren was given access to it in 1954-5.
U’ren considered Chaudhry Mohammad Hussein a highly competent police officer, whose team had conducted the only criminal investigation of the case. However, he did not quote any information from Chaudhry Hussein’s report. In other words, the U’ren report did not uncover a single piece of fresh and relevant evidence. His own conclusion was based on evidence that was skewed and faulty and had no bearing on the assassination of the prime minister. In short, his conclusion amounted to another cover-up.
Epilogue
There are also other sides to the story. Journalists and writers continue to write on Liaquat Ali’s murder and narrate at length his life and achievements as prime minister, and how his widow, Begum Ra’ana Liaquat Ali, was later sent abroad as ambassador. But there has never been a shred of objective information about Said Akbar before October 1951, and about his family after that.
Hasan Zaheer, author of The Time and Trial of the Rawalpindi Conspiracy, stated:
In March 1995, I wrote to the former prime minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, requesting permission to consult the official records of the Rawalpindi Conspiracy and related background materials for this study. I thank her for graciously acceding to my request.
I personally would like to examine the investigation report by Chaudhry Mohammad Hussein and his team and other related documents of the assassination of the prime minister, which have been collecting dust in some government archives. However, in the current political atmosphere of Pakistan and the fact that I am an American citizen, it would require authorisation by high government officials and sincere cooperation of others. Something I cannot count on.
I realise that certain events are described more than once in different chapters of the book because each chapter analyses one or more related questions of the case and describes the characters and the different roles they played in the tragedy. All events eventually culminated in the killing of Liaquat Ali Khan and Said Akbar in less than a minute.
The author is the third son of Said Akbar, the assassin of Liaquat Ali Khan, and was born in North Waziristan. He lived and studied in Abbottabad, Kabul, Beirut and Honolulu, where he completed his doctorate in linguistics. He has taught in Hawai’i, Muscat and Beijing and at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California. He currently lives in California in the US
