• Israeli strike kills another journalist
CAIRO: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military would enter the besieged enclave “with full force” in the coming days, vowing not to stop the war.
A statement from the office of Israeli PM Netanyahu on Tuesday said, “In the very coming days, we are going in with full force to complete the operation.”
“Completing the operation means defeating Hamas. It means destroying Hamas,” Netanyahu said during a meeting with injured reserve soldiers in his office late Monday.
“There will be no situation where we stop the war. A temporary ceasefire might happen, but we are going all the way,” he added.
Israel resumed major operations across Gaza on March 18 amid a deadlock over how to proceed with a January 19 ceasefire that had largely halted the war with Hamas.
Earlier this month, Israel’s government approved plans to expand its Gaza offensive, with officials talking of retaining a long-term presence there.
During the meeting with soldiers, Netanyahu said Israel was working to find countries that may be willing to take in Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.
“We’ve set up an administration that will allow them (Gaza residents) to leave but… we need countries willing to take them in. That’s what we’re working on right now,” he said.
Journalist killed
An Israeli airstrike on the Gaza Strip on Tuesday killed a well-known Palestinian journalist who it accused of working with Hamas and was recovering in hospital from an earlier strike, the territory’s health ministry said.
Israel accused the journalist, Hassan Aslih, who has hundreds of thousands of followers on social media platforms, of taking part in the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas.
It said Aslih had documented and uploaded footage of “looting, arson and murder” during the incursion into Israel.
Ahmed Siyyam, a Gaza civil emergency service member, told Reuters the attack hit the third floor of a Nasser Hospital building in the southern city of Khan Younis. Dozens of patients and injured were also being treated at the hospital.
Two patients, including Aslih, were killed and several others were wounded, the health ministry said.
Israel’s military said in a statement it struck Hamas members operating from within a “command and control centre” located at the hospital. It didn’t name them.
Reuters footage showed heavy damage to one of the hospital buildings, including the medical equipment and beds inside.
According to the International Federation of Journalists, at least 160 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since October 2023.
Officials in Gaza put the number at 215, and accuse Israel of deliberately targeting journalists. Israel denies targeting journalists and says it tries to avoid harm to civilians.
Aslih headed the Alam24 news outlet and worked as a freelance photojournalist. He was wounded last month in a deadly strike on a tent in the Nasser hospital compound.
Some 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken prisoner in the October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel’s response has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and destroyed much of the enclave. A blockade on aid supplies since March 2 has left the population at critical risk of famine, according to a UN-backed monitor.
A senior World Health Organisation official warned on Tuesday that hunger and malnutrition could have a lasting impact on “an entire generation”.

The deputy prime minister, in an interview with CNN, said Pakistan had no choice but to launch strikes in self-defence following cross-border stri­kes by India on May 7.
Terming India’s strikes “war and a wishful attempt to establish its hegemony in Kashmir,” Mr Dar said Pakistan was “very sure that our conventional capa­city and capabilities are str­ong enough” to beat Ind­ian ground and air forces.
Deputy PM Dar said there was no direct contact between Indian and Pakistani officials before US intervention, contradicting a previous assertion made by India that Pakistan’s director general of military operations contacted his counterpart with an offer for talks.
When asked how the cea­sefire deal was rea­ched, the foreign minister said Pakistan’s “counter-escalation” brought world powers into the picture.
 
 

After Pakistan’s strikes on May 10, Mr Dar said, “[C]ertain capitals, particularly the  US, realised it could be a really filthy next move.”
He claimed to have received a call from Mr Rubio, who had talked to India’s external affairs minister, S. Jaishankar.
“[Mr Rubio] said India is ready to stop it now … Would you be willing? I said of course …  if India does not restart [escalations] we would not do it.”
“[The Indians] had seen what happened in the sky. They could see how serious the damage was,” he said while talking about possible reasons for India’s agreement for ceasfire.
Negotiations
Mr Dar said Pakistan was looking forward to establishing a path for long-term peace and security that would provide dignity for both sides.
Calling Kashmir the root cause of this regional instability, Mr Dar called for granting the self-determination right to the Kashmir people. He reiterated that Pakistan was not behind last month’s attack in Pahalgam, saying, “We condemn terrorism in all forms and all manifestations”.
On negotiations with India to resolve longstanding issues, Mr Dar said talks between the countries were yet to begin. “We still hope sense will prevail,” he said, adding it was in the “interest of everybody” not to delay or to leave such issues “beyond a certain reasonable time”.
He warned the cease­fire could be threatened if the water issue was not resolved. “Failure to resolve the water issue will amount to an act of war.”
Separately, Information Minister  Attaullah Tarar told Sky News that India had not yet stopped the flow of water to Pakistan after New Delhi unilaterally held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance after the Pahalgam attack .
He said India lacked the capacity to stop the water from flowing in three western rivers given to Pakistan as part of the treaty.
“At present, the flow of water was continuing as usual,” the minister said in the interview aired on Tuesday.
Strategic success
He remarked that the ceasefire between Pakistan and India was a result of the diplomatic efforts of various countries.
He said the ceasefire was not a weakness of Pakistan but a “strategic success”. “India was not in a position to bear further tension.”
Mr Tarar welcomed President Trump’s desire to resolve the Kashmir dispute, calling it a “good sign”. He said India accused Pakistan of being invovled in the Pahalgam attack without evidence. However, India “failed miserably” in linking the attack to Pakistan.
The attack, which took place in the presence of “around 700,000 Indian troops” in occupied Kashmir, was a “security and intelligence failure”, he added.
Mr Tarar reiterated Pakistan’s sacrifices in the war against terrorism, saying operations against terrorists were still ongoing on the western borders.
The minister denied any “safe havens” for terrorist groups inside Pakistan.

The diplomatic tit-for-tat began with India declaring a Pakistani official posted at its High Commission in New Delhi persona non grata, accusing him of engaging in activities “not in keeping with his official status”. The official was ordered to leave the country within 24 hours, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a brief statement.
India’s move followed the arrest of two individuals in Indian Punjab on Sunday, who were allegedly involved in leaking sensitive military information to a purported Pakistani handler. According to Punjab Police, one of the suspects had been passing details about Indian Army movements,  reportedly under the direction of an official linked to the Pakistani mission in Delhi.
The chargé d’affaires of the Pakistan High Commission was summoned and handed a formal demarche regarding the expulsion. Later the same evening, Pakistan responded in kind by expelling an Indian High Commission official,  identified as Shankar Reddy Chintala. The Foreign Office stated that the official had been “found involved in espionage in violation of his privileged status”.
In its statement, the Foreign Office said the  Indian diplomat had been declared persona non grata and was instructed —  along with his family — to leave Pakistan within 24 hours. The Indian  chargé d’affaires was summoned and handed a demarche expressing  Pakistan’s strong protest against what it called “undesirable  activities”.
The FO also reminded the Indian mission to ensure  that its staff adheres to diplomatic norms and does not engage in  conduct incompatible with their diplomatic status. The expulsions mark a  sharp deterioration in already fraught relations, coming on the heels of  military clashes and accusations of ceasefire violations and  cross-border strikes.

• FO says will closely monitor Indian actions, take necessary measures to preserve rights under Indus treaty
• Security forces jam, seize ‘Indian surveillance drone’ in Lahore
ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Tuesday said it rem­ai­ned committed to the current ceasefire understanding with India, but any fut­ure aggression will be met with full resolve, as the Foreign Office lambasted a provocative spe­ech delivered by the Indian prime minister on May 12.
A statement issued by the Foreign Office said that Pakistan rejected “the provocative and infla­mmatory assertions” made by the Indian premier, and the remarks were “a dangerous escalation rooted in misinformation, political opportunism, and a blatant disregard for international law”.
In his speech, PM Modi had accused Pakistan of retaliating with strikes on Indian military and civilian targets, claiming that India’s air defence systems repelled the attacks and inflicted significant losses on Pakistan. He also said Pakistan requested a ceasefire through military channels on May 10 after its ‘failed’ retaliation. India accepted the ceasefire conditionally, PM Modi said, warning that future Indian responses would depend on Pakistan’s behaviour.
Pakistan dismissed this portrayal as “yet another blatant lie” and said that the ceasefire was achieved “as a result of the facilitation of several friendly countries” and any claim to the contrary was “misinformation and propaganda”.
 
 

In light of the ceasefire, the two sides are hammering out its operational details. The first post-ceasefire contact between the heads of military operations from the two countries resulted in an understanding that the two sides would uphold the truce and reduce troop deployment along the international border. Another round is expected soon.
The FO said the Pahal­gam incident was used as a pretext to attack Pakis­tan, “justify military adv­e­n­turism, serve domestic political objectives… and reinforce a manufactured narrative of a perpetual external threat”.
“After the unlawful and unprovoked Indian aggression…India recklessly provoked the situation further by targeting Pakistan’s military bases, risking an uncontrollable escalatory spiral,” the statement said, adding that the Indian actions brought the entire region to the brink of disaster. Pakistan accused India of “justifying the cold-blooded murder of innocent civilians… as the ‘new normal’ for the region”.
According to the statement, Pakistan will monitor Indian actions in the coming days and it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty. “Make no mistake, we will closely monitor India’s actions and behaviour in this regard in the coming days. We also urge the international community to do the same,” it said.
In response to India’s allegations of terrorism sponsorship, Pakistan said, “We are a victim of terrorism, being directly sponsored by India. … Our contributions and sacrifices in the global fight against terrorism are well known.”
The statement also condemned India’s unilateral actions, citing New Delhi’s violation of the Indus Waters Treaty. “Pakistan will take all necessary measures to preserve its rights under the treaty,” it said.
While alluding to the unilateral suspension of Indus Waters Treaty, the Indian premier had said, “India’s stand is very clear… Terror and talks cannot go together… Terror and trade cannot go together…. Water and blood cannot flow together.”
PM Modi, in his speech, declared that India would not tolerate “nuclear blackmail or state-sponsored terrorism,” announcing a new policy that rules out dialogue with Pakistan outside the context of terrorism and Azad Kashmir.
 
 

The Foreign Office countered, saying, “Peace is the true strength. The world is not served by theatrical militarism and grandstanding but by mature leadership, regional cooperation, and respect for international norms.”
The statement reaffirmed Islamabad’s support for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.
“Pakistan is a sovereign nation with resilient institutions, a committed populace, and a globally recognized role in maintaining peace and security,” the Foreign Office said. “Our commitment to peace must never be mistaken for weakness. Any future aggression will also be met with full resolve.”
Indian Ministry of External Affairs, in its reaction to FO statement, said, “The terrorist infrastructure sites that India destroyed were responsible not only for the deaths of Indians but of many other innocents around the world. There is now a new normal. The sooner Pakistan gets used to it, the better.”
Meanwhile, an Indian drone was spotted in Lahore by the security forces, who brought it down near the Lahore airport by using the GPS jamming technology.  Sources in the law enforcement agencies said it was an “Indian surveillance drone” which was launched by the neighbouring country after the ceasefire agreement.

• Imposes up to Rs100m fine on sale of smuggled petrol
ISLAMABAD: The government has introduced a landmark bill in the National Assembly aimed at digitally tracking petroleum products from import and production to retail sales in a bid to curb smuggling and adulteration, which cause massive revenue losses estimated at Rs300-500 billion annually besides affecting environment and vehicle engines.
The Petroleum (Amend­ment) Act, 2025 — moved by Pet­roleum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik on Monday — seeks to amend the 1934 Petroleum Act. The draft law envisages new clauses for information technology-based tracking of petroleum products to curb smuggling and to initiate strict actions against illegal transportation and decantation of petroleum products, along with actions to be taken against illegal petrol pumps.
All local refineries and major oil marketing companies have been demanding — both individually and from their collective forums — that the government take stringent measures at borders and at domestic locations of production and sale to control smuggling of petroleum products, including LPG, as it negatively affected their businesses and caused substantial revenue losses to the government.
A 2020 inquiry ordered by the then-prime minister estimated that over Rs250bn worth of petroleum products were being smuggled annually, mostly from Iran. In April 2024, a joint intelligence report revealed that nearly 10 million litres of Iranian petrol and diesel were entering Pakistan daily via land and sea, causing a revenue loss exceeding Rs227bn.
This report entailed complete identities, addresses and contact numbers of 100 black sheep in around a dozen law enforcement agencies, owners and operators of 533 illegal petrol stations across the country, and 105 smugglers of Iranian oil. The report also contained precise information about informal border crossings and routes for trafficking smuggled items throughout Pakistan.
Officials and sources in the oil industry suggest these rep­orts were just the tip of the iceberg and did not cover the business and operations of the adulteration of petroleum products.
The new clauses also empo­wer the government to enable confiscation of petroleum products, equipment, machinery, tra­n­sportation and storage faci­lities by deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and designated officers under the Customs Act, 1969, before and after conviction to provide for stringent administrative action against illegal activities.
For swift legal proceedings, trial powers for offences under the act will be vested in sessions courts, while administrative enforcement will rest with deputy and assistant commissioners.
Another clause provides a right of appeal in the high court, and yet another binds the Department of Explosives or other respective regulatory authorities to revise, extend, or allow new licences in a given timeframe.
One clause outlines a framework for digital tracking and monitoring of petroleum products using real-time data and coordinated action between government agencies. This includes tracking storage points, petrol stations and transport vehicles using IT-enabled systems.
Under the draft law, any individual found importing, transporting, storing, producing or selling petroleum products illegally would face a fine of Rs1m, rising to Rs5m for repeat offences. Facilities found operating without a valid licence would be sealed, and their machinery, tanks and stock confiscated. The owner would be subject to a Rs10 million fine. Those with expired or cancelled licences would be granted a six-month grace period for renewal. Failure to do so would result in confiscation and a Rs1m fine.
The Department of Explosives will renew the licences within a month upon receiving the required documents and the fee. The owner of a premises or facility involved in the storage or sale of smuggled petroleum products will be liable to closure and all machinery, equipment, mat­er­ials, storage tanks and petroleum products being employed or sold will be confiscated along with a fine of Rs100m. The licence of such facility will also be cancelled. Any means of transportation involved in transporting smuggled petroleum products will also be confiscated.

The Saudis escorted Air Force One into the kingdom with fighter jets before bringing out long-stretching guards of honour and sending flag-waving cavalry to accompany Trump’s motorcade to the palace.
Under imposing chandeliers, Trump welcomed a promise by Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, for $600 billion in investment and quipped that it should be $1 trillion.
 


“We have the biggest business leaders in the world here today, and they’re going to walk away with a lot of cheques,” Trump told the prince.
For “the United States, it’s probably two million jobs that we’re talking about”, Trump said.
The White House said that Saudi Arabia would buy nearly $142bn in weapons in what it described as the largest-ever weapons deal, although Trump in his first term trumpeted a larger, longer-term figure.
The White House said that Saudi company DataVolt will invest $20bn in artificial intelligence-related sites in the United States, while tech firms including Google will invest in both countries — welcome news for Saudi Arabia, which has long faced restrictions in US advanced technology.
With cameras rolling, a lengthy procession of Saudi royalty and business figures waited their turn to shake hands with Trump and the crown prince, including Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and a close adviser to Trump, who made a rare appearance in a suit.

The US leader will head later in the week to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, fellow oil-rich Arab monarchies with long-standing ties to the United States — and to Trump.
In choosing the Gulf for his first major tour, the 78-year-old billionaire is again bypassing traditional presidential stops among Western allies, some of which have been unnerved by his norms-shattering diplomacy.
Eight years ago, Trump also chose Saudi Arabia for his first overseas trip, when he posed with a glowing orb and participated in a sword dance.
 


Saudis seek image change
Trump’s embrace of the Saudis contrasts with a more hesitant initial approach by former president Joe Biden, who had vowed to punish the crown prince after US intelligence found that he ordered the murder of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.
Trump reminisced with the 39-year-old crown prince over their first meeting, saying he was “so impressed with this young guy who was very wise beyond his years”.
Since Khashoggi’s gruesome killing, Saudi Arabia has worked aggressively to change its image, from easing restrictions on women to diversifying from oil to new areas such as artificial intelligence.
The country has also increasingly exercised diplomatic clout, serving as a venue for the United States to pursue talks with Ukraine and Russia.
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have also sought outsized international roles, with the Qataris serving as a mediator along with the United States and Egypt in the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Jon Alterman, senior vice president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said that for Trump, the Gulf “is his happy place”.
The leaders will “flatter him and not criticise him. And they’ll treat his family members as past and future business partners”, he said.
Israel and Trump at odds over Iran nuclear strategy
Israel is threatening military action against Iran while US President Donald Trump pursues diplomacy, exposing a growing rift between the long-time allies over how to confront the Islamic Republic’s advancing nuclear programme.
As a fourth round of indirect talks between Iran and the US kicked off in Muscat on Sunday, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar emphasised that his country would not allow Tehran, under any circumstances, to develop its nuclear programme.
“The most dangerous regime must not be allowed to obtain the world’s most dangerous weapon,” said Saar.
Like Western countries, Israel suspects its arch foe Iran of wanting to acquire nuclear weapons.
Tehran denies these allegations, defending its right to civilian nuclear energy.
“If military operations are necessary […] so be it,” said Israeli President Isaac Herzog in an interview published this week by the German newspaper Die Welt, while also stating that he wanted to give “dialogue a chance”.
In 2015, Iran and several major powers signed an agreement regulating Tehran’s nuclear development, including uranium enrichment, in exchange for the gradual lifting of sanctions that had been imposed on the country since the mid-2000s.
Military option
However, in 2018, the United States, during Trump’s first term, withdrew from the agreement, rendering the deal largely ineffective.
Since then, Iran has resumed much of its nuclear activities.
The country is now enriching uranium up to 60 per cent, well above the 3.67pc limit set by the agreement, but still below the 90pc threshold required for making nuclear weapons, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since his return to the White House, Trump has initiated new negotiations, which Israel opposes.
Israeli officials have also expressed irritation at another agreement made behind their backs between Washington and Houthi rebels in Yemen.
“Israel insists that the [nuclear] agreement be much more comprehensive [than the one in 2015] and that Iran not be allowed to domestically enrich uranium,” geopolitical analyst Michael Horowitz told AFP.
According to him, Israeli authorities now believe that “Tehran can quickly develop a weapon if it chooses to.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who applauded Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, has emphasised that Israel is prepared to use all means necessary to stop the Islamic Republic from developing its nuclear capacity.
“The deal that truly works is the one that eliminates Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons,” he said in late April, urging for the complete “dismantling” of the nuclear programme.
‘Awkward position’
“There are currently many voices in Israel suggesting that there is a window of opportunity to use military force if necessary,” said Raz Zimmt, director of Iran studies at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv.
According to him, the idea of strikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure is motivated by two factors.
The first being the perception that Iran has been weakened after Israel targeted its defence systems in October 2024.
Secondly, the fact that Hezbollah is also diminished after its conflict with Israel in 2024, and thus “incapable of retaliating” to defend Tehran, its major ally.
Experts interviewed by AFP say that if Israel were to strike Iranian nuclear sites, the United States would likely be expected — at the very least — to be ready to defend Israel in the event of Iranian retaliation.
“A strike with the support or even participation of Washington can be much more effective,” said Horowitz.
“Trump’s positions are putting Israel in an awkward position: he (Netanyahu) doesn’t want to be at odds with the new administration, but he is beginning to understand that Trump wants a deal at all costs.”
Zimmt says, however, that “it is highly unlikely that Netanyahu would oppose Trump” if the latter signed an agreement with Iran.</p><small>2025-05-13 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/131931409acab9d.png?r=194916' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789/in-rare-interview-imrans-sons-call-attention-to-their-fathers-incarceration' target='_blank'><strong>In rare interview, Imran’s sons call attention to their father’s incarceration</strong></a><br><p>In a rare public appearance, former prime minister Imran Khan’s sons — Suleman Khan (28) and Qasim Khan (26) — called attention to their father’s incarceration.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.
 
 

This is the first time the two have publicly talked about their father’s incarceration. They were allowed by a court in November 2023 to contact him every week, but these talks, according to them, have not always been facilitated.
In an interview with X influencer Mario Nawfal on why they chose to speak out now, Qasim said: “We’ve gone through the legal routes. We’ve gone through every route that we thought would potentially get him out. We never thought he would be in there a fraction of how long he’s been in there. And it’s only getting worse. And, so, we’ve somewhat run out of those options. And now we’ve decided the only route of taking action is to come and speak publicly.”
He added: “What we want is international pressure on Pakistan right now, because currently he’s living in inhumane conditions. They’re not giving him basic human rights … They’re not really doing anywhere near enough. And what we want is global pressure.”
On the topic of a lack of success so far through legal channels, Suleman said: “We’ve exhausted other options [and] legal avenues and it’s gone very quiet. It seems, in the international media, it seems to have gone very quiet.”
 


The PTI has frequently complained about Imran’s facilities and has filed several petitions in the Islamabad High Court regarding the issue. On the other hand, the jail administration has refuted the claims.
Questioned about the calls by US official Richard Grenell for their father’s release, Suleman said the two had not had any contact with him so far but were grateful for “all the support he’s shown”.
Regarding a message they had for the Trump administration on the topic, Suleman said: “We’d call for any government that supports free speech and proper democracy to join the call for our father’s release.”
Qasim similarly said he wanted the international community to “look at what’s going and hopefully take action and who better than Trump to gain the attention of.
“We’d love to speak to Trump or try and figure out a way where he would be able to help out in some way. Because, at the end of the day, all we’re trying to do is free our father, bring democracy in Pakistan and just ensure his basic human rights.”
Talking about the toll the situation had had on them, Qasim said “it’s been pretty brutal”.
The brothers claimed their phone calls were set up with their father at odd times with limited duration, adding that the failure to miss the calls “meant going a long time before they could talk to him again.”
They further claimed they spoke to Imran only once every two or three months.
The brothers said they did not want to participate in politics, adding that they had taken permission from Imran before speaking out in the interview.
The two have stayed away from the limelight, with their mother, British journalist and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith, stressing that her sons had nothing to do with Pakistani politics.
In 2022, after anti-PTI protests were held outside her UK residence, she wrote on the former Twitter platform, “[…] I have got nothing to do with Pakistani politics and neither have my children. They are low-key private individuals who are not even on social media.”
The following year, Jemima expressed her disappointment with X owner Elon Musk for taking away the previous blue-tick verification from accounts after trolls made fake accounts of her sons.
“Fake accounts pretending to be my children, created by imposters with a political agenda in Pakistan. This is exactly what I feared would happen when you took away Twitter’s verification blue ticks. FYI my children are not on social media & have no plans to be,” she said.</p><small>2025-05-13 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13191744c87979d.jpg?r=204328' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910790/pm-directs-measures-to-broaden-tax-net-tech-use-to-prevent-evasion' target='_blank'><strong>PM directs measures to broaden tax net, tech use to prevent evasion</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday called for measures to broaden the tax net, directing the authorities to take strict action against individuals and sectors involved in tax evasion.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) missed its collection target by nearly Rs831 billion in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, mainly due to a decline in import volume and lower-than-expected inflation, which hit sales tax collections. The tax body collected Rs 2.299 trillion in July-April FY25 against the budgetary target of Rs 10.130tr. On monthly terms, it collected Rs846bn in April against the target of Rs963bn, which indicates a gap of Rs117bn.
The prime minister, chairing a review meeting on broadening the tax base and increasing tax revenue, said that the individuals and sectors capable of paying taxes must be brought into the tax net.
He also instructed the stringent accountability of officers and personnel assisting the tax evaders, according to a statement by the PM Office.
The meeting was informed that the tax revenue target equivalent to 10.6 per cent of GDP would be attained as a result of reforms in the FBR.
The prime minister lauded the efforts of the government’s economic team for swiftly heading towards achieving the FBR’s revenue targets for the current fiscal year. He said that expanding the tax net was the government’s priority to reduce the tax burden on the common man by lowering their tax rates.
The prime minister directed officials to complete the digital monitoring of cement and other sectors by next month. Besides, the efforts to increase tax revenue from the tobacco sector should be accelerated in collaboration with the provinces, PM Shehbaz said.
He directed that pending tax-related cases should be pursued effectively to ensure the recovery of the nation’s money. While calling for collective efforts for the country’s development, he said the national economy was stable and moving towards growth.
The participants were informed that the complete implementation of the Track and Trace System at cement plants nationwide led to a significant increase of billions of rupees in tax revenue. With the implementation of this system in the sugar industry, tax revenue increased by 35pc from November 2024 to April 2025.
It must be noted that the International Monetary Fund has revised the FBR revenue collection target for FY25, decreasing it to Rs12.333tr from Rs12.913tr, marking a reduction of Rs580bn.  The shortfall is primarily attributed to reduced import tax collection, sluggish manufacturing growth and unexpectedly low inflation, which has dropped to the lowest single digits in decades.
The FBR paid Rs427bn in refunds to taxpayers in 10MFY25, up 1.18pc from Rs422bn in the same period last year. However, Rs43bn was refunded in April, almost the same amount as last year.
In July-April, income tax collection totalled Rs4.479tr, exceeding the target of Rs4.152tr by Rs327bn. The income tax collection grew 28pc compared to last year`s Rs3.505tr.
The sales tax collection fell short of the target by Rs774bn in 10MFY25, totalling Rs3.174tr against the target of Rs3.948tr. The sales tax collection rose 27pc compared to last year`s Rs2.498tr.
The customs collection also fell short of the projected target by Rs228bn to Rs1.043tr in 10MFY25 against the target of Rs1.271tr. The customs collection recorded a growth of 17pc when compared with last years Rs894bn. The Federal Excise Duty collection fell short of the target by Rs156bn to Rs603bn in 10MFY25. The excise duty recorded a growth of 33pc over last years Rs453bn.</p><small>2025-05-13 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/131742452ff63ce.jpg?r=174323' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910779/junaid-akbar-submits-resignation-as-pac-chairman-to-pti' target='_blank'><strong>Junaid Akbar submits resignation as PAC chairman to PTI</strong></a><br><p>PTI MNA Junaid Akbar on Tuesday said he had handed over his resignation as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to the party.
The development came after it emerged that PTI founding chairman Imran Khan had directed Akbar to resign from the position and focus on provincial matters.
In a video statement issued today, Akbar confirmed that he had handed over his resignation to PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, saying that he readily accepted the decision of the party and Imran.
“Whatever the decision of the party and the decision of Imran Khan, I will not think for a moment and will readily accept it,” he said.
Akbar said the position was a responsibility given by the party and he would accept any decision by the PTI founder, including handing over the party presidency or resignation from the assembly.
PTI’s central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, had confirmed to Dawn, that Akbar would step down as PAC chairman. He said Imran had conveyed the message through his sister Aleema Khan during their last meeting and announced that Akbar would be replaced by Omar Ayub Khan. He said Aleema conveyed the message to Salman Akram Raja after coming out of Adiala Jail.
Akbar was elected unopposed as chairman of the PAC in January this year. In the same month, he was appointed by Imran as the president of PTI’s KP chapter, replacing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.
The position had been vacant since the February 2024 general elections, which brought the PML-N government to power. The PAC chairmanship is usually held by the leader of the opposition or their nominee, though there is no legal requirement for this parliamentary tradition.
After the general elections, the PTI made several U-turns over nominating a candidate for the post of PAC chairman. Sher Afzal Marwat was initially nominated, followed by the names of Akram and Omar. Ultimately, Akbar’s name was finalised for the post.</p><small>2025-05-13 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13155538374cb9c.jpg?r=163642' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910767/more-funds-to-be-allocated-for-education-sector-in-upcoming-budget-kp-cm' target='_blank'><strong>More funds to be allocated for education sector in upcoming budget: KP CM</strong></a><br><p>Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ali Amin Gandapur on Tuesday vowed that the provincial government will make education a “top priority” in the upcoming budget and allocate more resources towards the sector, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The chief minister’s concerns follow in the wake of the unexpected textbook shortage in the province which has disrupted classes, high dropout rates, and Pakistan’s “low” ranking in the District Education Performance Index Report 2020-23.
“Presiding over a meeting in Peshawar, he directed measures to enhance teachers’ capacity, ensure 100 per cent merit in new recruitments, and establish schools in rented buildings in areas where they are urgently needed,” the report said.
During the meeting, it was decided that comprehensive and multi-faceted measures would be taken to increase student enrollment in schools. In this regard, schemes would be included in the upcoming budget to support various activities.
“Gandapur expressed concern that in some districts,  the rate of out-of-school children remains alarming, and the declaration of an education emergency is a necessary step to reduce this number and improve enrollment rates,” it added.
The chief minister emphasised strengthening the monitoring system and taking steps to provide missing facilities such as laboratories, examination halls, and other essential infrastructure in existing schools.
During the last two decades, students received books from the provincial government free of charge at the start of the scholastic year in April.  Two years ago, the government decided to deliver only half of the required books as the costs reached over Rs10 billion, directing the schools’ administration to collect old books from the students promoted to the next grades and fulfil the remaining book requirements.
This year, however, a complex situation has emerged in schools as the textbook board claims that it has printed all the books requested by the education department but students and teachers have complained about a shortage of books.
In August last year, an official report placed the country’s education system in the ‘low’ performance category and highlighted critical areas requiring attention to improve education outcomes.</p><small>2025-05-13 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13154757e7e8cd7.jpg?r=161633' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910764/shoaib-malik-steps-down-as-domestic-cricket-mentor-with-love-and-gratitude' target='_blank'><strong>Shoaib Malik steps down as Domestic Cricket Mentor with ‘love and gratitude’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani all-rounder Shoaib Malik announced his resignation from the role of Domestic Cricket Mentor today through a social media post on X.
He submitted his formal resignation to the Pakistan Cricket Board two weeks ago, saying he believed it was “time to move on” to ensure fairness and pay attention to multiple personal and professional responsibilities in his life.
“This was not an easy choice, but after reflecting on my commitments, I realised that juggling multiple responsibilities would prevent me from giving my best — both to Pakistan cricket and to my other professional and personal priorities,” he wrote in his post.
The former skipper added he would continue to serve the role according to his contractual obligations, giving PCB enough time to appoint a new mentor for the next season.
Malik also expressed immense gratitude to PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, the PCB executive team, his former teammate and director of Champions Events Wahab Riaz, the coaching staff at Stallion, and the players who “entrusted him with the opportunity to share his knowledge.”
“Working with some of Pakistan’s most talented cricketers has been an immensely fulfilling experience, one I will always cherish.”
 






Malik has served as the captain of Pakistan cricket from 2007 to 2009. He made his one-day international debut in 1999 by starting his career as an off-break bowler. Eventually, Malik gained a name for being a batting all-rounder.
He appeared in 287 one-day internationals and scored 7,534 runs with nine hundreds. As an off-spinner, he finished with 158 wickets, while he also captained Pakistan in 41 ODIs.
He confirmed his retirement from one-day cricket post-2019 World Cup.</p><small>2025-05-13 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13153339d6c10ad.jpg?r=153433' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910762/bulls-dominate-as-psx-climbs-over-1000-points-upon-boost-in-investor-sentiment' target='_blank'><strong>Bulls dominate as PSX climbs over 1,000 points upon boost in investor sentiment</strong></a><br><p>Bulls maintained a hold of the trading floor at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday as shares gained over 1,000 points, continuing their upward momentum following de-escalation between India and Pakistan.

Finally, the index closed at 118,575.88 points, up 1.09pc or 1278.15 points compared to yesterday.
A day earlier, the PSX gained a record 9pc, with the market mirroring the restored calm in the region after the Pakistan-India ceasefire. The development, announced by US President Donald Trump on Saturday, followed four days of tit-for-tat strikes between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as well as diplomacy and pressure from Washington.
Commenting on today’s surge, Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities said: “Investor sentiment, initially lifted by the ceasefire, has been further boosted by Trump’s announcement to promote trade with both India and Pakistan.”
“Energy stocks are gaining on expectations of a Rs1.5 trillion injection linked to the resolution of the circular debt. However, the market has yet to price in the potential impact of the International Monetary Fund tranche release and a policy rate cut to below 12pc,” he commented.
Yousuf M Farooq, research director at Chase Securities, also said that the market was factoring in improved macroeconomic indicators, lower interest rates and the potential reduction in super tax which would like boost corporate earning across the board.
“With economic stability returning, the market’s price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is expected to gradually rerate to reflect these positive developments,” he added.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also concurred that the market performed well in continuation of Monday.
“Ceasefire, lower interest rate, IMF board approval, better corporate result expectations and a favourable budget expectation are driving market sentiment,” he said.</p><small>2025-05-13 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13134024fd253ef.jpg?r=135922' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910752/mike-hesson-to-be-pakistan-cricket-mens-team-odis-and-t20s-head-coach' target='_blank'><strong>Mike Hesson to be Pakistan cricket men’s team ODIs and T20s head coach</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has announced the former New Zealand cricketer Mike Hesson as the new white-ball (ODIs and T20 Internationals) head coach of the Pakistan men’s cricket team, according to a press release issued by PCB.
The role was left vacant by Gary Kirsten, who resigned just seven months into the job on October 29 following differences with the PCB. Last year, Aaqib Javed was temporarily handed the responsibility as Pakis­tan’s white-ball head coach until next year’s ICC Champions Trophy.
 


PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi took to X to welcome the new coach, saying
“After evaluation of numerous applications received against the vacancy, I’m pleased to announce that former New Zealand cricketer and renowned coach, Mike Hesson, will join us as the new White-ball Head Coach for the Pakistan National Team,” adding that he will join from May 26.
“We look forward to his expertise and guidance in shaping the future of Pakistani cricket,” added Naqvi.
 






Mike Hesson, who is the current head coach of Islamabad United, has previously served as the head coach of New Zealand and Kenya, among other international teams.
Separately, Mohsin Naqvi also welcomed the appointment of Aaqib Javed as the director of high performance. In a post on his X, he shared, “To strengthen our cricket infrastructure, Aaqib Javed joins us as Director of High Performance, complementing Mike Hesson’s appointment as White-ball Head Coach.”
Naqvi hoped that “together, they will play a pivotal role in the evolution and success of Pakistan Cricket.”
 






Aaqib Javed left his Job as the head coach following this year’s ICC Champions Trophy held in February-March.
This comes only a few weeks before Bangladesh’s T20 team is scheduled to tour Pakistan from May 25 for a five-match series.

The seat fell vacant following the demise of Senator Professor Sajid Mir on May 3, 2025, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
According to a notification by the provincial election commissioner, the nomination papers may be filed on May 14 and 15 for the election that will be held at the Punjab Assembly. The names of the nominated candidates will be published on May 16.
The scrutiny of the nomination papers will be held on May 17 while appeals against their acceptance or rejection will be filed on May 20. The appeals will be disposed of on May 22.
The revised list of candidates will be published on May 23, while the candidature may be withdrawn by May 24. The polling will be held at the Punjab Assembly chambers between 9am to 4pm.
The nomination papers may be received from the Punjab ECP office on 10-Court Street in Lahore during the office hours.
Notable religious and political leader Senator Prof Sajid Mir passed away at the age of 86 after a heart attack. Mir, the head of Jamiat Ahle Hadith Pakistan, belonged to a suburban area of Punjab’s Sialkot.
Mir was elected as a PML-N senator in 2021, which was his fifth time contesting the Senate election on the party’s ticket. He had also served as a senator from March 2009 to March 2015.
On May 6, PPP’s Syed Waqar Mehdi won the by-election held for the vacant general seat of the Senate from the province of Sindh in Karachi.
The ruling PPP and the opposition MQM-P had nominated Waqar Mehdi and Nighat Mirza, respectively. The PTI did not field any candidate and announced boycotting the polling process as well.
In the by-election held at the Sindh Assembly, Mehdi secured 111 votes, while MQM-P’s Nighat Mirza received 36, and two were rejected, said the returning officer, Provincial Election Commissioner Sindh Ejaz Anwar Chauhan. A total of 149 votes were cast during the scheduled polling time.
The general Senate seat fell vacant after the death of PPP’s Senator Taj Haider on April 8 in Karachi.

The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan under the banner of Operation Sindoor, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
On Saturday, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), 40 civilians — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.
The martyrs from the Pakistan Army include Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar and Sepoy Nisar, as per the statement.
The martyrs from the Pakistan Air Force include Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.
“Pakistan Armed Forces mounted a resolute response under the banner of Marka-i-Haq, delivering precise and notch-up retributive strikes through Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, stated the ISPR in its statement.
“Their noble sacrifice of martyrs is an enduring symbol of courage, devotion, and unwavering patriotism — etched forever in the nation’s memory,” the statement said. “Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response.”
Paying tribute to the martyred civilians and military personnel, the ISPR offered heartfelt prayers for the recovery of the injured.
“Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response,” the statement read while reaffirming that the nation “remains resolute in the face of aggression.”
PM Shehbaz Sharif has announced that Youm-e-Marka-i-Haq will be observed every year on May 10 on the “magnificent success” of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. Friday, May 16, 2025, will be observed as a day to pay tribute to the armed forces for achieving magnificent success on the defence front and to bow before God in gratitude, he added.</p><small>2025-05-13 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13123634b6b5dbb.jpg?r=124929' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910744/five-students-among-6-injured-in-battagram-school-van-firing' target='_blank'><strong>Five students among 6 injured in Battagram school van firing</strong></a><br><p>An assailant opened fire at a school van injuring six people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Battagram district, police said on Tuesday.
Battagram police spokesperson Gul Nabi told Dawn.com that the school van was coming from the Pirwahari area when it was attacked. “Five students and the van driver were injured in the incident,” he added.
The injured were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital Battagram, he continued, adding that one person, who was in critical condition, was referred to the Ayub Medical Complex Abbottabad.
“A first information report [FIR] was lodged and efforts to arrest the suspect were underway,” Nabi added.
According to Kuzabanda Station House Officer (SHO) Amjid Khan, the suspect’s motive behind the incident was “personal vendetta” against the van driver. “The shooter opened fire, recklessly endangering the lives of the children onboard,” he said.
The president of the Private Education Network (PEN) Battagram chapter, Syed Raqib Shah, condemned the incident and characterised it as an “act of terrorism”.
Shah urged the Battagram district police officer (DPO) to register a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act and apprehend the assailant, warning that failure to do so would prompt a strong reaction from the community.

Earlier, it was reported that the six PSL franchises have reached out to players, who were flown from the country on a charter flight over the weekend as the cross-border skirmishes with India intensified last week, to return after a ceasefire agreement was reached.
“The franchises are in negotiations with their foreign players regarding the tentative dates of May 17 to 25 with Raw­a­lpindi proposed to be the ve­nue for the remaining matc­hes,” sour­ces told Dawn on Monday.
“As soon as the franchises confirm the availability of the foreign players, the PCB will announce the schedule of the remaining matches after getting the approval from chairman Mohsin Naqvi,” sources added.
With no international cricket during the proposed window, the PCB remains hopeful that the foreign players will return.
However, reports suggested that Australian players might not be open to the idea of returning to Pakistan or India, which also saw its T20 tournament — the Indian Premier League — suspended due to the escalating hostilities.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to formally announce the scheme to revive the housing and construction sector, which is passing through challenging times along with purportedly 72 associated industries, an informed source told Dawn.
The sources said the government would initially provide about 200,000 low-cost 3-5 marla housing units after their construction in the public sector at 50pc subsidy on financing and then expand it. A draft plan was shared with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and commercial banks on Monday.
A meeting on affordable housing finance schemes was presided over by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Monday to address the critical challenges faced in long-term housing finance and explore viable policy models for low-cost housing in Pakistan. The meeting was also attended by SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed, chief executive officers of private and public sector banks and Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company (PMRC) representatives.
The SBP chief and commercial bank CEOs sought a week for their feedback. At this stage, the government considered two options. First, provision of 50pc subsidised funding to select people and offer them to construct 3-5 marla houses independently. Second, the government could build such housing units in the public sector and hand them over to people on 50pc subsidised financing. The stakeholders would meet again next week.
The meeting noted that Pakistan currently faces a severe housing shortage and a “paradoxical situation” for affordable housing. The current shortage was estimated at 12 million units, while additional annual demand was around 700,000. In contrast, the annual supply stood at just 250,000. This meant an annual gap of about 450,000 units. This included about 65pc (about 292,500) shortfall in the lower income group, followed by 25pc or 112,500 per annum in the lower middle-income group and the remaining 10pc or 45,000 in the upper middle-income groups.
It was considered paradoxical because there were challenges of affordability, limited access to finance, lack of mortgage financing and 64pc youth below the age of 30 on the demand side. On the other hand, the cost of land and material was too high, there were high risk and low profit margins, regulatory barriers, and high interest and tax rates on the supply side.
The participants reviewed international best practices and mortgage models from countries including Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, Bangladesh, Brazil, and India. They discussed designing a practical and sustainable housing finance framework tailored to Pakistan’s socio-economic landscape.
The minister said that the unavailability of long-term housing finance remained one of the country’s most significant barriers to affordable housing. He recalled substantial progress made in 2017-18, which was unfortunately disrupted by political instability. “When policy continuity is lacking, the public bears the cost,” he noted.
Referring to the success of auto-leasing models in the private sector, the minister questioned why a similar model could not be implemented for housing. “Millions of people live their entire lives in rented homes. Owning a house should not be a distant dream for the salaried class,” he said, adding that “a two to three crore home cannot be built through lump-sum payments by an average income earner.”
Ahsan Iqbal advocated for a housing finance framework similar to auto-leasing, backed by mortgages and supported by government policy.

His colleagues from various pro-Modi TV channels were reporting about a “regime change” in Pak­istan when not mentioning the firing of Russian-made Bra­hmos missiles into densely populated parts of Karachi.
Their audiences were beg­inning to doubt the rav­ings but had nowhere to verify the facts. Prac­tically every foreign channel or newspaper was made inaccessible in India by overt or covert means.
“Who authorised Presi­dent Trump to interv­ene?” Goswami was frothing at the mouth.
In his dream world, there couldn’t be Pakis­tani pilots outfoxing their Ind­ian counterparts, or Pakis­tan having better planes.
The political leadership has usually been defended by its TV channels. That nexus could be coming to a head.
The brunt of the attack, however, was borne not by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who would have been the obvious interlocutor with President Trump.
Mr Modi’s loyalists turned their ire on Foreign Secre­tary Vikram Misri, the man who had been carrying out the arduous task of briefing the nation on the post-Pahalgam tensions and the eventual shootouts with Pakistan.
 
 

As per reports, the official was subjected to vicious trolling for announcing on the government’s behalf the cessation of military operations.
In the face of trolls, Mr Misri’s colleagues rose in support of the beleaguered diplomat.
A post on the X account of Indian Administrative Service Association expressed solidarity with Mr Misri and his family.
“Unwarranted personal attacks on civil servants performing their duties with integrity are deeply regrettable. We reaffirm our commitment to uphold the dignity of public service,” the association of India’s bureaucrats said.
The Indian Police Service (IPS) Association also condemned the personal attacks on Mr Misri.
“Unequivocally condemn the deplorable personal attacks against Foreign Secretary Misri and his family. Such unwarranted assaults on civil servants committed to their duties are intolerable,” said the representative body of police officers.
After Mr Misri’s personal account on X was subjected to vulgar comments, most targeting his daughter, he locked his public account, according to The Hindu.
Asaduddin Owaisi, the member of parliament from Hyderabad, put the issue in context.
“Our civil servants work under the Executive. This must be remembered & they shouldn’t be blamed for the decisions taken by The Executive /or any Political leadership running Watan E Aziz (the beloved nation),” he wrote on X.
Congress leader Sachin Pilot also condemned the abuse directed at Mr Misri’s family.
“It’s unacceptable to target our professional diplomats and civil servants — those who work dedicatedly to serve the nation,” Mr Pilot said on X.
Congress deputy leader in Lok Sabha, Gaurav Gogoi, also supported Mr Misri.
“Mr Misri did his duty impeccably. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to feel malice towards him. He has only conveyed the message that the political leadership of India has taken.”
As the story shifted to self-recrimination, greater trouble loomed for India.
President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are striking fresh trade deals.
A US-China rapprochement against the backdrop of the India-Pakistan flare-up can’t be good news for New Delhi.
Away from the political volatility in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah was urging his people to return to their homes near the Line of Control that has gone silent as seldom before.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report cited a significant deterioration since October. It forecast that 2.1 million people across Gaza — roughly the entire population — will likely experience high levels of acute food insecurity, with 469,500 projected at  “catastrophic” levels — the most severe stage. The previous IPC analysis in October found 133,000 people in that category.
Israel sealed off Gaza in early March when it resumed military action against Hamas after a ceasefire collapsed.
Israeli  government spokesperson David Mencer said the IPC had  “constantly talked about famine; famine has never happened because of  Israel’s efforts to get more aid in.” He blamed Hamas for causing hunger by allegedly stealing aid. Hamas denies this, accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon.

Warns half a million people face starvation

The IPC report stated that Israeli military plans and aid agencies’  “persistent inability” to deliver essential goods mean a “high risk” of famine during the May 11 to Sept 30 projection period.
“Immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, starvation and acute malnutrition, and a descent into famine,” the report urged. Famine declaration requires at least  20 per cent of people facing extreme food shortages, high child malnutrition,  and elevated death rates from starvation or related diseases.
The report projected that nearly 71,000 cases of acute malnutrition, including 14,100 severe cases, among children, aged 6 to 59 months, were expected to occur between April 2025 and March 2026.
The report “really demonstrates that the situation in Gaza has deteriorated quite dramatically in recent months,” said Beth Bechdol,  deputy director of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. She noted  the blockade since early March “has really prevented the delivery of  essential humanitarian and even commercial supplies.”
While noting that the two-month-long ceasefire had allowed for a temporary alleviation of acute food shortages and ma­­lnutrition, the IPC report said the on­­g­oing blockade had reversed the situation. The key findings showed that 1.95 mill­i­­on people, or 93pc of the population in the coastal enclave, are living through high levels of acute food insecurity, including 244,000 experiencing the most severe, or  “catastrophic”, levels.

MUZAFFARABAD: Indian troops violated the ceasefire agreement late Sunday night by resorting to ‘unprovoked’ shelling across the Line of Control (LoC), resulting in the death of a young man in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), officials said on Monday.
According to Sardar Waheed Khan, Director General of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), Indian forces targeted several villages in the Nakyal sector of southern Kotli district shortly after 11pm, using both small and heavy arms during a 40-minute barrage.
In Bari Dhara Mathrani, one of the affected villages, 32-year-old Muhammad Shahid, son of Muhammad Taj, sustained critical abdominal injuries when shrapnel from a mortar shell struck him.
He was initially treated at the THQ Hospital in Nakyal and later referred to the DHQ Hospital in Kotli, where he succumbed to his wounds at around 1am.
 
 

A brief episode of shelling was also reported from the Haveli district, the SDMA chief added.
Shahid’s death raised the toll from the recent wave of cross-LoC shelling, including missile attacks in Muzaffarabad and Kotli districts, to 32. They included 12 in Kotli, six each in Bhimber and Poonch, three in Muzaffarabad, two each in Neelum and Haveli, and one in Bagh. Another 123 people were injured in the hostilities.
School, colleges reopen today
The AJK government annou­nced the reopening of all educational institutions from today (Tuesday), following a temporary closure amid the escalation.
However, a revised schedule for the postponed examination papers will be issued separately by the AJK Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) in Mirpur, Mr Khan said.
Earlier on Monday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq visited forward posts in the Barnala sector of Bhimber district to express solidarity with the armed forces for their robust response to Indian aggression and to console families affected by the shelling.
Addressing the troops, Mr Haq lauded the army’s professionalism and high morale, stating that ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ had forced the Indian forces to back down.
“The Pakistan Army has made the country’s defence invincible,” he remarked, also praising the Pakistan Air Force for showcasing its capabilities with international recognition.
He condemned India’s targeting of civilian populations and infrastructure, and applauded the resilience and bravery of the AJK people.
He said compensation had been provided to the families of martyrs and injured persons within 24 hours, and that relevant departments remained fully alert and operational round-the-clock.
The prime minister pledged to personally visit all LoC-affected areas to assess damages and ensure timely relief and rehabilitation.
During his visit, Mr Haq met with the families of those martyred in Saturday’s shelling, offering condolences and handing over compensation cheques. As his convoy passed through the area, large crowds chanted slogans in support of Pakistan, the armed forces, and the AJK leadership.
President for immediate relief to affected families
Separately, AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood strongly condemned India for deliberately targeting innocent and unarmed civilians along the LoC, calling it a blatant display of frustration.
Expressing heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and wishing a swift recovery to the injured, he directed the government and relevant authorities to urgently assess the damages and ensure immediate relief for the affected population, including uninterrupted medical care for the wounded.

WASHINGTON: Amid easing tensions following a ceasefire bet­ween India and Pakistan, Presi­dent Donald Trump has claimed that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a televised address to the nation asserted that New Delhi would not tolerate “nuclear blackmail” in the event of further conflict with Islamabad.
Trump’s comments, made during a press interaction at the White House, signal a rare moment of US diplomatic mediation bet­ween the two South Asian nuclear powers and suggest a broader Ameri­can strategy that ties peace to economic engagement.
“We stopped a nuclear conflict. I think it could have been a bad nuclear war. Millions of people could have been killed,” Trump said while talking to reporters.
This is perhaps one of the starkest warnings yet from the US leader, who has rarely minced words in highlighting global security threats. His remarks reflect Washing­ton’s growing concern about the fragile peace between India and Pakistan, both of whom possess significant nuclear arsenals and a long history of military confrontations.
In a tone that combined both reassurance and transactional diplomacy, Trump added that the United States is prepared to enhance trade with both countries — if they continue to engage in dialogue. “We’re going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan. We’re going to do a lot of trade with India. We’re negotiating with India right now. We’re going to be soon negotiating with Pakistan,” he said, linking the prospect of economic cooperation to continued regional stability.
 


Trump, who appeared eager to underscore his adm­inistration’s peacemaking role, said: “On Sat­u­rday, my administration helped broker an immediate ceasefire, I think a maybe permanent one bet­ween India and Pakistan — the countries having a lot of nuclear weapons.”
His assertion, while dramatic, underscores the high stakes involved in this latest confrontation and his belief that trade can be a powerful tool of diplomacy.
He also praised the leadership of both countries for their roles in defusing the situation. “I’m very proud to let you know that the leadership of India and Pakistan was unwavering and powerful, but unwavering in both cases — they really were from the standpoint of having the strength and the wisdom and fortitude to fully know and to understand the gravity of the situation,” he said.
Trump also offered a unique insight into how he leveraged economic incentives to push both sides toward de-escalation.
 
 

“We helped a lot, and we also helped with trade. I said ‘Come on, we’re going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let’s stop it, let’s stop it. If you stop it, we’re doing trade’,” he said. He then added: “If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade. People have never really used trade the way I used it. By that, I can tell you, and all of a sudden they said. I think we’re gonna stop, and they have.”
In concluding his remarks, the president emphasised once again the magnitude of what he believed had been averted. “We stopped a nuclear conflict,” he declared, before offering thanks to members of his administration. “I also want to thank VP JD Vance and Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, for their work,” he said, crediting them for helping facilitate the peace process.
While the claims made by President Trump will be scrutinised in Washington and South Asia, they do indicate a willingness on the part of the US to reassert its role as a mediator in global conflicts. Whether these efforts translate into a lasting peace between India and Pak­i­stan, however, remains to be seen.
‘Nuclear blackmail’
Indian PM Modi vowed on Monday to respond strongly to any future “terrorist attack”, and cautioned that India would not succumb to ‘nuclear blackmail’ in the face of future provocations.
A weekend ceasefire which Trump said he brokered appeared to be holding on Monday after four days of intense jet fighter, missile, drone and artillery attacks — the worst violence between the two nuclear-armed neighbours since 1999.
The conflict followed an April 22 attack on tourists in Pahalgam, in India-held Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians.
Modi, in a televised address to the nation — his first since hostilities began last Wednesday — said Pakistan has chosen to attack rather than help it fight “terrorism”. “If another terrorist attack against India is carried out, a strong response will be given.”
“India’s stand is very clear. Terror and talks cannot go together… Terror and trade cannot go together… Water and blood cannot flow together.”
Pakistan had strongly denied having any role in the attack on tourists in India-held Kashmir, and has repeatedly asked New Delhi for sharing any evidence.
Proclaiming victory in the short and bitter standoff in which foreign media reported the downing of several Indian warplanes, including the highly rated French-made Rafale jets, and Indian military claiming hitting what it called terrorist targets in Pakistan, Modi said it would be the new normal against terrorism.
India launched a missile barrage against Pakistan on May 7, but remained silent about the downing of its estimated five warplanes in response.
The Indian PM underplayed the role of foreign interlocutors in brokering the ceasefire. “And I am repeating again, we have just postponed our retaliatory action on Pakistan’s terrorist and military bases. In the coming days, we will measure every step of Pakistan on the basis of what attitude it adopts.”
Three key issues
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that any future talks with India would focus on three key issues — Kashmir, terrorism and water.
In an exclusive talk with a private news channel, he said India’s arrogance is the main reason why these matters remain unresolved. Kashmir can be resolved under UN resolutions, but India’s stubbornness is the hurdle, he added.
The minister stated that terrorism has affected Pakistan for decades, and there is solid evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring terror activities inside the country. India had violated the Indus Water Treaty, he said, adding that an attempt to deprive Pakistan of its water rights will never be allowed.
Mr Asif emphasised the world has recognised Pakistan’s military readiness and its responsible approach in times of conflict.

• Dar says second round to follow within two days
• COAS calls conflict ‘defining chapter in the country’s military history’ as ISPR rejects reports of ceasefire breach
ISLAMABAD: Pakistani and Indian senior military officials on Monday agreed to uphold the ceasefire reached last week and reduce troop deployments along the international border, following days of hostilities between the two countries that had raised fears of a wider conflict.
The directors general of military operations (DGMOs) from both countries held a scheduled conversation at 4:30pm that lasted about 45 minutes. The discussion was originally scheduled for noon, but was postponed till afternoon — the delay was attributed by some sources to a difference over the agenda of the meeting.
The two officers — Pakis­tan’s Maj Gen Kashif Abdul­lah and India’s Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai — discussed measures to reinforce their mutual co­mmitment not to fire or eng­age in any aggressive or in­imical actions, according to Indian authorities. There was no official statement r­eleased by the Pakistan Army regarding the meeting.
In addition to reaffirming the ceasefire, the two sides reportedly agreed to pursue immediate steps to reduce troop presence along the borders and forward areas, which is seen as a significant move amid fragile calm after a four-day flare-up from May 7 to May 10.
Pakistani officials described the conversation as the initial round of talks after the ceasefire took effect. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that the DGMOs are expected to have another round of talks within 48 hours for further discussions.
In peacetime, Pakistan and India typically station border security forces — the Pakistan Rangers and India’s Border Security Force, respectively — along the international border, while regular army troops remain in nearby cantonments for rapid deployment if needed. Under the existing terms of engagement, helicopters are restricted from flying within 1 kilometre of the border, and combat jets must remain at least 10 kilometres away.
During heightened tensions, both countries activate wartime formations, repositioning offensive and defensive units closer to the border. After escalation, defensive formations occupy positions on border, whereas offensive forces get into ‘concentration areas’ — usually behind the front lines, where units gather, assemble, and prepare before launching an attack or advancing, according to deployment contingencies. The same happened during this crisis. This understanding reached at the DGMOs interaction implies that some of the troops would move back to their peacetime locations. Pakistan’s defensive units are assigned specific sectors, while its offensive formations operate flexibly, without a pre-designated area of responsibility.
The latest contact between DGMOs comes after both countries agreed on May 10 to a “full and immediate ceasefire” following a sharp escalation that included drone and missile attacks, artillery fire, and airbase strikes. The violence was triggered by India’s May 7 aggression against Pakistan on the pretext of April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian-Occupied Kashmir. Pakistani armed military responded with ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’.
Though the ceasefire was brokered through high-level US mediation, violations were reported just hours after the agreement took effect. Both sides blamed each other for the breaches and Monday’s meeting aimed to reinforce the fragile truce.
On Monday night, the army’s media wing responded to reports in the Indian media, saying that Pakistani forces were fully abiding by the ceasefire. It rejected Indian allegations regarding the violation of the ceasefire.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a televised speech, said India had “suspended retaliatory action” but warned that future conduct would be judged by Pakistan’s posture. “We will measure every step of Pakistan on the criterion that what sort of attitude Pakistan will adopt ahead,” he said.
In a detailed statement, Pakistan’s military described Operation Bunyan un Marsoos as a “textbook demonstration” of tri-services integration across land, air, sea, and cyber domains, delivering precision strikes against Indian military targets.
The operation employed long-range missiles, drones, and cyber warfare to hit 26 key installations in Indian-occupied Kashmir and mainland India, including air force bases, logistics hubs, command centres, and missile storage facilities, the Inter-Services Public Relations said in its statement. “Pakistan Armed Forces possess an ‘adequate’ suite of very sophisticated ‘niche military technologies’, and only a limited number and type were used with restraint in this conflict,” it maintained.
The ISPR emphasised that the operation was “precise, proportionate, and remarkably restrained,” targeting only those directly involved in attacks on Pakistani civilians.
“No hostile design can erode the determination of the Armed Forces of Pakistan,” army chief Gen Asim Munir said during a visit to injured personnel at CMH Rawalpindi.
“The resolute and unified response exhibited during Marka-i-Haq /Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, in concert with the steadfast support of the Pakistani people, constitutes a defining chapter in the country’s military history.”
