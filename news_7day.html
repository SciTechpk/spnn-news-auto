Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani welcomed him at the airport. A video released from the minister’s office showed Ghani receiving Afridi and the two hugging at the airport. Ghani was also seen presenting Afridi a Sindhi cap and Ajrak.
The party’s secretary general Salman Akram Raja has also reached Karachi.
Videos shared by the PTI on X showed a large crowd gathered at the airport to welcome Afridi.







An update shared on PTI‘s X account at around 5:15pm said Afridi’s convoy, surrounded by a large crowd, had reached Karachi’s main artery Sharea Faisal by then.







Afridi also shared a video of himself at Sharea Faisal, with PTI supporters and workers shouting slogans of “Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi”.







An update by Karachi traffic police said the “participants of a political party had cleared main Sharea Faisal” by 6:20pm.







Afridi boarded the flight for Karachi from the Islamabad airport, where he faced flight delays.
KP Minister for Local Government Meena Khan Afridi, who is accompanying the chief minister, said in a post on X prior to their departure that their flight had been delayed.







PTI alleges dismantling of tents
Meanwhile, PTI spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar alleged while speaking to Dawn that police had removed the tents put up outside the party‘s head office near the nursery area for the KP CM’s reception.
He, however, clarified that the office had not been sealed by police.
Previously, the PTI had alleged in a post on social media platform X that Sindh police had sealed the Insaf Secretariat in Karachi and dismantled a camp installed there for Afridi’s welcome.







Bozdar said CM Afridi was expected to address party workers and leaders at the head office, where he would be taken from the airport.
He also said he had spoken to police and Sindh government officials, who have assured that the tents would be returned. He added that the officials also assured that the party would be allowed to hold a gathering but was asked not to block roads.
Dawn reached out to police for a comment but there was no response from their side.
Afridi to hold gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday
Before departing for Karachi, the KP chief minister said in a post on X that he was bringing party founder Imran Khan’s “message” to the province.
“My visit is for three days and during this time we have planned various activities,” the chief minister said, urging people to support the street movement.







KP CM announced that he would be holding a gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday at 4:30pm, calling on people to participate in the gathering.
“We will hold the biggest gathering in Karachi’s history,” CM Afridi said.
For its part, the authorities in Sindh initially said Afridi would not be allowed to hold a public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid but later, a provincial minister announced a change in the decision.
A notification issued by the Korangi deputy commissioner’s office initially cited “great traffic congestion” and consequent “public inconvenience” as the reasons to deny permission to hold the gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid and asked the PTI to propose an alternative venue.
However, later Sindh Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah said in a statement issued by his office that the authorities had decided to allow the rally at Mazar-i-Quaid.
“We will fully welcome KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in the province,” he said, adding that the peaceful struggle of any political party, including the PTI, could not be stopped.
But, he also warned that “difficulties could arise in the law is violated”.
“There is no restriction on the rally. They have sought permission for holding rallies in South and Korangi districts. They have sought permission for a rally at Jinnah Ground and they are being given permission for that,” he said. “We are in talks with the PTI leadership and they can definitely be given permission for holding the rally in accordance with the law.”
What’s on CM’s agenda?
The KP CM, during his three-day visit, will meet with the party leadership, as well as lawyers and business leaders, and hold a meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.
The visit is aimed at energising the party’s newly launched street movement in Karachi and other cities seeking the release of the incarcerated former prime minister.
On Monday, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, during a press conference at party headquarters, Insaf House, shared the CM Afridi’s schedule for the visit.
He detailed that CM Afridi will depart from Islamabad on January 9 and arrive in Karachi, where he will be received by party workers and supporters.
His Karachi engagements include interactions with traders at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a meeting with the Press at the Karachi Press Club (KPC), and street movements across districts South, Korangi and Malir.
The PTI Sindh chapter president had also said that a meeting between the chief ministers of KP and Sindh is expected on January 12, pending official confirmation.
He is also expected to meet incarcerated PTI workers, which the party says underscores its campaign narrative of resistance and sacrifice following his arrival in Karachi.
Hyderabad visit
The CM will travel to Hyderabad on Jan 1o. On his route, he will be welcomed in Jamshoro by Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah.
The Hyderabad leg features street protests in Kotri, addresses to the Press Club, meetings with journalists, intellectuals and farmers, and a gathering at Insaf House Hyderabad.
The agenda also includes an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA), but the lawyers’ body has said it never accorded permission for the CM to visit or address the bar.
Earlier, the bar association general secretary invited the CM to the Hyderabad High Court in a letter dated January 7.
In the letter, seen by Dawn, General Secretary Israr Hussain Chang said he warmly welcomed the CM to Sindh and “commend your principled stance on the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the rule of law, human rights, and justice for missing persons”.
“We hope you will also support our ongoing legal and constitutional struggle to protect Sindh’s lands, resist unjust corporate farming allotments, and safeguard Karoonjhar Kirthar, and the water rights and Indus delta, all vital to our ecological and cultural identity.
“During your visit to Hyderabad, if you spare some moments to visit the High Court, Hyderabad, I would be honoured to receive you on behalf of the legal fraternity and people of Sindh,” the letter read.
But, the bar association clarified in a press release on January 8 that it “never accorded permission nor allowed the worthy KP chief minister to address or visit HCBA, Hyderabad”. It added that the bar association’s entire executive/ managing committee, by a clear majority, had rejected during a meeting an application submitted in this connection.
The general secretary issued his letter in his personal capacity and “used the letterhead of the HCBA without consent of the managing committee for the aforesaid programme”, the press release said.
Meanwhile, the spokesperson for PTI Hyderabad chairperson alleged while speaking to Dawn that police had conducted raids at residences of the “elected chairpersons of different union committees and activists of PTI on Thursday in different parts of the city”.
However, no arrests could be made, he said.
Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio also told Dawn that no PTI activists had been arrested during the raids in Hyderabad.
Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — undertaken for the same purpose — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.</p><small>2026-01-09 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/091805186de0cdf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965993/iran-cuts-internet-amid-expanding-protests-over-economy-supreme-leaders-tells-trump-to-focus-on-problems-in-us' target='_blank'><strong>Iran cuts internet amid expanding protests over economy; supreme leaders tells Trump to focus on problems in US</strong></a><br><p>Iran was largely cut off from the outside world on Friday after authorities blacked out the internet to curb expanding protests, with phone calls not reaching the country, flights cancelled and online Iranian news sites only intermittently updating.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused protesters of acting on behalf of US President Donald Trump, saying rioters were attacking public properties and warning that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as “mercenaries for foreigners”. He also told Trump to focus on the problems in his own country.
The protests, which began on December 28 over an inflationary spiral, have not approached the scale of unrest three years ago but have spread across Iran with dozens reported dead and the authorities looking more vulnerable because of a dire economy and the aftermath of last year’s war with Israel and the United States.







The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has reported at least 34 protesters and four security personnel killed, and 2,200 arrested during the unrest.
Images of fires raging in Iranian cities
Iranian rights group Hengaw reported that a protest march after Friday prayers in Zahedan, where the Baluch minority predominates, was met by gunfire that wounded several people.
Iran’s fragmented external opposition factions called for more protests on Friday with Reza Pahlavi, exiled son of the late ruling shah, telling Iranians in a social media post: “The eyes of the world are upon you. Take to the streets.”







Trump, who bombed Iran last summer and who last week warned Tehran it could come to the protesters’ aid, said on Friday he would not meet Pahlavi and was “not sure that it would be appropriate” to support him.
Images published by state television overnight showed what it said were burning buses, cars and motorbikes as well as fires at metro stations and banks. It accused the People’s Mujahedin Organisation, an opposition faction that splintered off after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and is also known as the MKO, of orchestrating the unrest.
A state TV journalist standing in front of the fires on Shariati Street in the Caspian Sea port of Rasht said: “This looks like a war zone — all the shops have been destroyed.”
Videos verified by Reuters as having been taken in the capital Tehran showed hundreds of people marching. In one of the videos, a woman could be heard shouting, “Death to Khamenei!”







Iran has quelled far bigger bouts of unrest before, but it now faces a graver economic situation and intensifying international pressure with global sanctions over its disputed nuclear programme reimposed since September.
Supreme leader warns protesters
The authorities have tried a dual approach — describing protests over the economy as legitimate while condemning what they call violent rioters and cracking down with security forces.
Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf told lawmakers that the voices of protesters must be heard but that any cases linked to “foreign spy networks” must be handled differently.
The Supreme Leader, the ultimate authority in Iran above the elected president and parliament, used tougher language in his speech on Friday.
“The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of hundreds of thousands of honourable people. It will not back down in the face of vandals,” he said, accusing those involved in unrest of seeking to please Trump.
Khamenei also told Trump to focus on the problems in his own country.
The US president had stated earlier that the US was watching the situation in Iran “very closely”.
“If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump had said.
Khamenei said Trump’s hands “are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians” and predicted the “arrogant” US leader would be “overthrown” like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution.
While the initial protests were focused on the economy, with the rial currency losing half its value against the dollar last year and inflation topping 40 per cent in December, they have morphed to include slogans directly against the authorities.
Protesters have chanted slogans including “death to the dictator” and praising the former monarchy that was overthrown in 1979. The extent of support inside Iran for the monarchy or for the MKO, the most vocal groups among emigre Iranians, is disputed.
Most of the demonstrators seen in videos viewed by Reuters, many of which it has been unable to verify, have been young men.
Iran blocked off the internet overnight. Reuters reporters trying to place phone calls to Iran from abroad were unable to do so on Friday.
Flights cancelled
At least six flights between Dubai and Iranian cities scheduled for Friday were cancelled, the Dubai Airport website showed.
Turkish Airlines on Friday also cancelled its seven flights from Istanbul to Iran — five of them to the capital Tehran, a spokesperson told AFP.
The other flights were bound for Tabriz and for Mashhad, the spokesperson said.
Turkish Airlines had already cancelled two flights to Tehran on Thursday and one to Tabriz, the spokesperson said.
According to the Istanbul airport app, five other flights operated by Iranian airlines have also been cancelled, while seven others were still scheduled at midday.
According to the specialist website Flight Radar, a Turkish Airlines plane flying to Shiraz and a Pegasus flight to Mashhad turned back from Iranian space on Thursday night.
Turkey shares a border of around 500 kilometres with Iran, and there are three active land crossings between the two countries.</p><small>2026-01-09 13:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09181343d28bc2f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965994/punjab-schools-and-colleges-will-open-from-jan-12-says-education-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab schools and colleges will open from Jan 12, says education minister</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat on Friday clarified that all schools and colleges across the province will reopen on January 12.
The clarification comes after a reportedly fake notification circulated on social media claiming that winter vacations in Punjab had been extended from January 10 to 17.







However, the education minister rebuffed claims of extending winter holidays, urging the public to “avoid fake news.”
Earlier this week, he had also denied any extension of the winter holidays.







The Punjab government had announced winter vacations for all public and private schools and colleges from December 22 to January 10.
According to the official notification, schools and colleges were scheduled to reopen on January 12.
A day ago, a fake notification claiming to have been issued by Punjab’s School Education Department went viral on social media, spreading confusion among parents and students.
The notification claimed that “due to severe weather conditions,” the vacations had been extended until January 17, and that schools would reopen on January 19.</p><small>2026-01-09 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/091616392970dd5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966000/grok-to-offer-image-generation-only-to-paid-subscribers-after-backlash' target='_blank'><strong>Grok to offer image generation only to paid subscribers after backlash</strong></a><br><p>Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok on Friday turned off its image creation feature for non-paying users of X following backlash over its use in creating sexualised deepfakes of women and children.
Owned by Elon Musk and developed by xAI, Grok’s image-generation and editing tools have faced backlash on the social media platform X after netizens raised concerns about the chatbot generating nude images of women and children.
Musk has also been threatened with fines, and several countries have recently pushed back publicly against the tool over its creation of sexually explicit imagery.
Replying to users on Musk’s social media platform X, Grok posted: “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features.”
The change means many users of the tool can no longer generate or edit images using the AI. Paying customers must provide the platform with their credit card information and personal details.
The European Commission this week said the photos of undressed women and children were unlawful and on Thursday ordered X to retain all internal documents and data related to Grok until the end of 2026.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said X has “got to get a grip of this” and stated that he has asked communications regulator Ofcom “for all options to be on the table,” according to media reports. He called the images “unlawful” and said Britain was “not going to tolerate it.” France, Malaysia and India have also criticised Musk’s platform over the issue.
“Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk wrote on X last week in response to a post about the explicit images.







X’s official “Safety” account subsequently said it addresses illegal content on X “by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.“
Users now have to subscribe to access image-generating features on X, which were initially rolled out for free with daily limits.
However, users can avail Grok’s image-generating and editing features for free on its separate app.
In December 2025, a controversy erupted on X after users were found exploiting Grok’s tools to edit and manipulate photographs, including digitally undressing people, including children or portraying them in minimal clothing such as bikinis.
Reuters, BBC, and other news outlets also documented numerous cases where Grok had generated sexualised images of women and minors.</p><small>2026-01-09 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09164457fa0c59c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966001/russia-fires-hypersonic-oreshnik-missile-near-ukraines-eu-border' target='_blank'><strong>Russia fires hypersonic Oreshnik missile near Ukraine’s EU border</strong></a><br><p>Russia fired a powerful hypersonic missile at Ukraine near the EU border overnight, in what Kyiv called a new threat to European security that demanded a global response.
Moscow said it had fired the Oreshnik missile in response to what it has described as an attempted drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin’s residences last month, which Ukraine has denied and the United States has said did not happen.
It was only the second time Russia has fired the Oreshnik at Ukraine, and came amid a night of air attacks that Ukrainian authorities said also killed four people in Kyiv, knocked out power in the capital and damaged the Qatari embassy there.
The Oreshnik, designed to project power across Europe and which Moscow says is impossible to intercept, is capable of carrying nuclear warheads, although there was no suggestion it had done so.

“Such a strike close to [the] EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said on X.
“It is absurd that Russia attempts to justify this strike with the fake ‘Putin residence attack’ that never happened,” he added. “Putin uses an IRBM near the EU and Nato border in response to his own hallucinations. This is truly a global threat. And it demands global responses.”







Kyiv has called Russia’s allegation that it attacked Putin’s residence in the Novgorod region of northern Russia on December 29 “an absurd lie” to sabotage peace talks.
US President Donald Trump has said he does not believe it happened, although something else happened in the area.
The Oreshnik hit the Lviv region in western Ukraine, around 60 kilometres from the border with Poland. Moscow said it hit a drone factory and energy infrastructure. Ukrainian officials said it hit unspecified infrastructure; local media reported that it struck a large underground gas storage site.
Germany condemned the missile strike, accusing Moscow of seeking to “instil fear”.
“Russia has escalated the situation once again,” government spokesman Steffen Meyer said. “These are symbolic gestures of intimidation intended to instil fear, but they are not effective. “
Casualties, power supplies disrupted in attack on Kyiv
Russia fired a total of 242 drones and 36 missiles, including Oreshnik, to hit infrastructure in the western Lviv region and in and around the capital Kyiv, Ukraine said.
Authorities said at least four people were killed and more than 20 injured by the strikes on Kyiv, which knocked out electricity to more than half a million homes in the capital. Water and heat were cut off, with temperatures around -10º Celsius and heavy snow.

The Oreshnik was fired just before midnight, according to Lviv regional officials. The Ukrainian military said the missile was moving at a speed of 13,000 kilometres per hour.
“The strike’s targets were hit,” Russia’s Defence Ministry said in a statement, describing the targets as a factory producing drones used in the alleged attack against Putin’s residence, as well as energy infrastructure.
Russian war correspondents released a video purportedly showing the moment the Oreshnik struck its target in western Ukraine. Filmed across a snow-covered landscape, what looked like six flashes were seen striking the ground, followed by a loud bang and a series of detonations.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
Moscow first fired an Oreshnik — Russian for “hazel tree” — against what it said was a military factory in Ukraine in November 2024. On that occasion, Ukrainian sources claimed the missile was carrying dummy warheads, not explosives, and caused limited damage.
Ukrainian and US envoys, joined by a coalition of Ukraine’s allies, have been negotiating in Paris this week to iron out remaining disagreements in a peace framework Washington is seeking to thrash out with Kyiv before presenting it to Russia.</p><small>2026-01-09 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/091457185bab99e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965992/fact-check-fake-screenshot-of-purported-dawn-story-circulates-on-social-media' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Fake screenshot of purported Dawn story circulates on social media</strong></a><br><p>A fake screenshot purporting to show the headline of a Dawn story has been circulating on social media, it emerged on Friday. The headline is fake and no such story has been published by Dawn.
The screenshot shows a headline that claims Parliament must pay a large sum of money to any individual who invests in an artificial intelligence platform.
The headline of the fake news article states: “The Parliament of Pakistan has been obliged to pay Rs6o lakh to every individual who starts investing in the state-backed artificial intelligence platform called Quantum AI, beginning with as little as Rs70,000.”
The headline’s length and formatting, particularly the words in red, do not conform to Dawn’s style guide.
Further, the URL displayed at the top of the page is not that of Dawn’s website.
Additionally, the data below the masthead is from October 2025, suggesting that the fabricated headline has been grafted over an old screenshot of Dawn’s website.
Dawn urges its readers to be wary of attempts to defraud them and always verify information directly from our website.

He made the remarks while speaking alongside a delegation of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in Lahore, which is on a three-day visit to the city as part of the opposition’s “street movement” to hold political and social gatherings.
The alliance posted on X that TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas arrived on Friday at a gathering held at the residence of Advocate Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas, where a large number of journalists, political leaders and PTI workers were present.
Speaking during the gathering, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar welcomed the TTAP delegation to Lahore.
He urged the TTAP to use its platform to push for a meeting with Imran, who has not been allowed visitors in recent weeks.
“No talks or dialogue can start until meetings are allowed with Imran,” he said. Zafar assured the TTAP of “full cooperation and support from [PTI’s] leaders and workers in Lahore”.







He stressed that the top priority at the moment was the protection of Pakistan‘s sovereignty. In this regard, he said that Imran’s release was “the need of the time”.
“The government cannot take any such step that will harm Pakistan‘s future or is against Pakistan’s sovereignty,” he said.
Zafar expressed gratitude to the TTAP leadership for their visit, stating, “The difficulties you faced in reaching here, I would like to say that we face it every day here.“
On Thursday, Achakzai, who led the TTAP caravan from Islamabad to Lahore, had urged the nation and political parties to support its wheel-jam and shutter-down strike to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8 elections, saying the protest would also pave the way for talks with the government.
The PTI had also accused the Punjab police of a crackdown on its supporters ahead of Achakzai’s visit, saying its workers were rounded up by the police in late-night raids while the caravan was also attacked by “masked individuals” on its way to the provincial capital.
Speaking to reporters, Achakzai said a powerful protest would exert pressure on the government to hold talks with the opposition and release its leader, Imran.</p><small>2026-01-09 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0912110911808d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965989/can-the-us-put-a-price-tag-on-greenland' target='_blank'><strong>Can the US put a price tag on Greenland?</strong></a><br><p>Despite Denmark’s repeated insistence that Greenland is not for sale, US President Donald Trump and his team are “talking about what a potential purchase would look like”, according to a White House spokeswoman this week.
But even as a thought experiment that assumes the presence of a willing seller, discussion of the hypothetical sale of an autonomous territory such as Greenland rapidly encounters imponderables such as how a meaningful price tag could even be established.
“There’s not a market for buying and selling countries,” said Nick Kounis, chief economist of Dutch ABN AMRO bank, noting there was no accepted framework for valuing countries.
Attempts to find historical benchmarks for fair value also run into difficulties.
In 1946, the US offered to buy the vast, mineral-rich Arctic island from Denmark for $100 million — an offer that was rejected back then.
In today’s money, that is around $1.6 billion.
But that figure, already paltry, is of no use as a baseline because of the massive growth in both US and Danish economies over eight decades since then: it does not reflect any relative “value” of Greenland and its resources in the global economy of the 2020s.
America’s $15m purchase of Louisiana in 1803 and $7.2m acquisition of Alaska from Russia in 1867 are also not useful precedents.
First and most obviously there is the fact that both France and Russia actually chose to sell.

 

And while it is clear that those figures would be vastly higher in today’s money, how much more would depend on how and whether you factored in variables like inflation, appreciation in land prices and growth in local economies.
What if it were a company?
So, how about if you tried a method akin to the valuation of a corporate takeover based on the income the target is capable of generating? Still tricky.
Denmark’s central bank put the size of Greenland’s fishing-based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at a tiny $3.6bn in 2023 — about a tenth that of its smaller Arctic neighbour Iceland.
Even if that was a starting point for a valuation, what multiple would you use to determine a price based on that? How, too, would you account for the fact that Danish subsidies cover about half Greenland’s public budget, funding hospitals and schools and underpinning infrastructure for the sparsely populated territory?
While Trump has denied the US has its eyes on Greenland’s mineral assets and energy assets, Reuters reported last October that his administration has held discussions about taking a stake in Critical Metals Corp, a company aiming to build the largest rare earths project there.

 

Estimates put the value of Greenland’s mineral and energy reserves in the hundreds of billions of dollars or more.
Proper geological studies of the entire island have not been fully conducted, but a 2023 survey showed that 25 of 34 minerals deemed “critical raw materials” by the European Commission were there.
Mining and energy companies have a long history of putting price tags on assets around the world. But here, at least two complications emerge.
First, the extraction of oil and natural gas is banned in Greenland for environmental reasons, and development of its mining sector has been snarled in red tape and opposition from Indigenous people.
Is that a political constraint that a buyer would want a discount for? If so, how much? And second, mining and energy deals crucially do not include the transfer of national sovereignty — in this case complicated further by the presence of Greenlandic Inuits who assert ownership claims of their own.
“Because you are adding the intangible notions of Indigenous peoples’ culture, history, then you can’t — there is no way to price it,” said Andreas Osthagen, Research Director for Arctic and Ocean Politics at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Norway. “It’s why that notion is ridiculous.”
For now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table — including military action — to gain control of a territory that it says is vital for US national security and where it already has a small military presence.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s scheduled meeting with Danish leaders next week may yield further insights into the US game plan on Greenland.
ABN AMRO’s Kounis suggested Trump could be using a similar playbook to one he has used in other situations such as talks on trade tariffs, where an extreme scenario is put on the table simply to soften up the other side.
If one possible outcome is an agreed settlement that the US sees as being to its military and economic advantage, then “part of this might well be about getting leverage for future negotiations”, Kounis said.</p><small>2026-01-09 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/091218421ba5b56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965990/india-us-trade-deal-stalled-after-modi-did-not-call-trump-says-us-commerce-secretary' target='_blank'><strong>India-US trade deal stalled after Modi did not call Trump, says US commerce secretary</strong></a><br><p>India’s trade pact with the United States was delayed because Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not make a telephone call to US President Donald Trump to close a deal they were negotiating, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Friday.
The trade talks fell apart last year and Trump doubled tariffs on Indian goods in August to 50 per cent, the world’s highest rate, including a levy of 25pc in retaliation for India’s purchases of Russian oil.
“It’s all set up and you have got to have Modi call the president. And they were uncomfortable doing it,” Lutnick said in an interview on the All-In podcast, a US show by four venture capitalists that focuses on business and technology. “So Modi didn’t call.”







The comments came after Trump stepped up the pressure for talks with a warning this week that tariffs could rise further unless India curbs its Russian oil imports.
That step pushed the Indian rupee to a record low and spooked investors waiting for progress in two-way negotiations for a trade deal that remains elusive.
India still seeks a tariff rate between Washington’s offers to Britain and Vietnam that had formerly been agreed but the offer has expired, Lutnick added.
India’s trade ministry did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment on Lutnick’s remarks.
New Delhi and Washington were very close to a trade deal last year but a communication breakdown led to the collapse of any potential pact, Reuters reported.
It cited an Indian government official involved in the talks as saying that Modi could not have called Trump, for fear that a one-sided conversation would put him on the spot.</p><small>2026-01-09 07:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09112923e887342.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965985/pakistan-seeks-economic-dialogue-with-us-flags-regional-security-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks economic dialogue with US, flags regional security concerns</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Pakistan has called for the launch of a high-level economic dialogue with the United States at the earliest and urged a shift in bilateral engagement from geopolitics to geoeconomics during a series of meetings between the country’s envoy Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and senior members of Congress.
Meeting House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US said 2026 should be treated as a “year of action” to translate shared intentions into concrete economic cooperation.
“Our focus is shifting from geopolitics to geoeconomics,” he said, according to one of two handouts issued after the meeting, and stressed the need for institutionalised engagement in sectors such as energy, defence, minerals, information technology and artificial intelligence.
Ambassador Sheikh said Pakistan’s low-cost, high-quality manufacturing base positioned it well to meet growing US market needs, highlighting surgical instruments, textiles and sports goods as areas with strong export potential.
He said that “2026 should be the year of action for a long-term, sustainable partnership based on economic cooperation”, noting that footballs manufactured in Sialkot had been used in five consecutive Fifa World Cups.
US State Secretary Marco Rubio has recently spoken positively about expanding ties with Pakistan, describing the relationship as one with significant untapped potential.
“We see an opportunity to expand our strategic relationship with Pakistan,” Rubio said in October 2025, adding that Washington valued Islamabad’s long history of cooperation, particularly in counter-terrorism.
At the same time, Rubio sought to reassure regional partners, saying that closer engagement with Pakistan does not come at the expense of US ties with India.
“I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India, which is deep, historic, and important,” he had said, describing US policy as pragmatic and interest-based.
US President Donald Trump, however, has also highlighted strains in Washington’s dealings with New Delhi.
Speaking at a political gathering this week, Trump said: “I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi … he’s not that happy with me because they’re paying a lot of tariffs now,” referring to trade and energy-related differences between the two countries.
Meanwhile, in his meeting with US lawmakers, Ambassador Sheikh also praised the US president’s political judgment and personal engagement in helping de-escalate tensions following the military escalation between Islamabad and New Delhi in May 2025.
According to the handouts, the discussions in Washington also focused on regional security challenges, with the Pakistani ambassador warning that terrorism originating from Afghanistan continued to pose serious threats to Pakistan’s security as well as to regional and international peace.
He told congressional leaders that terrorist incidents in Pakistan increased by 40 per cent in 2024 and by a further 25pc in 2025, attributing the rise to militant groups operating from Afghan soil.
He expressed concern over the continued misuse of advanced weapons left behind during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Addressing South Asian tensions, Ambassador Sheikh referred to the events of May 2025 and said India’s “irresponsible and aggressive behaviour” had lowered the threshold of escalation in the region.
He warned that confrontation between two nuclear-armed neighbours had moved beyond conventional conflict to include advanced technologies, describing the use of dual-capable weapons in a region of 1.7 billion people as deeply alarming.
Ambassador Sheikh cautioned that decisions based on misperceptions or miscalculations could undermine regional peace and reiterated that the unresolved issue of Kashmir and the right of self-determination of its people remained central to lasting stability in South Asia.
Both sides agreed on the need to institutionalise structured and regular dialogue on issues of mutual interest, including economic cooperation and security.
Ambassador Sheikh also extended invitations to congressional leaders to visit Pakistan to strengthen parliamentary and people-to-people ties.
About his meeting with Rogers, the envoy said on X that the two discussed the “ascendantly evolving Pak-US partnership”.
“Focused on regional security challenges, the escalating and sponsored terrorism from Afghanistan, and the subsequently urgent need to address the leftover military equipment. Emphasised that a stable, standalone Pak-US relationship remained vital to regional as well as global peace, security and stability,” he said.







About his meeting with Mast, the ambassador said he thanked him for his leadership and continued support during a year of positive trajectory in Pak-US relations.
“Noted that 2026 must be a year of action — moving from good intent to concrete content based on structured and sustained engagement, geared to translating our ties into a long-term partnership on its own merits,” he said.
“Also exchanged views on regional and global developments. Sought support for enhanced counterterror cooperation, and invited him to visit Pakistan,“ he said.

“What I have done is that I have asked our three missions to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It’s a security issue,” he told reporters at the foreign ministry, responding to a question on whether Bangladesh missions in India had restricted tourist visas for Indians.
He did not name the missions. However, diplomatic sources said the visa sections of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, the Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, and the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala have been closed.
The visa sections at Bangladesh missions in Chennai and Mumbai, however, remain operational, sources said.
Over the past few weeks, protests have taken place near Bangladesh missions in India.

 

Following the ouster of the Awami League regime, the Indian High Commission restricted tourist visas to Bangladeshis, citing security concerns.
Touhid was also asked about the dropping of Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman from the Indian Premier League amid anti-Bangladesh protests in India, and Bangladesh’s decision not to send the national cricket team to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup.
The adviser said he fully supported Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul’s stance on not sending the team to India for safety reasons and demanding that Bangladesh’s matches be relocated to co-host Sri Lanka.
“We will certainly play outside India,” Touhid said.
He added that both players and supporters would have to travel to India and said the government must consider their security.
Asked about the impact on bilateral relations, Touhid said such issues arise from time to time and each has some impact.
He said Bangladesh would take decisions based on its national interest.
“We have an interest in our players’ safety in not sending them to India. If we have interest in buying rice from India, we will buy it,” he added.

Following the issuance of the policy directive, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) is expected to release the information memorandum (IM) for telecom operators and new entrants to participate in the upcoming spectrum auction.
Under the policy framework, spectrum fees have been fixed in dollars, while the exchange rate will be determined at the closing National Bank of Pakistan’s TT selling rate prevailing on the day preceding the auction date.
A minimum of 50 per cent of the spectrum fee will be payable within one year from the date of licence issuance. The remaining 50pc will be payable in five equal annual instalments at KIBOR offer rate plus 3pc.
Previously, interest rates were based on the London Interbank Offered Rate under the 2021 policy directive issued by the IT ministry. Under the new framework, licences will be issued for a period of 15 years. The PTA is expected to issue the IM shortly for telecom operators and any potential new entrants.
The auction will be conducted by the PTA for 15 MHz paired spectrum in the 700 MHz band, 3.6 MHz paired spectrum in the 1800 MHz band, 20 MHz paired spectrum in the 2100 MHz band, 50 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 2300 MHz band, 190 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 2600 MHz band, and 280 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 3500 MHz band.
The base prices for the various spectrum bands have been set at $6.5 million for 1 MHz paired spectrum in the 700 MHz band, $14m for 1 MHz paired spectrum in both the 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz bands, $1m for 1 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 2300 MHz band, $1.25m for 1 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 2600 MHz band, and $0.65m for 1 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 3500 MHz band.
At the same time, the IT ministry has taken note of broader concerns of the telecom industry and has asked the federal government to take measures in consultation with relevant stakeholders.
It has suggested that to enhance the market penetration of 5G-compatible smartphones, taxes should be reduced to promote local manufacturing. Another proposal is to allow duty-free import of 5G equipment to accelerate adoption.
The IT ministry has also asked the government to implement an industrial power tariff for the telecom sector through a joint task force comprising the ministry, Power Division, Nepra, PTA, telecom operators and power distribution companies.
The PTA has obligated PTCL to participate in the upcoming spectrum auction, while Jazz has welcomed the policy directive.
Kazim Mujtaba, president of Jazz’s consumer division, said that long-standing structural challenges faced by the telecom sector have been addressed, adding that these will translate into tangible progress, enabling sustained investment, network expansion and the delivery of affordable, high-quality connectivity nationwide.

According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck at a depth of 159km in the Tajikistan- Xinjiang border region at 2am.
The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which reports magnitude using the Moment Magnitude scale, said the earthquake had a magnitude of 5.3 and struck Tajikistan at a depth of 140km.
The United States Geological Survey said Pakistan, Tajikistan, China and Afghanistan were among the affected countries.
According to media reports, the tremors were felt in Islamabad and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There were no immediate reports of any casualties.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
In October 2025, a 3.2-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Karachi. A month earlier, a 5.5-magnitude earthquake was felt in areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2026-01-09 04:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/090927211be7b7d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965981/trump-says-us-going-to-start-now-hitting-land-against-drug-cartels' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US ‘going to start now hitting land’ against drug cartels</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that land strikes against drug cartels were on the way following maritime attacks in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, without providing further details.
“We are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico,” Trump told broadcaster Sean Hannity in an interview on Fox News that aired on Thursday night.
Trump’s comments come after the brazen abduction of Venezuelan leader Nicholas Maduro last weekend, the culmination of months of mounting US military and economic pressure on the leftist leader.
As part of that campaign, the United States has killed more than 100 people in strikes on alleged drug boats since September, and Trump has also said that the US forces conducted a land strike on a docking area for such vessels in Venezuela.
But strikes on cartels in Mexico would mark a significant US military escalation.
The left-wing interim government in Caracas has condemned US strikes on Venezuela as a threat to regional stability.
Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday that the Americas “do not belong” to any power, after Trump invoked Washington’s “dominance” of the hemisphere after seizing Maduro.
Trump said on Sunday he was pushing Sheinbaum to let him send US troops to tackle drug cartels in Mexico, an offer he said she had previously rebuffed.</p><small>2026-01-09 04:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08173420e8aeac9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965821/historic-rs185bn-bid-buys-sialkot-as-new-psl-franchise-hyderabad-snapped-up-for-rs175bn' target='_blank'><strong>Historic Rs1.85bn bid buys Sialkot as new PSL franchise, Hyderabad snapped up for Rs1.75bn</strong></a><br><p>Two new franchises were added to the Pakistan Super League (PSL) as OZ Developers put forward a massive Rs1.85bn bid to win Sialkot, moments after the FKS Group secured Hyderabad for Rs1.75bn at the league’s auction on Thursday.
OZ Developers were in a bidding war with software company i2c as they went head-to-head in the second round of the auction taking place at the Jinnah Convention Centre in Islamabad.
I2c’s final bid was Rs1.82bn before OZ Developers upped the ante and ended the night at Rs1.85bn, the highest ever bid for a PSL franchise.
The first round of the auction was won by FKS, which was also in a bidding war with i2c, whose final bid was Rs1.7bn.







The base price for the first franchise — the seventh team being added to PSL — was set at Rs1.1bn, while the base price for the eighth team was Rs1.7bn.
This will be Hyderabad and Sialkot’s first appearance since the league’s inception in 2015, with this year’s league set for March 26-May 3.
The cities up for potential franchise allocation included Faisalabad, Gilgit, Hyderabad, Muzaffarabad, Rawalpindi and Sialkot.
The current PSL teams include Lahore Qalandars, Islamabad United, Peshawar Zalmi, Quetta Gladiators, Karachi Kings and Multan Sultans.
Bidders for the two new teams were FKS, OZ Developers, Aim Next inc, Deharki Sugar Mills, Inverex Solar, i2c, Jazz, Prism Developers, VGO TEL, and Walee Pakistan.
Commentator and former Pakistan cricket team captain Wasim Akram hosted the auction as PSL CEO Salman Naseer joined him on stage.
“Ten years of PSL have lead us to this moment,” Naseer said at the start of the auction.
Akram coaxed the bidders by reminding them that winning a bid was more than just ownership; it was the ability to design new logos, kits, interact with players and much more.
Ahead of the bidding process, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi awarded a cash prize of Rs 90 million to the team that won the Rising Star Asia Cup.
The team that won the Hong Kong Sixes title was also awarded a cash prize of Rs 18.5m.







The bidding deadline was extended multiple times — initially from December 15 to December 22, and further to December 24 — amid growing interest from investors in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and beyond, following promotional roadshows in London and New York.
Ex-Multan Sultans owner Ali Tareen pulls out of auction
Earlier in the day, ex-Multan Sultans owner Ali Tareen announced on social media that he and his family would not be participating in the PSL auction.
“Our time with Multan Sultans was never just about owning a cricket team. It was about south Punjab,” he wrote in a post on X.
“[It was] about giving a voice to a region that had been overlooked for too long. That’s what drove everything we built.”
Tareen added that if he were to return to the league, it would have to be for the same reason, stating that south Punjab “is where my heart is”.
“This year, I’ll be in the stands. Cheering for players on and celebrating with the fans. And when the Multan team is being sold, we’ll be ready,” he wrote.

ISLAMABAD: Religious motivation for charity puts Pakistanis among the top donors in the world, but 42 per cent of people express their inability to donate due to financial constraints.
This has been reported by the Pakistan Centre for Philanthropy (PCP), a non-governmental organisation, based on The World Giving Report (WGR) 2025 and its own surveys and evaluation of over 5,000 not-for-profit organisations in the country.
The PCP says about two-thirds (73pc) of Pakistanis donated money in 2024 for various social causes.
“This is above the global average of 64pc and the continental average of 69pc. This is reflective of the generous impulse of charitable giving for causes people care for,” the PCP says in its ‘Giving in Pakistan 2025’ report.
Interestingly, Nigeria scores the highest at 89pc, while Japan ranks the lowest with 16pc.
As such, Pakistan ranks 17th out of 101 countries for how generous its people are and also places 17th in terms of the proportion of income donated.
In terms of percentage of income donated at 1.64pc, Pakistan ranks above the global average of 1.04pc despite having an income distribution highly skewed towards the middle- and low-income brackets.
In contrast, volunteering is not a common practice in Pakistan, as only 16pc of people report having volunteered time in 2024.
This reflects into just 3.5 hours volunteered on average per person, nearly half of the continental average of 7.5 hours and far lower than 8.9 hours of the global average.
The report finds that lack of affordability is the predominant cause of non-giving in all parts of the world, including Pakistan.
Out of the 27pc non-givers, the major reason mentioned for not giving is lack of affordability in Pakistan, compared to 40pc average globally and 35pc in the Asia continent.
However, 18pc of non-monetary givers prefer to give in-kind — in the form of food or other support.
A total of 42pc of people did not donate in 2024 due to lack of affordability.
Major motivations
The PCP notes religious motivation and compassion for a cause as the leading reasons for giving money. Among the people who donated, the top three reasons are religious obligation (58pc), care about a cause (54pc) and a sense of duty to give to charity (49pc).
The report says Pakistanis prefer to do­­nate money directly to a person or family in need, accounting for the highest proportion at 51pc, followed by giving money to charities at 47pc and religious causes at 34pc.
These proportions are all higher than global and continental scores, and the “pattern of giving in Pakistan indicates that faith-based giving and deep compassion for helping a person or family in need runs through every neighbourhood and community”.
The survey also shows that Pakistanis give money frequently with nearly 18pc donating more than 12 times during 2024 and 21pc giving between six and 11 times — both figures are higher than global and continental averages.
“This relatively higher frequency of giving could be attributed to the general trend of donating on religious and cultural occasions, such as [the] festivals of Ramazan, Eid and other religious events.”
Direct giving
Of all money given in 2024, 44.7pc goes directly to people in need, far more than to charities (33.8pc) and to religious reasons (21.5pc.).
This shows that Pakistan’s giving profile leans heavily towards direct giving instead of formalised charity, hence a preference for informal giving to individuals.
Also, the generosity in Pakistan felt like a duty — hard-wired into the culture.
This behaviour could be closely associated with religious norms and obligations such as Zakat, Sadaqah and Fitrana
Around 89pc felt “happy” fulfilling this duty, while nearly 70pc felt “very happy”.
The PCP argues that improved credibility and effectiveness of the charity sector could increase donations.
About 32pc of people show more willingness to donate if charities are well-regulated and almost a same proportion are ready to donate if they had more money.
Around 29pc appeared ready to increase their donations if they knew more about how and where their money was spent.
Poverty and religious organisations are the most popular causes in Pakistan, followed by homelessness and disability-related reasons.
Around 39pc of giving goes to the poor, 38pc to religious organisations, 30pc to the homeless and 28pc to people with disabilities.
Pakistanis also trusted their charity organisations more than the regional and global averages.
Overall, the public in Pakistan give a score of 10.4 out of 15 for how much they trust charities, compared to an Asian average of 9.65 and a global average of 9.22.

The instruction was rel­ayed by Hafiz Gul Baha­dur, who heads the so-cal­led Ittehadul Mujahideen Pakistan, in an audio message released to his cadres a few days ago, The Khorasan Diary reported.
This also seems to fly in the face of Kabul’s stance that the terrorist threat plaguing Pakistan is “an internal problem”.
The issue of Afghan soil and fighters being used to stage terrorist attacks in Pakistan has remained a critical bone of contention between Islamabad and Afghanistan, escalating into border skirmishes and leading to the eventual closure of the Pak-Afghan border in October last year.
In recent months, Pakis­tan’s civilian and military leadership has maintained that the terrorism plaguing the country originated from Afghanistan.
The instruction from Gul Bahadur comes in the backdrop of pressure from the Afghan Taliban on their Pakistani comrades — in the face of rising international pressure — and follows a decree by a council of religious scholars, pledging that Afghan soil would not be used against a foreign country.
Issued in Kabul early last month, the decree followed a similar statement by the Afghan Taliban su­­preme leader Hibatul­lah Akhundzada, which had largely gone unheeded.

The saga began when the YouTuber was allegedly assau­lted on Dec 29, 2025, while appearing for the hearing of his bail plea in a case registered against him for allegedly hurting people’s religious sentiments.
The violent incident also drew a reaction from Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar, who termed the matter unfortunate and regrettable, and told the media that it was not a good thing for society that lawyers, instead of protecting the law, had taken the law into their own hands.
In response to the assault, Butt’s counsel, Mian Ali Ashfaq, registered a case against Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and 15 to 20 other lawyers under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 337-A (punishment for shajjah) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

 

Meanwhile, on a request by the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) to the Punjab Bar Council (PBC) to take action against counsel Mian Ashfaq, the council on Jan 1 suspended his licence to practice and referred the matter to its disciplinary committee.

Rivals undertake to withdraw cases, complaints against each other

On Thursday, Mian Ashfaq visited the KBA on its request and held a press conference, flanked by KBA president Aamir Nawaz Warraich, general secretary Rehman Korai, senior counsel Rehan Aziz, advocate Solangi — the complainant in the case pertaining to hurting religious sentiments against the YouTuber — and advocate Fatah, in the committee room of the KBA office.
After holding talks in a separate room, Mian Ashfaq told the media that, after detailed discussions on all matters that arose after the incident, both parties had agreed — without any conditions imposed on either side — to withdraw the cases registered against each other, without specifying whether the case against Butt for allegedly hurting religious sentiments would also be withdrawn.
In his talk, he also praised the KBA for providing a platform to resolve the issue between the two sides.
Speaking to the media, Mr Warraich said the incident had tarnished the reputation of the legal community.
He urged lawyers to confine themselves to their role as counsel in matters relating to religion rather than becoming complainants, and stressed that they should not be involved in assaults.
He added that every litigant who approaches the courts must be treated with respect.
It is pertinent to mention here that Butt is required to appear before the court in Karachi on Jan 13, in the case pertaining to allegedly hurting religious sentiments, for confirmation of his interim bail or otherwise.

ADEN: The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen said on Thursday that southern separatist lea­der, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, has fled the country by boat, as government forces advanced on the port city of Aden.
The coalition said in a statement that Zubaidi travelled from Yemen to Somaliland, where he boarded an aircraft to Mogadishu. The coalition stated the plane was later tracked to a military airport in Abu Dhabi.
The Somali government announced it has launched an investigation to determine if its airports were used to transport a “political fugitive”, a reference to Zubaidi.
The country’s Immigration and Citizenship Agency said that if this proved to be true, it would constitute a “serious violation” of national sovereignty.
Zubaidi’s escape follows his failure to appear for crisis talks in Riyadh on Wednesday. His group, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), claimed he had been asked to go to Saudi Arabia under threat.
In a statement, the Saudi-led coalition provided further details about the flight from Somaliland. It said the aircraft turned off its identification system over the Gulf of Oman before turning it back on 10 minutes before its arrival at Al Reef military airport in Abu Dhabi.
The situation in Aden appeared stable on Thursday, with Saudi-backed Yemeni government forces patrolling the streets and no sign of STC forces, a witness told Reuters. Authorities have also imposed a nighttime curfew in the city.
Aden served as the seat of Yemen’s internationally recognised government since Houthi forces seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014, but leaders of the Saudi-backed government left Aden last month after the STC took control of the city.

 

The Saudi-led coalition first intervened in Yemen in 2015 to support the government against the Houthis, an intervention that led to one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The STC was established in 2017 and later joined the government coalition.
An STC delegation in Riyadh said it had held fruitful talks with the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, according to comments by Mohammed Al Ghaith, a senior official of the group.
Meanwhile, Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council on Thursday ousted the separatist leader from its ranks and referred him for investigation on charges of high treason after he fled the country, according to Arab News.
The council held an emergency meeting, revoking Zubaidi’s membership and dismissing two ministers, Transport Minister Abdul­salam Humaid and Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Waed Badhib, from their posts.
The meeting also revealed a split within the STC, as one of its prominent members, Abdulrahman Al-Muharrami, attended the session that voted to oust Zubaidi.
Al-Muharrami’s Giants Brigades forces have also been deployed to help prevent security breakdowns in Aden in coordination with the government, officials said.

The Brussels-based independent and non-profit think tank, founded by prominent statesmen, says in a new report that relations between the two countries have tanked, mainly because of the Afghan Taliban’s refusal to crack down on the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Since 2022, violence in Pakistan has spiralled. In 2025 alone, militants killed more than 600 Pakistani soldiers and police, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the two provinces bordering Afghanistan.
Islamabad blames the banned TTP for these attacks, along with Baloch insurgent groups, which it believes with evidence, are backed by arch-rival India.

Brussels-based think tank says Islamabad may strike Afghanistan again if militant attacks continue

“UN monitors assert that the TTP enjoys Taliban support, but the Taliban publicly deny that Pakistani militants are even in Afghanistan and say Islamabad provoked what they paint as homegrown violence,” according to the report.
On its western flank, after 11 Pakistani military personnel were martyred in a TTP attack on Oct 8, Islamabad conducted cross-border airstrikes, including its first-ever strike on Kabul, ostensibly targeting TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud.
Afghanistan retaliated with attacks on Pakistani military installations. Continued fighting claimed military and civilian lives on both sides.
The report cautions that Islamabad is likely to lash out again if it traces another strike back to Afghanistan.
The Taliban regime is badly outgunned, but its retaliation could still be lethal. Kabul claims to have missiles that can reach Pakistani cities, the use of which would likely provoke an even stronger Pakistani response.
South Asia
In South Asia, however, Islamabad’s foreign relations are far more fraught. After short wars in 2025 with both Afghanistan and India, another major attack by militants could upend the precarious calm that prevails between Pakistan and its two neighbours.
The report lists 10 conflicts to watch in 2026: Afghanistan-Pakistan, Myan­mar, Israel and the United States versus Iran, Israel-Palestine, Syria, Ukraine, Mali and Burkina Faso, Ethiopia-Eritrea, Sudan, and Venezuela.
The report says the world was careening into a dangerous new era well before Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Thus far, his second term has done less to slow things down than to put a foot on the gas. The year 2025 was a bloody one, and 2026 promises little better.
‘Trump effect’
Less predictable has been President Trump, whose first year back in the White House has turned world politics and international crisis management on their heads. Trump returned to power pledging to bring peace to a world ablaze. He has put himself centre stage in many wars and trouble spots.
Trump has brought fresh attention to peacemaking after years in which diplomatic efforts to end conflicts had been flailing.
But Trump has not calmed the global turmoil he decried on the campaign trail. In some cases, he has made it worse.
His deals, often built on other countries’ diplomacy, have brought respite to some battlefields but delivered no lasting peace anywhere.
Trump’s deal-making aims to bring US power to bear, whether in Gaza, by leveraging Israel’s dependency on Washington, or elsewhere, mostly by threatening tariffs or dangling business opportunities.
Trump’s bargaining must be set against the dearth of peace deals that preceded his return to power as well as the lack of progress in places where he does not engage.
European leaders, for example, focused on the existential peril they see on their doorstep, have less bandwidth for peacemaking elsewhere, the report says.

“He (Xi) considers it to be a part of China, and that‘s up to him what he’s going to be doing,” Trump told the newspaper on Wednesday.
“But I‘ve expressed to him that I would be very unhappy if he did that, and I don’t think he‘ll do that. I hope he doesn’t do that.”
Trump made the comments in the context of an exchange about what lessons Xi might take away from Trump‘s audacious military operation in Venezuela and the abduction of the country’s president, Nicolas Maduro.
The Republican president said he did not view the situations as analogous because Taiwan did not pose the same type of threat to China that he has said the government of Maduro posed to the United States.
He also repeated his belief that Xi would not make a move against Taiwan during his presidency, which ends in 2029.
“He may do it after we have a different president, but I don‘t think he’s going to do it with me as president,” Trump said.
The Trump administration said in a strategy document last year that it aims to prevent conflict with China over Taiwan and the South China Sea by building up US and allies’ military power.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own, and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan rejects Beijing’s claims.
The Taiwan question is purely China‘s internal affair, and how to resolve it is a matter purely within China’s sovereign rights, said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington.
The United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Washington is the island’s most important international backer and is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.
The issue has been an irritant in US-China relations for years.
Trump has largely avoided directly saying how he would respond to a rise in tensions over the island.</p><small>2026-01-09 02:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09070806fb302bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965945/us-border-agent-shoots-wounds-2-people-in-portland' target='_blank'><strong>US border agent shoots, wounds 2 people in Portland</strong></a><br><p>A US immigration agent shot and wounded a man and a woman in Portland, Oregon, authorities said on Thursday, leading local officials to call for calm given public outrage over the ICE shooting death of a Minnesota woman a day earlier.
“We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more,” Portland police chief Bob Day said in a statement.
The Portland shooting unfolded on Thursday afternoon as US Border Patrol agents were conducting a targeted vehicle stop, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.
The statement said the driver, a suspected Venezuelan gang member, attempted to “weaponise” his vehicle and run over the agents.
In response, DHS said, “an agent fired a defensive shot” and the driver and a passenger drove away.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the circumstances of the incident.
Portland police said that the shooting took place near a medical clinic in eastern Portland.
Six minutes after arriving at the scene and determining federal agents were involved in the shooting, police were informed that two people with gunshot wounds — a man and a woman — were asking for help at a location about 3 km to the northeast of the medical clinic.
Police said they applied tourniquets to the man and woman, who were taken to a hospital. Their condition was unknown.
The shooting came just a day after a federal agent from US. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a separate agency within the Department of Homeland Security, fatally shot a 37-year-old mother of three in her car in Minneapolis.

 

That shooting has prompted two days of protests in Minneapolis. Officers from both ICE and Border Patrol have been deployed in cities across the United States as part of Republican President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.
While the aggressive enforcement operations have been cheered by the president’s supporters, Democrats and civil rights activists have decried the posture as an unnecessary provocation.
US officials contend criminal suspects and anti-Trump activists have increasingly used their cars as weapons, though video evidence has sometimes contradicted their claims.
Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said in a statement his city was now grappling with violence at the hands of federal agents and that “we cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts”.
He called on ICE to halt all its operations in the city until an investigation can be completed.
“Federal militarisation undermines effective, community-based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region,” Wilson said.
“I will use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents’ civil and human rights.”</p><small>2026-01-09 02:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08221427eac738e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965837/pakistan-muslim-countries-express-strong-condemnation-of-israeli-fms-visit-to-somaliland' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Muslim countries ‘express strong condemnation’ of Israeli FM’s visit to Somaliland</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and a wide selection of Muslim countries issued a joint statement on Thursday condemning a visit by Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to Somaliland earlier this week.
On Tuesday, Saar arrived in Somaliland for a high-profile visit, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”, after Israel recognised the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa.
The joint statement, issued by the Foreign Office (FO) today, was issued on behalf of the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Gambia, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Türkiye and Yemen, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
It recalled the earlier statement condemning Israeli recognition and “expressed strong condemnation” of the Israeli FM’s visit.
“The said visit constitutes a clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and undermines established international norms and the United Nations Charter,” the joint statement said.







It reaffirmed the 22 countries’ unwavering support for the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia and highlighted that “encouraging secessionist agendas are unacceptable and risk exacerbating tensions in an already fragile region”.
“Respect for international law, non-interference in [the] internal affairs of sovereign states, and adherence to diplomatic norms are essential for regional and international stability,” the joint statement added, commending Somalia’s commitment to peaceful international engagement, constructive diplomacy and international law.
The statement expressed the 22 countries’ commitment “in continuing to support diplomatic and legal measures taken by Somalia to safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity and stability in line with international law”.
It further stressed that Israel should respect Somalia’s sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity and honour its obligations in compliance with international law, further demanding that Tel Aviv immediately revoke its recognition of Somaliland.
Somaliland enjoys a strategic position on the Gulf of Aden and has its own currency, passport and army, but has struggled to win international recognition, amid fears of provoking Somalia and encouraging other separatist movements in Africa.
Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
Last month, Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in rejecting Israel‘s recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.
The joint statement underscored their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of Somalia.
The statement added that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.</p><small>2026-01-08 17:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08212510c3e2cd5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965825/negotiations-do-not-happen-in-jail-ptis-raja-says-talks-with-govt-will-not-happen-in-imrans-absence' target='_blank'><strong>‘Negotiations do not happen in jail’: PTI’s Raja says talks with govt will not happen in Imran’s absence</strong></a><br><p>PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said on Thursday that negotiations with the federal government would not take place if party founder Imran Khan is not present.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, Raja said that the party’s stance on talks is very clear: “You cannot come into our house, attack us, loot us and then invite us for negotiations.
“Give us an agenda, tell us what topics will be discussed,” he added. “We cannot negotiate in Imran Khan’s absence. You cannot expect to put him in a black hole while everyone else talks and the PM eats biscuits. It will not happen like that.”
Raja continued, recounting that between December 2024 and January 2025, they wanted to meet Imran and have him present at the talks, but that was not authorised.
He added that judicial probes into the riots on May 9, 2023, and the PTI’s Islamabad march on November 26, 2024, were also denied.
“The plan seems to be an effort to bury the attack on voters on February 8, 2024, and move on from it,” the party official claimed, referring to the date of the last general elections, which the PTI has repeatedly claimed were rigged.
When asked about whether talks would happen on January 12, as per Federal Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Raja replied that he was not aware of the date.
In response to another question about differing party views on talks, Raja emphasised that Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Imran’s sister Aleema Khan were on the same page.
“This past Tuesday, Achakzai sahib and Aleema were present outside Adiala jail. Together, they spoke with the press,” the secretary general replied.
“They’re saying the same thing: talks will only happen when the powers that be realise that the Pakistani people are tired of them and the system. It’s a system where people are struggling to find livelihoods, health and education. We need to express our displeasure.”
Raja further added that Achakzai had travelled from Islamabad to Lahore today for street mobilisation, but claimed that the TTAP chief was stopped several times along the route and several PTI workers had been arrested and “someone had died”.
“How can talks happen in this environment, if you are not willing to give even a little bit of political space?” he asked. “You have denied two distinguished gentlemen passage from Islamabad to Lahore and have turned Lahore into a battleground. And you want us to sit and talk?
“Negotiations do not happen in a graveyard or a jail, they require space.”
On December 23, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
Since then, the PTI has said that it would not come to the table, citing instructions from Imran. However, the TTAP opposition alliance, of which the PTI is a part, has stated its openness to talks.
Last week, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said that “confidence-building measures” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation.
“Two of them are my leaders, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif. The third is President Asif Ali Zardari, the fourth is [incarcerated PTI leader] Imran Khan, and everyone knows who the fifth is,” Sanaullah said.
In response to Sanaullah, PTI Chief Whip Malik Amir Dogar said the government should arrange a meeting between Achakzai, MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, and the incarcerated PTI founder.
“Hopefully, a path will be made,” he added.</p><small>2026-01-08 16:25</small></div><hr>
