“Either we reach a deal, or we’ll have to do something very tough,” it quoted Trump as saying.
Trump has said he is considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, Axios and Channel 12 reported, amid simmering tensions between Washington and Tehran over Iran’s nuclear programme and over its recent crackdown on protesters.
“We have an armada that is heading there and another one might be going,” Trump told Axios, though he noted that Iran “wants to make a deal very badly”.
Trump initially threatened military action against Tehran over its crackdown on protesters last month. Subsequently, the US said that a naval strike group led by an aircraft carrier was deployed to Middle Eastern waters amid tensions between the two countries.
However, the countries held talks in Oman last week, which Iran called a good start. Trump also called the talks “very good” and pledged another round of negotiations.
On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he hoped talks with the US would resume soon, while reiterating Tehran’s red lines and warning against any American attack.
According to excerpts published on his official Telegram channel during an interview with the Al Jazeera network, Araghchi said that Iran’s missile programme was “never negotiable” in the talks in Oman.
He warned that Tehran would target US bases in the region if the US attacked Iranian territory.</p><small>2026-02-10 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/101857505166d0b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972273/underdogs-strike-associate-teams-are-setting-the-t20-stage-on-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Underdogs strike: Associate teams are setting the T20 stage on fire</strong></a><br><p>After Sri Lanka’s win against Ireland on Sunday night in Colombo, Ramiz Raja declared that a win is a win, whether it is against “minnows”, or the “big boys”.
The term “minnow”, in the cricketing context especially, refers to a smaller, ‘less serious’ opposition. Despite being a test-playing nation, Ireland tends to often be categorised under this moniker. However, the term is also heavily used to refer to associate cricketing nations – those teams that do not yet have permanent ICC membership or test-playing status.
While one could argue that Ramiz Raja meant well, his choice of words came across as patronising and dismissive of the effort associate nations put into cricket. The opening weekend of the ongoing T20 World Cup offered ample evidence to the contrary.
T20 opens with edge-of-seat contests
The opening days of the tournament featured games across venues in India and Sri Lanka. Notably, many of these games were closely contested — especially the opening weekend fixtures — with the matches ebbing and flowing, and rarely was one team distinctly ahead in the contest than the other.
The closest of these to home was of course the opening fixture between Pakistan and the Netherlands. While Pakistan was relatively comfortable in the chase, a spectacular middle-order collapse left the team reeling, requiring 29 runs off the final two overs. It was a penultimate-over cameo by Faheem Ashraf, complemented by a fortuitous dropped catch that got Pakistan over the line.
For all intents and purposes, the match should have been an easier one to win for Pakistan, with the team being just 2 wickets down when they needed 50 to win off the same number of balls.
However, Netherlands’ performance established a trend that developed in the games to follow: associate nations showing up as exceptionally competent, competitive sides, making the contests much different than the one-sided affairs the uninitiated might have expected.
It should also be noted that the Netherlands are hardly strangers to success at ICC tournaments. In 2022, they defeated South Africa (to the considerable benefit of Pakistan’s qualification scenarios) in a spectacular upset, and followed it up by an even more impressive win against the same opponent in the 2023 ODI World Cup.
Later in the day, the USA put India under pressure in the powerplay, reducing them to 46 for four. A solid captain’s knock by Suryakumar Yadav ensured India ended up with a close-to-par score that the bowlers defended convincingly — but USA had done enough to prove that they are a side to be taken seriously in theT20 World Cup.
Perhaps the most convincing of these associate performances came when evening. The atmosphere at the Wankhede was electric as Nepal took on England on Sunday, the stands packed with hundreds of Nepal fans roaring their team on as they came agonisingly close to chasing down England’s 183. In the end, Nepal fell just four runs short, with England barely escaping jail — and only after being tested to the absolute limit.
On Monday morning, Italy faced Scotland in a historic first World Cup appearance for the European nation, having qualified for the tournament by finishing second in the 2025 Europe Qualifiers.
T20: Cricket’s great equaliser
While the scheduling of the T20 World Cups attracts its fair share of criticism — for being held every two years instead of four and for over-saturating the sport’s calendar — it is undeniable that the 20-team format is the closest cricket has come to a truly global tournament.
T20 cricket itself is often criticised for diluting the essence of the game: for being too fast-paced, for driving over-commercialisation, and for indirectly undermining international formats due to the financial pull of franchise leagues.
What is often overlooked, however, is that the brevity and volatility of the shortest format enable something the longer formats do not: they narrow the gap created by disparities in skill, resources, and financial strength between associate nations and established teams.
At times, Test and ODI cricket serve more as displays of endurance than of outright skill. Teams operating with limited financial and administrative resources often face corresponding limitations in infrastructure: inadequate cricketing grounds and wickets, insufficient equipment, and sparse training facilities. As a result, even associate cricketing nations with abundant talent may struggle to develop players into durable all-format cricketers.
Furthermore, the current ICC calendar is heavily oriented around full-member nations playing each other, with associate nations rarely getting the opportunity to face stronger opponents in bilateral series that could strengthen their game. The lack of consistent match practice and training resources can lead to the raw talent of these players diminishing over the extended durations of Tests or one-day matches.
T20 cricket, however, presents a different scenario. Played over just four hours, it allows associate nations to compete within a timeframe that lets them showcase their full strength, even against much stronger teams.
T20 cricket is also the most accessible format. Permanent Test and ODI status is reserved for full-member nations, and temporary ODI status is often contingent on performance and other criteria. For many associate nations, T20 cricket remains the primary format in which they can consistently participate.
As the T20 game has evolved, so too has the arsenal of format-specific skills available to players. This allows teams to concentrate their development on this particular format, fostering a clear understanding of player roles, management strategies, and tactical approaches tailored specifically to T20 cricket.
In the games played so far, the craft of associate spinners has been particularly noteworthy, with standout performances by Nepal’s Dipendra Singh Airee and the Netherlands’ Aryan Dutt against England and Pakistan serving as proof.
Add to this the increasingly fast-paced (and therefore precarious and volatile) nature of T20 cricket, and the possibilities multiply. While teams with greater time and structural investment naturally maintain an advantage, it is not as decisive as it would be in the longer formats.
This is also why many “upsets” in cricket occur during T20 matches. A shorter game allows unlikely winners to emerge by sustaining moments of brilliance and consistency long enough to tip the balance. Notable examples from recent years include the Netherlands defeating South Africa in 2022, the USA beating Pakistan in 2024, Namibia overcoming Sri Lanka in 2022, and Nepal winning 2-1 against the West Indies in a three-match series in 2025.
Cricket still has a long way to go before it becomes a truly global sport. The disparities in resources and decision-making autonomy remain stark — both within some full-member nations and, more dramatically, between them and associate nations. Some teams, like the Netherlands, have competed as associate nations for many years across multiple tournaments, often attracting criticism for stagnation.
An opponent is an opponent
However, through T20 cricket, especially world cups, associate nations are making a mark for themselves by producing powerful performances more consistently than they did in previous years.
Problems of materials and resources aside, what also needs to change in the broader cricketing fraternity is the way associate nations are talked about and approached as sporting entities.
Words like “minnows” and “small teams” diminishes the spirit and skill that these teams show up with to compete against opponents who have an advantage of decades and millions in front of them.
On paper, fans of established teams might rightly expect their sides to win. But there needs to be a breakdown in the sense of shame created around losing, or almost losing, to associate teams. Recognising and awarding merit to their successes, viewing them as genuine victories rather than mere “upsets,” would be a crucial step toward granting associate nations the legitimacy they deserve as serious competitors rather than formalities.
An opponent is an opponent is an opponent. An cricket is so close to understanding why.</p><small>2026-02-10 17:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10215858126deab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972350/norway-parliament-to-appoint-rare-outside-probe-of-foreign-ministrys-epstein-links' target='_blank'><strong>Norway parliament to appoint rare outside probe of foreign ministry’s Epstein links</strong></a><br><p>Norway’s parliamentary oversight committee unanimously agreed on Tuesday to appoint a rare external inquiry into foreign ministry links to Jeffrey Epstein, part of a deepening scandal over friendships with the late US sex offender.
The release of a cache of new files in the US has revealed a host of new Epstein connections with politicians, royals and the ultra-rich across Europe.
Norway’s white-collar crime police opened an investigation into Thorbjoern Jagland, former prime minister and foreign minister and ex-chair of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, on suspicion of aggravated corruption.
On Monday, police announced that Mona Juul, who on Sunday resigned as ambassador to Jordan and Iraq, was also being investigated for corruption. Her husband, former cabinet minister Terje Roed-Larsen, is suspected of complicity.
All three will cooperate with the respective investigations and see no merit in the accusations, their lawyers have said.
Epstein scandal reverberates across Norway
But the police’s actions have not stemmed the demand for a public inquiry in a country where officials are expected to be squeaky-clean.
“If only half of what we have learned in the last few weeks is true, then this is terrible,” the Labour Party’s Sverre Myrli told reporters after a meeting of parliament’s Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs.
The files show, among other things, that Jagland and Epstein’s assistants made detailed plans in 2014 for Jagland, his wife, two children and his son’s girlfriend to visit Epstein at Palm Beach and the Caribbean island that he owned.
Jagland, then secretary general of the Council of Europe rights watchdog, has denied ever visiting Epstein’s private island.
In an email in 2014, he sought Epstein’s help in financing an apartment in Oslo.
Emails from 2018 showed Epstein asking Jagland to arrange for him to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and saying he had insights to offer President Vladimir Putin. Jagland promised to bring it up with Lavrov’s assistant.
Roed-Larsen’s ties to Epstein came to light in 2019. He has apologised several times for the relationship and, in 2020 stepped down as chief executive officer of the New York-based International Peace Institute think tank.
The files indicate that Juul and Roed-Larsen made plans to visit Epstein’s private island with their two children in 2011, though it was unclear if the visit took place.
In a message in 2017, Roed-Larsen called Epstein a “thoroughly good human being”, and in 2018, the couple received his help in negotiating the purchase of an apartment in Oslo that is now a subject of the police investigation.
In a will signed two days before his death by suicide in a jail cell in 2019, Epstein said he was leaving $5 million to each of the couple’s two children.
Norway’s crown princess, Mette-Marit, wife of the heir to the throne, apologised last week to the king and queen over a friendship with Epstein between 2011 and 2014, long after his 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a minor.</p><small>2026-02-10 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10212854cf22349.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972341/outcry-in-senate-after-nepra-notifies-new-regulations-scrapping-net-metering' target='_blank'><strong>Outcry in Senate after Nepra notifies new regulations scrapping net-metering</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: There was an outcry in the upper house of Parliament on Tuesday against changes by the power regulator in the contracts for solar consumers, with the government defending the move.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network. The notification effectively terminated the existing net-metering regime and replaced it with net-billing for all.
Speaking on a motion in the Senate on Tuesday, PTI Senator Syed Ali Zafar strongly criticised the government’s decision to withdraw net metering benefits for solar consumers, calling it a grave breach of trust and a cruel act against the people of Pakistan.
Senator Zafar stated that a promise, once made, must be honoured and when that promise came from the state, it became sacrosanct. He recalled that the government had assured citizens that if they invested in solar energy, they would be provided net metering on equitable terms.

 

This policy, he said, was presented not only as a personal financial benefit but as a national cause — reducing dependence on imported fuel, lowering energy costs, and moving Pakistan towards clean and sustainable energy.
He said the government made a solemn commitment to the people, urging them to invest for their own benefit and for the future of Pakistan, while assuring that issues with independent power producers (IPPs) would be addressed as citizens shifted to self-generation through solar power.
Acting on this assurance, people across the country invested heavily in solar panels, he said. He further stated that families diverted their life savings, sold assets, and even took loans, which they were still repaying, to install solar systems.
Senator Zafar said that solar energy was present in nearly every household, commercial building, and agricultural operation. Despite this, the government abruptly turned around and sought to cancel its commitment retrospectively, he regretted.
He termed retrospective withdrawal and retrospective imposition as a grave injustice. He also pointed out that under established law, the doctrine of promissory estoppel — a legal doctrine allowing enforcement of a promise lacking formal consideration to prevent injustice — applied.
Calling the decision “the most cruel act of the government”, Senator Zafar said it was akin to throwing a bomb into the already burdened lives of Pakistani citizens, who were struggling with soaring electricity bills and economic hardship.
He questioned how the government could expect foreign investment when it failed to honour commitments made to its own people.
Addressing the claim that the decision rested with Nepra, supposedly an independent authority, Senator Zafar categorically rejected this assertion.
He said that Nepra did not act independently but followed government directives. Any suggestion to the contrary, he said, would be misleading.
He challenged the government to prove its sincerity by making a clear commitment to ensure that the decision was withdrawn. He warned that the decision was disastrous, undermined public trust, damaged Pakistan’s investment climate, and punished those who acted in good faith for the betterment of the country.
In her remarks, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said that the decision by Nepra was beyond understanding. She said that the middle class was questioning why the government provided incentives for solar power in the first place, if this decision was to be taken.
“How can you do this to your country and citizens who are being affected the most by climate change?” she asked. She said that the problem lay with the distribution system, asking what message was being sent to investors by changing tariffs again and again.
“You have made electricity bills an instrument through which various taxes are being imposed,” she said. She said that instead of setting up artificial intelligence centres like other countries, Pakistan was increasing the power bills of consumers.
“Manufacturing companies and domestic consumers should be provided with cheap electricity,” she said, adding that major manufacturing industries were leaving Pakistan due to heavy taxes and expensive energy.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam — Fazl Senator Kamran Murtaza and PTI Senator Zeeshan Khanzada also spoke on similar lines.
However, Power Minister Awais Leghari defended the move, stating that Nepra was within its remit to do so and that it had been done to take the burden off consumers.
“Changing regulations according to the law and the Constitution is a regulator’s job,” he said, adding that he refused to step back from this.
“This is not policy; there should be clarity on that,” he maintained. “This is a change in regulations, which was conducted according to the Constitution and Pakistan’s laws,” he said.
The minister added that seminars were held involving solar associations, consumers and all other stakeholders, and that matters were settled with them last June.
“The Solar Association of Pakistan — whose bread and butter is installing and investing in these systems — conveyed to us that what the government was doing was not just necessary, but without it, public interests could not be saved,” the minister emphasised.
Leghari added that the solar association warned that up to 95 per cent of people would suffer “greater damages and increased burdens”.
“They said in June, don’t do this now, wait at least five or six months and carry out a proper transition,” he stated.
“Nepra, a regulator with the responsibility of maintaining its consumers’ interests, was formed to watch consumer interest and protect people from increases in electricity prices.”
The minister noted that PTI Senator Ali Zafar spoke about retrospective effects, but said that there were none in this regulation.
“I am proud to say that in this regulation, our regulator did not reverse one clause on these contracts, which used to last seven years,” Leghari said.
He added that Zafar mentioned that these contracts would last 20 years, before assailing the PTI government.
“Under that, Imran Niazi, electricity prices were touching the sky and we are trying to deal with it right now,” he added. The minister emphasised that there were no 20-year contracts.
“It was a seven-year contract and until it expires, nobody in this country has dared to insert new terms and conditions in the contract. Nepra has not done this either,” he stated.
He added that of the over 30 million consumers, 466,506 of them had net-metering.
“These 466,506 consumers have put 7,000 megawatts (mW) of electricity on net-metering,” the minister stated. “Other than these 466,000 consumers, there are 30.04m who live in flats or slums, where they cannot install solar systems, or they cannot afford them.
“If Nepra allowed electricity to be bought at these rates, then the 30.04m consumers — who are the true public — would have to shoulder a Rs200 billion burden left by net-metering consumers, which would increase to Rs550bn,” Leghari added.
The minister further said that nothing would happen to the existing contracts of the 466,000 consumers, but that these were regulations for future consumers.
“What we are saying is that we will buy electricity from you based on the average rate of the grid,” he explained. Leghari added that consumer regulations were evolving.
“These are policies formed by innovative thinking which evolve with time, and these aren’t even policies, they are just regulations,” he added. “This is not the first time regulations have been changed, or rates have been revised.”</p><small>2026-02-10 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/102124574ebe593.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972340/paf-successfully-completes-golden-eagle-training-exercise-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>PAF successfully completes ‘Golden Eagle’ training exercise: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) on Monday completed the ‘Golden Eagle’ training exercise, where artificial intelligence (AI) and the use of new indigenous technology were focused on, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
According to the statement, the exercise took place in “Southern Air Command’s area of responsibility”, to “validate combat readiness and operational agility through the synchronised employment of PAF’s complete combat potential”.
“The exercise was executed under unified command and control from the Next-Generation All-Domain Command and Control Centre, [at] Air Headquarters, Islamabad,” the statement said.
It added that the exercise was conducted on a two-force construct and particularly focused on AI-enabled and net-centric operations, while integrating indigenous niche, disruptive and smart technologies, in line with evolving regional security dynamics.
ISPR said that while operating within a robust integrated air defence system, participants seamlessly combined kinetic, cyber, space and electromagnetic spectrum operations.
“The kinetic phase featured first-shoot, first-kill swing-role combat aircraft equipped with long-range beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, extended-range stand-off weapons and precision strike capabilities, supported by airborne early warning and control platforms and air-to-air refuellers,” the statement said.
It added that the key highlight of the exercise was “manned-unmanned teaming”, where drones and loitering munitions were sent to operate in a highly contested, congested and degraded environment, to validate the PAF’s capability to conduct high-tempo operations.
“The successful conduct of exercise ‘Golden Eagle’ reaffirms PAF’s unwavering commitment to maintaining a high state of operational preparedness, leveraging indigenous innovation and effectively countering emerging and future security challenges,” the statement concluded.</p><small>2026-02-10 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1017532554e2e7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972284/special-committee-formed-to-monitor-development-work-review-any-security-operations-in-kp-districts' target='_blank'><strong>Special committee formed to monitor development work, review any security operations in KP districts</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Tuesday decided to establish a special sub-committee to monitor development work and “review any military operations” in certain districts.
The decision was taken at a high-level meeting at the Corps Headquarters in Peshawar to review the overall security situation in the province.
According to a handout, the meeting was attended by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, the national security adviser, and Peshawar corps commander, along with senior civil and military officials.
The press release said that at the outset of the meeting, the attendees paid tribute to the civilians and security personnel martyred in terrorist attacks.



The high-level meeting decided that Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches scheduled for this year would be held in Peshawar.
According to the statement, the meeting decided to implement a provincial governance model in Malakand Division under the supervision of the police and other provincial institutions.
It added that the model would then be implemented in “phases in the affected districts, particularly Khyber, Orakzai and Kurram”.
The press release said that to ensure the effective “monitoring of development projects and review of any security operations” in these districts, a special sub-committee would be formed under the leadership of CM Afridi. It was decided that the committee will hold monthly meetings.
The statement added that the special sub-committee would also include elected public representatives, the Peshawar corps commander, the KP chief secretary, the inspector general, provincial officials, and representatives from federal institutions.
The special sub-committee would also be responsible for “creating opportunities for alternative employment, ensuring a steady income for the locals” and arrangements to address the issues of temporarily displaced persons, the statement said.
During the meeting, it was decided that “effective communication between the Centre and the KP govt, complete coordination, and a united stance will be ensured on key policy matters to address issues such as terrorism”.
It was also decided to promote sustainable employment opportunities to prevent the youth from developing extremist ideas. The meeting also decided that strict action against illegal SIM cards, explosive material, and extortion will be taken, the meeting decided.
“Additionally, attention will be paid to the phased profiling of non-custom paid vehicles,” the statement said.
Last week, in an apex committee meeting, “consultation, cooperation and coordination” with the federal government and all political parties were termed “essential” for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy.
The panel discussed the “general rise in terrorism incidents in KP and an action plan to eradicate the menace of Fitna al Khawarij and establish complete peace and stability”.
According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
Security, economic decisions taken
In a video statement, CM’s aide for public relations Shafi Jan said a briefing on the security situation was provided during the meeting.
He added that certain decisions related to the province’s law and order and the economy were made.







Detailing the security-related decisions, KP Law Minister Aftab Alam said: “It was unanimously decided during the meeting that in Malakand Division, our Pak Army would hand over its responsibilities to law enforcement agencies, CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department) and the police.”
He termed it a “major decision and good news for the entire KP’s people, especially those in Malakand Division”.
Alam further said it was an “achievement” for the KP government, as well as the civilian and military leadership, that “peace was being restored in the province and efforts are being made for it”.
“This is also the restoration of trust in our police,” he highlighted.

 

Another decision made was that a meeting of “all political stakeholders would be summoned, where the civilian and military higher-ups and leadership would take them into confidence, and their recommendations would be implemented”, he said.
The minister also stated that the agreements reached upon in the last provincial apex committee would be “ensured before the federal Apex Committee’s meeting and would be endorsed” in the same.
Jan then emphasised that it was decided to hand over the local “services” to the civil administration as the law and order improved in certain districts.
Elaborating on the economic decisions, Adviser to KP CM on Finance Muzzammil Aslam said the meeting was conducted in an “extremely pleasant environment”.
He stated that the meeting was informed in detail about the financial issues faced by the KP government, as had been communicated by CM Afridi to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a January letter and a meeting last week.
Aslam lamented that had the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award been announced, it would have solved many issues of KP.

 

“We also told them that due to the reduced money coming from the Centre, the KP government was contributing from its funds for the merged districts, but it was insufficient,” the KP official said, adding that suggestions were made to improve the future situation.
According to Aslam, it was decided during the meeting that those recommendations will be presented before the federal government and aim to get KP “maximum relief”.
The adviser further said that “an assurance was given” on providing alternative arrangements to people whose livelihoods had been impacted as a result of any “operations” and the trade disruption with Afghanistan.
They also discussed “how the Centre and the province would together compensate people there financially</p><small>2026-02-10 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1019362821ce00a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972309/t20-world-cup-india-look-forward-to-pakistan-challenge' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: India look forward to Pakistan ‘challenge’</strong></a><br><p>India on Tuesday said it would be “a challenge” to face a “quality” Pakistan team in Colombo after Islamabad decided to play the blockbuster T20 World Cup clash.
“It’s great that the game is back on, we kind of never changed the preparation,” said India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate.
India will face a second Group A match against Namibia on Thursday in New Delhi before flying to Sri Lanka.
It means a quick turnaround for Sunday’s match, the biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket.
“It’s going to be a challenge going to Colombo where Pakistan have been for the last two weeks,” added Ten Doeschate.
“We are delighted to have another chance to play against a quality side in the first phase of the tournament.
“We are fully focused on just bringing our best game to that fixture.”
Sri Lanka, who will host the match that generates multi-millions of dollars in advertising, broadcast rights, sponsorship and tourism, also praised the decision.
Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, in a social media post, thanked Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.







Pakistan, who edged out Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, would have conceded two points if they had forfeited the match.
Pakistan will play all their T20 World Cup matches in Sri Lanka as part of an International Cricket Council deal that ensures the two nations only meet on neutral territory.
India captain Suryakumar Yadav said on Friday before their opening win against the USA that his team would travel to Colombo for the clash, whether the game was on or not.
“We haven’t said no to playing them,” Suryakumar said. “Our flights are booked and we are going to Colombo.”</p><small>2026-02-10 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/101104067fb512e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972247/pti-lawyer-salman-safdar-meets-imran-at-adiala-jail-says-party-founder-appeared-fine-healthwise' target='_blank'><strong>PTI lawyer Salman Safdar meets Imran at Adiala jail, says party founder appeared fine healthwise</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: PTI lawyer Salman Safdar on Tuesday met ex-premier Imran Khan at Adiala jail, saying that the party founder appeared fine healthwise.
The meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, came after the Supreme Court earlier in the day allowed Safdar to meet Imran.
Speaking to reporters outside the jail, Safdar said that Imran was fine and was looking healthy. However, he did not share further details about the meeting, saying that he had to submit a report to the court.
He said once the report was submitted to the court, he would be able to share the details.
SC allows lawyer to meet Imran
Earlier in the day, the SC had allowed Safdar to meet Imran, declaring him amicus curiae. The development came a day after a request for an ‘urgent’ meeting — submitted by senior PTI leader Latif Khosa — was rejected by a two-member bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan.
The bench observed that such an order could not be passed without hearing the other side. Hence, a notice was then issued to the government for Tuesday.
The two-member bench resumed the hearing, during which CJP Afridi appointed Safdar as “friend of the court”, with the court directing him to visit Adiala jail today and submit a written report regarding Imran’s living conditions by tomorrow.
PTI counsel Latif Khosa and Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan also appeared before the court.
At the outset of the hearing, CJP Afridi barred Khosa from speaking, while AGP Awan said that he had “submitted a written response to the chamber in light of the order of August 24, 2023”.
In 2023, SC had directed the AGP to submit a report on Imran’s “living conditions in jail”.
He informed the court that the PTI founder was in Attock jail at the time of the order.
“We had submitted a written report to the chamber on August 28, 2023,” the AGP said, adding that a medical report from August 5 to August 18 was also included.
In response to this, CJP Afridi said, “After the August 24, 2023 order, there has not been any order on record which was satisfactory to the SC”.
In the court order, available with Dawn, it was noted that the report submitted by the AGP pertained to the period when the former premier was imprisoned in the District jail, Attock, in 2023.
Hence, it maintained that the court “considered appropriate that a report regarding the present ‘living conditions of the petitioner in jail’ be submitted by the Superintendent, Central Prison, Rawalpindi.”
Subsequently, the court appointed Safdar as amicus curiae.
“Salman Safdar should go to Adiala as a friend of the court,” CJP Afridi said.
“We have full faith in Salman Safdar,” he further remarked.
“He should be given full access to the PTI founder so he may be able to file a written response,” he added.
Justice Afridi directed that Safdar should “not be kept waiting outside Adiala”, assuring him that in case he encounters any issues, the CJP’s personal staff will be available.
Safdar, addressing the court, asked “if the scope of the report was limited to living conditions only”, citing concerns regarding Imran’s health in light of a recent medical procedure.
“Submit a report of the living conditions only,” CJP Afridi responded.
AGP Awan also requested the court to “include in the order that a report had already been submitted”.
Towards the end of the hearing, Khosa took the rostrum again, seeking that his request to meet Imran be accepted as well. However, the request was again rejected.
The court then adjourned the hearing till February 12.
Raja terms conversation with court as ‘beneficial’
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja recalled his meeting with the chief justice last Friday, adding that Imran’s incarceration and health came under discussion.
He termed the conversation with the court as “beneficial” and stated that progress had been made as a result of it.
However, the PTI leader clarified, “We are not declaring anything as final. We are not saying everything is good [and] we have gotten everything. This is not the case.”
The PTI leader called for the “system to […] return to humanity”. “It is humanity and piousness that we are demanding right now,” he stated.







The former premier has been incarcerated since Aug 5, 2023, currently imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Central Jail.
According to a two-page memorandum filed by PTI last week to the SC registrar, the party had requested immediate jail visitation rights for Imran with his family, doctors, lawyers and friends.
In the memorandum, it was alleged that Imran’s rights as a prisoner and a human being have been consistently violated during this period.
The PTI memorandum also highlighted the reports about “Imran being subjected to some secretive medical procedure at a hospital in Islamabad and keeping his relatives in the dark in violation of jail rules”.</p><small>2026-02-10 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10190115da66ab9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972281/india-tightens-grip-on-social-media-with-new-3-hour-takedown-rule' target='_blank'><strong>India tightens grip on social media with new 3-hour takedown rule</strong></a><br><p>India’s government said on Tuesday social media companies would have to take down unlawful content within three hours of being notified about it, tightening an earlier 36-hour timeline in what could be a compliance challenge for Meta, YouTube and X.
The changes amend India’s 2021 IT rules, which have already been a flashpoint between Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and global technology companies.
The amended rules also relaxed an earlier proposal that would have required platforms to visibly label AI-generated content across 10 per cent of its surface area or duration, instead mandating that such content be “prominently labelled”.
The new regulations will take effect from February 20.
The tighter timeline marks the latest escalation in India’s efforts to control online speech, with a takedown regime that has drawn criticism from digital rights advocates and prompted clashes with companies including Elon Musks X.
Facebook-owner Meta declined to comment on the changes, while X and Alphabet’s Google, which operates YouTube, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The rules add to mounting global pressure on social media companies to police content more aggressively, with governments from Brussels to Brasilia demanding faster takedowns and greater accountability.
India’s IT rules empower the government to order the removal of content deemed illegal under various laws, including those related to national security, public order and sexual offenses.

The case was registered by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016, following allegations that the chief minister made false and defamatory claims against state institutions.
During the hearing on Tuesday, presided over by Senior Civil Judge Abbas Shah, the court noted that CM Afridi had once again failed to appear despite being summoned multiple times.
Subsequently, the judge ordered his immediate arrest and directed law enforcement authorities to ensure his production before the court. The hearing was then adjourned till February 21.
This is not the first time the court has taken action over Afridi’s non-appearance. Last month, the same court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant after observing that the KP chief minister had repeatedly ignored court summons and remained absent without lawful justification.
At that time, the court had termed his conduct a deliberate attempt to evade the legal process and emphasised that he had been given multiple opportunities to appear and respond to the allegations.
The first information report (FIR) against CM Afridi was registered on November 9, 2025, following remarks he made during a media interaction outside Adiala Jail on November 6.
During the interaction, Afridi alleged that security forces in KP had brought dogs inside mosques and tied them there, an accusation that sparked widespread outrage and condemnation for allegedly violating the sanctity of holy places.
Following an inquiry conducted on November 8, authorities concluded that Afridi and others had “knowingly and deliberately, with mala fide intentions and ulterior motives,” made false, misleading, derogatory and intimidating statements against state institutions.
These remarks were allegedly recorded, disseminated, and widely propagated through social media platforms, including a video uploaded on the PTI’s YouTube channel.
The FIR stated that the video contained “offensive, profane, false, misleading and unfounded allegations” made with the intent to malign and defame state institutions, as well as harm their reputation and integrity.
Investigators further alleged that the content formed part of an organised campaign to undermine public trust in state institutions, incite unrest, promote racial hatred, and destabilise national security.
Afridi has also been accused of preparing, publishing, sharing and circulating fake and misleading content on social media with the intention to incite violence, create panic, fear, disorder and unrest among the public, and promote anti-state sentiments deemed harmful to Pakistan’s security, integrity and stability.</p><small>2026-02-10 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10163605792c236.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972276/hats-off-to-you-maryam-assures-bugti-of-punjabs-full-support-for-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘Hats off to you’: Maryam assures Bugti of Punjab’s full support for Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Tuesday paid a visit to Quetta, where she met with her Balochistan counterpart CM Sarfraz Bugti and assured him of her full support.
CM Maryam’s visit comes in the wake of a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days. Security forces had responded by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in the province.
“As the chief minister of Punjab, as a Pakistani and as your sister, all services and resources of Punjab, whatever cooperation or support you need — whether in operations against khawarij here or any kind of challenges in the government — we are with you,” Maryam said.
She further assured Bugti, “Whatever kind of support you need, I am just a call away. I will be very glad if I can assist you or do something for the people of Balochistan.”







Noting that this was her first visit to another province after assuming the office of Punjab CM in February 2024, Maryam said she was glad it was to Quetta.
“You have rightly said that you do not have fitna, but you have Fitna al Khawarij, which is your own unique set of challenges that Balochistan is facing,” she further remarked, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“A lot of courage and firmness is needed for it, which you are demonstrating by governing Balochistan in such situations, so hats off to you, CM sahib,” Maryam said.
The Punjab chief minister said she visited the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in the morning, where the “commitment” she saw was very “promising and encouraged” her.
She prayed that may God help “Balochistan move forward and very soon eradicate the menace of terrorism” from the province.
“May Balochistan be a cradle of peace, safety and happiness,” she added.
According to her PML-N, CM Maryam held a meeting with Bugti and Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail. She also attended an event at the FC headquarters.







Punjab gives Rs10bn for Balochistan forces
Separately, CM Bugti also lauded Rs10 billion in “assistance for security forces” from the Punjab government.
A post on X by the CM Office quoted Bugti as welcoming Maryam to Quetta, adding: “The assistance of Rs10bn for security forces is a positive and commendable step.”
Bugti further affirmed, “The Balochistan government and the opposition is united for the people’s welfare.
According to the post, the Punjab chief minister also met with members of the provincial cabinet and leaders of allied parties.
Speaking to reporters after their meeting, CM Bugti lauded the Punjab chief minister’s visit to Quetta, saying her visit was “very respectful for us, especially during a time when we are confronting a situation”.
“And helping our security forces, which required Rs10 billion […] she gave the entire Rs10bn,” he said, lauding CM Maryam’s announcement and terming it a “great justice” to Balochistan.

The development came as a video clip of the suspect in chains went viral on social media, prompting Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran to take notice.
The suspect, identified as Mukhtar, was reportedly being kept at the police checkpost for the last four days.
Lahore Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mohammad Tauqir told Dawn that the suspect was found in chains, and the Lakhoki checkpost In-charge subinspector Adnan Virk was found guilty of keeping him in illegal custody.
The SSP said that, as per the initial police record, no first information report had been lodged against the suspect.
However, local residents claimed that the suspect was involved in criminal activities and they had complained to the police to arrest and investigate him.
Meanwhile, DIG Kamran said that the official was not authorised to detain the suspect at the checkpost even after the registration of a case.
“The suspect can only be sent to the lock-up of the police station concerned,” he added.
He appointed the Kahna Circle assistant subinspector as the inquiry officer to further investigate the incident.</p><small>2026-02-10 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/101719364373d40.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972277/only-purpose-was-to-get-respect-for-bangladesh-says-pcb-chief-naqvi-after-talks-with-icc' target='_blank'><strong>Only purpose was to get respect for Bangladesh, says PCB chief Naqvi after talks with ICC</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday said in the context of his recent engagements with Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and International Cricket Council (ICC) officials that the purpose was to “get respect for Bangladesh”.
Naqvi said this while speaking to the media in Peshawar, a day after the government announced it was withdrawing its decision to boycott the group-stage match against India in the T20 World Cup, scheduled for February 15.
The development followed protracted negotiations between the ICC, the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, consultations among national leaders and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.

 

The now-withdrawn decision to boycott the match against arch-rival India was announced by the government on February 1 after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
The matter was raised during Naqvi’s media talk in Peshawar on Tuesday, where he was asked about several conditions that were reportedly put forward during his meeting with the ICC and BCB officials on Sunday.
In his response, Naqvi said: “We did not discuss anything apart from Bangladesh; our only purpose was to get Bangladesh respect, to highlight the injustice done to them.
“And you saw that whatever demands Bangladesh made, they were accepted. That’s it.”
He added, “We had no personal interest in the meeting … our task was purely related to Bangladesh. The government made the decision on that [basis]. When their demands have been accepted, and it has been acknowledged that injustice was done to them, we are playing after that.”
The developments unfolded as the ongoing T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, began on February 7. It was, however, overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland.
Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the ICC rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka.
After mulling its stance, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.

 

In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.
It expressed the hope that the PCB would consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country. Subsequently, it was reported last week that the ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.
Sri Lanka’s cricket board had also asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.
Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again consult the government.

 

On Sunday, the BCB chief and ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja landed in Lahore and held a long meeting with Naqvi.
A day later, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake also urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India in a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India.
The government then announced the withdrawal of its earlier decision to boycott the match against India while an ICC statement said “that no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on Bangladesh Cricket Board”.
The statement also said that to compensate Dhaka, it was agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2031.</p><small>2026-02-10 12:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10171254e63fd63.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972275/net-metering-billing-who-pays-the-price-for-pakistans-new-solar-regime' target='_blank'><strong>Net metering billing: Who pays the price for Pakistan’s new solar regime?</strong></a><br><p>In a sudden move, the government recently terminated the existing net-metering regime for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers, known as prosumers, and replaced it with a net-billing regime for all.
The stated rationale behind this development — which could mean longer payback periods and lower overnight returns — is the need to address the technical, financial and equity concerns that have emerged from the mushrooming growth of solar power in Pakistan over the last couple of years. Under the changes, the buyback rate for electricity exported to the grid by solarised consumers has been reduced from the existing Rs26 per unit to Rs11 per unit. The new export rate broadly reflects the national average energy purchase price at which the government purchases electricity from power plants.
At first glance, this price reform appears overdue. Like most electricity tariff interventions, however, it is not merely a technical adjustment but carries significant long-term implications for consumers, electricity utility companies, and the power sector as a whole.
To understand these implications, we first need to have a look at Pakistan’s solarisation map. A study conducted by the Policy Research Institute for Equitable Development (PRIED) shows that solar deployment in the country has now surpassed 33 gigawatts (GW). While only a smaller portion of this deployment, around 6GW, is net-metered — that is, connected to the national grid — its much larger portion, around 27GW, is off-grid or behind the meter.

 

The net-metered deployment is mostly concentrated in urban communities, among higher-income households, and among commercial users. This rapid solar adoption has provided relief to hundreds of thousands of grid-connected consumers from high electricity tariffs, giving them greater energy independence and transforming them from ‘consumers’ to ‘prosumers’.
Besides that, as more people generate and consume electricity from solar power, it has greatly reduced daytime grid electricity sales, giving rise to the well-known “duck curve” in electricity demand and supply. This, in turn, results in underutilisation of the national grid.
Net billing vs net metering
Net-billing is being introduced as a key driver to tackle two concerns: (i) increase demand for grid-provider electricity (to address the duck curve phenomenon) and encourage self-consumption by grid-connected solarised consumers; (ii) reduce the cost-shifting impact of solarisation on non-solarised consumers.
This cost-shifting phenomenon occurs when a utility company — for example, a distribution company or Discos — is unable to recover its fixed costs from solarised consumers, so these costs are ultimately borne by non-solarised consumers. Traditionally, utilities recover much of these costs through the volumetric spread of electricity consumption based on total units (kWh) consumed. As an increasing number of consumers installs its own solar power to meet or supplement their electricity needs, these fixed costs must be spread over fewer units.
This will either raise the electric tariff or create a recovery gap.
The primary reason behind this regressive cost-shifting is our existing tariff regime, which does not distinguish between different tariff types in electricity bills. For example, it does not clearly separate the energy charges (marginal cost of producing electricity or the variable cost) and capacity charges (fixed charges including costs of maintaining the grid and transmission systems).
A large part of the latter cost is recovered through flat volumetric rates. These flat rates create a mismatch between how costs are incurred and recovered. When electricity consumers reduce their consumption due to solarisation, energy efficiency, or other changes, the money collected through volumetric charges falls short of covering the utility company’s costs. To recover this shortfall, utility companies raise prices for all their customers.

 

Under net-metering, a prosumer effectively shields themselves from these charges by exporting electricity from their solar installations at a price that matches the retail price the utility charges its consumers. Non-solarised customers, on the other hand, have to bear all the resulting increase in capacity as part of their electricity bill. As a result of the ongoing solarisation, more than 90 per cent of grid-connected electricity consumers are estimated to be facing a higher tariff burden.
With net billing, solarised consumers will not receive the retail rate for the electricity they export. The buyback rate for their exported electricity will, thus, come down to Rs9-Rs11 per kwh, helping Discos to recover more revenue from these prosumers.
Seen from this perspective, net-billing appears to be a fiscally rational act.
In practice, under a net-billing regime, solarised households will do two transactions with the utility company: one for the amount of electricity they will import from the grid, and second for the amount of electricity they will export to the grid — each at a different rate. This will improve cost recovery reflectivity, which is a core principle of efficient tariff design.
Secondly, net-billing will reduce cross-subsidisation of solarised consumers by non-solarised consumers. The former will pay the same electricity price as other consumers for the electricity they import, while receiving only a fraction of this price for the electricity exported by them. Thirdly, lower payments for the electricity exported by prosumers will provide short-term financial relief to Discos by helping stabilise their revenues. It will also spread the burden of fixed costs across all types of consumers equally.
Finally, net-billing can incentivise greater self-consumption and battery storage among solarised consumers, potentially aligning household behaviour with system needs by addressing the duck curve phenomenon — at least in theory.
Broad implications
These arguments, however, offer only a partial view. They ignore the fact that the real test of their validity lies in the implementation of the changes.
For instance, the regulations impose a flat rate on exported electricity regardless of the time it is exported. This creates two major inefficiencies. Firstly, even at a discounted buyback price of Rs11 per unit, households will continue exporting large volumes of electricity at noon — precisely when system demand will be at the lowest — because the solarised power output is highest at that time.
This, according to the evidence available from other countries, will do little to mitigate midday transmission and distribution congestion, reverse power flows, or local voltage instability. Flat export pricing offers no incentive to shift consumption from the evening peak hours, when the national grid faces its greatest stress (duck-curve), to off-peak hours. Studies on time-of-use (TOU) tariffs consistently find that consumer behaviour remains misaligned with system needs without time signals.
In addition to the flat export rates, restrictions on the system size introduce another layer of complexity. They revise the permissible sizing ratio of rooftop solar systems relative to the sanctioned load from 1:1.5 to 1:1. The intent is to limit surplus electricity exports to the grid. On paper, this will reduce operational stress and cost shifting. Yet this change also has broader implications.
The strict size cap reduces the surplus that households can export and does not adequately account for likely future electrification within homes: cooking, space heating, and electric vehicle charging, etc. By locking household system size to today’s sanctioned loads, the regulation may discourage long-term planning and constrain a household’s ability to electrify end uses that could otherwise reduce reliance on imported fuels.

 

Under net-billing regulations, lower export rates will lengthen payback periods for grid-connected solarised consumers, making solar power a less attractive option from an investment perspective. In comparison, systems designed primarily for self-consumption will offer shorter payback periods. This will create a real risk that consumers may choose to maximise self-consumption, using the grid only as a backup and, thus, effectively shifting to behind-the-meter mode. Such behaviour will further reduce the demand for grid-connected electricity and deepen the challenges of network underutilisation.
A poorly designed net-billing policy can also accelerate defections from the grid. If exporting electricity yields little value, particularly during high-demand evening hours, and fixed charges continue to rise, grid-connected solarised households may choose to install oversize solar-plus-storage systems and end their reliance on the grid altogether, further shrinking the consumer base for fixed-cost recovery. Beyond its impact on grid participation, net-billing also raises important questions about who can access and benefit from rooftop solar.
Rooftop solar adoption is already shaped by access to capital and, therefore, is being pursued more vigorously by high-income groups than by low-income ones. Lower returns on solar installations and their longer payback periods, especially when combined with taxation measures on solar panels and equipment, will certainly further disincentivise the low-income groups to move towards solar adoption, thus widening the inequity gap between them and those who have the capacity to finance new solar installations even after the regulations are enforced.
In other words, the policy will slow down solar diffusion and reinforce the current pattern in which distributed solar has become a technology primarily adopted by wealthier groups.
The real challenge
Net-billing is not inherently anti-solar; done well, it can correct an inefficient valuation of exports, reduce regressive cost shifting, and improve the financial sustainability of utilities.
But a poorly designed net-billing regime — especially one with flat export pricing and restrictive sizing caps — will push consumers into greater self-consumption, accelerate behind-the-meter behaviour, and even prompt grid defections. That outcome would deepen underutilisation and make fixed-cost recovery harder, not easier.
Pakistan’s real challenge is to modernise tariff design so the grid remains financially viable, technically stable, and economically attractive for all consumers — including prosumers. Net-billing can be part of that solution, but only alongside broader reforms that introduce time signals, transparently recover fixed costs and ensure equitable access so that distributed solar benefits all households, not just the wealthier ones.</p><small>2026-02-10 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10171110205c77f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972280/pm-shehbaz-hails-pak-kuwait-ties-as-raqami-islamic-digital-bank-issued-licence' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz hails Pak-Kuwait ties as Raqami Islamic Digital Bank issued licence</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said Pakistan and Kuwait share strong brotherly relations, which were set to further strengthen through bilateral economic, investment and trade cooperation.

What started as curiosity is turning into what experts describe as a form of AI addiction — not in the clinical sense yet, but as a pattern of reliance that can interfere with daily life.
This isn’t just about teenagers preferring technology over face-to-face interaction. It’s about the way AI is being used to fill emotional gaps.

Teens are spending hours chatting with AI programmes, not just for help with homework but for emotional support, encouragement, and social interaction. Some report talking to AI more than they talk to real friends.

The appeal is understandable. AI doesn’t judge, doesn’t interrupt, and is always available. For teens who feel misunderstood, lonely, or socially anxious, a chatbot can feel like a safe space. 
Providers of these technologies design them to be responsive, engaging, and empathetic, which only strengthens the habit. A conversation that begins with a homework question can easily turn into an emotional outlet.

But that convenience comes with a cost. A 2024 survey linked to trends in AI use shows that when children lean on technology instead of people, it can affect emotional development, school performance, and real-world relationships. 
Because chatbots can mimic empathy without actually experiencing it, they give teens a sense of connection that isn’t grounded in mutual understanding. That can make real relationships feel harder or less rewarding.
Experts point out that habitual overuse of any technology — in this case AI — starts to look like more than just a habit. Patterns include prioritising chatbot interaction over friendships, hiding usage from loved ones, and becoming distressed when access is restricted. These behaviours mirror what psychologists recognise as problematic tech use, similar to excessive gaming or social media addiction.
Parents can play a crucial role in recognising this early. Signs include sudden mood shifts when screen time is limited, declining interest in offline activities, and frequently using AI late at night.
Conversations about technology often focus on safety and screen time limits, but with AI, the discussion needs to include how and why teens are using it. 
Opening a dialogue without judgment helps teens reflect on their own habits. Rather than banning AI outright, what matters more is helping them find balance and understanding the difference between supportive use and dependency.

Setting clear limits and routines can help. Experts suggest designated tech-free hours, encouraging in-person interaction, and promoting hobbies unrelated to screens.
Some families choose to check in daily about how technology made a teen feel — not just how long they used it. That shift from quantity to quality of use aligns technological tools with healthy emotional development.

There’s no simple fix. AI is here to stay, and for many, it will be a useful resource. But when reliance on AI begins to replace real human connection or interferes with daily life, parents and caregivers need to pay attention.

Helping teens navigate this new terrain is as much about emotional guidance as it is about digital rules.
AI doesn’t have to be the problem. Without awareness and limits, it can become a substitute for the support and connection that only real human relationships can provide.

A day earlier, it emerged that the provincial government had decided to release nearly 300 PTI workers. Government sources told Dawn that the “documentary process” had already begun.
“So it may take some time, and by Tuesday evening, we may see the workers being released from prison,” said a source.
Following the withdrawal of MPO orders by the provincial government, the additional advocate general of Sindh appeared before the court and informed that the MPO notification had been withdrawn.
The notification was presented in court, following which the court disposed of over 100 petitions filed challenging the detention of PTI workers.
Earlier today, the SHC directed the Sindh government to withdraw the MPO orders, warning that “if the orders are not withdrawn, the court will issue orders against the authorities”.
The defence counsel, Barrister Ali Tahir, informed the court that “over 187 families were being affected by illegal detention orders”.
He alleged that the “police had illegally raided the homes of party workers”, and added that the orders went “against SHC’s decisions and principles”.
Subsequently, the provincial home department, in a notification dated February 10 and available with Dawn, withdrew the detention orders.
“The government of Sindh is pleased to withdraw all detention orders issued by the Home Department, Sindh, under section 3(1) of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO), 1960, during the period from Feb 1 to Feb 9, with immediate effect,” the notification read.
“Senior superintendents of central prison & correctional facilities, Karachi, and district prison & CF, Malir, Karachi, are hereby directed to release the persons detained under the MPO, 1960, forthwith, if they are not required in any other case,” the notification said.
As per a statement issued via PTI spokesperson, Barrister Tahir had expressed hope that the detention orders would be suspended today.
More than 400 workers detained, claims PTI Sindh
In a post on X, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh welcomed the decision, stating, “Finally, the fake government of Sindh had to withdraw its unconstitutional and illegal detainment of our innocent workers and peaceful citizens”.







According to a PTI press release, Sheikh, while speaking to the media earlier, alleged that “more than 400 party workers were unlawfully abducted between Feb 1 and Feb 9”.
The PTI leader said the arrests were made on the instructions of the Sindh government.
“First, they abducted the PTI workers, then formally arrested them and later sent them to jail under MPO,” he said.
Last week, the PTI accused provincial authorities of arresting dozens of activists during night-long raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh and detaining them under the controversial MPO Ordinance.
On Feb 1, the Sindh home department issued notifications under MPO to detain the PTI workers for 30 days on the ground that they “are instigating the public to block roads, highways, and organise sit-ins, which may disturb peace and tranquillity and can create serious law and order problems”.
The party challenged the alleged detentions in the SHC the very next day.
On Friday, the SHC directed provincial authorities to produce the cabinet’s decision for issuing detention orders against PTI workers under the MPO Ordinance.</p><small>2026-02-10 12:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/101508165308b6b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972268/workers-remittances-total-35bn-in-january-up-113pc-in-jul-jan-fy26' target='_blank'><strong>Workers’ remittances total $3.5bn in January, up 11.3pc in Jul–Jan FY26</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Tuesday said overseas workers’ remittances were recorded at $3.5bn in January, increasing by 11.3 per cent during Jul-Jan of the current fiscal year (FY26).
“Cumulatively, with an inflow of US$23.2 billion, workers’ remittances increased by 11.3 per cent during Jul-Jan FY26 compared to US$20.9 billion received during the same period last year,” said SBP.
“In terms of growth, remittances increased by 15.4pc on a year-to-year basis,” the central bank said.
It elaborated that the remittances in January were “mainly sourced” from Saudi Arabia ($739.6 million), the United Arab Emirates ($694.2m), the United Kingdom ($572.1m) and the United States of America ($294.7m).







Remittances in December rose to the highest level of FY26, reaching $3.6bn, largely driven by continued incentives for sending money through formal channels and relative stability in the exchange rate.
Currency experts believe remittance growth this year is weaker than in FY25. They cite concerns over a “managed” exchange rate, suggesting some inflows may be diverted away from official banking channels.
Pakistan is among the top countries receiving large foreign exchange inflows through remittances. While a growing number of jobseekers leaving the country is termed by some economists as brain drain, the government considers it beneficial for the external balance.
Last year’s record inflows of $38bn helped partially repay external debt, boost SBP reserves, stabilise the exch­ange rate and post a current account surplus after more than a decade.</p><small>2026-02-10 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10144652bd68186.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972267/president-zardari-welcomes-uzbek-presidents-invitation-to-visit-emphasises-strengthening-ties' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari welcomes Uzbek president’s invitation to visit, emphasises strengthening ties</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari welcomed Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s invitation to visit the country and emphasised strengthening ties between Islamabad and Tashkent, the president’s media wing said on Tuesday.
According to a press release by the President’s Secretariat, the president met with Uzbek Ambassador Alisher Tukhtaev, who called on him at Aiwan-e-Sadr and handed over a letter from the Uzbek president, who had visited Pakistan for two days last week.
In his letter, Mirziyoyev thanked President Zardari, the government and the people of Pakistan for the extraordinary hospitality and warm welcome extended to him during his visit. He also expressed gratitude for being conferred the Nishan-e-Pakistan, Pakistan’s highest civil award, as well as the honorary professorship and doctorate, according to the statement.
“President Mirziyoyev reiterated his invitation to President Zardari, earlier conveyed during their tête-à-tête,” it added, referring to the Uzbek president’s invitation to President Zardari to visit Uzbekistan “at a convenient time in order to further develop comprehensive cooperation”.
“President Zardari accepted the invitation and directed the concerned authorities from the Pakistani side to coordinate with their Uzbek counterparts to finalise the visit later this year.”
The president said that Pakistan attached great significance to its close brotherly relations with Uzbekistan, while underscoring the importance of effective follow-up on the outcomes of Mirziyoyev’s recent “historic and result-oriented” state visit to Pakistan, the statement said.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening cooperation with Uzbekistan in “key sectors including food and agriculture, mining, information technology, tourism, health and banking”.
The president also welcomed Uzbekistan’s interest in importing halal meat, fruits and potatoes from Pakistan as a positive step towards enhancing bilateral trade, it added.
“President Zardari also conveyed his gratitude to Mirziyoyev for his message of solidarity and support following the recent terrorist attack in Islamabad,” the statement said.
Zardari reaffirmed the shared resolve of Pakistan and Uzbekistan to “continue their joint journey of peace, stability and development”.
During Mirziyoyev’s two-day visit to Pakistan, the two sides signed a protocol for enhancing bilateral trade between the two countries to $2 billion within the next five years.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his delight that the Uzbek president and his delegation visited Islamabad, his “second home”, for the second time in four years. Meanwhile, Mirziyoyev declared that Pakistan was Uzbekistan’s “time-tested, reliable partner and closest friend” in South Asia.</p><small>2026-02-10 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10143136bb9c197.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972266/iran-warns-of-destructive-influence-on-diplomacy-ahead-of-netanyahus-us-trip' target='_blank'><strong>Iran warns of ‘destructive’ influence on diplomacy ahead of Netanyahu’s US trip</strong></a><br><p>Iran on Tuesday warned of “destructive” influence on diplomacy ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington for talks expected to focus on US negotiations with Tehran.
“Our negotiating party is America. It is up to America to decide to act independently of the pressures and destructive influences that are detrimental to the region,” said Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei in a weekly press briefing.
“The Zionist regime has repeatedly, as a saboteur, shown that it opposes any diplomatic process in our region that leads to peace.”
Tehran and Washington resumed talks in Muscat on Friday, months after earlier negotiations collapsed following Israel’s unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June, which triggered a 12-day war.
During the conflict, Israel targeted senior Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists and nuclear sites, as well as residential areas.
The United States later joined the campaign, launching its own strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities.
Iran responded with drone and missile attacks on Israel and by targeting the largest US military base in the Middle East, located in Qatar.
“The June experience was a very bad experience. Therefore, taking these experiences into account, we are determined to secure Iran’s national interests through diplomacy,” Baqaei said.
He insisted that Iran’s focus would remain strictly on the nuclear file in return for sanctions relief.
Tehran has repeatedly said it rejects any negotiations that extend beyond that issue.
On Saturday, Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that the Israeli premier “believes any negotiations must include limitations on ballistic missiles and a halting of the support for the Iranian axis”.
The talks followed threats from Washington and the deployment of a US aircraft carrier group to the region after Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last month.
Iranian authorities said the protests, which erupted in late December over the rising cost of living, began as peaceful demonstrations before turning into “riots” involving killings and vandalism, which they said were inflamed by the United States and Israel.</p><small>2026-02-10 10:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10143304e28c977.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972257/dar-indonesian-minister-reaffirm-trade-investment-as-key-pillars-of-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Dar, Indonesian minister reaffirm trade, investment as key pillars of bilateral cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Indonesia’s investment minister Rosan Roeslani on Tuesday reaffirmed trade and investment as key pillars of bilateral cooperation.
Roeslani, who is also the chief executive officer of Indonesia’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Danantara), arrived in Islamabad on Monday evening, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
On Tuesday, Dar and Roeslani met at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where their discussions focused on strengthening Pakistan-Indonesia economic and investment ties, the FO said in a post on X.
Both leaders also reviewed “potential collaboration opportunities and mutually beneficial projects, including exchange of views on sovereign wealth fund models, and reaffirmed trade and investment as a key pillar of bilateral cooperation”.







The two sides also held delegation-level talks, wherein they reviewed potential cooperation avenues and projects, including the “exchange of best practices and cooperation in priority sectors such as health”.
Presentations were provided by the finance ministry, Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and Board of Investment (BoI), the FO noted.
The presentations outlined Pakistan’s “investment landscape, priority sectors and facilitation mechanisms, while also seeking Indonesia’s experience and expertise, including in sovereign wealth fund structures and downstream investment”.
Dar reaffirmed the “shared commitment to longstanding bilateral relations based on mutual respect and cooperation, with mutual investment being a catalyst of Pakistan-Indonesia partnership”, the statement added.
The meeting was attended by SIFC National Coordinator Lt Gen Sarfraz Ahmed, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, the BoI chairman, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal, the acting foreign secretary, and other senior officials.







Upon his arrival in the capital on Monday evening, Roeslani was welcomed by the foreign ministry’s East Asia Pacific region director general and the Indonesian ambassador.
“During the visit, he will have comprehensive talks with the DPM/FM on the prospects of enhancing Pakistan-Indonesia partnership in the domain of trade and investment,” the FO had said.







Recent months have seen robust exchanges between Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur, with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto also making a two-day official visit to Pakistan in December 2025.
He had held meetings with President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif, wherein the two sides agreed to enhance bilateral trade and cooperation in various sectors.
Indonesian Vice Minister of Trade Dyah Roro Esty Widya Put­­ri also visited Pakistan in January.

 

She and Commerce Minis­ter Jam Kamal Khan had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to establish an Indonesia-Pakistan Joint Trade Committee (JTC) to strengthen dialogue, facilitate cooperation and address opportunities and challenges in bilateral trade.
The same month, Indonesian Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin had also made a visit to Pakistan, where he met with the army chief and the air chief.
He had expressed Kuala Lumpur’s desire to further expand defence ties with Islamabad across multiple domains, the military’s media affairs wing had said.</p><small>2026-02-10 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10133215f63348e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972255/pafs-participation-in-saudi-defence-expo-reinforces-pakistans-position-as-emerging-hub-of-aerospace-innovation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>PAF’s participation in Saudi defence expo reinforces Pakistan’s position as ‘emerging hub of aerospace innovation’: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Air Force’s participation in the ongoing World Defence Show 2026 (WDS-26) in Saudi Arabia highlights the country’s role as an emerging hub for aerospace innovation, operational competence, and reliable defence solutions, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.
“[The] World Defence Show 2026 serves as a premier global platform for defence and security,” the press release said. “PAF’s participation at WDS-2026 reinforces Pakistan’s position as an emerging hub of aerospace innovation, operational competence and reliable defence solutions.”

 


The ISPR added that the participation in the show underscored PAF’s commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s “rapidly advancing indigenous aerospace capabilities and its proven operational excellence”.
The military’s media wing added that the force will feature its “cutting-edge JF-17 Thunder Block-III multi-role fighter jet and the highly acclaimed Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft”.
“The JF-17 Block-III, representing the pinnacle of Pakistan’s combat aviation technology, features state-of-the-art avionics, an advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, enhanced electronic warfare suite and beyond-visual-range combat capabilities, making it a formidable 4.5 generation fighter jet addressing the operational needs of modern air forces,” it said.

 

“Alongside it, the Super Mushshak trainer aircraft highlights Pakistan’s strength in pilot training solutions.
“Renowned for its reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance, the Super Mushshak has been successfully inducted by several friendly countries and continues to serve as a benchmark platform for basic flying training worldwide.”
According to the ISPR statement, PAF’s presence at WDS-2026 reflects its leadership’s vision of fostering defence cooperation, promoting defence exports and strengthening strategic partnerships with friendly nations.
The statement added that participation provides an opportunity for international delegations, defence officials and military industry leaders to engage with PAF representatives and “explore avenues for collaboration, training and technology transfer”.
Earlier in January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed that several countries were in active talks with Islamabad to procure the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which became a centre of attention following the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.
Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in buying the fighter jets, while Azerbaijan inducted this aircraft into its air force in 2024. Azerbaijan had become the third country to acquire JF-17 fighters after Myanmar and Nigeria.</p><small>2026-02-10 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/101240240ad867c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972253/coas-munir-lauds-character-courage-competence-shown-by-soldiers-in-ongoing-fight-against-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir lauds ‘character, courage, competence’ shown by soldiers in ongoing fight against terrorism</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir lauded the “character, courage, and competence” demonstrated by soldiers in the ongoing fight against terrorism, the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.
According to an ISPR statement, the CDF made these remarks while addressing the closing ceremony of the 9th International Pakistan Army Team Spirit (PATS) Competition as the chief guest on Monday.
Reaffirming the core values of the army, the CDF “underscored the enduring soldierly attributes of ‘character, courage and competence’, which have been consistently demonstrated by Pakistani soldiers, particularly in the ongoing fight against terrorism”, the military’s media wing said.







Field Marshal Munir also “commended all participating teams for their exceptional professionalism, physical and mental endurance, operational competence and high morale displayed during the exercise”.
“He emphasised the importance of such multinational engagements in enhancing collective preparedness and adapting to the evolving character of modern warfare,” the press release added.
ISPR described PATS Competition as a 60-hour-long patrolling exercise, designed to “enhance professional military skills through the exchange of innovative ideas, tactical experiences and best practices among participating teams”.
The exercise, held from February 5 to 9, was carried out in the semi-mountainous terrain of Punjab, “providing a realistic and challenging operational environment”.
“Over the years, PATS has evolved into a prestigious and highly competitive military exercise, recognised for promoting professional excellence and mutual learning among participating nations,” the statement noted.
It affirmed that the forum “continues to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and understanding, while fostering camaraderie and team spirit in a demanding operational setting”.
This year’s PATS Competition featured 19 countries — including Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Malaysia, Maldives, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkiye, the United States of America, and Uzbekistan — while Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand attended the exercise as observers.
Meanwhile, 16 domestic teams from the army and the navy, along with observers from the air force, also participated in the event, ISPR stated.
The CDF also presented awards to the outstanding participants of the competition.
“International observers and defence attachés from participating countries also attended the event and expressed appreciation for high standard of professionalism, organisation, and conduct demonstrated throughout the exercise,” the press release read.
Separately, the CDF also witnessed miscellaneous training activities at the National Counter Terrorism Centre in Pabbi, including a visit to the newly established Tactical Simulator.
He lauded the efforts of troops and the technical team and emphasised the importance of simulator-based training to complement traditional training methods, ISPR said.</p><small>2026-02-10 08:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10124939ce0509e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972250/pakistans-ranking-in-global-corruption-perceptions-index-edges-up-score-rises-to-28' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s ranking in global corruption perceptions index edges up; score rises to 28</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2025 improved by one point, moving from 135 out of 180 countries in 2024 to 136 out of 182 countries in 2025.
At the same time, the country’s CPI score increased by one point, from 27 in 2024 to 28 in 2025, according to Transparency International’s report published on Tuesday.
While Pakistan is undertaking commendable efforts in governance and institutional reforms, it is imperative that the recommendations of the IMF Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment are implemented effectively. This is essential to sustain Pakistan’s upward momentum in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) in the coming years, said the Chair of Transparency International Pakistan, Justice Zia Perwez.
The Berlin-based Transparency International (TI) notes that corruption is worsening globally, with even established democracies experiencing rising corruption amid a decline in leadership.
The 2025 index shows that the number of countries scoring above 80 has shrunk from 12 a decade ago to just five this year.

 

The score has changed since 2012: 31 countries improved, 50 countries declined, while 100 countries stayed the same.
This year’s CPI ranks 182 countries and territories according to the levels of public-sector corruption perceived by experts and business people.
Chair of Transparency International, Francois Velerian, said: “Corruption is not inevitable. Our research and experience as a global movement fighting corruption show there is a clear blueprint for how to hold power to account for the common good, from democratic processes and independent oversight to a free and open civil society.”
“At a time when we’re seeing a dangerous disregard for international norms from some states, we’re calling on governments and leaders to act with integrity and live up to their responsibilities to provide a better future for people around the world.”
The highest-ranked nation was Denmark, for the eighth time in a row, with a score of 89. Only a small group of 15 countries, mainly in Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific, managed to get scores above 75. Of these, just five reached scores above 80.
Meanwhile, over two-thirds of countries (68 per cent) fell below 50, indicating serious corruption problems in most parts of the planet.
At the bottom of the index, the countries scoring below 25 are mostly conflict-affected and highly repressive countries, such as Venezuela, and the lowest scorers, Somalia and South Sudan, which both scored nine.
Data show that democracies, typically stronger on anti-corruption than autocracies or flawed democracies, are experiencing a worrying decline in performance. This trend spans countries such as the United States (64), Canada (75) and New Zealand (81), to various parts of Europe, such as the United Kingdom (70), France (66) and Sweden (80).
Another concerning pattern is increasing restrictions by many states on freedoms of expression, association and assembly. Since 2012, 36 of the 50 countries with significant declines in CPI scores have also experienced a reduction in civic space, TI says.
The CPI shows the stark contrast in controlling corruption between nations with strong, independent institutions, free and fair elections, and open civic space, and those ruled by repressive authoritarian regimes.
Full democracies have a CPI average of 71, while flawed democracies average 47 and authoritarian regimes just 32. Although a very small number of non-democratic countries score relatively well compared to their regional peers, and are perceived as managing a limited range of corruption types successfully, they remain exceptions.
Similarly, countries where civic space is guaranteed and protected tend to control corruption better. Those where the freedoms of expression, assembly and association are duly safeguarded are generally more resilient against corruption and score better on the CPI.
However, countries where these freedoms are lacking are more likely to lose control of corruption: 36 of the 50 countries where the CPI scores have significantly declined have also seen a reduction in civic space.
TI is calling on governments and leaders across the world to take action to strengthen justice systems, ensure independent oversight of decision-making and public spending, guarantee transparency about how political parties and election campaigns are funded, and protect civic space, democracy and media freedom.
This year, governments that fail to address their citizens’ concerns may find themselves toppled by popular protest movements. By choosing to act for the public interest, not private gain, governments and leaders can live up to their responsibilities to shape and nurture safe, fair and healthy societies where everyone can thrive, TI says.
TI CEO Maira Martini commented that at a time of climate crisis, instability and polarisation, “the world needs accountable leaders and independent institutions to protect the public interest more than ever – yet, too often, they are falling short.”
Some powerful nations have an indirect impact on corruption levels that extends well beyond their borders.
The Russian state has been accused of interfering in other countries’ elections by spreading disinformation and buying votes with the intention of influencing voters and driving instability, democratic backsliding and the narrowing of civic space.
The US government’s decision to temporarily freeze and then degrade enforcement of its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act – a key anti-corruption law that prohibits corporate bribery of foreign officials – sends a dangerous signal that bribery and other corrupt practices are acceptable.
At the same time, US aid cuts to funding for overseas civil society groups that scrutinise their governments have undermined anti-corruption efforts around the world. Political leaders in various countries have also taken this as a cue to further target and restrict independent voices, such as NGOs and journalists.
The report recommended that, in order to function properly, deter potential offenders and protect people who speak out against corruption, countries’ justice systems must be shielded from interference by political or economic interests.
This includes protecting appointments and promotions from external pressure. These systems also need to be properly resourced, prosecutorial decisions must be reasoned and reviewable, and courts should publish decisions and data.
Fundamental freedoms – including a free press and the right to information – enable the active engagement of individuals and groups to promote transparency and integrity in government and business activities. Decision-makers must fully protect civil society groups and people reporting corruption, such as whistle-blowers.
They should also create a regulatory framework that enables, rather than restricts, the work of civil society organisations – including giving them access to both domestic and international funding. This will strengthen the fight against corruption by allowing civic actors to expose abuse, assist victims, foster public participation and build accountability.
When journalists are attacked or killed for investigating corruption, power cannot be held to account effectively and corruption tends to worsen.
Since 2012, in non-conflict zones worldwide, 829 journalists have been murdered. 150 were killed while covering corruption-related stories, five of them in 2025. Over 90 per cent of these killings happened in countries with a CPI score lower than 50, including Brazil, India, Mexico, Pakistan and Iraq, which are particularly dangerous for journalists reporting on corruption.

 

Citizens deserve to know who funds political parties and candidates, or who influences decisions. It is important that political finance, conflicts of interest and lobbying are regulated, documented and subject to public scrutiny to ensure that democracy is protected against potential corruption.
Transparency and limits on political donations stop rich and well-connected industry groups from being able to unfairly influence policies, budgets and public institutions to suit their own goals, rather than the public interest.
The report recommended that robust checks and balances at home, together with strong national and international prevention and detection measures, are essential to block and uncover large-scale, high-level corruption and major cross-border money laundering.To deter and punish these serious crimes, more effective enforcement systems are essential.
Overcoming pervasive and deep-rooted state corruption will require strong national coalitions to rebuild democracy and the rule of law. International enforcement in states with effective justice systems can also play a vital role by prosecuting wrongdoers and seizing stolen assets hidden abroad, to cut off their ability to operate.</p><small>2026-02-10 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10110103a69b878.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972248/epstein-accomplice-maxwell-seeks-clemency-from-trump-before-testimony' target='_blank'><strong>Epstein accomplice Maxwell seeks clemency from Trump before testimony</strong></a><br><p>Convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell refused Monday to answer questions from US lawmakers but her attorney said she was prepared to speak if granted clemency by US President Donald Trump.
Maxwell, 64, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, was subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee to discuss her relations with Epstein.
Rather than answer the committee’s questions, however, the former British socialite invoked her Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate herself.
A recording of the deposition released by the committee showed Maxwell speaking via video link, her eyes cast down at the table she was seated in a Texas prison.
She was asked about her and Epstein’s co-conspirators, whether they surrounded themselves with the rich and famous in order to “curry favor” and avoid scrutiny, and whether Trump ever engaged “in sexual activity with an individual introduced to him by you or Jeffrey Epstein.” Wearing a drab, beige uniform, Maxwell repeated the phrase “I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to silence” until the committee gave up and called off their questioning early.

 


Maxwell’s attorney, David Markus, said she would be prepared to speak publicly if granted clemency by Trump.
“If this Committee and the American public truly want to hear the unfiltered truth about what happened, there is a straightforward path,” Markus said in a statement.
Markus also said that Trump and former president Bill Clinton — both of whom were once friendly with Epstein — are “innocent of any wrongdoing.”
“Ms Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation,” he said.
Maxwell is the only person convicted of a crime in connection with Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.
She was convicted in 2021 of supplying underage girls to Epstein, who had ties to powerful business executives, politicians, celebrities and academics.

 

Her deposition comes amid the recent release by the Justice Department of millions of documents related to the government’s investigation into Epstein, many of which have been heavily redacted.
The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) passed by Congress in November compelled the Justice Department to release all of the records in its possession related to Epstein.
It required the redaction of the names or personal identifying information about Epstein’s victims, who numbered more than 1,000 according to the FBI.
But the EFTA said no records could be “withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.”
Congressional access to unredacted files
Members of Congress were given access to unredacted versions of the files Monday, though only under strict, in-person visits at secure Justice Department viewing locations.
“I saw the names of lots of people who were redacted for mysterious or baffling or inscrutable reasons,” Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, told reporters, including “people who were enablers and cooperators.” The Justice Department has said no new prosecutions are expected.
Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican, said he discovered the names of six men whose identities have been redacted from the publicly released documents and who “are likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files.”
Massie declined to provide their identities but said one “is pretty high up in a foreign government.” He also posted on X a sordid 2009 email exchange between Epstein and a redacted sender discussing a “torture video.”







Massie said the email exchange appeared to be with “a Sultan” and that the Department of Justice should make his identity public.
Later, on CNN, Massie said prominent businessman Les Wexner was listed as a “co-conspirator” in a 2019 child sex trafficking case, in a file that had been improperly redacted. Wexner is the billionaire behind women’s retailers and lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret.
The House Oversight Committee has also summoned Clinton and his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, to testify about their interactions with Epstein.
The Clintons have called for their depositions to be held publicly to prevent Republicans from politicizing their testimony.
Trump was once a close friend of Epstein but has not been called to testify by the Republican-controlled committee.</p><small>2026-02-10 06:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/100939035f024a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972243/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-trumps-board-of-peace-meeting-in-washington-on-feb-19' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to attend Trump’s Board of Peace meeting in Washington on Feb 19</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to visit Washington on February 18 and represent Pakistan at the first leaders’ meeting of President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace.
The meeting is scheduled for Feb 19 at the US Institute of Peace.
The inaugural meeting will focus on Gaza’s post-war reconstruction. The official invitation underlines the expected presence of “heads of state, heads of government, and international figures”.
The summit is also expected to formalise the board’s mandate and structure.
Eight Muslim-majority countries are expected to participate in the meeting. They include Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar, and the UAE. Muslim participants are expected to adopt a unified position on Gaza-related issues.
These include halting Israeli ceasefire violations and securing durable peace guarantees. Such guarantees are seen as essential for reconstruction efforts to proceed. The meeting may also address mechanisms to support long-term stability.
All 22 invitees have already joined the Board of Peace. Pakistan joined the board in late January, and it signed the founding charter during the World Economic Forum in Davos.
The charter was signed on January 22 alongside representatives from two dozen countries.
Pakistan’s participation reflects its diplomatic engagement on Gaza as Islamabad continues to support Palestinian rights and international law. Officials stress that this position remains unchanged.
The Feb 19 meeting is described as organisational and financial in nature and is also expected to function as a fundraising conference. Discussions will define the board’s structure, mandate, and secretariat.
Operational direction is also expected to be clarified. Diplomatic sources said troop contributions may be discussed and any decision would follow completion of the board’s framework.
President Trump launched the Board of Peace late last month. It is part of his broader Gaza peace and transition plan. Trump will chair the meeting in Washington. He has framed the initiative as a vehicle for reconstruction and cooperation.
Analysts have welcomed the stated objectives of the board, while others have raised concerns about its wider implications. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is due to meet President Trump on February 18, is expected to attend the talks; however, his participation has not yet been officially confirmed.
The moot will focus on the implementation of the ceasefire and Gaza’s future governance.
The Board of Peace was first proposed in September 2025. It formed part of a 20-point Gaza peace plan. The plan followed a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier that year.
The board’s establishment was endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution.
Resolution 2803, adopted in November, authorised international cooperation for Gaza’s reconstruction. The board’s charter includes humanitarian and reconstruction responsibilities. It also allows for broader conflict resolution roles.
This expansive mandate has drawn mixed global reactions. Several Western allies have expressed reservations. Concerns focus on structure, financing, and long-term authority.
Some countries have chosen not to participate. Islamabad has adopted a cautious approach to engagement. Officials stress Pakistan’s participation is not unconditional.
Pakistan aims to advocate Palestinian self-determination.
Diplomats say Islamabad seeks alignment with UN resolutions, and international law remains central to its position.
Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi earlier outlined Pakistan’s stance, stressing a lasting ceasefire, humanitarian access, and reconstruction.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán confirmed his attendance, along with Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto, who has also indicated that he will attend. So have half a dozen other Muslim states.
Some countries, including India, are expected to skip the meeting.</p><small>2026-02-10 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/100733105099595.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972203/nepra-pulls-the-plug-on-net-metering' target='_blank'><strong>Nepra pulls the plug on net-metering</strong></a><br><p>• Notifies new regulations, shifts all prosumers to net-billing• New contracts will be limited to five years; existing seven-year terms will remain valid until expiry• Buyback rate for future prosumers cut to Rs10-11 per unit from Rs26• Imported electricity from Discos to be billed separately at Rs37-55 per unit
ISLAMABAD: In a rapid move, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network.
The contractual changes were introduced through a predetermined set of regulations that had been published as draft for public opinion but were notified without any change after a public hearing. The notification effectively terminates the existing net-metering regime and replaces it with net-billing for all.
As a result, earlier public pronouncements by officials and ministers that the terms of contracts with existing prosumers would remain unchanged until completion of their seven-year terms have proven incorrect. Under the new regulations, the existing registered prosumers will be shifted immediately to net-billing instead of net-metering, and their export units will be credited for one month only instead of the current three months. All other existing terms will remain unchanged until expiry of their seven-year contracts.
New prosumers will be granted only five-year contracts, and their export units will be accepted at Rs11 per unit compared to Rs26 under the existing contracts. Consumers’ import units from distribution companies (Discos) will now be billed separately at Rs37-55 per unit, depending on the relevant slab, excluding taxes, surcharges and duties.
Surplus generation exported to Discos will be calculated separately — at Rs26 per unit for existing and around Rs10 per unit for future prosumers. The net difference will be billed to consumers, unlike the existing system of unit-for-unit exchange in import and export.

 

Nepra held a marathon public hearing on Friday evening but restricted dozens of relevant consumers, independent think tanks and business representatives from suggesting alternative solutions. By the afternoon of the first working day, the regulator notified the same draft without changing a single clause, indicating a predetermined conclusion.
Earlier, the Power Division had proposed similar changes multiple times but withdrew after public criticism over unilateral changes to consumer-financed contracts under a properly announced renewable policy in 2015.
Both the government side and the regulator have blamed prosumers with higher-than-approved solar capacity and non-metered solar homeowners for grid challenges and higher capacity charges. However, the new regulations appear silent on both counts.
The Power Division claimed on-grid (metered) solar capacity had reached 7,000MW and off-grid exceeded 13,000MW. The power minister said millions of consumers had installed hybrid systems without meters to remain in subsidised categories, pushing capacity beyond 19,000MW outside metering. The new rules target only metered solar consumers.
Under the regulations, at the end of each billing cycle following the interconnection of a distributed generation facility, Discos will raise bills after accounting for electricity generated and consumed by the prosumer “under a net-billing arrangement”. Units supplied by Discos to prosumers will be billed at the applicable tariff (Rs37-55 per unit excluding taxes), while units supplied by prosumers to Discos will be billed at the National Average Energy Purchase Price (NAEPP) of around Rs10 per unit.
Net-billing means electricity generated by a prosumer’s distributed facility is purchased by Disco, and a bill is raised on consumption at Rs37-55 per unit after credit for electricity supplied by the prosumer at NAEPP. “In case the billed amount of the units supplied by prosumers exceeds the billed amount of units supplied by Disco, the net billed amount shall be credited against the prosumer’s next billing cycle or shall be paid by the licensee to the prosumer quarterly,” Nepra stated. Discos, however, have not made such payments in the past.
Under the new regulations, prosumers will not be allowed to install solar systems for net-metering beyond their original sanctioned load, effectively reducing the capacity limit by 50 per cent.
Existing prosumers’ contracts will remain valid until expiry of their current seven-year term, after which they may request a five-year extension, subject to Discos’ willingness. The new regulations apply to systems ranging from one kilowatt to one megawatt (1kW to 1MW) under Nepra’s direct regulatory and licensing domain.
At present, consumers below 25kW are licensed directly by Discos.
The solar regulation changes have been notified despite Nepra itself repeatedly blaming power companies for unaffordable and inefficient supplies.
“Compounded by heavy taxes, levies and surcharges, particularly the Debt Servicing Surcharge, these factors collectively inflate electricity costs for consumers. The result is a shifting of consumers towards decentralised or off-grid solutions, further weakening demand for grid-based electricity,” Nepra said recently.
The regulator stated that the new prosumer regulations provide clearer procedures, stricter technical requirements and a shift in billing methodology, aiming to better integrate small-scale generation into the national grid while safeguarding system stability.
Another restriction is a capacity cap at the transformer level. Discos are barred from entertaining new applications if the cumulative distributed generation capacity connected to a particular distribution transformer reaches 80pc of its rated capacity, to avoid overloading and technical instability in local distribution networks.

He is a voter in the Gopalganj-3 constituency, from where former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was elected for eight consecutive terms. Chandra has long supported Hasina’s Awami League.
But this time, the situation is different. Following the mass student-led uprising on August 5, 2024, Sheikh Hasina fled to India. On May 10, 2025, the interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, banned the political activities of the Awami League and all its affiliates, under the Anti-Terrorism Act. 
The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh, a domestic judicial body founded by Hasina in 2010, is currently prosecuting Awami League leaders for “genocide” and “crimes against humanity”, related to the 2024 movement. Ironically, the same tribunal sentenced Hasina to death for ordering a crackdown on the 2024 protesters. 
Previously, the tribunal had awarded death sentences to several Jamaat-i-Islami leaders for ‘war crimes’ during the 1971 war and supporting Pakistan, resulting in the execution of Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mujahid in 2015 and Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami in 2016.

Once banned and vilified in Bangladesh, the Jamaat-i-Islami is now polling neck-and-neck with the country’s mainstream opposition. As the country prepares for its first election since the 2024 uprising, voters disillusioned with corruption are turning to an unexpected alternative…

The current government has stated that the Awami League will not be able to resume political activities until the trial is completed. As a result, the Awami League will not participate in the upcoming February 12 elections, the first national polls since the mass uprising. Despite being banned, the Awami League is campaigning against the polls on social media.
When asked if he would be voting this time, Chandra tells Eos, “Why wouldn’t I vote? I will vote and, this time, I will vote for the Jamaat. Everyone has had a chance. This time, Jamaat should be given a chance,” he continues. “Besides, none of them [Jamaat leaders] engage in corruption and extortion,” he claims. 
Like Chandra, many other voters are now also leaning towards the Jamaat-i-Islami, reflecting a broader electoral transformation sweeping Bangladesh.
A SURGING POLITICAL FORCE
A December survey by the US-based International Republican Institute (IRI) showed 30 percent of voters backing the party of the late former PM Khaleda Zia, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP); 26 percent supporting the Jamaat-i-Islami; and six percent supporting the National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by student activists involved in the August 2024 popular uprising. 
Another mid-January joint poll by Projection BD, IILD, Jagoron Foundation and NarratiV indicates a tighter race, with BNP at 34.7 percent, Jamaat close behind at 33.6 percent and NCP at 7.1 percent. It’s a remarkable turnaround for both the leading parties, whose leaders had been incarcerated and executed and particularly for the Jamaat, which was banned under the Sheikh Hasina regime.
Analysts say the Jamaat is competing closely with the BNP due to growing public dissatisfaction with corruption and extortion at the grassroots level, following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Jamaat has sought to capitalise on this sentiment by presenting itself as a disciplined alternative. Its initiatives, including digital tools to track extortion complaints and monitor government spending, have drawn widespread attention.
The party’s rising popularity among young voters is also evident. According to Election Commission data from November 2025, Bangladesh has around 127.7 million registered voters, including roughly 45 million aged 18 to 35. In recent student union elections at several universities, including Dhaka University, the Jamaat’s student wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir, won decisively across contested positions, while the BNP-backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal failed to secure any significant posts. Many experts believe the student parliament elections could influence the next national polls, though others disagree.
The Jamaat-i-Islami has formed an 11-party electoral alliance for the upcoming elections, including with the NCP, the student-led party. With the Awami League absent, the BNP and the Jamaat-led coalition are poised to be the main contenders.
Nahid Islam, convener of the NCP, tells Eos that the alliance is electoral rather than ideological. “Our political views differ from those of Jamaat-i-Islami, but we align on reform, justice and anti-corruption agendas,” he says. “That is why we formed this alliance.”
Islam is confident that their 11-party coalition will get the votes. “If given the chance to form the government, decisions will be made on common principles and will not be dominated by any single party,” he adds.
The JI chief, or ameer, Dr Shafiqur Rahman tells Eos that his party is receiving “overwhelming support” from across the country, citing independent surveys by, what he termed, credible pollsters.
Dr Rahman says that, since the official campaign began on January 22, he has travelled to nearly half of Bangladesh, visiting more than two dozen districts and addressing around 100 public rallies. “At each rally, the crowds were overwhelming,” he says, claiming that large numbers of supporters had turned out in favour of Jamaat candidates. “The country has not witnessed such political euphoria in more than two and a half decades,” believes Dr Rahman.
According to political analysts, the upcoming election, held after the 2024 popular uprising, could be the most important in the party’s history, with it potentially winning more seats than ever before.
Last month, The Washington Post reported that US diplomats were seeking closer engagement with the Jamaat, expecting it to perform strongly. The publication said it has audio recordings that reveal a US diplomat describing the Jamaat as a potential “friend” and stating that it cannot impose Sharia-rule in the country due to Western economic pressure.
The prospect of a Jamaat-led government has raised concerns in India, Bangladesh’s largest neighbour and Sheikh Hasina’s longtime ally. New Delhi views the Jamaat as pro-Pakistan, citing the party’s opposition to Bangladesh’s 1971 war that led to the country’s creation and alleged historical ties to Islamabad. Indian officials worry that the Jamaat coming to power could reorient Bangladesh’s traditionally India-friendly foreign policy.

THE QUESTION OF CAPABILITY 
Jamaat chief Dr Rahman is confident that his party is ready to govern. “If Allah wills it and the people give us the mandate on February 12, we are ready,” he tells Eos. “Over the past half-century, Jamaat has built a talented and honest pool of leaders, capable of managing every sector.”
He recalled the 2001 BNP-Jamaat alliance government, noting that ministers such as Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mujahid efficiently managed key portfolios, introduced programmes that boosted employment, utilised taxpayers’ money for development, and rooted out corruption. 
“Now, after more than 20 years, we are even more confident our leaders will govern effectively across all ministries,” Dr Rahman adds.
Dr Rahman’s thoughts are echoed by one of his party candidates, lawyer Mohammad Shishir Monir. “I alone am capable of running 10 ministries,” he tells Eos. “We have dozens more in our party like me, who are capable of running the country.”
However, Dhaka University professor and political analyst Dr Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Khan says that, while Jamaat had some experience in the BNP government from 2001 to 2006, they lack the experience of administration and running the government. 
Dilara Chowdhury, a former professor and political analyst at Jahangirnagar University, points out that capability and honesty matter more than experience when it comes to running the country. “Currently, Jamaat has more educated and qualified people in its ranks than other parties,” she adds.
An analysis of candidates’ affidavits by Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo shows that, of the 224 candidates contesting under the JI’s scales symbol, 201 are highly educated, including 10 with PhD degrees. 
Among the 287 BNP candidates contesting under the rice sheaf symbol, 229 are highly educated, including eight PhDs. The analysis indicates that the percentage of highly educated and PhD-holding candidates among Jamaat’s ranks is slightly higher than that of the BNP.
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
Jamaat-i-Islami chief Dr Rahman says the party’s goal is to establish a country based on insaaf [justice], where the majority are not ruled by a chosen few, public wealth is not plundered and no one remains above the law. “Is this not the basic tenet of a model Islamic society?,” he asks. “Is this not the demand of Gen Z, who overthrew a corrupt and fascist regime?”
Dr Rahman emphasises that Bangladesh’s multicultural and multi-ethnic population would continue to enjoy equal rights as enshrined in the constitution. “We believe in the rule of law, transparency, accountability, democracy and shura [consultation],” he says. “These principles are already embedded in our constitution and we do not view them as contradictory to Islamic values. You may call it ‘Sharia’ or any other name.”
Dr Rahman adds that any elements contradicting Islamic principles would be addressed through parliament, not by force. “Our opponents often use scare tactics, suggesting that ‘Sharia law’ would force women into strict dress codes or deny them education or careers,” he continues. “We have repeatedly clarified that no such measures will be enforced. Women will enjoy equity and fairness in all spheres of life,” Dr Rahman asserts. 
The party chief also addresses concerns over a Jamaat-led government’s adherence to national laws and UN human rights standards. “As a democratic party that has participated in every election since its inception, no one can deny that Jamaat-i-Islami is committed to the people’s mandate,” he says.
Dr Rahman adds that the party sees democratic nations in the West and East as strategic partners and aims to build a stable, pluralistic society based on freedom of expression, rule of law, equity and justice.
The Jamaat chief also points out that, despite attempts by the previous Awami League government to portray the Jamaat as militant, “they were never able to produce a single piece of evidence of Jamaat leaders or workers being involved in terrorism.”

FROM PARIAH TO CONTENDER
The Jamaat-i-Islami was founded in 1941 in Lahore, British India, by Islamist scholar Abul Ala Maududi. The party advocates Islam as the foundation for the state and society. During the 1971 war, JI opposed Bangladesh’s independence, and its leaders were accused of collaborating with the Pakistani army and committing war crimes. The party was banned after independence, but the ban was lifted following political changes in 1975, and it returned to politics in 1979.
The Jamaat won 18 seats in the 1991 elections, three in 1996, 17 in 2001, and two in 2008 — a modest to poor showing in previous elections. A high court cancelled the party’s registration in 2013, while JI also boycotted the 2014 elections. In 2018, with the party still declared illegal, some of its candidates ran under BNP tickets while others contested as independents. The party remained ineligible for the 2024 election, with the ban only overturned after Hasina’s ouster.
Dr Rahman, its chief, attributes the party’s growing current support to greater public exposure after the student-led July 2024 revolution and wider social media visibility, following decades of what he called “unfair” media portrayal. 
Dr Rahman thinks that the party’s suffering under the previous government, including the execution of its leaders and the imprisonment of its members, has earned it public sympathy. Unlike other parties, he claims, the Jamaat has avoided revenge or corruption. Instead, he says, the Jamaat cooperated with the interim government and the judiciary following Hasina’s ouster, demonstrating moral integrity that has won the party public support.
Analysts say another key factor is public frustration with corruption and extortion involving BNP leaders and activists, while the Jamaat has relatively avoided such allegations. 
“People are fed up with BNP leaders and activists because of extortion,” says analyst Dilara Chowdhury. She adds that corruption and extortion lie at the root of most crises in Bangladesh and effective curbs could significantly reduce the country’s problems.
Dr Khan of Dhaka University says that, with the marginalisation of the Awami League, the Jamaat has emerged as an alternative for some voters. “Public sympathy for the Jamaat has increased to some extent due to repression over the past 15 years,” he tells Eos.
Like the Jamaat, the BNP is also campaigning on an anti-corruption platform. Speaking at a rally in Chittagong on January 25, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman said the party would crack down on corruption if elected. Analyst Dilara Chowdhury points out, however, that the public has greater trust in the Jamaat than the BNP on corruption. “During BNP’s time in power from 2001 to 2006, corruption was not reduced. That is why many people do not trust the BNP,” she adds.
The Jamaat has also announced plans to launch a mobile app aimed at tackling extortion. At a recent election rally in Dhaka, Dr Rahman revealed that the app would allow individuals to anonymously file complaints against extortionists. 
By contrast, since August 5, 2024, numerous BNP leaders and activists have been implicated in cases relating to extortion and other allegations. Following media reports, the party expelled several thousand members. On September 18, 2025, BNP chairman Tarique Rahman said organisational action had been taken against more than 7,000 party members in response to various allegations.
Analysts also point to internal conflict within BNP, which they say has not been evident within Jamaat. According to an October 2025 report by Dhaka-based Human Rights Support Society (HRSS), at least 85 people were killed and 5,017 were injured in internal BNP clashes between September 2024 and September 2025.
Another factor behind the JI’s growing popularity is the party’s charitable activities, including welfare and social assistance programmes. Through disaster relief, financial support for low-income families, and educational and medical assistance, the party has expanded its engagement at the local level. In addition, institutions associated with the Jamaat, including banks, hospitals, coaching centres, schools and colleges, have helped create employment opportunities for party workers and supporters, while also providing education and healthcare services to the wider public.
It is no surprise, then, that voters such as Gopalganj’s Ramesh Chandra are planning to stamp their vote on the scales symbol in the upcoming elections. But whether the Jamaat can translate polling numbers into actual seats, navigate coalition politics and govern a diverse nation of 170 million remains to be seen. 
What is certain is that the February 12 elections will reshape Bangladesh’s political landscape in ways unimaginable just 18 months ago — when Hasina still ruled and Jamaat was still fighting for political survival. For a party that opposed the country’s founding, the possibility of now leading it represents perhaps the most dramatic political reversal in Bangladesh’s history.
