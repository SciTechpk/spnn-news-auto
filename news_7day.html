Sahil’s Six Months Cruel Numbers data reveals that a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country last year.
In the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported. 48 cases of pornography after sexual abuse were also recorded.
The victim was brought to the hospital due to her health condition, where, during a medical check-up, it was discovered that she was six months pregnant.
An application for action was filed by the victim’s family on Saturday at the City Hafizabad Police Station, on which case number 1152/25 was formally registered on Sunday under Section 376 (3) (Whoever commits rape of a minor or a person with mental or physical disability, shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life and fine) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Rana Sultan Mahmood has been named as the plaintiff in the FIR.
The victim is a child with congenital disabilities, unable to speak, hear or walk, and is also mentally immature and unconscious. Her parents stated in the FIR that they belonged to a poor and illiterate family and were unable to learn about the incident due to their daughter’s physical condition.
Investigation into the incident revealed that the suspect allegedly found the girl alone in the Hussainabad neighbourhood six months ago and sexually assaulted her. After the incident, he went into hiding.
Hafizabad District Police Officer (DPO) Atif Nazir Kadhar has taken immediate notice of the incident and ordered the DSP City Circle to submit a report. The DPO has also issued instructions for the immediate arrest of the suspect.
 
 

According to police officials, the accused will be arrested within the next 48 hours, while the victim’s family is being provided with full protection.
In May, police said they had arrested four suspects involved in an alleged gang rape of a mentally-challenged minor in Lahore earlier this month.
Also last month, A madrassah teacher in Muzaffargarh district of Punjab was arrested for allegedly raping an 11-year-old student at a seminary.</p><small>2025-06-15 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15141114071d3b6.jpg?r=141702' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917299/3-brothers-drown-as-car-plunges-into-river-in-gb' target='_blank'><strong>3 brothers drown as car plunges into river in GB</strong></a><br><p>At least three members of a family died and three others went missing on Sunday after their car plunged into a river stream in the Shinbar area of district Nagar, Gilgit-Baltistan.
Rescue 1122 official Nizamuddin told Dawn.com that the family was returning from a marriage ceremony when their car plunged into a stream, resulting in the drowning of six people and injuries to one.
He said rescue divers had recovered three bodies, while a search operation was ongoing to locate the remaining three missing individuals.
Sajid Ali, spokesperson for the Nagar district police officer, also confirmed the incident and said the car was en route to Chalt Bala when it plunged into the river stream.
He added that the bodies were transported to the District Headquarters Hospital in Nagar, while the injured had been referred to a hospital in Gilgit for further treatment.
The spokesperson identified the deceased as Ghulam Abbas, Sher Baz Ali, and Zohaib Ahmad. Those reported missing are Muhammad Hussain, Sharafat Hussain, and Aleem, while Kashif Hussain received injuries.
He said the three victims, who were brothers, were returning from the Bardas area after attending a wedding ceremony when the incident took place.
Gilgit Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said the accident was “regrettable”. He said Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan expressed sorrow over the incident and instructed all relevant departments, including the Home Secretary, to mobilise all available resources in the search for the missing individuals.
According to the spokesperson, the vehicle carrying seven passengers was returning from a wedding ceremony when it plunged into the river late last night.
Following the chief minister’s directives, rescue teams were dispatched to the site and efforts are underway to locate the remaining missing persons, he added.
Many accidents occur on Gilgit Baltistan’s roads due to its challenging and treacherous terrain, which becomes particularly dangerous during harsh weather conditions.
The lack of proper safety barriers, limited visibility, and inadequate maintenance further increase the risk of accidents, making it one of the more hazardous routes in the region.</p><small>2025-06-15 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15142826d023fd4.png?r=143518' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917285/iran-says-israel-aims-to-drag-war-to-gulf-region-after-attack-on-worlds-largest-gas-field' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says Israel aims to ‘drag war’ to Gulf region after attack on world’s largest gas field</strong></a><br><p>Tehran on Sunday said Israel wanted to “drag the conflict to the Persian Gulf” after the latter attacked the world’s largest gas field that Iran shares with Qatar, igniting another round of deadly tit-for-tat missile barrages.
Israel launched an air offensive against Iran on Friday, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.

What we know so far:

Production suspended after Israel hits Iran’s South Pars gas field
10 more killed, over 140 injured in Israel as Tehran responds with another missile barrage
Germany, France, UK offer talks over nuclear programme
3 drones reportedly aimed at US base in Iraq shot down as Trump warns against attacks on US
Situation ‘under control’ after oil depot hit; other refineries ‘functioning’


A day after Israel wiped out the top echelon of Iran’s military command, it hit Iran’s oil and gas industry for the first time. Iran then partially suspended gas production at the South Pars gas field, which it shares with Qatar.
At least 10 people were killed overnight, including three children, and more than 140 were injured by missiles that had hit homes in northern and central Israel, authorities said, according to Reuters.
Rescue teams combed through the rubble of residential buildings destroyed in strikes, using flashlights and sniffer dogs to look for survivors.
 






Following the fresh exchange of missiles, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran does not want its conflict with Israel to expand to neighbouring countries unless the situation is forced, adding its response had been based on self-defence.
Araghchi said Tehran had been responding to foreign aggression, and that if this aggression stopped, Iran’s reactions would also cease.
The foreign minister said the Israeli strikes on the offshore South Pars gas field that Iran shares with Qatar were a “blatant aggression and a very dangerous act”.
“Dragging the conflict to the Persian Gulf is a strategic mistake, and its aim is to drag the war beyond Iranian territory,” he said.
 


The foreign minister accused Israel of seeking to sabotage ongoing Iran-US nuclear talks, which, according to him, could have opened the way for an agreement. Tehran was set to present a proposal this Sunday during a sixth round of talks, which were cancelled following recent escalations.
“Israel’s attack would never have happened without the US green light and support,” Araghchi said, adding Tehran does not believe American statements that Washington had taken no part in recent attacks.
“It is necessary for the United States to condemn Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities if they want to prove their goodwill.”
The Wall Street Journal reported that the US military was “operating in the air, on land and at sea to shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel”. “US jet fighters, Navy destroyers and ground-based air-defence systems had [been] positioned to help counter any attack”, it said, citing US officials.
Axios quoted a US official as saying that Israel has urged the Trump administration to join the war, but said currently the administration was not considering it.
Explosions echoed through Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as missiles streaked across the skies, as interceptor rockets were launched in response. The military lifted its shelter-in-place advisory nearly an hour after issuing the warning.
Israeli media said at least 35 people were missing after a strike hit Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. A spokesperson for the emergency services said a missile hit an eight-storey building there and while many people were rescued, there were fatalities.
It was unclear how many buildings were hit overnight.
The latest wave of Iranian attacks began shortly after 11pm on Saturday (1am PKT Sunday), when air raid sirens blared in Jerusalem and Haifa, sending around a million people into bomb shelters.
Around 2:30am local time (4:30am PKT), the Israeli military warned of another incoming missile barrage and urged residents to seek shelter.
So far, at least 13 people in Israel have been killed and over 300 others injured since Iran launched its retaliatory attacks on Friday.
 






Brigadier General Ali Mohammad Naeini, the spokesperson for the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said in a televised statement that Israel’s fuel production facilities for fighter jets and energy supply centres were targeted with a large number of drones and missiles, Press TV reported.
The IRGC spokesperson also claimed that the IRGC aerospace defense system had “successfully intercepted and destroyed” three Israeli cruise missiles, 10 drones, and dozens of “hostile mini-drones in the affected regions”.
The elite force warned Tehran’s attacks will be “heavier and more extensive” if Israel continues its hostilities.
Yemen’s Houthis also said they targeted Israel in coordination with Iran, the first time a regional group has publicly announced joint cooperation on attacks with Tehran.
The Yemeni group targeted central Israel’s Jaffa with several ballistic missiles in the last 24 hours, military spokesperson Yehya Sarea said in a televised address.
“Triumphing for the oppressed Palestinian and Iranian peoples […] This operation was coordinated with the operations carried out by the Iranian army against the criminal Israeli enemy,” he added.
 


Situation ‘under control’ after oil depot hit
The Israeli military warned Iranians living near weapons facilities to evacuate, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks by Israel so far were nothing compared with what Iran would see in the coming days.
In Iran, nearly 140 people have been killed since Friday, with 78 on the first day of Israel’s campaign, and scores more yesterday, including 60 when a missile brought down a 14-storey apartment block in Tehran, where 29 of the dead were children.
The Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack, Iran said, but added the situation was under control.
A fire had erupted after an Israeli attack on an oil refinery near the capital while Israeli strikes also targeted Iran’s defence ministry building, causing minor damage, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said.

At the Tehran Oil Refinery, fuel production, supply and distribution continue without disruption, Iran’s Student News Network reported after an overnight fire following an Israeli strike took place at a fuel tank unrelated to the refinery.
Similarly, Iran’s oil ministry told state media today that operations at the Isfahan refinery continue without disruption, denying online reports of an incident or attack against the facility.
Trump distances US from strikes on Iran, warns against attacks on it in ‘any way’
US President Donald Trump said earlier today that if Iran attacks the United States in “any way, shape or form”, it would face the might of the US military “at levels never seen before”.
Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that the US had nothing to do with an attack on Iran overnight and that “we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!”
 


Three drones were launched toward the Ain al-Asad air base housing US forces in western Iraq following Israel’s strikes on Iran, the Associated Press reported, citing a US military official and a second US official.
The drones were shot down, the officials said. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the report.
AP further said that for a second day, supporters of armed factions in Iraq held a demonstration in Baghdad to denounce Israel’s bombing of Iran but did not attempt to breach a high-security zone where the US Embassy is located.
Germany, France, UK offer Iran talks over nuclear programme
Meanwhile, Germany, France and Britain are ready to hold immediate talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme in a bid to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.
Wadephul, who is on a visit to the Middle East, said he was trying to contribute towards a de-escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran, adding that Tehran had previously failed to take the opportunity to enter into constructive talks.

“I hope that’s still possible,” Wadephul told German public broadcaster ARD late on Saturday.
“Germany, together with France and Britain are ready. We’re offering Iran immediate negotiations about the nuclear programme, I hope ]the offer] is accepted.”
“This is also a key prerequisite for reaching a pacification of this conflict, that Iran presents no danger to the region, for the state of Israel or to Europe.”
Tehran called off nuclear talks that Washington had said were the only way to halt Israel’s bombing. Netanyahu claimed Israel’s strikes had set back Iran’s nuclear programme “possibly by years” and rejected international calls for restraint.
US intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have “repeatedly said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapon before Israel” launched its attacks on the Islamic Republic this week, AP noted.
 
 

Trump had warned Iran of worse to come, but said it was not too late to halt the Israeli campaign if Tehran accepted a sharp downgrading of its nuclear programme.
A round of US-Iran nuclear talks that was due to be held in Oman on Sunday was cancelled, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi saying the discussions could not take place while Iran was being subjected to Israel’s “barbarous” attacks.
Gas field attack
In the first apparent attack to hit Iran’s energy infrastructure, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said Iran partially suspended production at the world’s biggest gas field after an Israeli strike caused a fire there on Saturday.
The South Pars field is located offshore in Iran’s southern Bushehr province and is responsible for the lion’s share of gas production in Iran, the world’s third largest gas producer after the United States and Russia.
The strike caused a fire, which has been extinguished, the Iranian oil ministry said. The fire broke out in one of the four units of Phase 14 of South Pars, halting production of 12 million cubic metres of gas, Tasnim said.
Iran produces around 275 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year or some 6.5pc of global gas output, and consumes it domestically as it cannot export gas due to sanctions.
Iran shares the field with Qatar, which calls the field North Field. Qatar produces 77 million tonnes of liquefied gas from the field with the help of global majors such as Exxon and Shell and supplies the gas to Europe and Asia.
Fears about potential disruption to the region’s oil exports had already driven up oil prices 9 per cent on Friday, even though Israel spared Iran’s oil and gas on the first day of its attacks.
An Iranian general, Esmail Kosari, said on Saturday that Tehran was reviewing whether to close the Strait of Hormuz, controlling access to the Gulf for tankers.
 
 

With Israel saying its operation could last weeks, and Netanyahu urging Iran’s people to rise up against their rulers, fears have grown of a regional conflagration dragging in outside powers.
B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights organisation, said on Saturday that instead of exhausting all possibilities for a diplomatic resolution, Israel’s government had chosen to start a war that puts the entire region in danger.
Tehran has warned Israel’s allies that their military bases in the region would come under fire too if they helped shoot down Iranian missiles.
Israel sees Iran’s nuclear programme as a threat to its existence, and said the bombardment was designed to avert the last steps to production of a nuclear weapon.
Tehran has repeatedly said the programme is entirely civilian and that it does not seek an atomic bomb. However, UN’s nuclear watchdog IAEA reported it this week as violating obligations under the global non-proliferation treaty.</p><small>2025-06-15 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15135127e2016dd.jpg?r=135353' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917303/pmd-says-chances-of-rain-thunderstorm-in-karachi-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>PMD says chances of rain, thunderstorm in Karachi tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Karachi is expected to receive rain on Monday, accompanied by a dust thunderstorm, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
The PMD has predicted that a “westerly wave is affecting upper parts of the country & moist currents also penetrating in eastern parts of the province”.
Cloudy weather with temperatures ranging from 36–38 degrees Celsius is expected to persist throughout the metropolis tomorrow. Humidity levels are expected to touch 70-80 per cent in the morning.
“Dust-thunderstorm /rain likely in Karachi division on tomorrow & isolated places at outskirts of Karachi division on Tuesday,” the weather advisory read.
Under the influence of this system, the following parts of Sindh are expected to receive rain accompanied by dust thunderstorm at isolated places today: Ghotki, Sukkur, Jacobabad, Qamber Shahdadkot, Shikarpur, Khairpur, Dadu, Nosheroferoz, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tharparker, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, T.M.Khan, T.A.Yar, Hyderabad, Mitiari, Thatta, Sujawal, Badin and Jamshoro districts.
The forecast predicts light to moderate rainfall accompanied by dust thunderstorms on 16th-17th June.
Every year, Karachi gets flooded by rains, causing widespread disruption to public life and their safety. Last year in August, Mayor Karachi declared a state of emergency ahead of the downpour to tackle management efforts. The five-day rain spell left a trail of destruction in its wake, washing away roads and crippling civic life.

Trump hailed the United States as the “hottest country in the world” after watching tanks, aircraft, and troops file past him in Washington to honour the 250th anniversary of the US army.
But it formed a stark split screen with turmoil at home and abroad, as police used teargas to disperse protesters in Los Angeles and US ally Israel traded missile fire with Iran in a rapidly escalating conflict in the Middle East.
Trump’s parade on an overcast night in Washington came after tens of thousands of “No Kings” demonstrators thronged the streets in cities including New York, Philadelphia, Houston and Atlanta.
Trump largely avoided his usual domestic political diatribes in an unusually brief speech, and instead focused on praising the US army, saying that they “fight, fight, fight, and they win, win, win”.

The display of military might comes as Trump asserts his power domestically and on the international stage.
In his address to the parade, Trump sent a warning to Washington’s adversaries of “total and complete” defeat, with the United States increasingly at risk of getting tangled up in Israel’s conflict with Iran.
“Time and again, America’s enemies have learned that if you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you,” Trump said.
‘Happy Birthday’
Trump had openly dreamed since his first term as president of having a grand military parade, of the type more often seen in Moscow or Pyongyang than Washington.
The last such parade in the United States was at the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
When it came, Trump stood and saluted on a stage outside the White House as tanks rumbled past, aircraft roared overhead, and nearly 7,000 troops marched past.
Troops and military hardware from different eras of US history passed by, with an announcer reeling off victories in battles with Japanese, German, Chinese and Vietnamese forces in past wars.
The army said it cost up to $45 million.
But while the crowd sang “Happy Birthday” and there were occasional chants of “USA! USA!”, the atmosphere was less intense than one of the barnstorming rallies that swept Trump to power.
The White House said that “over 250,000 patriots showed up” for the event, without providing evidence. Communications Director Steven Cheung described the “No Kings” protests as a “complete and utter failure”.
“No Kings” organisers said protesters gathered in hundreds of cities, with AFP journalists seeing large crowds in several cities.

Organisers said they were protesting against Trump’s dictatorial overreach, and in particular what they described as the strongman symbolism of the parade.
“I think people are mad as hell,” Lindsay Ross, a 28-year-old musician, told AFP in New York, where tens of thousands of people rallied.
‘Display of authoritarianism’
Thousands turned out in Los Angeles to protest Trump’s deployment of troops in the country’s second-largest city following clashes sparked by immigration raids.
Police in Los Angeles used tear gas and mounted officers to clear protesters who had gathered in front of the federal building in downtown, the focus of demonstrations for the last week.
AFP reporters at the scene said there was no disorder, but it appeared local officers were moving people away from an area where National Guard troops and Marines are stationed.
Some protesters targeted Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida — while a small group even gathered in Paris.
“I think it’s disgusting,” protester Sarah Hargrave, 42, said in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, describing Trump’s parade as a “display of authoritarianism”.
The killing of a Democratic lawmaker and her husband Saturday in the northern state of Minnesota — in what the governor called a targeted attack — also cast a pall over the parade.
Trump was quick to condemn the attacks outside Minneapolis in which former state speaker Melissa Hortman was killed along with her husband, while another state lawmaker and his wife were hospitalised with gunshot wounds.</p><small>2025-06-15 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1511291179a3d82.jpg?r=113204' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917161/thar-villagers-stumble-upon-ancient-wooden-sculpture' target='_blank'><strong>Thar villagers stumble upon ‘ancient’ wooden sculpture</strong></a><br><p> 

THE ‘ancient’ sculpture.—Dawn

MITHI: An apparently centuries-old wooden sculpture of a robed, bearded man has been discovered in the hilly region of Karoonjhar, Nagarp­arkar, intriguing historians and archaeologists about its cultural origins.
Sources privy to the discovery said the artefact was recovered near a seasonal riverbed in the Karoonjhar hills by area residents and social activists.
The intricately carved wooden statue depicts a robed man with traditional features, and is believed to be of considerable antiquity. Preliminary observations suggest it may be linked to ancient eastern cultures, though its exact provenance remains unclear.
Researcher and writer Khalid Kumhar, who had extensively documented the historical geography of Tharparkar, remarked that the design and posture of the statue appeared to reflect influences of East Asian or Chinese culture.
“The statue does not match known relics of Buddhist or Jain iconography common to this region,” he noted.
The discovery drew the attention of the Sindh Department of Culture, Tourism and Antiquities and provincial minister Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah stated that measures would be taken to preserve the object.
“A team of heritage experts will conduct thorough research on the sculpture, and their findings will be shared with the public in due course,” said the minister.
The wooden statue has been temporarily secured by locals until it is formally examined by experts from the culture department.

The minister also revealed that the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has expressed willingness to fund the project while final decision regarding the loan approval was expected in September this year after its board meeting.
 
 

Commenting on the media talk of Sindh chief minister regarding the motorways, Mr Aleem said that he takes responsibility for the past year only but does not want to comment on the inaction of previous governments regarding the construction of the HSM and Karachi motorways.
He emphasised the corporate importance of connecting Karachi Port to the National Motorway network, highlighting that without this connection, the motorway’s utility for import, export, and business would be of no use.

Minister vows to start work on the project this year

He pointed out that various political parties, including the PPP remained in power but unfortunately, valuable time was lost due to their failure to initiate crucial infrastructure projects such as the Karachi-Hyderabad-Sukkur motorways.
The minister reaffirmed the federal government’s commitment to construct HSM but also the Hyderabad-Karachi section as well while the aim was to complete the entire route within two years. Furthermore, the Northern Bypass will be converted into an eight-lane highway and linked with HSM.
He said HSM has been divided into five zones. The Islamic Deve­lo­p­ment Bank will finance three of these zones while funding for the remaining two will be sought from other banks or donor agency, he added.
The minister extended his thanks to the Sindh chief minister and said that the federal government would definitely not hesitate to request the Sindh government’s contribution of Rs25 billion, if needed.
He affirmed the federal government’s desire to complete this $2bn project as swiftly as possible through its own resources.
Mr Aleem further said the National Highway Authority (NHA) was actively working on the Lyari Expressway. This project will also be upgraded to meet international standards and, upon its completion the project will be presented as a gift to the people of Karachi.

Little is known publicly about President Asif Ali Zardari’s efforts to play a mediatory role and seek a rapprochement between Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In January 2011, the Iranian president’s special envoy invited Zardari to a conference on the global ‘War Against Terror’ in Tehran. Despite advisers suggesting Pakistan participate at a lower level, Zardari readily accepted and decided to attend personally.
During his visit to Tehran in June 2011 for the conference, Zardari met with Rahbar Ayatollah Khamenei. After initial pleasantries, Zardari asked his delegation members to leave him alone with Iran’s supreme leader. The contents of their discussion remained undisclosed. A press release from the Rahbar’s office merely reiterated the usual diplomatic language about “historical, cultural and religious bonds” and the need to “strengthen Tehran-Islamabad relations in all areas.”
Unusually, Zardari revisited Tehran the following month, meeting the Rahbar one-on-one for a second time in less than 30 days.
I gained more insight into the June meeting with the Rahbar when Iran’s foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, visited Pakistan and met with the president at Bilawal House in Karachi that September. I was present throughout the meeting. Salehi first summarised his visit’s achievements, mentioning signed agreements and reiterating the need to earnestly pursue the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project. He then broached the subject of Iran-Saudi relations, saying, “Mr President, I wish to convey my president’s deep appreciation for your efforts.”
Speaking in hushed tones and glancing over his shoulder, Salehi appeared uncomfortable with my presence. As I rose to leave, Zardari gestured for me to remain seated. Zardari’s face brightened as Salehi disclosed, “Necessary elements are falling into the right place, and it is proceeding in the right direction.” The cryptic nature of these “necessary elements” and the direction of progress intrigued me.

From seeing off military dictator Gen Musharraf to the Osama bin Laden fiasco, from being mired in the Memogate controversy to pushing legislation for greater provincial autonomy and staring down threats of coups, Asif Ali Zardari’s first presidency was anything but ordinary. His former spokesperson and trusted confidant, Farhatullah Babar, recounts the events he was witness to first-hand in The Zardari Presidency (2008-13): Now It Must Be Told. Eos presents exclusive excerpts from the book…

After a pause, Salehi continued, “As we started on your advice and took the first step, a storm erupted in parliament. They even called for my impeachment.” Zardari interjected, “No, I did not give any advice. I only made a request.”
This exchange further piqued my curiosity. Salehi elaborated on his response to the Iranian parliament: “I asked them, what did they expect from me? As foreign minister, is it not my responsibility to talk with everyone, even our enemies? Indeed, it is my job to pursue peace. So why criticise me? Why condemn me merely for seeking to open a window?”
He explained that he had reasoned with parliament that seeking peace was Iran’s own desire and initiative, not driven by external forces. Salehi then revealed that the Iranian ambassador in Riyadh had received a message from the Saudi government stating, “We expect some progress next month”, though he didn’t elaborate further. Zardari didn’t press for details but instead smiled and called for refreshments.
President Zardari informed Salehi that, during his recent trip to Urumqi, he had already briefed the Chinese vice premier about these developments. He explained that this was to enable Chinese leaders to play a role if needed. Salehi listened intently, eager to learn about the Chinese reaction. Zardari noted, “The Chinese vice premier did not respond to my comments,” adding that the premier may have avoided commenting without President Xi’s approval.
Pleased that Iran had accepted his mediatory role, Zardari continued, “When I met the Rahbar, I told him that I would sit in his office and not leave until he agreed. We have no choice but to seek peace and pursue rapprochement. We are all in serious turmoil. Pakistan cannot afford a war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.”
His thoughts seemed to flow rapidly as he jumped from one subject to another.
“Economies are falling apart. I fear this will result in wars. I’ve seen how small mistakes and miscalculations can be disastrous. I witnessed Shevardnadze [then Soviet foreign minister, later President of Georgia] visiting Pakistan. He wanted to discuss Afghan President Najibullah’s offer for a peaceful power transfer. Najibullah was willing to seek a political solution, and the Soviet Union supported this. It was a great opportunity. But our people insisted on a military victory. Egos came into play. They wanted to tell our people that we could win wars. Some were obsessed with a military victory. We all know what happened then. We were misled when they told my wife, ‘Madam Prime Minister, Jalalabad will fall within a week.’”
Zardari also recalled US Ambassador [Robert] Oakley once telling him that the US was unaware Najibullah possessed MiGs and other sophisticated weapons. “Oh, a serious lapse on the part of our intelligence,” Oakley had admitted. “The Americans do not have a plan A, let alone plans B or C,” Zardari remarked.
 


As he continued speaking, Salehi listened without interruption. Past midnight, the president requested the draft press release of the meeting. He reviewed it, deleting references to currency swap and banking cooperation agreements with Iran and diluting mentions of the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project.
While Zardari may have thought the Americans incapable of executing even plan A, he was careful not to offend the US by publicly acknowledging the growing Pakistan-Iran cooperation. Iran’s Bank Melli had been on the United Nations’ watch list since 2008 for its alleged involvement with Iranian nuclear and missile programmes. The UN had also imposed sanctions on states opening Iranian bank branches in their countries. The president removed references to banking cooperation.
However, the next day’s newspapers quoted a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, which was front-paged with reports that, “despite UN restrictions on the Iranian banking sector”, Pakistan had signed a banking cooperation agreement with Iran. Zardari was displeased.
Thus, in 2011, Zardari mounted a serious bid to seek Iran-Saudi rapprochement. He was prepared to sit in the Rahbar’s office until the supreme leader agreed. Zardari also informed Chinese leaders about his efforts.
 
 

Some speculated that Zardari might have undertaken this initiative at the behest of Chinese leaders, but there was no evidence to support this claim. It remains debatable whether the Chinese encouraged Zardari to undertake this mission in 2011 or were inspired to broker peace between the two nations after Zardari informed them about his secret mediation efforts.
A decade later, in April 2023, the world was stunned to learn that Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud met his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in Beijing for the first time in seven years. They agreed to reopen embassies and consulates. The peace process between Iran and Saudi Arabia was on track. Zardari did not have to sit in front of the Rahbar after all.
THE CULMINATION OF THE LAWYER’S MOVEMENT
Some advisers of Zardari, known for their links with the establishment, had made it known that [Chief of Army Staff] Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani wanted [Justice Iftikhar] Chaudhry reinstated [as Chief Justice of Pakistan]. Throughout the day on March 15, [2009] they spoke, first in whispers and later loudly, that troops in Rawalpindi had been alerted in anticipation of some emergency.
Zardari had never mentioned what Kayani wanted. Indeed, he did not heed any talk about it. As the convoy of hundreds of vehicles led by Nawaz Sharif readied in Lahore to march on Islamabad for the “final push”, the chorus by these advisers grew louder, and the push for Chaudhry’s reinstatement stronger. A few, painting a grim picture, even claimed they had heard about the takeover from the horse’s mouth. Their refrain was that a military coup was imminent if Chaudhry were not reinstated immediately.
[Late Night, March 15, 2009]
As I entered the president’s chamber on the fourth floor, Zardari was seated on a rocking chair. Surprisingly, he appeared unfazed. A few close advisers were already present. It was difficult to tell whether he had been informed of the shadows lurking in the compound below. Even if he were aware, he did not seem to care. The late-night meeting was held in the president’s official chamber instead of the committee room, where such meetings were typically conducted.
Twenty-two close associates and advisers had been invited to the huddle, but only thirteen turned up. One suspected they avoided coming at that hour, fearing an army takeover. Those who had been falling over one another for an audience with the president in the morning were conspicuously absent at night, even when asked to come.
Zardari inquired about those who had not turned up. No one had an answer. There was a hushed silence. Everyone pretended that he had not heard what the president had said. Zardari did not press for an answer. It was enough just to point out that several invitees had failed to appear. The message would reach those who did not come for the meeting.
“Sir, my information is that, in a short while, the marchers will set out from Lahore towards the capital and lay siege to the Presidency and PM’s House,” a close adviser said with a drawn face.
Zardari responded, “Sometimes you have to take strong decisions and take a firm position and stand by your decision.” Regarding the threatened march on the Presidency, he said in Urdu: “Ye loagon ka samundar jo Islamabad ki taraf aaraha hai, yeh chand gaarrion ke siwa kuch bhi nahi hoga. Yeh sab drama hai [The sea of people marching towards Islamabad will turn out to be no more than a few cars. It’s all a drama]. Yeh sab drama hai [All this is a drama],” he further emphasised.
He reassured the dozen advisers gathered around him, saying nothing would happen even if the demonstrators were allowed to camp in front of the Presidency for a few days. The cabinet ministers, however, already had cold feet.
A federal minister expressed concern: “A serious law and order situation, even bloodshed, can result if the masses were allowed to converge at the ‘D’ Chowk.” Zardari remained unimpressed. The huddle continued until past midnight. Almost everyone urged the President to reinstate Chaudhry to avert an imminent military takeover. A few who may have thought otherwise kept quiet.

A minister occasionally called someone from the meeting room to ascertain whether the marchers had actually started from Lahore. Every time he made a phone call, he told the president, “Sir, the marchers will start off in a few minutes. They are led by Nawaz and will be joined by groups on the way. I am keeping watch.” The few minutes seemed like an eternity, never-ending. Occasionally, a minister would rise and, coming closer, almost whisper into the president’s ears. One guessed that the advice to reinstate Chaudhry and “save the system” was being whispered. Zardari remained defiant.
Everyone spoke about reinstating Iftikhar Chaudhry. No one talked about reinstating the scores of other sacked judges. Surprised, the president asked why no one talked about reinstating the other sacked judges. No one responded. The president said, “In principle, I am not against the reinstatement of other sacked judges, but I don’t want Chaudhry reinstated.”
“Sir, if you agree to reinstate all other sacked judges, why not also reinstate Chaudhry,” Prime Minister [Yusuf Raza] Gilani asked. “Why, sir?” another asked, endorsing the suggestion. “If it is right to reinstate other sacked judges, why would it be wrong to reinstate Chaudhry?”
Almost in chorus, everyone said that all sacked judges, including Chaudhry, should be reinstated.
As everyone stressed Chaudhry’s reinstatement, Zardari once again said, “I know Chaudhry more than you do.” He explained that it would be wrong because, to reinstate Chaudhry, he would have to sack the sitting chief justice, Abdul Hameed Dogar. “I will not do it under any circumstances. Dogar has been appointed under the Constitution. I will not go against the Constitution.”
He reminded the advisers around him that Shaheed Benazir Bhutto also didn’t favour reinstating Chaudhry, although she protested the sacking of judges. “We cannot ditch Dogar unceremoniously and unconstitutionally,” he said. Zardari then talked about Chaudhry and said that some people had brought messages from him that he would not cause any problems if reinstated. He did not name the messengers. “His [Chaudhry’s] methods were not like [that of] a Chief Justice,” Zardari told the meeting.
 
 

At one point, Zardari blurted: “Wo qasmain kha raha tha ke Saab ko meri taraf se guarantee de do [He swore to assure me that he would not cause any problem to me],” Zardari recalled.
“I cannot talk more than this,” he said, leaving everyone guessing. He was surprised at how his close associates had ditched him at this hour and left him alone in the ring. He turned around to look closely at a go-getter federal minister as if saying to him, “Et tu, Brute?”
Once again, he firmly said he would not sack Dogar to bring in Chaudhry, “come what may.” Gilani pointed out that Dogar would be retiring in a week, and Chaudhry could be reinstated after Dogar’s retirement. “Chaudhry will not mind waiting for a week,” he said. There was silence as all eyes turned towards Zardari.
Zardari was silent, signalling his agreement.
THE ‘MEMOGATE’ CRISIS
The Memogate scandal, which turned into a political and security crisis, seemed like a suicide attack on Zardari by the army chief and DG ISI, aided by the opposition leader at the time and CJP (Chief Justice of Pakistan) Iftikhar Chaudhry.
It consumed Zardari worse than any other personal or political crisis he had thus far endured. While it is indeed remarkable that he survived it, to claim that he was unscathed would be wrong and not borne out by facts. He was badly bruised.
The army and ISI chiefs claimed that the memo to [US Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral] Mike Mullen was not fake. They asserted it existed and that Zardari wanted to use the US against the army and ISI in the aftermath of the raid on the Osama bin Laden (OBL) compound. They blamed [Pakistan ambassador to the US, Husain] Haqqani as the conduit for the memo but actually aimed at Zardari as the mastermind.
 
 

In TV talk shows, Zardari was painted as an evil incarnate who conspired against the military leadership and the ISI. References were made to the Kerry-Lugar Bill that linked US aid to Pakistan with democracy in the country and blamed it on Zardari-Haqqani. Doomsday predictions were made that Ambassador Haqqani would turn into an approver. References were made to his alleged admission in the past of having links as a student with the ISI chief [under Gen Zia] Akhtar Abdul Rehman. Suggestions were made that some civilians who were aware may have blown the OBL cover.
Who else among the civilians would know more about the cover than President Asif Ali Zardari? The president, indeed, was under siege. Accused of treason, he stood at the centre of the storm. Embattled and defiant, Zardari decided to go down fighting. To send a message of defiance, he announced he would address a joint session of Parliament and make some hard-hitting statements by directly addressing the nation. He was ready to fight to the finish.
The announcement to address Parliament created an uproar. He was accused of pitting parliament against the judiciary and the army. Zardari did not care.
“President and supreme commander of the armed forces Asif Ali Zardari has decided to address [a] joint session of the Parliament after Muharram and called upon the government to take appropriate steps in this regard,” said a brief press release issued by the Presidency. Never before had the title “supreme commander of the armed forces” been used for President Zardari in official press releases.
But today, Zardari asked that the press release clearly state that the “supreme commander of the armed forces” had decided to address Parliament. The decision about the time and date of the address was left to the government to allow him to choose the timing. The press release also referred to iconic pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar for “standing up to mountains of hardship for the cause.”
The president approved the draft press release before it was issued. The die was cast. Enough was enough. He invited a small group of advisers to his residence for discussions to prepare the draft of the address to Parliament. Nearly half a dozen advisers came for the preparatory meeting. Zardari began speaking to prepare the pitch for his speech points. I pulled out my pen and notebook.
Soon, it became clear that he was laying bare his distressed mind and soul more than indicating points for a formal speech. It was yet another monologue, as in meetings with the Sri Lankan dignitaries and the Korean business delegation the previous week.

He alone spoke uninterruptedly, words coming out of his mouth like a torrent. He spoke for nearly two hours. Words and sentences gushed out of his lips like a heavy downpour. Sometimes he was highly sublime, at other times too mundane and abrasive. That he was deeply distressed was not in doubt.
Aware that the president had been stressed this past week, his personal physician, Dr Asim, barged into the meeting uninvited. He did not want the president to remain engaged in a brainstorming session for too long. Dr Asim was casually dressed, as if straight from the bedroom.
Seeing him, the president clapped, as if to draw attention to an unwelcome intrusion and firmly asked Dr Asim not to disturb him. Dr Asim retreated. As emotions turned into anger, Zardari resumed: “I am the supreme commander. I can destroy my enemies. If anyone thinks that I will surrender, he is mistaken. I am not going to run away.” He also threatened: “I know many things. Kayani is under me; I am not under them. Nobody should think that manipulations against me will succeed.”
“I will defeat all manipulators,” he declared. Without naming anyone, he said, “They are playing with me, but I will play with them.” He seemed to indict Kayani and Pasha. Then he softened somewhat: “But I will not talk. I have to protect the country. I will.”
I scribbled in shorthand as he spoke. I did this not to prepare his speech but for the sake of history and to record how intrigues at the highest state levels had pushed the civilian president to the brink.
“I am radiating energy, Farhatullah, that you don’t understand,” he said, looking at me as he noticed me scribbling. He once again clapped his hands and said, “Laughter is the best medicine. It releases frustration.” Then he laughed out loud, asking us to laugh with him. Obligingly, everyone giggled. Once or twice, he clapped, which exaggerated the laughter.
It brought to mind [US Secretary of State] Henry Kissinger’s memoirs of [US] President Nixon, when he was mired in Watergate and deeply distressed. One night, the president telephoned Kissinger and called him to the White House during the crisis. When Kissinger came, Nixon told him, “Henry, you are not a very orthodox Jew, and I am not an orthodox Quaker, but we need to pray,” and went down on his knees. Obligingly, Kissinger knelt, too.
Zardari, mired in Memogate, asked his advisers to laugh with him as he laid bare his soul, and everyone did. Suddenly, looking at me, he said, “Do you know why I did not send you to the Senate [in the last Senate election in 2009]? You are a credible face of the Party, and when you speak, people trust you. You speak for me. I asked you to work with me even though, when you worked with Bibi, you did not think highly of me. You also thought I was corrupt.”
When I tried to say something, he stopped me.
Turning sublime and philosophical, he started talking about how, with a trained mind, focused thoughts, and an outpouring of love, one can even control the universe. Love embraces everything. He seemed to be reading from Rumi’s treatise on love. He hopped from one subject to another as everyone listened.
Next, he spoke about the power of words. Positive words inspire, while negative words cause stress and anxiety and can be demoralising. “Watch your words,” he asked everyone. He alternated between the sublime and the mundane as he said again: “No one should think of intrigues against me. I will defeat them.”
Exhausted, he asked for tea for everyone.
After over two hours of monologue, the president called off the meeting and asked to reassemble later that night. The “briefing session” was postponed until after dinner. The aborted midday preparatory meeting resumed after dinner.
Once again, the president began by lamenting how he had been demonised and wronged in life. Some unforgettable and telling words and sentences stuck in the mind: “I worshipped Bibi, not merely loved her. She was far beyond even the feelings of love. I have lost her. She sacrificed her life.” “What else is there for me to give?”
“I was accused of every crime on earth. I was accused of murder, of killing my own brother-in-law. I was accused of drug smuggling, of tying a bomb to the leg to extort money.” “Is there anything of which I have not been accused?” “I endured all this. I have been wronged.”
 
 

Baring his anguished soul, his words came out from the depths of his heart, creating a tapestry of admiration and respect that was difficult to explain. His words pierced the heart as he spoke and were profoundly moving. His voice became louder, and his speech incoherent. The next moment, it faltered, and his body shook. Then he began to stutter.
He struggled for the words to come out of his lips. Words that had flowed like a torrent before were now coming out with difficulty and haltingly. Each word was a struggle to come out of his mouth.
Then the stutter vanished, and he turned pale. His head swung to the right as he slipped on the sofa. A bottle of water was rushed, but it was hard to make him drink. He lay on the sofa, his feet dangling. He was helped to lie on the carpet on the floor. Someone rushed out to call for medical help.
Before the physician arrived, a trained valet barged into the room and administered some emergency tablets on his own. He knew what to do almost by reflex action if something went wrong. He removed Zardari’s socks, which were moist with sweat. Artificial resuscitation was also tried, but only briefly. It was not needed. The military secretary also rushed in. Everyone left the room. Minister of State Kamal Majidullah and I, however, stayed behind. Doctors called in emergency had arrived. A stretcher was brought in to take the president to his bedroom. The shades of night had fallen. It was 10:30pm.
As he was being shifted to the bedroom, I looked at him more closely again, fighting back the thought that it might be the last time. This was not the fate he deserved. It was hard to look at him. He was going down fighting. If it were his last battle, it was also his best. Shakespeare wrote: “He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.”

A few days later, a furniture brand known for its chairs, Chairman, released a press ad with the caption, “Humari kursi sab se mazboot hai [Our chair is the strongest].”
That one press ad put the brand smack dab in the middle of a political discourse that was raging at the time. Some understood the ad as mocking Bhutto, while others believed it was supporting him. The brand was doing neither. It was simply trying to gain some relevance during a time when a majority of Pakistanis were split into two camps and politics was all they were talking about. Uncannily, Chairman did something that was ahead of its time.
There is now enough evidence that in today’s polarised societies, consumer brands and their advertising agencies are struggling to understand their consumers and to stay relevant.
 
 

Numerous articles and books have appeared trying to figure out the ‘enigma’ that is Generation Z (1997-2012). It is as if the problems brands are facing to stay relevant can be resolved if this generation is ‘correctly’ profiled. But it has been profiled. In fact, unlike past generations, this one has been over-profiled.
Yet, numerous brands are continuing to struggle to get a foothold in the psyche and zeitgeist of the times they are operating in. Nevertheless, consequently, an increasing number of brands are realising that the field of marketing requires some major alterations in a polarised milieu. How can a brand find relevance in fragmented societies split into opposing cultural and political camps?

As societies grow increasingly divided along political and cultural lines, and as consumer identities rapidly change, brands must evolve or risk irrelevance

This is the question brands are asking — even though most have decided to go about their business the way they always have. But this means they are suffering from a ‘cultural lag.’ These brands are not keeping pace with the rapid cultural and political transformations taking place in societies and, consequently, within the markets that these brands operate in.
Consumer brands are not just products or services. They carry an ethos in a bid to strike a much ‘deeper connection’ with consumers. Sneakers are products. Nike, a company that makes this product, is a brand. It posits a belief: “Just Do It.” This is not just a slogan but an ethos: ‘Don’t hold back. Believe in yourself. Take the plunge. This act in itself is a win.’
To survive, brands need to remain relevant. One way of doing this is to jump on a bandwagon of trends driven by a particular generation. But this is not working anymore. For example, in Pakistan, some brands, in a bid, to become relevant for the youth, plug rap/hip-hop music in their communication. On most occasions, the youth finds this to be inauthentic and downright silly.
Disney learned this the hard way when it began to shape characters and plots of their films and TV series according to Gen Z’s ‘woke’ beliefs. But the company suffered one flop after another. It lost a huge amount of money by ‘going woke.’ And the irony is, the ‘woke crowd’ wasn’t interested. In fact, it saw Disney’s ploy as a corporate entity turning a cluster of beliefs into silly caricatures.
 
 

This shows just how tough it has become for brands to stay relevant in this day and age. Those who are playing safe may still be selling their products, but the emotional hold of the brands that make these products is rapidly loosening.
Politics has become a vital part of the transformations taking place in today’s polarised societies. But most brands are petrified to take sides or, for that matter, even to think about politics — even though it is possible that most of their consumers today would want them to. Brand teams and their advertising agencies are not designed to think any deeper than the standard ways they comprehend their consumers. The focus groups and researches that they bank on are engineered to only skim the surface of segments they are targeting.
It’s like those doltish TV shows in which a host asks the most inane questions from guests. One can get to know what a person’s favourite colour, soft-drink or ice cream flavour is, but that’s about it. Most focus groups turn consumers into caricatures.
A 2021 report by the American Marketing Association concluded that, as the political landscape continues to shift and polarise, the influence of politics on consumption behaviours is poised to grow. The report suggested that “analysing and utilising consumers’ political ideologies may prove not only useful to brands, but also necessary…”
 


Indeed, but such suggestions horrify most brands. Those who handle them are not designed to think about marketing in this manner. Secondly, most of them have only a superficial understanding of politics. So, even if they do venture out to determine the politics of their consumers, what will they ask? Some brands have started to hire help in this regard by asking sociologists and political scientists to design questioners.
After doing this, they have plunged in to pick a side. The American ice cream brand Ben&Jerry’s openly advocates progressive/liberal causes, whereas Black Rifle Coffee quietly supports conservative causes.
 
 

In fact, in the US, there are now numerous ‘Red Brands’ and ‘Blue Brands.’ Red ones identify with conservative views, and the blue ones uphold ‘liberal’ ideals. This is how these brands are finding relevance in a polarised society and, thus, market.
However, not all brands want to go this far — especially in Pakistan. But they are likely to continue losing relevance if they fail to understand the politics of their consumers. They don’t really have to pick a side. They only have to reshape the way they understand today’s consumers. This can provide them a deeper understanding of their consumers and more relevant communication can be the outcome, without even mentioning any politics.
I once worked with a Thai sociologist who was associated with a major advertising agency. This was during a research stint I was a part of in Washington DC, in 2018.
He demonstrated that even when a person enters a store just to buy a soft-drink can, on the surface, his choice in this regard is being influenced by taste and aesthetics. But, more importantly, what’s on the surface is being unconsciously influenced by his political and social views. In politically charged times, a brand needs to dig and mine these.

The fatal accident comes as relatives mourn at least 279 people killed when a passenger plane slammed into a residential area in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad on Thursday.
The helicopter crash left the pilot and all six passengers dead when their chopper came down during the flight from Kedarnath temple, in Uttarakhand state, disaster response official Nandan Singh Rajwar told AFP.
The state’s chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, said rescue teams had been dispatched to the scene after the “very sad news”.
The crash was likely caused by bad weather, according to district tourism official Rahul Chaubey.
Pilgrims flock to Kedarnath temple during the summer when it is possible to access the site, which stands at an altitude of 3,584 metres.
A cottage industry of helicopter charter firms has developed to serve wealthy pilgrims who want to visit shrines in the Indian Himalayas, but who prefer to avoid arduous trekking.

• Inaugurates second phase of first segment of Shahrah-i-Bhutto
KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has warned the PML-N government that the PPP will not support the passage of the federal budget in parliament if Islamabad continues to manage development schemes in Sindh instead of transferring them to the provincial government.
Although the PPP is not part of the federal cabinet, it is a major coalition partner of the PML-N government and without its support the passage of the federal budget in the National Assembly is not possible.
Speaking at a programme held to inaugurate the second phase of the first complete segment of the Malir Expressway, renamed as Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Expressway / Shahrah-i-Bhutto, on Saturday, the CM strongly criticised the federal government, accusing it of discriminating against Sindh and treating the province like a colony.
“The federal government has wronged us. They have dissolved the Public Works Department (PWD), which was responsible for overseeing development projects across provinces,” he said, adding that while the other three provinces received funding for development projects accompanied by their budgets, Sindh was completely overlooked.
“They want to manage Sindh’s projects from Islamabad through a newly formed company. I have made it clear that this will not work,” he asserted.
He asked the federal government to transfer all development projects in Sindh to the provincial government; otherwise the PPP would not support the PML-N-led federal government in the passage of the federal budget in parliament.
“You cannot run Sindh like a colony,” he said,  adding that the federal government’s decision seemed influenced by specific vested interests.
Without naming the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, a coalition partner of the PML-N government at the Centre, the CM said: “It appears this move has been motivated by  land grabbers, the so-called ‘china-cutting mafia’.”
Mr  Shah urged the federal government to stop treating Sindh like a stepchild. “If you continue this stepmotherly treatment, we know how to claim our rights,” he warned.
‘A gift from PPP to Karachiites’
Talking about the expressway, the CM described the project as a vital gift from the PPP government to the people of Karachi,  promising enhanced transportation, economic growth and better industrial connectivity.
 
 

He reiterated that the expressway would improve transportation, stimulate economic growth and facilitate industrial links.
He also directed that the section from Kathore to Quaidabad be completed promptly. This project is the largest public-private partnership initiative in Sindh.
The chief minister noted that the starting point of Shahrah-i-Bhutto is located 200 meters before the Jam Sadiq Interchange. To enhance connectivity from DHA and Korangi, a permanent interchange/roundabout is being constructed at the existing Korangi Causeway to facilitate traffic from all directions, including Korangi, DHA, and Sharea Faisal (KPT Interchange).
Emphasising the importance of infrastructure development for progress, the CM stated that the focus is on making urban and industrial connections faster and safer. Although there have been some delays due to utility shifting and local issues, he assured that work is ongoing, with expected completion dates for the remaining sections by Dec 2025.
This inauguration follows the opening of the first phase of the first segment by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Jan 11, 2025, which covered the Sharea Faisal to Quaidabad stretch.
Mr Shah added that the final phase from Quaidabad to Kathore is expected to be opened by the end of Dec 2025, and that he plans to request an appointment with the PPP chairman after the anniversary of Benazir Bhutto’s death.
Speaking about future plans, he said the provincial government aims to establish a link road from the port to Qayyumabad, with strong backing from the Karachi business community. “Some people are beginning to recognise the efforts of the PPP,” he stated, adding: “To those who still question our work, I say the people of Sindh are fully aware.”
Earlier, the inauguration event drew significant attendance from PPP members and the public, with participants chanting party slogans.
Accompanied by senior ministers Sharjel Inam Memon, Minister of Planning and Development Nasir Shah, and Senator Waqar Mahdi, the chief minister inspected the expressway and paid the toll tax.
The Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Expressway project spans 38.661 km, with six lanes  and a design speed of 100 km/h. It connects DHA and Korangi to the M-9  Motorway near Kathore and includes six interchanges and 12 toll plazas.  The overall progress of the project is currently at 80 per cent.

It may not have been so openly stated, but one important objective is regime change in Iran in order to try and usher in a regime more like Israel’s other Middle Eastern/ regional neighbours, who are happy to be friends with Tel Aviv. That is why they offer only perfunctory condemnation of Israel’s ethnic-cleansing of Palestinians not just in Gaza, but also the West Bank.
A wider war also helps shift the focus from the worst ethnic cleansing of this century in Gaza by relentless bombing, other military means, and mass starvation. It is the food blockade which was beginning to create a little unease among at least Israel’s European allies, who have so far offered unconditional material and diplomatic support to it on Gaza.
 
 

At least the European allies, I say, because the US administration solidly supports the apartheid state, which is executing the American president’s Gaza Riviera Plan. It visualises beachside resorts after the forceful displacement of two million Palestinians to unspecified countries, presumably Muslim.
The Gaza genocide has really not been about Israeli hostages taken during the October 2023 atrocity. Ample evidence of this can be found in the conduct of presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, whose family members are crypto business partners with the Trump family. He has walked away twice, if not more times, from deals that could have secured the release or exchange of the remaining hostages in Hamas captivity. Meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians remain in Israeli captivity who are no more than hostages.

How long can Iran’s arsenal of reportedly 2,000 ballistic missiles last?

Despite this unconditional support to Israel, President Donald Trump so far seems unprepared to commit US forces in any open confrontation. Over the coming days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s efforts will be directed towards somehow sucking in the US to commit forces into the war with Iran.
After the Iranian missile retaliation against the Israeli air campaign, which killed several senior Iranian military commanders, leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and targeted nuclear sites, former Israeli prime minister and military chief Ehud Barak picked off some of these objectives one by one in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.
Ehud Barak was categorical in saying that Israel’s air campaign may have ‘delayed’ by a few weeks Iran’s acquisition of a nuclear weapon but, he said, even if the US joined the air campaign, it would delay it by no more than a few months at best. “They have 400 kilograms of 60 per cent enriched uranium and it can be enriched to 90pc in a garage with the right equipment and they will have a crude bomb,” he said.
Quoting the chief of the IAEA (the internati­o­nal nuclear watchdog), who said that many of Iran’s key facilities are “hundreds of yards” und­erground in old mines, etc, Mr Barak maintained these were “out of our reach”. “I have no illusions we’ll do anything more than damage or hurt them.”
The former IDF chief said the initial successes of the air campaign, which exceeded expectations, should be used to push through a nuclear deal with Iran, stop the war in Gaza, and go for peace in the wider region, including Saudi Arabia, which would take time and won’t be easy but still needs to be done.
He said going further for Israel without US logistics support will be difficult, so it should say ‘we have done all we could do, now it is up to you’. At a time when Israeli intelligence’s targeting of the Iranian military’s key leaders is being seen as a manifestation of internal divisions, Ehud Barak also addressed the issue of regime change.
Saying it did not appear possible without US ground troops on Iranian soil, he listed wars from Korea to Vietnam to Afghanistan that the US entered but was unable to win: “How did those wars go?” he asked, while doubting that President Trump, or any other US leader or the American public for that matter, would have the appetite to commit US boots to the ground.
It is true that in 2018, Trump unilaterally scuppered an Obama-led deal that stopped Iran’s nuclear weapons march in exchange for sanctions relief. But the scrapping pushed Tehran back to restarting its enrichment levels closer to weapons grade. So, in a sense, this war hasn’t been about Iran’s nuclear arms quest but more about getting it to bow to Israeli-US will.
Therefore, it is important to see who is eventually likely to get the upper hand in this conflict. With the US and entire Western production, stores and supplies of modern weaponry at its disposal, it would be safe to assume Israel can outlast Iran in a war of attrition. For all practical purposes, Iran has no air force, and its air defence system appears inadequate.
How long can its arsenal of reportedly 2,000 ballistic missiles last? What happens beyond that? These are some of the questions that need to be answered. So far, Iran has taken massive hits and yet has been able to remain defiant and retaliate. Can it sustain this in the medium to long term, and will there be any third-party mediation to stop the war?
Or, if cornered further, will Iran lash out dire­c­tly at US bases and assets in the region and even nations hosting them in order to expand the conflict as a means of stopping it? The impact of any such eventuality will not only be on millions of lives in the region but also on the global economy.

PBC Chief Executive Officer Ehsan Malik, in a letter to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, said the powers do not differentiate between major taxpayers and the informal sector.
“We are alarmed at the draconian powers proposed to be granted to the FBR. If past practice is anything to go by, these will most likely be misused to harass the formal taxpaying sector,” he feared.
“We are disappointed that the powers proposed for the FBR will do the exact opposite of encouraging investment,” Ehsan informed the finance minister.
Pointing out excessive powers to FBR, he said Section 11E enables tax assessment and recovery based on suspicion without proper investigation, while Section 14AE allows arbitrary seizure of business premises and property without adequate safeguards.
Section 32B empowers private auditors with quasi-legal authority over businesses, while Section 33 introduces 10-year prison terms and Rs10 million fines for broadly defined “tax fraud,” which is likely to encompass business errors.
Section 37AA authorises arrest without a warrant based on mere suspicion of tax fraud—a power that invites abuse and harassment, followed by Section 37B, which permits a 14-day detention of businesspersons, extendable through magistrates. Overriding the principle of client/advisor relationship, Section 58C will grant the FBR access to the offices of tax advisers and firms where discrepancies in returns are suspected.
He informed the finance minister that from a country on the brink of default less than three years ago, the current economic stability owes much to your determined leadership. The raging fire of inflation has been doused, borrowing costs have declined sharply, the fiscal deficit is in control, the current ac­­c­ount is in surplus, two IMF tranches have been appr­o­ved, and the rupee is stable.
A substantial contribution to securing the IMF programme, and the resultant solvency, is the formal sector’s disproportionate contribution to taxes in the FY25 budget.
The council, for FY26, sought and has so far been denied a roadmap of gradual reduction in taxes. The critical need to support exports amid significant uncertainty from US tariffs has not been addressed.

• Asad Qaiser says it is Pakistan’s moral duty to support Iran
ISLAMABAD: Minister for Defence Kha­waja Asif on Saturday cal­le­­d on the Organisation of Islamic Coope­ra­tion (OIC) to hold an emergency meeting to map out a joint strategy in the wake of Israel’s ongoing aggression, warning that if the Muslim Ummah does not unite, every Muslim country’s turn will come.
“The way Israel has targeted Yemen, Iran, and Palestine shows a larger game plan,” he said while speaking in the National Assembly.
The remarks came as another war in Middle East has sparked a global turmoil. The defence minister pointed out that most of the Muslim nations were already facing security risks.
“Strong leadership is needed now,” he remarked and described Israel’s brutal actions, particularly its military aggression against Iran as a serious threat to regional and global peace.
Regretting the apathy of the Muslim world over the aggression in Palestine where even children were being brutally killed, he said there were more protests in non-Muslim countries than in Muslim nations. He assured that Pakistan stands firmly with Iran and will continue to support it on all international fora.
The defence minister said that while Pakistan’s military strength was commendable, the economy must also be strong.
 






Tax evasion
Mr Asif said that the country suffers huge losses due to tax evasion, especially in sectors like tobacco, real estate, steel, and tyres. “We lose around Rs300 billion annually in tobacco taxes alone,” he said, acknowledging that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has made some improvements, but much more needs to be done.
“If we can just improve our tax collection by 50 per cent, we wouldn’t need foreign loans,” he noted.
He demanded accountability and urged the finance ministry and FBR to brief the parliament on the people behind large-scale tax evasion. “We need honesty in governance. Only then we can provide real relief to the people,” he said.
Jibe at PTI
The minister criticised those who now attack the government’s economic policy had once urged the IMF not to support Pakistan.
“These people tried to sabotage our economy,” he said. “Pakistan is not about any one person. It is a mission, a belief, and a shared history.”
He urged political leaders to rise above personal ambitions and serve the nation with sincerity.
‘Stand by Iran’
Former National Assembly speaker and PTI leader Asad Qaiser in his speech while referring to Israeli attack on Iran said, “It is our moral obligation to stand by Iran at this critical time.”
He also said that Israel has committed the worst atrocities against Palestinians, sparing neither children, women, the elderly, nor hospitals and schools. He regretted the criminal silence of international community, particularly from human rights organisations and so-called democratic states.
“Most disappointing, however, is the deafening silence of the Muslim Ummah,” he said and demanded that the government immediately launch diplomatic efforts to convene an emergency session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
Discussing financial ‘injustices’ with Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, he said, “After the Fata merger, the province’s NFC award share should have been increased from 14 per cent to 19pc, but there has been no substantial progress.
During his visit to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had claimed that an additional 1pc allocation was allocated for terrorism-affected areas.
 
 

However, the province’s agreed annual share of 4.84pc, amounting to Rs381bn, has yet to be released, Mr Qaider recalled.
Furthermore, the hydel profit amount due to the province has also been withheld.
“Is this all just because the people of KP voted for PTI,” he asked.
He said the current government has earmarked only Rs550m for the entire province’s Public Sector Develop­ment Programme (PSDP).
“We are demanding our constitutional rights, and if the situation remains unchanged, we will stage a sit-in on the motorway with our people.” he warned.
 






‘Discrepancy’
Expressing his views, PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar stated that there is a clear contradiction between the public statements made by the prime minister and cabinet members and the figures presented in the budget documents.
He said that while government officials insist that agriculture is the backbone of country’s economy, there is nothing for this vital sector, which ensures food security.
“Do you want to depend on imports to meet country’s food needs?” he questioned.
 






In her remarks, PPP leader Sharmila Farooqui questioned the powers being given to the FBR to arrest people without any notice.
She pointed out that external debts continue to pile up but over 100 entities had been given relief in taxes.

Additionally, some existing taxes have been eliminated or reduced, with export processing zones and special economic zones exempted from the services tax.
Addressing a post-budget press conference at the CM House, he announced the abolition of the entertainment tax and reductions in restaurant taxes.
He said that as per the Sindh Finance Bill 2025-26, the stamp duty on third-party vehicle insurance had also been reduced to Rs50 with a drop in the insurance tax from 15 to 5pc, adding that a list of tax-exempted items would be published as per the IMF requirement.
As per the finance bill, services of parliament and assembly members, local government representatives, judges, and tribunal members were exempted from sales tax.

Chief minister opposes Centre’s 18pc general sales tax on solar panels

Tax exemption on construction of 10,000 sq. feet of houses in private residential schemes and there would be no tax on health and life insurance worth Rs500,000.
The government-approved universities and colleges will also not have to pay tax on educational research, while Haj and Umrah travel operators will be exempt from tax.
According to the bill, a 19.5pc tax would be applied to vehicle trackers, security cameras, and alarm systems in security services.
The internet, telephone services, Wi-Fi and broadband connections service will have to pay 19.5pc tax, and there will be a three per cent tax on those who transact vehicles.
There will be 8pc tax on online payments of restaurants, hotels, farmhouses and beverages. Cab services will have to pay 5pc, rental car services and freight vehicles will have to pay 8pc tax.
As per the bill, 8pc tax will have to be paid on hiring armed guards and security guards.
There will be 8pc tax on real estate services and 3pc on foreign exchange services.
Coaching and training centres will also have to pay 3pc tax. Schools and colleges that receive an annual fee of Rs500,000 will also pay 3pc tax.
The chief minister in a wide-ranging post-budget press conference outlined an ambitious fiscal and development agenda for the province while addressing serious financial challenges and federal shortfalls.
Flays Centre for withholding funds
He criticised the federal government for failing to meet its financial commitments, revealing that Sindh was informed just one day before the budget presentation that Rs105bn in expected funds would be withheld. “Sindh has received Rs1,478.5bn from the divisible pool since last year, but Rs422.3bn remains outstanding,” he lamented.
Mr Shah expressed hope that the withheld amount would be disbursed by the end of June.
He said that the Sindh government would allocate Rs590bn for development projects this year, with a total budget of Rs3.45tr — Rs1tr for development and Rs2.15tr for current expenditures.
“Notably, Rs1.1tr is earmarked for salaries and pensions, leading to salary increases of 12pc for lower-grade employees and 10pc for higher grades.
He said that sectoral budget increases included an 18pc rise in education funding and an 11pc increase in health. Funding for agriculture, irrigation, and local government projects has also seen significant boosts.
Job vacancies
He also noted 20,000 to 25,000 job vacancies in Grades 1 to 4, with plans for recruitment via IBA-administered tests for Grades BPS-5 to 7 and filling higher Grade 16 positions.
On the critical Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, the chief minister expressed concern over the halving of federal funding from Rs30bn to Rs15bn.
Opposes tax on solar panels
Mr Shah emphasised that major projects are not included in the Federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) and criticised the 18pc tax on solar panels as unjust, warning that the Pakistan Peoples Party would not support the federal budget if concerns raise are not resolved.
Addressing various challenges, he acknowledged delays in operating 150 buses in Karachi due to resource constraints but highlighted ongoing infrastructure and sanitation projects.
On digitisation, Mr Shah admitted the Sindh government had not fully digitised land records yet, but was piloting a project in Matli and Sukkur.
Mr Shah revealed Rs25bn allocated for solar projects and the launch of afforestation programmes to combat climate change, admitting more needs to be done.

• Meagre allocations for Sukkur motorway and K-IV projects deplored
KARACHI: Trade and industry leaders on Saturday strongly criticised the federal and Sindh budgets for the upcoming fiscal year, calling them deeply disappointing and discriminatory towards Karachi, the country’s economic nerve centre.
Businessmen Group (BMG) Chairman Zubair Motiwala and Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Jawed Bilwani expressed serious concerns over the sheer neglect and denial of essential development funds to Karachi and the province of Sindh as a whole.
In a joint statement, they also demanded that before the approval of budgets, necessary amendments be made by significantly enhancing allocations for Karachi-centric development projects.
Highlighting the gross underfunding of the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, a strategic infrastructure project vital for the economic connectivity of Sindh and Karachi, they said despite the project’s total cost exceeding Rs400 billion, the federal government allocates a meagre Rs15bn for 2025-26, reflecting a blatant disregard for Sindh’s development priorities, especially considering that Karachi would directly benefit from the completion of this motorway.
The K-IV Water Supply Project has been in limbo for years despite being a critical lifeline for the water-scarce city of Karachi. Despite multiple promises made at the highest level, including by prime minister himself, the federal government has once again failed to demonstrate a commitment to the project, allocating only Rs3.2bn out of the total required Rs150bn, thus raising doubts about the government’s sincerity in addressing Karachi’s water crisis.
They stated that the Sindh government has failed to address Karachi’s needs adequately. In the provincial development outlay, the Sindh government has allocated a meagre Rs100 million for the K-IV project and a symbolic Rs15bn for the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, amounts that are practically meaningless in terms of project execution.
Alarmingly, this marks the third consecutive year in which not a single new mega development project has been announced for Karachi, they said, adding that the only gesture made was the allocation of Rs eight billion for the continuation of previously announced mega projects, most of which have been progressing at a snail’s pace.
Despite being a vital lifeline for Karachi, the K-IV project continues to face inexcusable delays, even as the city’s demand for water grows exponentially with each passing day.
Shockingly, millions of gallons of water are being wasted and discharged into the sea, while the people of Karachi and its industrial zones remain parched and desperate for a sustainable water supply, they deplored.
Appreciating the ongoing development of the new canal from Hub Dam, they noted that the project was initially scheduled for completion by August. With barely two months remaining, the government must accelerate work on a war footing to ensure its timely execution.
They further recalled that an additional supply of 10 MGD (million gallons per day) was promised for the SITE Industrial Area, and the relevant PC-I had already been approved — a move widely welcomed by the business community. However, the promised supply remains unfulfilled, leaving industries in a continued state of uncertainty.
They stressed that the continuous denial of fair development funding for Karachi is not just a regional injustice but a national threat, as Karachi contributes the largest share of 67pc revenue to the national exchequer, 90pc to the provincial kitty and 54pc in terms of exports.
They called on both the federal and provincial governments to urgently revise their priorities and ensure that Karachi receives its fair share of development funding. The time for symbolic allocations and broken promises has long passed. Concrete action, substantial funding, and political will are now required to address the growing frustration of the citizens and business community of Karachi.

According to the just released Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25, whatever spin you may want to give it, the economy is in a deep downturn given the collapse of the crop sector and the drastic decline in incomes in rural areas, where almost 60 per cent of the population lives and where extreme poverty is concentrated.
Severe decline in rural incomes and little success in increasing exports have led to poor growth in manufacturing. A combination of the two has slowed down the services sector, which now makes up nearly 60pc of our GDP.
 
 

The resulting overall economic growth is dismal at around 2.5pc, while we need a minimum growth of at least 6.5pc to absorb the increase in the labour force and reduce the prevalent high levels of poverty, which, according to a recent World Bank report, has risen dramatically, post-Covid, to near 50pc.
At the same time, there is no denying the fact that the economy has stabilised. There is no threat of default given our current reserves, a stable exchange rate (though it has come under pressure), a current account surplus (thanks to a surge in remittances), and inflation at an all-time low (it is expected hover around 5-6pc). For this, the government can take full credit — a fact recognised by the IMF and rating agencies.

Relief was hardly given to those who deserve it most.

So, is the price that we have had to pay for macroeconomic stability a drastic contraction of the real economy? While the stabilisation measures have indeed helped, I would strongly argue that the poor sequencing of these measures and economic reforms by our policymakers are chiefly to blame.
A prime example is the agricultural sector. The cold-blooded way in which the government removed the wheat support price shows the anti-rural, pro-urban bias of the current regime. Without first ensuring the development of an alternative market, it left the farmers — both small and large — to suffer huge losses at the hands of the middlemen.
Now let’s turn to what the future holds for the economy under IMF tutelage.
 
 

In his budget speech, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb emphatically stated that we have launched on a mission ‘to change the DNA of the economy from its currents inefficient uncompetitive path to one of high productivity and sustained economic growth’ — or words to that effect.
To put it more simply, he promised to implement economic reforms that will root out the current incentive structure, which breeds inefficiencies and inequalities and results in recurring stop-go cycles. We waited with bated breath to hear of the far-reaching reforms that are intended to usher in this process of creative destruction and the birth of a new economic order, but have been extremely disappointed.
Yes, some worn-out, positive steps were announced, which have been repeatedly tried before, with little success. This includes a tariff reform package — in the works since 1988 — with a maximum upper limit on import duties of 15pc in five years and four slabs. Significantly, there was no mention of a reduction in import duties on products of our most inefficient industries (for example, autos) to improve their competitiveness. This demonstrates a lack of reluctance to take on entrenched business interests.
The privatisation of the same old state-owned enterprises, such as PIA, the power distribution companies, etc, was promised. Hopefully, this time, the process will be successfully completed. A lot of faith was placed in the digital economy and increasing its export earnings (with ambitious targets), though concrete measures in this direction were difficult to discern.
 
 

Relief was given under strong pressure to the real estate sector and traders, despite high hopes to the contrary, and hardly any to those who deserve it most — the working poor. And technology and data were waved around to bring more tax evaders into the tax net as if these have never been available before. Agriculture income tax was left to the provinces.
Key issues related to investment in people (health, education, social protection) were rattled off, highlighting initiatives and projects by the prime minister, but the fact that we are cutting down on their already meagre share in the federal development programme, which itself has fallen to its lowest level in living memory to around 1pc of GDP, was not mentioned. Ultimately, this left us with roads and highways and infrastructure which would transform the economy.
And we had envisaged this budget in the shape of a reform package to change our DNA!

• FBR chief says tampered vehicles to be seized and destroyed
• IMF to review tax authority’s performance every week
• Average annual income of top 1pc households is Rs10m
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary panel on Saturday pressed senior tax officials to drop proposed provisions in the Finance Bill 2025 granting arrest and money laundering notice powers to tax commissioners, warning the move would create unnecessary obstacles for businesses.
The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandvi­walla, convened for a second consecutive day to examine the Finance Bill 2025. Lawmakers debated the implications of enhanced powers for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and discussed measures to curb tampered vehicles.
Senator Mandviwalla warned that there is a grave risk of misuse of the power to arrest or issue a notice. Even a junior FBR officer sending a notice could create chaos, he warned. He also emphasised that receiving a money laundering notice often leads to business shutdowns. “Such notices should require the express permission of the FBR chairman and the finance minister,” he said.
Senator Shibli Faraz also stressed that this extension of power to tax commissioners is turning Pakistan into a police state. “Even taxpayers will flee,” he warned.
Senator Farooq H. Naek underscored the imp­act of business bec­ause of the same, stating that money laundering notices are not trivial. “They can cripple a businessman’s ability to import or export,” Mr Naek warned the FBR.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb acknowledged the apprehensions of senators, stating that money laundering notices are indeed a very serious matter and should be reviewed carefully under this provision.
The Pakistan Business Council has also raised alarm, formally writing to the prime minister to urge the government to reconsider the plan to empower FBR officials with arrest and notice authority.
Meanwhile, FBR Cha­ir­man Rashid Mahmood Langrial defended the move, stressing that tax officials already possess the authority to arrest businesspersons, but the procedure has been further refined in the latest bill.
However, Senator Shibli Faraz strongly opposed the proposal to grant arrest powers to income tax commissioners, arguing that such mea­sures are turning the country into a police state.
Amendments to the Customs Act
The committee also examined proposed ame­­ndments to the Customs Act, 1969, including the rollout of a digital Cargo Tracking System (CTS) to monitor the movement of imports, exports, transhipments and transit cargo. The CTS aims to curb smuggling and ensure duty compliance while easing legitimate trade.
 
 

Another amendment would exempt postal or courier imports valued below Rs5,000 from duties and taxes. However, the de minimis limit for courier parcels is set to drop from Rs15,000 to Rs500 to prevent misuse by individuals.
The committee also approved strict measures against tampered vehicles. Under the proposed law, any vehicle found with a tampered chassis number, cut-and-weld modifications or re-stamped identification will be presumed smuggled, regardless of registration status.
The FBR chairman clarified that such vehicles will be confiscated and destroyed. “Such vehicles will not be auctioned again. In principle, these vehicles should be scrapped to prevent the resale of parts,” he said.
The committee recommended that the confiscation and destruction of such vehicles must occur within 30 days of seizure.
The Pakistan Poultry Association requested that customs duty on grandparent chicks be reduced to zero, while the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture sought a cut in duty on imported and reconditioned tractors from 15 to 5 per cent.
FBR chief briefing
Briefing the committee, Mr Langrial highlighted Pakistan’s stark wealth inequality, stating that just 5pc of the population controls most of the country’s wealth.
“Ninety-five per cent cannot afford to pay taxes,” he added, revealing that the top one per cent earn an average of Rs10 million per year.
The focus must shift from expanding the tax net to taxing the rich effectively, he emphasised. He added that only 6m people are registered tax filers, while 132m are under 18 or senior citizens — outside the labour force. At the same time, 67m are unemployed, including a large segment of educated women.
Mr Langrial confirmed that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked Pakistan to introduce new tax measures worth Rs701 billion for FY26. The FBR aims to generate Rs500bn through enforcement measures, although the Fund has adjusted this target to Rs389bn.
He said that tax collection from the sugar, cotton, and other sectors is being underreported. In the tobacco sector, strict monitoring will start from July 1 to track green tobacco leaf production, he said, adding, “We will fix cameras at identified places.”
The IMF will also conduct weekly reviews of the FBR’s performance. Mr Langrial claimed that improved enforcement had already led to significant tax collection gains.

Mr Dar was scheduled to travel to New York next week to attend a United Nations conference on Palestinian statehood. But on Friday, France and Saudi Arabia — co-sponsors of the event — requested the UN to postpone the gathering.
The request followed Israeli air strikes on Iran. Speaking in Paris, French President Emmanuel Mac­ron said the conference, which aimed to advance a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, had been delayed but would still take place.
“While we have to postpone this conference for logistical and security reasons, it will take place as soon as possible,” Presi­dent Macron said.
The changing situation in the Middle East has also delayed another planned visit — that of a trade delegation from Islamabad, which was to hold talks in Washington on tariffs.
 
 

At a news briefing last week, US President Donald Trump had anno­unced that the delegation would arrive “next week” for trade talks. Those plans are now on hold.
“But it will happen soon. We are working on the schedule,” a source told Dawn.

• Egypt blocks activists’ bid to march to Gaza border
CAIRO: Israeli firing and air strikes killed at least 45 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, many of them near an aid distribution site operated by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation on Saturday, local health authorities said.
Medics at Al-Awda and Al-Aqsa Hospitals in central Gaza areas, where most of the casualties were moved to, said at least 15 people were killed as they tried to approach the GHF aid distribution site near the Netzarim corridor.
The Israeli army said in a statement that an aircraft had opened fire on a person “to neutralise the threat” after he advanced towards troops and ignored warning shots fired near a group.
Last week, the army warned Palestinians not to approach routes leading to sites of the GHF between 6pm and 6am local time, describing these roads as closed military zones. The GHF said none of its distribution centres was opened on Saturday.
The GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May after Israel partially lifted a near three-month total blockade. Scores of Palestinians have been killed in near daily mass shootings trying to reach the food.
The United Nations rejects the Israeli-backed new distribution system as inadequate, dangerous, and a violation of humanitarian impartiality principles.
“None of our distribution sites were open today, and there were no incidents at our sites because they were closed,” the GHF said in a written response to Reuters about Saturday’s incident.
The Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday that at least 274 people have so far been killed, and more than 2,000 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations in Gaza.
Hamas, which denies Israeli charges that it steals aid, accused Israel of “employing hunger as a weapon of war and turning aid distribution sites into traps of mass deaths of innocent civilians.”
Health officials at Shifa Hospital in Gaza said Israeli fire killed at least 12 Palestinians, who gathered to wait for aid trucks along the coastal road north of the strip.
The Israeli military ordered residents of Khan Younis and the nearby towns of Abassan and Bani Suhaila in the southern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and head west towards a so-called humanitarian zone, saying it would forcefully work against “terror organisations” in the area.
March to Gaza border
Meanwhile, Egyptian authorities have blocked activists’ efforts to hold a march to the Gaza border to draw attention to Israel’s blockade of the war-torn Palestinian territory, organisers said Saturday.
Several dozen activists hoping to join the planned Global March to Gaza were stopped on the edge of Cairo as they attempted to reach the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya, the organisers said.
From there they had hoped to travel on by road to the North Sinai city of El-Arish, the starting point for their planned march to the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing on the Gaza border.
Most of the activists were ordered onto buses back to the capital after several hours of questioning, but some remained in custody on Saturday, the organisers said.
“We were blocked for six to seven hours before security forces violently dispersed our group,” one organiser said.
At least one activist was expelled from Egypt, several sources said, adding to dozens more denied entry or expelled in the run-up.
Egyptian authorities have not commented on the reported expulsions.
The foreign ministry had warned that while Egypt backs efforts to put “pressure on Israel” to lift its Gaza blockade, any foreign delegations intending to visit the border area must obtain prior permission.

The vessel, MV ASL ROSE arrived from Australia carrying 20,000 tonnes of diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser destined for Afghanistan.
Previously, the first ship under the Afghan Transit Trade, MV Beyond 2, berthed at Gwadar Port on Feb 4.
The current consignment was imported by Agven Private Limited, further highlighting Gwadar Port’s growing role as an emerging transit hub for Afghanistan.
This progress in Afghan transit trade became possible after the Economic Coordination Committee of Pakistan abolished the requirement for bank guarantees on Afghan trade — a policy aimed at facilitating smoother trade and strengthening economic ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Gwadar Port Chairman Shah Irfan Ahmed remarked that the successful berthing and swift unloading of MV ASL ROSE demonstrate that Gwadar Port is now fully equipped for modern and efficient commercial operations.
He emphasised that Gwadar’s expanding role in Afghan Transit Trade not only showcases the port’s capacity but also opens new avenues of economic opportunities for the entire region.
“We aim to establish Gwadar Port as a reliable trade corridor not just for Afghanistan but for Central Asia as well,” Mr Ahmed added.

Sachal Station House Officer Aurangzeb Khattak told Dawn.com that the body of a man in his mid-20s was recovered from bushes outside the wall of the society near Super Highway.
“The victim sustained injuries to his head,” he added.
Khattak highlighted the possibility that he might have been thrown there by suspects travelling in a car.
He also said that the body was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where his identity could not be ascertained immediately.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that although the victim was in the advanced stage of decomposition, there were head injuries.
“The cause of death was a head injury,” Dr Syed said, adding that samples had been collected.
Earlier this year, Mustafa Amir, a 23-year-old youth, was kidnapped and allegedly murdered by his friends in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA). According to the police, the youth’s friends stuffed his body in the trunk of his car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.
In Feb, police arrested Armaghan Qureshi, the prime suspect, for injuring officers while resisting his detention. His friend Sheraz aka Shavez Bukhari was remanded by an ATC.
Armaghan was sent to prison in March after he refused to record his confessional statement while a magistrate observed that the suspect was not in stable condition to record his confession.</p><small>2025-06-14 18:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14212344cf76eb4.jpg?r=222332' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917132/uzbekistan-airlines-flies-inaugural-pakistani-route-paa' target='_blank'><strong>Uzbekistan Airlines flies inaugural Pakistani route: PAA</strong></a><br><p>Uzbekistan Airlines on Saturday flew its inaugural Pakistani route from Islamabad to Tashkent, marking a key moment in connectivity between the two nations, a statement from the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said.
Uzbekistan announced earlier this year that air routes between Karachi, Samarkand and Bukhara would be launched, describing it as a significant step to foster closer ties between the two nations.
According to a PAA statement, the flight took off at 1:09pm with 126 passengers on board, with Zone 1 of Islamabad International Airport specially adorned with colourful balloons for the milestone.
“The event was graced by the esteemed ambassadors of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan,” the statement read, adding that the Chief Operating Officer of Islamabad Airport, the managing director of Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation and the Country Manager of Uzbekistan Airlines also attended.
“Guests warmly welcomed passengers at Stand 3 and a formal cake-cutting ceremony was held in the upper lounge area (A5) to commemorate the launch,” the statement added. “The entire event was seamlessly organised with the dedicated support and coordination of airport teams under the Pakistan Airports Authority.”
In February this year, Pakistan and Uzbekistan agreed to expand bilateral trade to $2 billion as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in Tashkent.
Addressing a joint press conference with PM Shehbaz, President Mirziyoyev said: “We came to the conclusions on different spheres and mutual trade turnover had exceeded $400 million, and we have plans to increase that to $2bn.”
He termed the negotiations between them “very fruitful”, adding that there was a “new direction” for future goals.</p><small>2025-06-14 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14200745d2c1101.jpg?r=200758' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917111/pakistan-stands-in-complete-solidarity-with-iran-amid-conflict-with-israel-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan stands in ‘complete solidarity’ with Iran amid conflict with Israel: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday expressed “complete solidarity” with Iran amid heavy exchanges of missiles and airstrikes between Tehran and arch-foe Israel, while former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said that Pakistan cannot afford the conflict in Iran turning into Iraq 2.0 or World War III.
There were reports of new Israeli strikes in Iran earlier today as Tel Aviv warned “Tehran will burn” after the Islamic Republic continued its barrage of overnight missiles in response to Israeli onslaught on its nuclear facilities that killed its top generals.
The missile exchange comes a day after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country’s UN envoy Amir Saeid Iravani.
According to PTV News, the PM spoke over the phone to Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian, informing him that Pakistan stands in complete solidarity with the “brotherly people of Iran against Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression”.
“He (the PM) strongly condemned the Israeli attacks against Iran, which are a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a complete violation of the UN Charter and international law,” the report read. The PM added that Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.
“The prime minister condemned Israel’s provocations and adventurism, calling them a serious threat to regional and global peace and stability,” PTV News reported. “He also strongly condemned Israel’s unabated acts of brutal genocide against the brave Palestinians.”
According to PTV News, PM Shehbaz urged the international community and the UN to take “immediate and credible steps” against Israeli aggression, stating that Pakistan is fully committed to promoting peace in the region.
Pezeshkian thanked the PM for Pakistan’s support, saying that this was a “reflection of the close and brotherly relations between the two countries”.
PTV News reported that Pezeshkian apprised PM Shehbaz of Iran’s perspective on the crisis with Israel and urged the international community, especially Islamic countries, to work together to confront these threats. The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact.
 






‘Cannot afford Iraq 2.0 or WWIII’: Bilawal
While addressing a press conference in Brussels, Bilawal said, “We certainly do not want a war on this border (with Iran). Pakistan has condemned the strikes that took place over the last couple of days on our neighbouring country.
“We will continue to advocate for peace on all our borders. Be it with Afghanistan, be it with Iran, be it with India. We absolutely cannot afford this conflict in Iran to turn into Iraq 2.0 or World War III.”
 






He said that it had become “far too easy to have a war every month” and added that war had become the “default setting” that “whenever there is a conflict or dispute, to launch into a full-scale war”.
Bilawal called on the international community to “immediately impose a ceasefire in this Iranian conflict with occupying forces in Palestine”.
“We cannot have perpetual war. It serves none of our interests,” he added.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India to the world and counter New Delhi’s unproven allegations. As part of its global outreach, the team has visited the United States, is currently in London, and will also head to Brussels.
The delegation comprises Ex-FMs Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
‘Pakistan will safeguard Iran’s interests’: Khawaja Asif
Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday said that Pakistan will “safeguard Iran’s interests” amid exchanges of missiles between Tehran and Israel, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
Condemning the Israeli attack on Pakistan’s “neighbour and fraternal country” during a session of parliament, the defence minister urged that a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) be convened to launch an initiative that “manifests the unity of [the] Muslim Ummah”.
“Pakistan stands firm on its traditional stance, as it has neither recognised Israel nor established relations with it,” Asif said. “Pakistan will safeguard Iran’s interests at all international fora, including the United Nations.”</p><small>2025-06-14 15:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14190846826f15d.jpg?r=191705' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917118/pm-shehbaz-calls-for-finalisation-of-electric-vehicles-policy-2025' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz calls for finalisation of Electric Vehicles Policy 2025</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday ordered that the National Electric Vehicles (NEV) Policy 2025 be finalised in consultation with all stakeholders and immediately presented before the federal cabinet.
The NEV policy incl­udes a subsidy of Rs50,000 for electric mot­orcycles and Rs200,000 for rickshaws, with a total subsidy allocation of Rs4 billion. In addition, the policy provides for subsidies and support to establish electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, such as charging stations.
The PM issued these orders while chairing a high-level meeting today to review and discuss the policy framework.
“[Pakistan needs] swift and priority-based measures to promote electric motorcycles, scooters, three-wheelers, cars, and buses,” PM Shehbaz emphasised.
He also underscored the importance of establishing charging infrastructure, including charging stations and battery swapping facilities, to support the expansion of the EV ecosystem.
“Relevant industries should be facilitated to enhance the local manufacturing capacity of electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers,” the PM added.
The meeting was attended by Federal Ministers Rana Tanveer Hussain, Ahmad Khan Cheema, Muhammad Aurangzeb, Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar, and other senior government officials.
Earlier this week, 57 manufacturers were granted licences to produce EVs, supported by fiscal incentives, tax exemptions, and reduced charging tariffs aligned with the government’s ‘Clean Green Pakistan’ and ‘Make in Pakistan’ initiatives.
Meanwhile, the Sindh government on June 11 decided to purchase more buses and allocate funds for EV taxis and scooters in the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26.
The decision was made in a meeting chaired by Minister for Transport and Mass Transit Sharjeel Inam Memon, where various projects, including the People’s Bus Service, EV scooters, and others, were reviewed and discussed.</p><small>2025-06-14 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14172215486e111.jpg?r=173601' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917114/south-africa-beat-australia-by-five-wickets-to-win-world-test-championship' target='_blank'><strong>South Africa beat Australia by five wickets to win World Test Championship</strong></a><br><p>South Africa won the World Test Championship on Saturday, completing a remarkable turnaround to beat Australia by five wickets as they successfully chased down an imposing 282-run target.
But it was an edgy finish as they took 27.4 overs to slowly score the 69 runs needed to secure success on the fourth day at Lord’s after resuming at 213-2 overnight.
In so doing, South Africa completed a successful pursuit of the joint second-highest winning fourth-innings total in test history at the London venue.
It was a first major cricket triumph for South Africa, who had earned an unwanted reputation for failure when on the cusp of victory over the last decades in limited overs competitions.
This was their first appearance in the WTC final, with opener Aiden Markram delivering a heroic innings of 136 to ensure success.
Markram, who reached his century late in the third day, added 34 more runs on Saturday, accumulating carefully before falling to a sharp catch by Travis Head with six runs needed to win.
Kyle Verreynne hit the winning run and was four not out at the end along with David Bedingham, who scored an unbeaten 21.
Nerves
“It was the most nervous I’ve ever been. I didn’t want to come out and bat, but when Aiden went out, I had to,” said Verreynne.
South Africa started the fourth day as favourites to win, but nervy, given a litany of past disasters, and would have been further on edge when captain Temba Bavuma was out in the third over of the morning.
A rising delivery from Australia skipper Pat Cummins took an edge and saw Bavuma depart, having added only one run to his overnight total of 65.
Australia made two unsuccessful reviews of not-out decisions as they sought a further breakthrough before Mitchell Starc clean bowled Tristan Stubbs for eight, with 41 runs still needed.
 
 

Markram and Bedingham then diligently put together a 35-run partnership to see them to the brink of success, before the win was secured in the last over before lunch.
South Africa, which came into the contest as underdogs, won the toss on the opening day and gambled by putting Australia into bat. But with Kagiso Rabada returning figures of 5-51, they were vindicated as the defending champions were dismissed for 212.
South Africa’s reply of 138 meant Australia had a 74-run lead, significantly increased after scoring 207 in their second innings, with their tail order recovering after they had slumped to 73-7.
But South Africa profited from a dramatic change in the pitch conditions, after 24 wickets fell on the first two days to patiently bat themselves to a landmark victory.</p><small>2025-06-14 12:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/140839113f67762.jpg?r=084036' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917045/pakistan-warns-unsc-of-grave-threat-to-world-peace-posed-by-israeli-strikes-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan warns UNSC of ‘grave threat to world peace’ posed by Israeli strikes on Iran</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities constitute a “grave danger and a serious threat” to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council during an emergency session convened on Friday, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Israel on Friday launched widescale strikes on Iran, claiming that it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military commanders. Iran’s ambassador told the UN that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were the beginning of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, Reuters reported. Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed, and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Six Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, Iranian state media reported.
In his remarks, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, strongly condemned the “unjustified and illegitimate” aggression by Israel against Iran, reaffirming that Islamabad stood in resolute solidarity with the Iranian government and people.
 






Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi requested the Security Council meeting, saying Israel “has now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished”.
Among those supporting the request for a meeting were Algeria, Pakistan, China and Russia.
Amid escalating tensions, the Pakistani envoy urged the Security Council to discharge its responsibility to uphold international law and stop this aggression immediately.
Ambassador Asim strongly called for the resolution of the crisis through dialogue and diplomacy
Briefing the Security Council, UN Under-Secretary-General for political affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, told ambassadors that the repercussions of the attacks were already reverberating.
“I reaffirm the Secretary-General’s condemnation of any military escalation in the Middle East,” she said, urging both Israel and Iran to exercise maximum restraint and “avoid at all costs a descent into deeper and wider regional conflict”.
She also noted that the military escalation came just as “some significant diplomatic developments” were unfolding, including the planned resumption of United States-Iranian talks in Oman at the weekend. Latest reports indicate that Iran will no longer attend.
DiCarlo urged parties to stay the diplomatic course.
“A peaceful resolution through negotiations remains the best means to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme,” she said.
“We must at all costs avoid a growing conflagration which would have enormous global consequences.”
Also briefing the Council, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi said his agency was in constant contact with the Iranian Nuclear Regulatory Authority to assess the status of affected facilities and determine broader impacts on nuclear safety and security.
He stressed that nuclear sites must never be targeted — under any circumstances.
“Such attacks have serious implications for nuclear security, nuclear safety and safeguards, as well as regional and international peace and security,” Grossi said.
He stands ready to travel to the region at the earliest opportunity, he added, to assess the situation and support safety, security and non-proliferation efforts in Iran.
“It is clear that the only sustainable path forward for Iran, for Israel, the entire region and the international community is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability and cooperation.”
Grossi concluded by offering the IAEA as a neutral platform where “facts prevail over rhetoric” and where technical engagement replace escalation.
“I reaffirm my personal and the agency’s readiness to facilitate dialogue and support efforts that promote transparency, security and the peaceful resolution of nuclear issues in Iran.”
Pakistan came out strongly in support of Iran’s right to self-defence, following Israeli military strikes on Iranian targets, distinguishing its position from most other regional and global powers.
The Pakistani position was more than a diplomatic footnote; rather a bold assertion of principle in a region accustomed to cautious ambiguity.
 






When the Foreign Office described Isr­­ael’s action as “unjustified and illegitim­a­­te aggression” that violated “the soverei­g­nty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran” and flouted the UN Charter, it did not stop at condemnation.
It explicitly mentioned Article 51: “Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.” The statement further urged the world to “hold the aggressor accountable for its actions.”
In a call with the Iranian foreign minister, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the blatant Israeli aggression and reiterated Islamabad’s strong support to Iran for the sake of peace in the region.
He also conveyed the deepest sympathies on the loss of many precious lives in Israeli attacks on Iranian territory.</p><small>2025-06-14 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14151153345f7bd.jpg?r=151620' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917107/delhi-launches-inspection-of-boeing-787s-after-air-india-crash' target='_blank'><strong>Delhi launches inspection of Boeing 787s after Air India crash</strong></a><br><p>India’s government is urgently inspecting all Boeing 787s after a devastating Air India crash that claimed at least 279 lives this week, the country’s aviation minister said on Saturday, adding that the authorities were investigating all possible causes.
The aviation regulator on Friday ordered Air India to conduct additional maintenance checks on its Boeing 787-8/9 aircraft equipped with GEnx engines, including assessments of certain take-off parameters, electronic engine control tests and engine fuel-related checks.
“We have also given the order to do the extended surveillance of the 787 planes. There are 34 in our Indian fleet,” aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu told a media briefing in New Delhi, without saying if the checks will apply to all Indian airlines.
“Eight have already been inspected and with immediate urgency, all of them are going to be done.” Air India operates 33 Boeing 787s, while rival airline IndiGo has one, according to data from Flightradar24.
The planes, however, have not been grounded, but a source on Friday told Reuters the Indian government was considering that as an option.
Naidu also said the government will look at all possible theories of what led to the crash.
Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash, including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down, Reuters has reported.
Forensic teams are still looking for the second black box as they probe why the plane lost height and crashed straight after takeoff.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Britain’s Gatwick Airport began losing height seconds after take-off on Thursday and erupted in a fireball as it hit buildings below, in what has been the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
At least 270 bodies have been recovered from the site of the plane crash, Dhaval Gameti, president of the Junior Doctors Association at B.J. Medical College, told reporters.
Only one of the 242 passengers and crew onboard survived while others were killed as the plane struck the medical college’s hostel as it came down.
The crisis has cast a shadow on Air India, which has for years struggled to rebuild its reputation and revamp its fleet after the Tata Group took over the airline from the Indian government in 2022. Tata’s chairman said on Friday the group wants to understand what happened, but “we don’t know right now”.
Dozens of anxious family members have been waiting outside an Ahmedabad hospital to collect bodies of loved ones killed in the crash, as doctors were working overtime to gather dental samples from the deceased to run identification checks and DNA profiling.
 
 

Rafiq Abdul Hafiz Memon, who lost four relatives in the incident, said he was not getting any answers from authorities and was “very hassled”.
“We have lost our children … we are not understanding anything. Please help us get information about our children. Tell us when they are going to release their bodies,” Memon said.
 

Rafiq Memon, a relative of Javed Ali Syed, who along with his wife and two children died after the Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plane bound for London’s Gatwick Airport crashed during take-off from Ahmedabad, talks to media outside the DNA sample collection room at a hospital in Ahmedabad, India June 14, 2025. — Reuters

Another father was upset about not being able to get the body of his son, Harshad Patel, saying he was told by authorities it would take 72 hours for DNA profiling. “The authorities are trying to help, but our patience is running out,” he said.
Most bodies in the crash were badly charred, and authorities are using dental samples to run identification checks.
Jaishankar Pillai, a forensic dentist, told reporters on Friday they had the dental records of 135 charred victims, which can then be matched through reference to victims’ prior dental charts, radiographs or other records.</p><small>2025-06-14 10:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14142148fb8681d.jpg?r=143556' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917102/no-casualties-as-rocket-fired-at-bajaur-house-of-pms-aide-mubarak-zeb' target='_blank'><strong>No casualties as rocket fired at Bajaur house of PM’s aide Mubarak Zeb</strong></a><br><p>The residence of Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Tribal Affairs MNA Mubarak Zeb’s residence in Bajaur was targeted with a rocket in the wee hours of Saturday, according to police.
Last month, an improvised explosive device (IED) had detonated outside the residence of MNA Zeb, partially damaging the house, police had said.
Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique, told Dawn.com that the rocket was fired at the residence of MNA Mubarak Zeb in Bajaur.
“However, it struck the MNA’s neighbour’s house, resulting in damage to the house walls and gate,” he added.
The MNA confirmed the attack in a post on X as well, adding that there were no casualties in the attack.
 






DPO Rafique added that there were no human casualties.
He said that miscreants had attacked the MNA’s house for the second time in the last two months.
He said that a search operation is underway in the area to track down the terrorists who launched the rocket at Zeb’s house.
Zeb was one of the PTI-backed independent candidates that the party decided to take action against after they voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, against their party stance.
Earlier in the week, a man was killed and two women were wounded after a mortar shell fired from Afghanistan’s side hit their house in the hilly area of Bajaur district’s Salarzai tehsil, police and residents said.
In April, four children were wounded when a mortar shell, fired from an undisclosed location, hit a house in the Lowi Mamund tehsil in Bajaur.
Also in April, eight people, including three security personnel and five residents, were injured after a roadside bomb targeted a vehicle of the Frontier Corps in the same district.</p><small>2025-06-14 09:35</small></div><hr>
