The indian premier arrived in occupied valley today to open a strategic railway line.
According to Indian news media outlets, Modi, during his visit, said that Pakistan attacked ’insaniyat’ and Kashmiriyat’ (humanity and the Kashmiri identity) in Pahalgam.
The Indian premier alleged that Pakistan was “also the enemy of poor’s bread and butter”.
He warned that anyone trying to derail the development in Indian-held Kashmir would have to “face Narendra Modi first”.
Responding to the Indian premier’s remarks, the foreign office today said: “Pakistan firmly rejects the baseless and misleading remarks made by the prime minister of India regarding the situation in Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
It added that such statements represented a “deliberate attempt to deflect international attention from the grave and persistent human rights violations being committed in a territory under foreign occupation.”
“We are deeply dismayed that the Indian prime minister has once again chosen to accuse Pakistan of involvement in the Pahalgam attack, without presenting a single piece of credible evidence,” FO said in its statement.
“Jammu and Kashmir remains an internationally recognised disputed territory, the final status of which is to be determined in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and the will of the Kashmiri people,” it said, adding that no amount of rhetoric could change the legal and historical reality.
“Claims of development in IOJK ring hollow against the backdrop of an unprecedented military presence, suppression of fundamental freedoms, arbitrary arrests, and a concerted effort to alter the region’s demography in violation of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention,” FO said.
FO called upon the international community, including the UN and human rights organisations, to hold India accountable for its oppression and to ensure that the “Kashmiri people are allowed to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, as enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.”
“Pakistan remains steadfast in its principled support for the people of Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for their rights and dignity,” FO said.
Modi’s visit follows a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
As New Delhi launched air strikes in early May, killing civilians, Pakistan downed five Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p><small>2025-06-06 16:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/06184135aba8a9b.jpg?r=184138' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915821/sindh-bans-four-seater-rickshaws-outsources-fitness-checks-in-traffic-law-overhaul' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh bans four-seater rickshaws, outsources fitness checks in traffic law overhaul</strong></a><br><p>In a bid to tighten traffic regulation enforcement, the Sindh government on Friday approved a set of legal changes, including a ban on four-seater rickshaws, mandatory third-party vehicle fitness checks, and sharp increases in traffic violation fines, as part of an overhaul aimed at improving road safety and accountability.
The decision comes as Karachi witnesses a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data. The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to ban heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates.
According to a statement from the home department, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar chaired the meeting to discuss necessary amendments to the Motor Vehicles Rules in light of the alarming increase in the number of accidents in the province.
Briefed by the secretaries of law and transport, as well as the inspector general of police and deputy inspector general of traffic police, the meeting “approved plans to outsource vehicle fitness certification to third parties and enforce a ban on four-seater rickshaws,” the statement said.
According to the statement, key decisions taken during the meeting included mandatory fitness certification for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, and outsourcing vehicle fitness evaluations to third parties.
Lanjar stated, “The services of third parties will be engaged for issuing fitness certificates, while formal memoranda of understanding (MoUs) will be signed with them in compliance with all applicable regulations.”
The meeting also decided to ban the sale of tinted windows, fancy lights, and sirens, whether online or at physical shops.
Participants unanimously approved legal amendments to enforce a complete ban on four-seater rickshaws, the statement said, adding that Excise Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla assured full support from the excise department in enforcing traffic regulations by ensuring that no registration or route permits will be issued for four-seater or larger rickshaws like Qingqi, as many accidents have taken place due to rickshaws colliding with trucks.
He further said that a crackdown will be launched against any such vehicles found operating on the roads.
While promising a prompt completion of the vehicle fitness service structure, he asserted that strict enforcement of fitness requirements would follow.
 
 

Chawla also made it mandatory for water tankers and dumpers to install trackers and sensors. It was decided that a comprehensive draft of the new regulations would be prepared and submitted to the Sindh government for approval and ratification.
Minister Lanjar added that to reduce traffic congestion, accidents, and rule violations, only 1x2 seater rickshaws would be allowed on the roads. Strict fines were also approved, including:

Rs200,000 for wrong-way driving by government vehicles,
Rs25,000 for motorcyclists driving against traffic,
Rs100,000 for four-wheelers violating one-way rules,
Rs25,000 for motorcyclists and PKR 50,000 for car drivers without a driving license,
Rs100,000 for first-time offences of one-wheeling or drifting, increasing to PKR 200,000 and PKR 300,000 for repeat offences.

Additionally, Lanjar approved the mandatory installation of at least five cameras in heavy/load-carrying vehicles.
It was decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines will not be allowed to be sold or transferred.
He further said that the traffic, transport, and excise systems would be interlinked and moved online, and announced the appointment of a dedicated traffic magistrate to handle traffic law offence cases, per the statement.</p><small>2025-06-06 16:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/06211001dee17af.jpg?r=211035' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915813/pakistan-condemns-israeli-airstrikes-in-lebanon-urges-intl-community-to-hold-tel-aviv-accountable' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan condemns Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, urges int’l community to hold Tel Aviv accountable</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Friday “unequivocally” condemned the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut and southern parts of Lebanon, urging the international community to hold Tel Aviv accountable and take immediate action against the offensive.
According to Al Jazeera, the attack on Thursday targeting Hezbollah marks the fourth time Israel has bombed Beirut after a ceasefire was signed in November 2024. The Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, in a statement after the strikes, voiced “firm condemnation of the Israeli aggression,” calling the attack — carried out on the eve of Eidul Azha — a “flagrant violation of an international accord.”
Israel and Hezbollah started trading fire on Oct 8, a day after Hamas attacked communities in southern Israel and sparked the Gaza offensive. Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, says its attacks aim to support Palestinians who are under Israeli bombardment in Gaza.
The Foreign Office, in a statement, extending solidarity to Lebanese people during “this difficult time” and highlighted that “the reckless use of force threatens civilian lives, fuels regional instability, and undermines efforts for lasting peace.”
The FO noted that the attack constituted a violation of the sovereignty of Lebanon as well as the ceasefire signed between Israel and Hezbollah.
“We urge the international community, particularly the United Nations and ceasefire mediators, to take immediate action to hold Israeli occupying forces accountable and prevent further escalation,” the statement read.
“Pakistan remains firmly committed to peace, justice, and the principles of international law.”
On Thursday, the prime minister of Lebanon, Nawaf Salam, announced that the Lebanese army had dismantled “more than 500 military positions and arms depots” belonging to Hezbollah in the south of the country.
“There can be no security or stability while Israel’s daily violations persist, parts of our land remain occupied, and our prisoners are not freed,” Salam added.</p><small>2025-06-06 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/06170534add9894.jpg?r=181203' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915820/presence-of-militant-groups-on-afghan-soil-poses-significant-challenge-to-regional-security-says-veteran-journalist' target='_blank'><strong>Presence of militant groups on Afghan soil poses significant challenge to regional security, says veteran journalist</strong></a><br><p>Veteran journalist and news director of the Associated Press for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Kathy Gannon on Friday said that the presence of various militant groups on Afghan soil posed a significant challenge to regional security.
Speaking at an event titled “Geopolitical Shifts and Security Challenges: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Regional Power Play” organised by the Institute of Regional Studies (IRS) in Islamabad, Gannon — who in 2014 was attacked and wounded while reporting from Afghanistan — said, “While Afghanistan might not want all the militant groups on its territory nor did Kabul invite them all, but they were still there.”
According to a press release, Gannon emphasised the importance of restoring trust between Pakistan and Afghanistan, appreciating the recent positive developments in relations between the two neighbours.  She said that “Pakistan could better influence the Afghan government by treating it as an equal and a partner in pursuing its regional objectives.”
“She also urged Islamabad to take steps against all terrorist groups through a concerted long-term strategy to address its internal security challenges,” the press release said.
Gannon maintained that Afghanistan was still relevant to the US policymakers “because of the increasing Chinese influence in the country as well as its mineral wealth”.
Pakistan’s former Special Representative for Afghanistan Ambassador Asif Durrani referred to Pakistan and Afghanistan as twin brothers who had come to each other’s help whenever needed notwithstanding the state of their relationship at the time.
“He hailed the upgradation of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan and the inclusion of Afghanistan in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as positive developments,” the press release said.
Durrani said that in the recent high-level trilateral meeting between Pakistan, Afghanistan, and China, the three countries had agreed to oppose terrorism, carry out law enforcement and security cooperation, remain vigilant against external interference in the internal affairs of regional countries, and safeguard regional peace and security.
He was of the view that there had been a decline in terrorist attacks in Pakistan since the positive development in diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the press release said.
“President IRS Ambassador Jauhar Saleem said that despite challenges, regional geopolitics and mutual interests had continually pushed both countries to engage and re-engage across various levels,” the press release said.
Saleem added that recent developments pointed toward a more constructive phase in bilateral engagement and expressed his hope that the trilateral dialogue among Pakistan, Afghanistan, and China most recently held in Beijing would strengthen regional cooperation on counterterrorism, stability, and economic integration.
“Aarish Khan, the Head of the Afghanistan Program at IRS, maintained that while the Taliban had not acceded to the demands of the international community on political inclusion, women’s education, and individual freedoms, they were still making good progress in improving diplomatic relations not only with important capitals like Beijing, Moscow, and Islamabad but also with the UN as was demonstrated by the Doha III talks last year,” the statement said.
Khan said that the Afghan interim government had taken concrete steps against the TTP in the recent past.
Ambassador Abrar Hussain, Pakistan’s former Ambassador to Afghanistan, also argued that Islamabad’s top priority in Afghanistan was to promote peace and stability notwithstanding whichever government was in power in the country.
Last month, Pakistan announced its elevation of diplomatic representation in Afghanistan from Charge d’Affaires to Ambassador level as bilateral ties “move on a positive trajectory.”
Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to upgrade their diplomatic relations by exchanging envoys — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.
Ties between the two neighbouring countries had turned sour due to frequent border skirmishes and Islamabad repeatedly demanding that Kabul take action against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan. Kabul has denied the allegations.
The recent understanding was reached during an informal trilateral meeting of foreign ministers from Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan in Beijing earlier this month. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in the Chinese capital.</p><small>2025-06-06 14:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/06190525f6d63fe.jpg?r=190529' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915600/fact-check-nacta-threat-alert-of-karachi-terror-attack-on-eidul-azha-is-fake' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Nacta threat alert of Karachi terror attack on Eidul Azha is fake</strong></a><br><p>Posts on social media platforms X and Facebook since Wednesday were sharing an alleged threat alert from the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) of a possible terror attack in Karachi during Eidul Azha. However, the threat alert is fake.
On Wednesday, a post on X by a user claimed that Nacta had issued a threat alert on the same date regarding a possible terrorist attack in Karachi during Eidul Azha.
The caption of the post said: “Intelligence warns of a potential terrorist attack in Karachi during Eidul Azha. Law enforcement on high alert. Citizens urged to stay vigilant and report anything suspicious.”
The same notification was circulated by other users as well as can be seen here, here, here and here.
It was also widely shared on Facebook, as seen here and here, and circulated in various WhatsApp groups.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim given its close proximity to the upcoming holiday and its potential to cause undue worry and panic in the public.
Analysing the document using multiple image analysis tools showed that Hive Moderation indicated a 98.6 per cent likelihood that the image was AI-generated, Decopy.ai reported a 61pc likelihood and Fake Image Detector concluded that the document was likely computer-generated or digitally altered.
 


Evaluating the text of the notification using Decopy.ai, a detection tool for AI-generated text, indicated a 31pc probability that the text was AI-generated.
 


A close examination of the alleged alert identified several discrepancies.
Notably, the word “Pakistan” at the top of the document is written with unnecessary spacing between “Pak” and “istan”. The phrase “In an emerged” is grammatically incorrect; it should be “It has emerged”. The word “unidetified” is a misspelling of “unidentified”. Additionally, the phrase “during Eidul Azha” is repeated.
In the first bullet point, “vitali” is written instead of “vital” and “vigllance” instead of “vigilance”.
In the second point, the word “ani” is written instead of “and”.
Towards the end of the document, the phrase “Alwan-e-Sadr” appears instead of the correct term “Aiwan-e-Sadr”. Furthermore, the names of several cities are misspelled in the alleged notification: “Islamnabad” instead of “Islamabad”, “Rawapidi” instead of “Rawalpindi” and “Paahawar” instead of “Peshawar”.
 


A keyword search for “National Counter Terrorism Authority”, “threat alert”, “Karachi” and “Eidul Azha” yielded no news reports from any credible news outlet covering the alleged alert.
Contacted for comment, Qadir Yar Tiwana, director general of media at the interior ministry, confirmed the alleged alert was fake.
The same was confirmed by a Nacta representative when contacted on the authority’s official landline number (051-9216574).
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that Nacta issued a terror alert for Karachi during Eidul Azha is false. The alleged alert is fake.

This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.</p><small>2025-06-06 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/06095726329ce72.png?r=095948' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915756/trump-not-interested-in-talking-to-musk-as-they-feud-over-tax-cut-bill-official' target='_blank'><strong>Trump ‘not interested in talking to Musk’ as they feud over tax-cut bill: official</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump is not interested in talking with his former ally Elon Musk, amid a bitter feud over the president’s sweeping tax-cut bill, a White House official said on Friday, adding that no phone call between the two men was planned for the day.
A separate White House official had said earlier that Trump and Musk were going to talk to each other on Friday.
Earlier, Donald Trump threatened to cut off government contracts to Elon Musk’s companies and the world’s richest man suggested the US president should be impeached, marking a stark end to an unlikely alliance and leaving onlookers wondering what was next.
The hostilities between the former allies intensified when the president criticised Tesla CEO Musk in the Oval Office and the pair then lobbed verbal barbs at each other on their social media platforms: Trump’s Truth Social and Musk’s X.
“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump posted.
In pre-market trading on Friday, shares in Musk’s Tesla rose as much as five per cent after the early news that the two men were scheduled to speak.
Tesla had closed down 14pc on Thursday, losing about $150 billion in market value in the largest single-day decline in value in the electric vehicle maker’s history.
The market capitalisation of Tesla Inc has fallen 29.3pc to $917bn so far this year, the biggest drop among big companies in the world.
Minutes after the closing bell, Musk replied, “Yes,” to a post on X saying Trump should be impeached, an unthinkable move in Congress where Trump’s Republicans hold majorities in both chambers.
 






The trouble between the two started brewing days ago, when Musk denounced Trump’s sweeping tax-cut and spending bill.
The president initially held his tongue while Musk campaigned to torpedo the bill, saying it would add too much to the nation’s $36.2 trillion in debt.
Trump broke his silence on Thursday, telling reporters he was “very disappointed” in Musk.
“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said.
As Trump spoke, Musk responded in real time on X.
“Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” wrote Musk, who spent nearly $300 million backing Trump and other Republicans in last year’s election.
In another post, Musk asserted that Trump’s signature tariffs would push the US into a recession later this year.
 






Musk’s businesses also include rocket company and government contractor SpaceX and its satellite unit Starlink.
Musk, whose space business plays a critical role in the US government’s space program, said that as a result of Trump’s threats he would begin decommissioning SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft. Dragon is the only US spacecraft capable of sending astronauts to the International Space Station. Late on Thursday, Musk backed off the threat.
And in a sign of a possible detente to come, Musk subsequently wrote: “You’re not wrong,” in response to billionaire investor Bill Ackman saying Trump and Musk should make peace.
 






Feud puts $22bn SpaceX contracts at risk, jolting US space programme
About $22 billion of SpaceX’s government contracts are at risk and multiple US space programmes could face dramatic changes in the fallout from Musk and Trump’s explosive feud.
Taking Trump’s threat to terminate Musk’s government contracts seriously, Musk said he would begin “decommissioning” SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft used by Nasa.
Hours later, however, Musk appeared to reverse course.
Responding to a follower on X urging him and Trump to “cool off and take a step back for a couple of days,” Musk wrote: “Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon.”
Still, Musk’s mere threat to abruptly pull its Dragon spacecraft out of service marked an unprecedented outburst from one of Nasa’s leading commercial partners.
Nasa press secretary Bethany Stevens declined to comment on SpaceX, but said: “We will continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the president’s objectives in space are met.”
Musk ‘very welcome’ in Europe: official
Separately, a spokesperson for the European Commission said today that Musk is “very welcome” in Europe.
At the commission’s daily briefing, spokesperson Paula Pinho was asked whether Musk had reached out to the European Union with a view to relocating his businesses, or setting up new ones.
“He’s very welcome,” she replied with a smile.
The commission’s spokesperson for tech matters, Thomas Regnier, followed up by stressing — straight-faced — that “everyone is very welcome indeed to start and to scale in the EU”.
“That is precisely the objective of Choose Europe,” he said, referencing an EU initiative in favour of start-ups and expanding businesses.
Punching back
Trump and Musk are both political fighters with a penchant for using social media to attack their perceived enemies, and many observers had predicted a falling out.
Musk had become one of Trump’s most visible advisers as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which mounted a sweeping and controversial effort to downsize the federal workforce and slash spending.
After leaving that role, Musk this week targeted what Trump has named his “big, beautiful bill”, calling it a “disgusting abomination” that would deepen the federal deficit.
His attacks amplified a rift within the Republican Party that could threaten the bill’s prospects in the Senate.
Nonpartisan analysts say Trump’s bill could add $2.4tr to $5tr to the nation’s $36.2tr in debt.
A prolonged feud between the pair could make it harder for Republicans to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections if it leads to a loss of Musk’s campaign spending or erodes support for Trump in Silicon Valley.
“Elon really was a significant portion of the ground game this last cycle,” said a Republican strategist with ties to Musk and the Trump administration who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
“If he sits out the midterms, that worries me.”
On Tuesday, Musk posted that “in November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.”
Musk had already said he planned to curtail his political spending in the future. Musk’s increasing focus on politics provoked widespread protests at Tesla sites, driving down sales while investors fretted that Musk’s attention was too divided.</p><small>2025-06-06 13:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/061647283438f07.jpg?r=170811' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915819/pm-shehbaz-performs-umrah-on-saudi-visit-offers-prayers-for-pakistans-success-against-india' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz performs Umrah on Saudi visit, offers prayers for Pakistan’s success against India</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, currently on a two-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, performed Umrah on the night of Thursday and Friday, offering prayers for the country’s success in Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos, the government said on its X account.
The delegation arrived in Saudi Arabia at the invitation of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman for a visit from June 5 to 6, according to a statement from the Foreign Office. The visit is focused on strengthening bilateral cooperation in key areas between both nations.  PM Shehbaz is also expected to thank the Saudi leadership for its constructive role in de-escalating the recent Pakistan-India conflict.
PM Shehbaz was accompanied by Army Chief Field Marshal General Asim Munir, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi, and Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar, who also performed the Umrah.
 






The gates of the Kaaba, the holiest site in Islam, were specially opened for the delegation, where they offered prayers for the prosperity of Pakistan and the Muslim community worldwide, particularly the Muslims in Gaza and India-occupied Kashmir. They also expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s success against last month’s Indian aggression and recent economic growth.
“This visit underscores the deep-rooted, time-tested ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, anchored in shared faith, mutual respect, and strategic partnership,” the FO said.
The statement further added: “It reaffirms the leadership’s commitment to deepening economic and diplomatic engagement, aligning with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 and Pakistan’s development priorities.
Prime Minister Sharif’s visit is expected to further solidify Pakistan-Saudi Arabia relations and open new avenues for multifaceted collaboration.“</p><small>2025-06-06 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/06181836cc6d7a4.jpg?r=181903' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915824/ukraine-war-existential-kremlin-says-launching-revenge-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine war ‘existential,’ Kremlin says, launching revenge strikes</strong></a><br><p>The Kremlin said on Friday that the Ukraine war was “existential” for Russia, after it launched a wave of retaliatory drone and missile strikes that killed at least three in Kyiv.
AFP journalists heard air raid sirens and explosions ring out over the capital throughout the night as Ukrainian air defence batteries intercepted waves of Russian drones and missiles.
Kyiv announced that Russia had fired 45 missiles and 407 drones in the barrage, after Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed retaliation for an audacious Ukrainian attack on several Russian airbases.
President Volodymyr Zelensky in response urged allies to “decisively” ramp up pressure on Russia to halt the war, which has left tens of thousands dead over more than three years of fighting.
“We heard a drone — we heard it coming very close, and then there was an explosion,” Ksenia, a Kyiv resident, told AFP outside a multiple-storey housing block that was left with a charred and gaping hole.
“Our windows and window panes were blown out, but we got away with a slight shock,” she added, standing in a courtyard littered with broken glass and debris.
The Kremlin on Friday cast its three-year invasion as nothing short of a battle for the “future” of Russia.
“For us it is an existential issue, an issue on our national interest, safety, on our future and the future of our children, of our country,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, responding to US President Donald Trump’s comparison of Moscow and Kyiv to brawling children.
‘Act decisively’
Zelensky said at least three people had been killed in the capital, and that Russia had targeted nine regions of Ukraine, including Lviv and Volyn in the west, which border EU and Nato member Poland.
“If someone does not put pressure and gives the war more time to take lives, they are complicit and responsible. We need to act decisively,” Zelensky wrote on social media.
Deadly attacks have escalated in recent weeks even as the two sides hold talks aimed at ending the conflict triggered by Russia’s February 2022 invasion.
Cities and villages have been destroyed across eastern Ukraine and millions forced to flee their homes, with Russia’s forces controlling around one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory.
Russian aerial assaults have become larger in recent weeks as concerns build over Ukraine’s strained air defence capacity.
The defence ministry in Moscow said its forces had launched the “massive” missile and drone strike in “response” to recent attacks by Kyiv on its territory.
Putin earlier this week told Trump that Moscow would retaliate over the Ukrainian attack on Sunday in which drones damaged nuclear-capable military planes at Russian air bases, including thousands of kilometres behind the front lines in Siberia.
The brazen operation, 18 months in the planning, saw Kyiv smuggle more than 100 small drones into Russia, park them near Russian air bases and unleash them in a coordinated attack.
Retaliation
Despite several recent rounds of meetings between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, Putin has repeatedly rejected a ceasefire, and has issued a host of sweeping demands on Ukraine if it wants to halt the fighting.
They include completely pulling troops out of four regions claimed by Russia, but which its army does not fully control, an end to western military support, and a ban on Ukraine joining Nato.
The overnight Russian attack left multiple fires burning in various districts of the capital.
Three first responders from the state emergency service were killed while dealing with an earlier strike, Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said.
“They were working under fire to help people,” he said, adding nine more were wounded and that “doctors are fighting for their lives.”
Kyiv’s mayor said earlier that four were killed in the capital but later revised down that toll.
Several strikes also hit the city of Lutsk and the Ternopil region in western Ukraine.
At least 49 people were wounded in total, Zelensky said.
Moscow meanwhile said Ukrainian strikes overnight on Russia wounded three people in the western Tula region, while Kyiv claimed to have staged successful attacks on two air fields deep inside Russian territory.
Footage shared on social media showed a large fire and smoke billowing into the air at an oil facility that serves a military site in Russia’s Saratov region, which has been frequently targeted.
The Russian defence ministry said it downed 174 Ukrainian drones overnight. Ten downed drones were headed for the Russian capital, according to Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin.</p><small>2025-06-06 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0611483558818a2.jpg?r=124406' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915803/pilgrims-stone-the-devil-as-haj-nears-end-in-saudi-arabia' target='_blank'><strong>Pilgrims ‘stone the devil’ as Haj nears end in Saudi Arabia</strong></a><br><p>Pilgrims on Friday were performing the last major ritual of the Haj — the stoning of the Jamarat, also known as the “stoning of the devil”, which symbolises the rejection of evil, as Muslims around the globe celebrated the beginning of Eidul Azha.
Pakistan will celebrate Eidul Azha tomorrow (Saturday).
Starting before daybreak, the more than 1.6 million pilgrims taking part in the Haj threw seven stones at each of three concrete walls symbolising the devil in the Mina valley, on the outskirts of the holy city of Makkah.
Droves of pilgrims had already set out from their camps and accommodations in the sprawling tent city in Mina before dawn, taking advantage of the shade and cool temperature.
The ritual commemorates Prophet Ibrahim’s stoning of the Jamarat at the three spots where Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God’s order to sacrifice his son.

“Our experience in Mina was easy and simple. We entered and within five minutes we had completed the stoning of the devil at the ‘Jamarat’,” said 34-year-old Wael Ahmed Abdel Kader, from Egypt, after carrying out the ritual at dawn.
Howakita, a pilgrim from Guinea, said the prospect of celebrating Eid in Makkah filled her with joy.
A day earlier, pilgrims converged on Mount Arafat, praying and reciting Quranic verses at the 70-metre rocky rise near Makkah, where Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) gave his last sermon.
Many climbed the mount despite the searing heat, though numbers had thinned by midday following official warnings for pilgrims to stay inside between 10am and 4pm (12pm and 6pm PKT)
This year’s Haj saw authorities implementing a range of heat mitigation efforts alongside a wide-ranging crackdown on illicit pilgrims — resulting in noticeably thinner crowds and a heavy security presence at holy sites in Makkah and surrounding areas.
The measures were aimed at preventing a fatal repeat of last year’s Haj that saw 1,301 people die in temperatures that hit 51.8 degrees Celsius.
Saudi authorities said a majority of those deaths were among pilgrims who illegally snuck into Makkah and lacked access to accommodation and other services aimed to keep pilgrims safe and protected from the searing desert heat.
This Haj season has recorded the lowest number of pilgrims in over three decades, barring the years of Covid restrictions from 2020-2022.
Last year, 1.8m pilgrims took part in the Haj, according to official figures.
Haj permits are allocated to countries on a quota basis and distributed to individuals by a lottery system. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
The Saudi King, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, in a message in Arabic, expressed gratitude at having the privilege to host Haj every year. He prayed to God for the acceptance of the holy ritual.
 






Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged the Pilgrims to keep the people of Gaza in their prayers. In a message posted on X, he wrote, “You blessed pilgrims, do not neglect the opportunity to pray and seek Almighty God’s help during the Hajj.”
Khaemeni called on the pilgrims to ask the Almighty “for victory over the Zionist oppressors and their supporters.”
 






Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide.</p><small>2025-06-06 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/06153754ebe54c6.jpg?r=153758' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915817/new-europe-push-to-curb-childrens-social-media-use' target='_blank'><strong>New Europe push to curb children’s social media use</strong></a><br><p>From dangerous diet tips to disinformation, cyberbullying to hate speech, the glut of online content harmful to children grows every day. But several European countries have had enough and now want to limit minors’ access to social media.
The European Union already has some of the world’s most stringent digital rules to rein in Big Tech, with multiple probes ongoing into how platforms protect children — or not.
There are now demands for the EU to go further as a rising body of evidence shows the negative effects of social media on children’s mental and physical health.
Backed by France and Spain, Greece has spearheaded a proposal for how the EU should limit children’s use of online platforms as fears mount over their addictive nature.
They were to discuss the plan on Friday with EU counterparts in Luxembourg.
The proposal includes setting an age of digital adulthood across the 27-country EU, meaning children will not be able to access social media without parental consent.
France, Greece and Denmark believe there should be a ban on social media for under-15s, while Spain has suggested a ban for under-16s.
Australia has banned social media for under-16s, which will enter into force later this year, while New Zealand and Norway are also considering a similar ban.
‘Better protect children’
France has led the way in cracking down on platforms, passing a 2023 law requiring them to obtain parental consent for users under the age of 15.
But the measure has not received the EU green light it needs to come into force.
France also gradually introduced requirements this year for all adult websites to have users confirm their age to prevent children accessing porn — with three major platforms going dark this week in anger over the move.
Also under pressure from the French government, TikTok on Sunday banned the “#SkinnyTok” hashtag, part of a trend promoting extreme thinness on the platform.
“We have an opportunity that should not be missed, and that’s what I also came to say to the European Commission today, age verification is possible,” French Digital Minister Clara Chappaz told reporters.
She pointed to work “in progress” in France for adult websites. “We want the same thing for social media.”
Chappaz added that although countries pushing the proposal were not aligned on the age for a ban, they all agreed on the need to enforce age verification properly.
The worry is that children as young as seven or eight can easily create an account on social media platforms despite a minimum age of 13, by giving a false date of birth, she said in Luxembourg.
Her Danish counterpart Caroline Stage Olsen emphasised that children should be as protected online as they are in the real world.
“We need to do something to make sure that they are better protected than they are today,” she added.
In-built age verification
France, Greece and Spain expressed concern about the algorithmic design of digital platforms increasing children’s exposure to addictive and harmful content — with the risk of worsening anxiety, depression and self-esteem issues.
The proposal also blames excessive screen time at a young age for hindering the development of minors’ critical and relationship skills.
They demand “an EU-wide application that supports parental control mechanisms, allows for proper age verification and limits the use of certain applications by minors”.
The goal would be for devices such as smartphones to have in-built age verification.
The European Commission, the EU’s digital watchdog, wants to launch an age-verification app next month, insisting it can be done without disclosing personal details.
The EU last month published draft guidelines for platforms to protect minors, to be finalised once a public consultation ends this month, including setting children’s accounts to private by default, and making it easier to block and mute users.
Those guidelines are non-binding, but the bloc is clamping down in other ways.
It is currently investigating Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, and TikTok under its mammoth content moderation law, the Digital Services Act (DSA), fearing the platforms are failing to do enough to prevent children accessing harmful content.
And last week, it launched an investigation into four pornographic platforms over suspicions they are failing to stop children accessing adult content.</p><small>2025-06-06 12:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/061528074268376.jpg?r=152828' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915816/china-seeks-improved-ties-with-canada-amid-rising-trade-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>China seeks improved ties with Canada amid rising trade tensions</strong></a><br><p>China called on Friday for steps to improve bilateral ties with Canada, saying there were no deepseated conflicts of interest, following a spike in trade tensions with many of Beijing’s Western trade partners this year.
China is willing to work with Canada to put ties on a healthy and stable path and find solutions to address each other’s concerns through enhanced dialogue, Premier Li Qiang told Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in a phone call on Friday, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.
“There is no fundamental conflict of interests between the two countries,” Li said.
Li’s talks with Carney followed a highly-anticipated phone call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, which Trump said led to “a very positive conclusion” and offered hope the trade war between the world’s two largest economies might start to de-escalate.
As the effects of trade frictions start to make their way into the already soft Chinese economy, Beijing has stepped up engagement with other countries to alleviate friction despite earlier retaliation.
In March, Beijing announced tariffs on over $2.6 billion worth of Canadian agricultural and food products in retaliation for Ottawa’s levies on Chinese electric vehicles and steel and aluminium products introduced in October.
Beijing has also launched an anti-dumping investigation into Canadian canola that is set to conclude in September.
Canola, also known as rapeseed, was one of Canada’s top exports to China, the world’s No. 1 agricultural importer, prior to Beijing’s investigation.
“The two governments should listen to and respond to the people’s calls and do more to deepen the friendly cooperation and enhance mutual understanding and trust,” Li told Carney.
 
 

China is Canada’s second-largest trading partner, trailing far behind the United States. Canada exported $47 billion worth of goods to the world’s second-largest economy in 2024, according to Chinese customs data.
Beijing is also willing to work with Canada to safeguard multilateralism and free trade, Li added.
 
 

Beijing’s olive branch to Ottawa also comes ahead of a Group of Seven summit of leaders in Canada in mid-June.
At the G7 summit in Italy last year, G7 leaders were critical of China, saying they would take steps to shield their economies from China’s “ unfair “ practices.</p><small>2025-06-06 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0614301149d6299.jpg?r=143024' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915812/ex-federal-minister-abbas-afridi-succumbs-to-burn-injuries-sustained-in-gas-leak-explosion' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-federal minister Abbas Afridi succumbs to burn injuries sustained in gas leak explosion</strong></a><br><p>Former federal minister and Senator Abbas Afridi on Friday succumbed to burn injuries sustained in a gas leak explosion a day earlier, while three others were wounded.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi told Dawn.com that their team had rushed Afridi and three others to Kohat Combined Military Hospital, from where Afridi was taken to a burn centre in Kharian, Punjab, in a helicopter.
Nouman Ali, spokesperson for the Kohat police, told Dawn.com, “Afridi was in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries in the hospital. His body was brought to Kohat today.”
He said the three others had been transported to a divisional headquarters hospital.
The police spokesperson said Afridi and his friends, Dilnawaz, Javed Afridi and Nadeem, were in the Hujra when a gas leak caused an explosion. The intensity of the blast damaged the walls of the Hujra.
Afridi’s funeral will be held today at 5pm at Babri Banda, Kohat.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi expressed deep sorrow and grief over Afridi’s death.
He expressed his heartfelt sympathy to the deceased’s father Senator Shamim Afridi, the deceased’s brother, who is provincial information secretary of the People’s Party, Amjad Afridi and other relatives, saying: “We all share the same grief with them in this hour of grief.”
Kundi directed higher authorities to investigate the nature of the explosion after receiving information about the blast, and that a transparent inquiry be conducted.
Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani and Deputy Chairman  Zahid Khan also expressed grief over the demise of Afridi, calling him a “sociable and sincere person.”

Modi is launching a string of projects worth billions of dollars for the occupied Muslim-majority territory.
 
 

India and Pakistan fought an intense four-day conflict last month over an attack in Occupied Kashmir’s Pehalgam, with New Delhi blaming Islamabad without evidence. This was the two countries’ worst standoff since 1999, before a ceasefire was agreed on May 10.
His office broadcast images of Modi at a viewing point for the Chenab Bridge, a 1,315-metre-long (4,314-foot-long) steel and concrete span that connects two mountains with an arch 359 metres above the river below.
“In addition to being an extraordinary feat of architecture, the Chenab Rail Bridge will improve connectivity,” the Hindu nationalist leader said in a social media post ahead of his visit.
 






Modi strode across the bridge waving a giant Indian flag to formally declare it open for rail traffic soon after his arrival.
New Delhi calls the Chenab span the “world’s highest railway arch bridge”. While several road and pipeline bridges are higher, Guinness World Records confirmed that Chenab trumps the previous highest railway bridge, the Najiehe in China.
The new 272-kilometre (169-mile) Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla railway, with 36 tunnels and 943 bridges, has been constructed “aiming to transform regional mobility and driving socio-economic integration”, Modi’s office says.
The bridge will facilitate the movement of people and goods, as well as troops, that was previously possible only via treacherous mountain roads and by air.
The railway “ensures all weather connectivity” and will “boost spiritual tourism and create livelihood opportunities”, Modi said.
The railway line is expected to halve the travel time between the town of Katra in the Hindu-majority Jammu region and Srinagar, the main city in Muslim-majority held Kashmir, to around three hours.
More than 70 people were killed in missile, drone and artillery fire during last month’s conflict.
Fighters in Indian-held Kashmir have waged a 35-year-long insurgency demanding independence for the territory or its merger with Pakistan.</p><small>2025-06-06 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05161706f2766eb.png?r=161723' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915597/noor-mukadam-got-justice-but-why-does-pakistans-legal-system-fail-its-women' target='_blank'><strong>Noor Mukadam got justice, but why does Pakistan’s legal system fail its women?</strong></a><br><p>“It’s brought me some closure,” said Shafaq Zaidi, a school friend of Noor Mukadam, reacting to the Supreme Court’s May 20 verdict upholding both the life sentence and death penalty for Noor’s killer, Zahir Jaffer.
“Nothing can bring Noor back, but this decision offers a sense of justice — not just for her, but for every woman in Pakistan who’s been told her life doesn’t matter,” Zaidi told Inter Press Service (IPS) over the phone from Islamabad. “It’s been a long and painful journey — four years of fighting through the sessions court, high court, and finally, the Supreme Court.”
Echoing a similar sentiment, rights activist Zohra Yusuf said, “It’s satisfying that the SC upheld the verdict,” but added that the crime’s brutality left little room for relief. “It was so horrific that one can’t even celebrate the judgment,” she said, referring to the “extreme” sadism Noor endured — tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and beheaded with a sharp weapon on July 20, 2021.
Yusuf also pointed out that the “background” of those involved is what drew national attention.
Noor Mukadam, 27, was the daughter of a former ambassador, while Zahir Jaffer, 30, was a dual Pakistan-US national from a wealthy and influential family. Her father and friends fought to keep the case in the public eye, refusing to let it fade into yet another forgotten statistic.
Still, the response has been muted — many, including Yusuf, oppose the death penalty.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) recorded at least 174 death sentences in 2024 — a sharp rise from 102 in 2023 — yet not a single execution was reportedly carried out. The last known hanging was in 2019, when Imran Ali was executed for the rape and murder of six-year-old Zainab Ansari.
However, Noor’s father, Shaukat Ali Mukadam, has repeatedly stated that the death sentence for Zahir Jaffer was “very necessary,” emphasising, “This isn’t just about my daughter — it’s about all of Pakistan’s daughters,” referencing the countless acts of violence against women that go unpunished every day.
The HRCP’s 2024 annual report painted a grim picture of gender-based violence against women in Pakistan.
According to the National Police Bureau (NPB), at least 405 women were killed in so-called honour crimes. Domestic violence remained widespread, resulting in 1,641 murders and over 3,385 reports of physical assault within households.
Sexual violence showed no sign of slowing. Police records documented 4,175 reported rapes, 733 gang rapes, 24 cases of custodial sexual assault, and 117 incidents of incest-related abuse — a chilling reminder of the dangers women face in both public and private spaces. HRCP’s media monitoring also revealed that at least 13 transgender individuals experienced sexual violence — one was even killed by her family in the name of honor.
The digital space offered no refuge either. The Digital Rights Foundation (DRF) recorded 3,121 cases of cyber-harassment, most reported by women in Punjab.

Justice remains elusive
But numbers alone can’t capture the brutality — or the deep-rooted disregard for women that drives it.
“We recently took a man to court and secured maintenance for twin baby girls,” said Haya Zahid, CEO of the Karachi-based Legal Aid Society (LAS). “The father divorced their young mother while she was still in the hospital — just because she gave birth to daughters.”
LAS offers free legal aid to those who can’t afford it, handling cases like rape, murder, acid attacks, forced and child marriages, and domestic violence.
Bassam Dhari, also from LAS, recalled Daya Bheel’s gruesome murder, which took place after Noor Mukadam’s but failed to stir national attention because it happened in a remote village in Sindh’s Sanghar district.
“She was skinned, her eyeballs removed, her breasts chopped off, and her head severed from her body,” said Dhari.
He said the postmortem report confirmed that she was neither raped nor sexually assaulted, and the attack did not appear to be driven by rage or revenge.
While Mukadam’s family may have found closure, justice remains elusive for thousands of Pakistani women.
“Noor Mukadam’s case is indeed a rare instance where justice was served,” said Syeda Bushra, another lawyer at the LAS.
“It’s not that there aren’t enough laws to protect women and children — far from it,” said Bushra. “There are plenty of laws, but what good are they if investigations are weak?” According to her, only a small percentage of women can seek redress. “Justice is denied or delayed every single day,” she added.
“The problem is that these laws are crafted in a social vacuum,” observed Fauzia Yazdani, a gender and governance expert with over 30 years of experience working with national governments, the United Nations (UN), and bilateral development partners in Pakistan.
She acknowledged that although many progressive, women-friendly laws have been passed over the years, they’ve failed to resonate in a society resistant to change. “Laws are essential, but no amount of legislation can end violence against women if the societal mindset remains misogynistic, patriarchal, and permissive of such crimes,” she said.
Buying justice through blood money
At the same time, Dahri highlighted critical flaws in the justice system.
In Pakistan, where the death penalty remains legal under its Islamic status, such sentences can be overturned through the diyat (blood money) law, which allows perpetrators to buy forgiveness by compensating the victim’s family.
“In our country, money can buy anything,” said Dahri. “This blood money law is routinely abused by the rich and powerful to literally get away with murder.”
He stressed the urgent need to reform these laws. “Many families initially refuse compensation, but intense pressure and threats — especially against the poor — often force them to give in.”
In 2023, 10-year-old Fatima Furiro’s death might have gone unnoticed if two graphic videos—showing her writhing in pain, then collapsing — hadn’t gone viral. The resulting public outcry led to her body being exhumed. Her employer, a powerful feudal lord in Sindh’s Khairpur district, who appeared in the footage, was swiftly arrested.
He spent a year in prison before the case was closed, after Fatima’s impoverished family accepted blood money — despite forensic evidence confirming she had been raped, beaten, and tortured over time.

Law vs prejudice
Alongside a flawed justice system, women must battle deep-rooted social taboos — amplified by relentless victim-blaming and shaming.
“In such an environment,” said Bushra, “it’s no surprise that many women, worn down by the long and exhausting process, eventually withdraw their complaints.”
“A woman’s trial begins long before she ever enters a courtroom,” said Dahri.
In Noor Mukadam’s case, the claim of a “live-in relationship” — real or fabricated — was used by the convict’s lawyer to downgrade his death sentence for rape to life imprisonment.
“Her reputation was sullied — even in death,” said Yazdani, adding that judges should refrain from moralising and preaching.
“A judge’s verdict should rest solely on an impartial reading of the law,” said Bushra.
But as Dahri pointed out, few lawyers in Pakistan dare to say this openly. “Judges can take it personally,” he said, “and we risk facing repercussions in our very next case.”
According to Yazdani, even a few targeted reforms — like faster hearings, clearing case backlogs, setting up gender-based violence (GBV) and child protection courts, and training judges, lawyers, and police on the realities of misogyny and gender-based violence — could cut victim-blaming in half.
But she also offered a word of caution: reforms alone don’t guarantee empathy, which she called the cornerstone of real justice.
“Social change doesn’t happen overnight,” Yazdani said. “Anthropologically speaking, it takes five years for change to take root — and another ten for it to truly take hold.”
Gender balance matters in justice
Judicial gender inequality worsens the situation. Some experts argue that increasing the number of women judges and lawyers could lead to a more fair, dynamic, and empathetic justice system.
A 2024 report by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) reveals that women make up less than 20 per cent of the country’s judges, lawyers, and judicial officers — an alarming gap in a nation of over 117 million women. Of the 126 judges in the superior judiciary, only seven are women — just 5.5pc. In the Supreme Court, that number drops to two.
Meanwhile, the 26 judges of the apex court (including the chief justice) are burdened with a backlog of more than 56,000 cases — not all related to violence against women.
Bushra believes more women must be encouraged to enter the justice sector — particularly as prosecutors, police officers, and judges. “I’ve seen how distressed victims become when forced to repeat their ordeal to male officers — often multiple times,” she said.
But she emphasised that simply increasing the number of women won’t end victim-blaming or guarantee survivor-centric justice. “Everyone in the system — including women — must be genuinely gender-sensitised to overcome personal biases and deep-rooted stereotypes,” said Bushra.
Special courts
In 2021, the government passed the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, leading to the formation of an anti-rape committee by the Ministry of Law and Justice to support victims, including setting up special courts nationwide. “Special investigation units with trained prosecutors now handle 77pc of complaints, and 91pc of cases go to special courts,” said Nida Aly of AGHS, a Lahore-based law firm offering free legal aid and part of the committee.
By 2022, Sindh had set up 382 such units. Aly noted that a survivor-centered, time-bound, and coordinated approach raised conviction rates from 3.5pc to 5pc. A national sex offenders registry, managed by police, was launched in 2024. In Punjab, all 36 districts now have crisis and protection centers offering legal and psychosocial support, though some face resource limitations.
Nearly five years after gender-based violence courts were established in Karachi, she sees a promising shift in how judges handle such cases. “Prosecutors now take time to prepare women complainants — something that never happened before,” she said.
However, she added, the number of such courts and sensitised judges remains a drop in the ocean compared to the overwhelming number of violence committed against women and such cases flooding the system across Sindh.

• Inmates tell court they temporarily left jail premises due to chaos caused by earthquake, returned once situation normalised
KARACHI: As many as 115 prisoners escaped from District Jail Malir have been rearrested and booked in a terrorism case along with remaining fugitives, a police officer informed an anti-terrorism court on Thursday.
Officials said that the Shah Latif Town police station registered a case pertaining to the jailbreak and escape of 216 inmates under different sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act on the complaint of prison official Zulfiqar Ali Peerzada.
On Thursday, the investigating officer of the case produced 115 prisoners recaptured following the jailbreak before the administrative judge of the ATCs at the judicial complex inside the central prison.
He informed the court that 115 fugitives were apprehended outside the prison and sought their physical remand for 14 days to arrest remaining 101 inmates.
However, the court sent the recaptured the undertrial prisoners (UTPs) to prison on judicial remand as it did not find any reason to hand over the custody to the police.
“Firstly that the accused persons are already UTPs in other cases, secondly no specific or individualised role has been attributed to each of the accused person, thirdly no fresh recoveries or evidence are shown to be dependent upon custodial interrogation.
“It is further noticed as it is seem that IO has brought this matter so haphazardly as nor he brought proper jail record duly signed by the concerned jail authorities showing all UTPs as listed in this FIR and surprisingly he initially submitted the record of one hundred eighteen (118) arrested UTPs but then altered with his own pen the number as one hundred fifteen (115) UTPs, whereas memo of arrest showing one hundred eighteen (118) arrested UTPs and IO also altered too one hundred fifteen (115) UTPs,” the judge stated in the order.
 
 

It added that the IO failed to produce the case diaries, witnesses, recovered case property, and the medical record of the injured police official.
The court observed that the IO’s claim appeared to be unconvincing that such a large number of UTPs were arrested outside the prison after the jailbreak.
When the court inquired from the detained UTPs about the circumstances of their arrest, they unanimously stated that they did not escape.
According to them, during the earthquake, the roof of the jail collapsed and a wall was partially damaged. In the chaos that ensued, they sought help from the jail authorities, who themselves were attempting to reach a safe location.
The inmates further informed the court that they had exited the premises temporarily but returned once the situation normalised. They alleged that the jail police later falsely showed them arrested.
The court observed that these statements created ambiguity, casting doubt over the alleged offence.
The court directed the IO to submit a report under Section 173 of the criminal procedure code along with all relevant record and proper list of arrested UTPs and their role on or before July 1.

• Provinces, AJK and GB stand with Centre on water security
• PM heads to Saudi Arabia for two-day visit on MBS’ invitation
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday condemned India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), describing it as a “blatant violation and act of water aggression”, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.
Chairing a high-level meeting on water resources at the Prime Minister’s House prior to departing for a two-day official visit to Saudi Arabia, the premier vowed that Pakistan would prevail on the water front just as it had recently “achieved victory in war”.
The high-level meeting brought together Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, federal ministers, chief ministers of all four provinces, the prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), the chief minister of Gilgit-Baltistan, and senior federal and provincial officials.
 
 

“This is a battle of justice, and like every battle we have fought with unity, we will defeat India’s water aggression with resolve and wisdom,” the prime minister said. He emphasised that living nations confront challenges head-on and make strategic, lasting decisions to protect their future generations.
PM Shehbaz said the Indian threats to weaponise water by at­tempting to violate the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty are increasing with each passing day. He highlighted that the treaty, a binding international agreement, does not allow any party to unilaterally withdraw, and India’s claims are politically and legally hollow.
All provincial chief ministers, along with the leadership of AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan, strongly condemned India’s water threats and unanimously reaffirmed their support for the federal government’s position. The premier lauded this united stance, calling it a “reflection of our collective national resolve to protect Pakistan’s water security”.
Emphasising the urgency of enhancing water storage, PM Shehbaz ordered the establishment of a high-powered committee under Mr Dar to oversee funding strategies for new dam projects. The committee will include all provincial chief ministers, the AJK prime minister, and relevant federal ministers, and is directed to submit its recommendations within 72 hours.
“We will prioritise the construction of non-controversial reservoirs. Wherever there is unanimity, we must act without delay. These dams are not political; they are a national necessity,” the prime minister said. He made it clear that any project with cross-provincial consensus will be fast-tracked and completed on a priority basis.
A detailed briefing was given during the meeting on Pakistan’s water infrastructure. Officials informed the participants that construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam is underway and expected to be completed by 2032, while the Mohmand Dam is likely to be completed by 2027.
Currently, Pakistan has 11 dams with a total storage capacity of 15.32 million acre-feet. Under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), 32 small and large dams are under construction, while 79 projects are underway under annual development programmes.
PM Shehbaz also pointed to the serious problem of silting in existing reservoirs like Tarbela and Mangla, which has drastically reduced their water retention capacities. He said bold decisions must be taken now, warning that history would judge today’s leadership by the steps it takes.
“We owe it to our 240 million people to act decisively. This is not about politics; it’s about survival. The future generations must remember this leadership with respect for the choices we make today,” he said.
PM Shehbaz also congratulated the finance minister, economic affairs minister and relevant secretaries for securing loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank despite strong Indian lobbying.
PM arrives in Saudi Arabia
Later, Prime Minister Shehbaz arrived in Jeddah on Thursday on a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia on the invitation of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince and Prime Minister Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.
On his arrival, PM Shehbaz was received by Jeddah Governor Prince Saud bin Abdullah Jalawi, Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador in Pakistan Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Malkiy, Pakistan’s Ambassador in Saudi Arabia Ahmed Farooq and high-level diplomatic officials.
The prime minister and his team are scheduled to spend Eidul Azha in the Kingdom and hold talks with the Saudi leadership on Eid Day.
During the meeting, the two sides will discuss strengthening bilateral cooperation in key areas, including trade and investment, the welfare of the Muslim Ummah and regional peace and security.

On radar screens, dozens of Indian Air Force (IAF) fighters began clustering to the north, maneuvering with unmistakable intent.
Within minutes, Pakistan’s skies were alive with scrambling fighter jets — including the most recently inducted J-10C aircraft, flown by one of its most storied units: No. 15 Squadron, the “Cobras.”
Nearly a month later, the PAF formally acknowledged what many had speculated — that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down six Indian Air Force (IAF) jets during what’s now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagement in South Asia in more than half a century.

Pilots from Kamra-based No. 15 Squadron expected to be decorated at a formal ceremony later this month

Eighteen of the squadron’s 20 J-10C aircraft took part in the mission, executing a high-risk intercept against a large-scale Indian formation as part of Pakistan’s defensive response.
In a post released by the PAF’s media directorate, the Cobras were hailed for their legacy and professionalism: “From heroic air battles in the 1965 war, where Flt Lt Imtiaz Bhatti downed two Indian Vampires, to Cold War-era vigilance during the Soviet-Afghan War, the squadron has always remained combat-ready… Now equipped with J-10C 4.5+ generation fighters, the Cobras continue to embody precision, courage, and aerial dominance.”
The May 7 confrontation — triggered by India’s launch of Operation Sindoor following a deadly attack in Pahalgam — saw more than 120 aircraft take to the skies from both sides.
 
 

According to the Pakistani military’s official account, the six Indian aircraft downed included three Rafales, a MiG-29, a Mirage-2000, and a Su-30MKI — all hit by PL-15 BVR missiles fired from PAF J-10C fighters. Each launch was executed by pilots from the 15 Squadron, who are expected to be publicly named and decorated at a formal ceremony later this month.
A senior PAF official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, confirmed: “The pilots involved in the operation will be honoured soon. These are some of the finest aviators in our ranks — and their performance speaks for itself”.
The engagement, insiders say, was the result of a calculated bait-and-counter strategy. With credible intelligence of an impending Indian incursion, the PAF deployed four defensive counter-air formations and monitored over 60 Indian aircraft using its electromagnetic spectrum management systems.
“We fought the battle on our terms,” the official added. “Our kill chain was fully ac­­tive. When the command shifted, while aircraft were airborne, from ‘Deter’ to ‘As­­sure Kill, Deny Own Loss,’ the Cobras carried out their mission with precision and control.”
Among the targets prioritised were the Rafales — the pride of the IAF since their induction in 2019. “The Indians expected the Rafales to be game chan-gers,” the official said. “So we made them our first target.”
The Indian response was initially evasive. On May 11, IAF Director General of Air Operations, Air Marshal A.K. Bharti, downplayed the situation, merely stating that “losses are a part of combat” and insisting all pilots had returned safely.
But the facade cracked during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on May 31, when India’s Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Anil Chauhan, was compelled to admit the losses, attributing them to “tactical errors.”
The admission triggered a storm of criticism back home. In a bid to contain the fallout, Gen Chauhan resorted to baffling cricket metaphors to explain away the embarrassment.
History of the Cobras
The No. 15 Squadron is no stranger to high-stakes operations. Established in 1956, the unit claimed Pakistan’s first confirmed aerial kill in 1959. It played a pivotal role in the 1965 and 1971 wars and later took on patrol and interdiction duties along the Durand Line during the Soviet-Afghan conflict.
Prior to the latest aerial engagement, the squadron participated in the 2019 Operation Swift Retort - Pakistan’s measured response to India’s Balakot airstrike. In that mission, two Mirage-VPAs from the Cobras conducted precision strikes using H-4 SOW glide bombs on open terrain adjacent to the Narian Army Base in the Rajouri Sector of Indian-Occupied Kashmir.
Following that mission, the Cobras underwent a significant transformation. In 2022, they became the first PAF squadron to transition from aging Mirage aircraft to the more advanced Chinese-built Chengdu J-10C multirole fighters. The older Mirages were reassigned to the newly established No. 50 Squadron, while the Cobras’ elevation to J-10C operators marked their formal recognition as Pakistan’s frontline aerial strike unit.
The induction of the J-10C — equipped with AESA radar, advanced datalinks, and BVR capabilities - dramatically expanded the squadron’s operational envelope, allowing it to perform both air superiority and precision strike roles across a wide spectrum of missions.
Adding to the unit’s prestige is the fact that the current Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu is a former commander of No. 15 Squadron. On the night of May 7, it was Sidhu himself who was directing combat operations from the PAF’s nerve centre in Islamabad, personally monitoring every move.
“The Cobras are our sharpest fang,” one official said. “They’ve defended this nation in every war. May 7 was no exception — only this time, the stakes were even higher.”
Back at their base in Kamra, the mood is one of pride tempered by professionalism. The PAF’s official statement ended with a sober affirmation: “Throughout its distinguished history, No. 15 Squadron has demonstrated unwavering operational resilience and tactical excellence.”

The finding, based on a survey conducted in 2018-19, comes in the wake of an update of global poverty lines made by the bank, and not because of any change in underlying economic conditions across the world.
The proportion of people living in extreme poverty has risen from 4.9pc to 16.5pc, according to the report.
The latest findings come in the wake of World Bank’s update of global poverty lines and not because of any change in the underlying economic conditions across the world.

Poverty assessments revised to reflect changes in cost of living and consumption habits

“For Pakistan, the poverty rate based on the new $3 international poverty line (IPL) under 2021 purchasing power parity (PPP) is 16.5Pc, compared to 4.9pc under the previous $2.15 line (2017 PPP),” said the World Bank.
About 82pc of this increase is due to the higher value of the new IPL, reflecting increases in the national poverty lines of comparator countries, with the rest explained by price increases in Pakistan between 2017 and 2021 reflected in the updated PPPs, it added.
“The poverty rate under the $4.20 IPL line rose from 39.8pc to 44.7pc” in Pakistan, the bank said. It added that the new IPL affected the level of poverty only, but trends in poverty remain unchanged.
Old definition
Under the World Bank’s old definition of $2.15 per capita threshold for low income countries (LICs), 4.9pc of Pakistan’s population was considered living in extreme poverty. The percentage has now surged to 16.5 with the new threshold of $3 per day under the same 2018-19 survey. Pakistan has not conducted household income survey since then.
Measured by $4.2 per capita income for lower middle income countries (LMICs), the poverty rate in Pakistan has increased to 44.7pc from 39.8pc estimated earlier at $3.65 per day, explained Christine Wieser, a World Bank poverty expert, at a news conference here.
She said Pakistan’s poverty and resilience assessment (PERA), currently in progress, would provide the latest update on actual poverty situation on the ground and explore drivers and dimensions of trends in poverty and welfare over the past 20 years.
The findings, due in September this year, would also have special deep dives on spatial disparities and fiscal equity.
Ms Wieser said the poverty rate in Pakistan was up 88.4pc, based on $8.30 a day — the poverty line meant for upper middle income countries (UMICs).
Earlier, 84.5pc Pakistanis fell in this category at the old threshold of $6.85 a day.
 
 

The bank changed its global poverty lines to reflect changes in the cost of living and consumption habits of people around the world, based on newly available data. The new poverty lines are $3 per person per day for low income countries, $4.2 for lower-middle-income countries, and $8.3 for upper-middle-income countries.
These lines are based on 2021 purchasing power parity rates, as well as updated national poverty lines.
In reply to a question whether this meant policy formulations were misplaced, Ms Wieser said countries used their own national poverty lines and surveys to monitor the evolution of poverty and guide anti-poverty policies and investments.
Significant shift
Pakistan is among the countries experiencing the largest changes in poverty when transitioning to the 2021 PPPs based on the Low-Income International Poverty Line. This significant shift in poverty rates under the LIC line, compared to the LMIC and Upper-Middle-Income Country (UMIC) lines, is due to a concentration of households with welfare levels between $PPP2.15 and $PPP3, which is near the International Poverty Line.
The revision in global poverty lines “does not suggest that poverty in Pakistan has worsened as living standards of the population have not changed to what was previously reported”, Ms Wieser said.
The change in international poverty rates merely reflected a higher threshold for being “non-poor”, based on improved consumption measurement across low-income countries; changes to LMIC and UMIC lines, where data is of a relatively high quality, may reflect an increase in the value of poverty lines as countries become richer.
However, because national poverty lines differ widely, the resulting poverty rates are not comparable internationally.
International Poverty Line
To enable cross-country comparisons, the World Bank introduced the “$1-a-day” International Poverty Line (IPL) in 1990. This benchmark was based on the average national poverty lines of the world’s 15 poorest countries at the time, adjusted using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates to account for differences in the cost of living.
 
 

It was revised to $1.25 per day in 2005, $1.90 in 2011, and $2.15 in 2017. The most recent update, using 2021 PPPs, sets the low-income country (LIC) IPL at $3 a day — a 40pc increase.
Sixty per cent of the increase in IPL is due to higher national poverty lines, while 40pc is due to a rise in prices between 2017 and 2021. Moreover, the lower-middle income (LMIC) IPL is set at $4.2 per day (from $3.65), an increase of roughly 15pc. The upper middle income line is set at $8.3 per day (from $6.85) — an increase of roughly 20pc, in 2021 PPPs.

Maori Party co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer were banished from parliament for 21 days, the longest-ever suspension. Fellow Maori Party lawmaker Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, New Zealand’s youngest current MP, was suspended for seven days.
The bans stem from a haka performed during voting in November on the contentious Treaty Principles Bill, which sought to redefine the principles of a key pact between Maori and the government. Waititi held up a noose as he rose to speak in defiance of the ban on Thursday. “In my maiden speech, I talked about one of our (ancestors) who was hung in the gallows of Mt Eden Prison, wrongfully accused,” Waititi said.
“The silencing of us today is a reminder of the silencing of our ancestors of the past, and it continues to happen. “Now you’ve traded the noose for legislation. Well, we will not be silenced.” Although performed on many different occasions, haka are often used as a kind of ceremonial war dance or challenge to authority.
New Zealand’s foreign affairs minister Winston Peters earlier mocked Waititi for his traditional full-face Maori tattoo. “The Maori Party are a bunch of extremists, and middle New Zealand and the Maori world has had enough of them,” said Peters, who is also Maori.

As the government prepares to announce the federal budget, the HRCP has urged that wages must reflect the principle that “full-time workers should be able to live with security, health and hope.”
In its latest report titled ‘From Survival to Dignity: The Case for a Living Wage’, the HRCP argues for the implementation of a living wage rather than a minimum wage. It noted that millions of workers across the country earn far below the living wage threshold, which forces them to make impossible choices between feeding their families and paying for essentials like electricity and medicine.
“The implementation of a living wage can be justified on many grou­n­­ds,” the report said. “From a human rights perspective, a living wage becomes a fundamental right to ensure that workers not only meet their basic needs but are also able to live a life of dignity. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides the basis for a living wage for every worker.”

Says workers deserve dignity, not just survival

It added, “Similarly, and most importantly, it allows us to address several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the UN. For instance, implementing a living wage will directly contribute to the first two goals — no poverty and zero hunger and the advancement of decent work.”
Further, the UN Global Compact, a corporate sustainability initiative in which more than 100 companies from Pakistan participate, “encourages companies to promote and provide a living wage as an essential aspect of decent work.”
A living wage is also about the dignity of individuals and their families while outlining employers’ responsibilities to their employees.
According to the UNDP’s Human Development Index (HDI), Pakistan’s HDI value is 0.540, which classifies it as a country with low human development.
With an HDI rank of 164 out of 193 countries, Pakistan is only better than Afghanistan and Nepal in the region. Both Afghanistan and Nepal saw years of violence, which is not the case for Pakistan. Almost 40 per cent of Pakistanis live below the poverty line.
“Years of neoliberal policies and reforms have made it difficult for governments to pursue policies that favour job creation. Free market reforms in trade and finance have adversely affected domestic industry and agriculture in developing countries,” the report said.
“Moreover, people’s purchasing power in Pakistan has decreased significantly because of high inflation and slow economic growth. This, coupled with a high population growth rate and vulnerability to climate change, has left the successive governments in Pakistan ill-prepared to provide jobs to a growing number of young people,” it added.
The HRCP stressed that government action to bridge the gap between the current minimum wage and an actual living wage would be a significant step towards poverty alleviation and long-term social equity.

• Ex-US diplomat endorses call for neutral Pahalgam probe, regrets Pak-US ties ‘still stuck in the past’
• VP Vance meets Indian delegation as US officials assure Pakistan of ‘equal representation’
WASHINGTON: As fomer foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari blamed India for pushing South Asia towards the first nuclear war over water, a former US ambassador to Pakistan endorsed Islamabad’s demand for an independent inquiry into the Pahalgam incident, which led to a full-blown conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi.
At a policy forum hosted by the Middle East Institute (MEI) in Washington, former US ambassador to Islamabad Anne Patterson stressed that the United States-Pakistan relationship was hindered by mistrust, despite ongoing security cooperation.
“The US-Pakistan relationship is so stuck in the past that India was not required to present any forensic or investigative evidence after the Pahal­gam attack,” Ms Patterson said.
“It (India) had simply said that Pakistan was still engaged in terrorism. And international observers, I hate to say, tended to believe this claim.”
She added, “This incident almost led to a nuclear war, and it’s critically important to get to the bottom of what happened. An independent investigation, possibly by agencies like the FBI or Scotland Yard, should be the first step.”
Mr Bhutto-Zardari highlighted Pakistan’s core concerns: terrorism, Kashmir, and the ongoing water dispute with India. “Water wars used to be a theory. India shutting off Pakistan’s water supply is laying the foundation for the first nuclear water war,” he said, referring to repeated violations of the Indus Waters Treaty.
“We have said that cutting off our water supply will be an act of war. We don’t say it in a jingoistic manner… It’s an existential crisis for us. Any country would fight for its survival and for its water,” he added, urging global powers to take a firm position against what he described as Indian aggression.
Balancing act
Delegations from both countries are in Washington this week, engaging with US officials, who are trying to strike a delicate diplomatic balance.
The Pakistani delegation includes Senator Sherry Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt, and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
The Indian delegation is led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and includes Shambhavi Chaudhary (Lok Janshakti Party), Sarfaraz Ahmed (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), G. M. Harish Balayogi (Telugu Desam Party), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejaswi Surya, and Bhubaneswar Kalita (all from the BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), former Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, and Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora.
The Indian delegation met US Vice President JD Vance on Thursday, taking advantage of his links to India.
Michael Kugelman, a US scholar of South Asian affairs based in Washington, described the visits as “a high-octane diplomatic effort on both sides meant to secure buy-in from Washington on key positions at a high-stakes moment for both Islamabad and New Delhi”.
He noted that India’s approach is “especially striking” as New Delhi typically avoids internationalising its bilateral disputes.
Mr Kugelman explained: “India’s position is that Pakistan isn’t sufficiently acting against terror. … For Pakistan, it’s about getting Washington to view New Delhi in ways that it tends not to: as untrustworthy and as an aggressor. In effect, each side is trying to not only advance its narratives but also change perceptions in Washington.”
He added: “Here, New Delhi has an advantage as Washington, on bipartisan levels, tends to sympathise more with Indian than Pakistani positions. And that includes most importantly not wading into the Kashmir issue.”
Other scholars, however, urged the United States to manage engagements with both sides carefully and equitably.
Hassan Abbas, another scholar associated with the National Defence University in Washington, noted that Pakistan had “already done a lot to fight terrorism” and was paying the price for it. “Now, Pakistan needs US appreciation and cooperation in dealing with the terrorists. Intelligence-sharing platforms need to be revived.”
Both delegations are also lobbying for their countries on Capitol Hill, meeting senior US lawmakers and chairs of various Congress committees.
The Pakistani delegation met the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and other congressmen and senators. “They told us they are ensuring equal representation for both,” said a Pakistani diplomatic source.
The Indian delegation met members of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, including senators Dave McCormick, Jacky Rosen, Jim Risch, Mark Warner, John Cornyn, and Elissa Slotkin.

The advisory issued by the National Computer Emergency Response Team (PKCERT) highlighted risks like disinformation, fraud, harassment, invasion of privacy and data breach.
The PKCERT flagged the increase in cyber incidents affecting children, including exposure to explicit content and online grooming.
Women are “frequently targeted” with cyber harassment, identity theft and image-based abuse, risks that are “compounded by broader societal inequities”.
The advisory cautioned that many social media posts are “deliberately designed to provoke strong emotions—such as anger, fear, or shock—prompting users to react or share them quickly without giving the content much thought”.
It added that social media platforms use algorithms to display content that triggers intense emotional reactions. “This approach keeps users engaged for longer periods, even if the information is not always accurate or beneficial.”
To counter these risks, the advisory suggested strong, unique passwords with multi-factor authentication. Social media users should not share their real-time location and regularly update the apps.
To counter propaganda, users must cross-check information mentioned in social media posts and remain “sceptical of viral trends”.

According to the advisory, a high-pressure weather system is likely to develop over the country on June 7 and is expected to grip most parts from June 8.
Under the influence of these meteorological conditions, daytime temperatures are likely to remain 5 to 7 degrees Celsius above normal in central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan from June 7 to 12.
In upper and central Sindh, southern Punjab and parts of Balochistan, daytime temperatures are likely to remain 04 to 06°C above normal from June 7 to 12.

Advisory urges citizens to avoid exposure to direct sunlight

Dust storms and gusty winds are also expected over the plains due to excessive heat.
“Rising temperatures in northern areas may enhance snow-melting rate during the forecast period,” the advisory stated.
The PMD has advised citizens, especially children, women and older people, to take precautionary measures — avoid exposure to direct sunlight during the daytime and stay hydrated.
Farmers have been advised to manage their crop activities as per the forecast.
The PMD has warned the authorities to remain alert and take necessary measures to avoid any mishap due to severe heatwave conditions.
The heatwave advisory was issued a day after PMD officials informed a high-level meeting that temperatures were already above normal in Gilgit-Baltis­tan and were forecast to remain so in the days ahead, resulting in above-normal snowmelt.
The annual flood preparation meeting of the federal and provincial governments on Wednesday was told that there could be higher and repeated chances of glacial lake outburst flood during the monsoon season.
Rainfall was also projected to be higher than normal across the country, particularly in the northern parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, GB, Potohar and parts of KP.
There could be an increased frequency of all-weather events, including severe thunderstorms and hailstorms.
An official statement issued after the meeting said the PMD has “forecasted normal to slightly above-normal rainfall across central and southern Pakistan from July to September”.
Meanwhile, excess rainfall was also expected in northeastern Punjab and Kashmir, while northern KP and GB may experience “normal to below-normal rainfall”.
Ill-prepared healthcare system
Last month, the National Institute of Health (NIH) issued a heatstroke advisory and urged public and private sector hospitals to make arrangements.
The country is experiencing severe climate changes due to global warming, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality due to heat stroke, the NIH added.
It called for immediate measures to prevent and treat heat-related illnesses.
The World Health Organisation has highlighted the impact of climate change on human health, including increased frequency and severity of heatwaves.
Pakistan has experienced severe heat waves in recent years, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.
The country’s healthcare system faces challenges in responding to these events, particularly in rural and underserved areas, said the NIH.

Addressing pilgrims gathered for the pinnacle of Haj, Dr Humaid emphasised the profound spiritual and unifying significance of the Day of Arafah and urged Muslims around the world to uphold the true essence of Islam through faith, humility, and sincere devotion to Allah.
“Oh Allah, take care of our brothers and sisters in Palestine. Feed the hungry among them, shelter the displaced. Grant security to the fearful and protect them from their enemies,” he prayed.
During the high point of the pilgrimage, Muslims prayed on Mount Arafat as authorities urged them to avoid the hottest hours of the day.

Over 1.6m brave extreme heat to perform pilgrimage

Thousands of white-robed pilgrims recited verses from the Holy Quran from dawn on the 70-metre rocky rise near Makkah.
But numbers thinned by midday following official warnings for pilgrims to stay inside between 10am and 4pm.
“I came here early to (avoid) the sun and later I will pray inside my tent,” said 54-year-old Adel Ismail, from Syria.
 
 

Saudi authorities have taken several steps to reduce the risk from heat at the Haj, which has drawn more than 1.6 million pilgrims to one of the world’s hottest regions, according to fresh figures published on Thursday.
Barring a few years of Covid restrictions from 2020-2022, this Haj season has recorded the lowest number of pilgrims in over three decades.
On Thursday, icepacks were handed to people walking towards Mount Arafat, with some placing the small bags on their heads.
With temperatures reaching 42C, officials ushered people away if they spent too long in one place near the bouldered hill, which had fans spraying mist and cool air at its foot.
Towards Muzdalifah
Later in the afternoon, pilgrims began making their way to Muzdalifah, halfway between Arafat and the sprawling tent city of Mina, where they will gather pebbles for Friday’s symbolic “stoning of the devil”.
Despite the heat, they were generally delighted to be performing the Haj. “I don’t think about the sun or the temperature or anything like that,” said Ahmed, a 44-year-old from Egypt.
“Because standing in Arafat is a great thing and a beautiful day, and as you can see, all the pilgrims” are doing it.
Ali, 33, from Pakistan, said he felt blessed to take part.
“This is something that I used to see every year on the TV screen during Haj and I always thought: ‘I wish I could be here’,” he said.

In a statement issued here on Thursday, the Uzbek embassy in Islamabad said that operating every Saturday, the new route underscored the shared commitment of Uzbekistan and Pakistan to strengthen their long-standing partnership and deepen cooperation across multiple sectors. This direct link marked a strategic advancement in bilateral relations and aligned with the broader goals of the Central and South Asia connectivity initiative.
In addition to the new Islamabad route, Uzbekistan Airways currently operates biweekly direct flights to Lahore on Wednesdays and Fridays. These connections were helping expand the airline’s regional footprint, linking Pakistan’s major cities not only with Uzbekistan, but also with the wider Central Asian region and beyond.
“Together, these routes support cross-border mobility, business travel, educational exchange, and cultural cooperation,” the embassy said.
The embassy said that beyond its commercial significance, the Tashkent-Islamabad route was poised to enhance people-to-people ties by enabling smoother, more direct travel for students, pilgrims, tourists, academics, and official delegations.
The direct link was also expected to boost tourism in both directions. For Pakistani travelers, Uzbekistan’s famed Silk Road cities - Samarkand, Bukhara, and Khiva - were now more accessible than ever. Likewise, Uzbek visitors could now more easily explore Pakistan’s rich landscapes.
The statement said that tourist flows between the two nations had seen steady growth in recent years, driven by shared historical ties, cultural affinity, and religious heritage. The new air service offered a convenient and reliable option for a growing number of visitors, students, and pilgrims seeking meaningful cross-border experiences.
“This air route is a cornerstone of the Central and South Asia Connectivity Initiative, first proposed by the President of Uzbekistan in 2021. It is part of a broader strategic push to transform a landlocked region into a land-linked hub. The Tashkent-Islamabad flight complements major regional infrastructure initiatives such as the Trans-Afghan Railway and supports broader cooperation in transport, logistics, infrastructure, energy, and digitalization,” the statement said.
By reducing travel time and improving accessibility, Uzbekistan Airways was playing a pivotal role in translating this vision into tangible results, the embassy said adding, “More than just a transport link, this route is a gateway to deeper economic integration, cultural exchange, and strategic partnership – a symbol of the growing synergy between Uzbekistan and Pakistan, two nations united by shared values, complementary interests, and a long history of collaboration.”
