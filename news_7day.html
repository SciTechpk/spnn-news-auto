The detention came ahead of a press conference by the Aurat March, which was scheduled for 3pm over the alleged “abduction” of two Baloch girls.
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) member Qazi Khizar said activist Sara was taken by the police from outside the KPC. Within a few hours, Aurat March confirmed to Dawn that she had been released.
Dawn has reached out to the police for a comment on the detention.
Ahead of the press conference, the Karachi police also heightened security, with a considerable number of women personnel present outside the KPC, a Dawn correspondent reported.
Roads leading to the KPC had been closed off briefly but were reopened by about 5pm.
Senior journalist Dodal Chandio said in a post on Facebook that “police stopped the Aurat March women who were to hold a press conference” outside the KPC.



The police “misbehaved” with activist Sheema Kirmani, he added. In the video he shared, Kirmani could be heard saying, “You have no right to touch me. How dare you touch me?”
The video also showed policewomen grabbing another woman’s hand to detain her, as Kirmani told the cops that the woman was a reporter. As the tussle between them and the police continued, the woman said, “Let go of my hand. This is not a legal process.”
In other videos that surfaced on social media, the woman identified herself as Shakeela and a member of “JMDC, Joint Minority Development”. She showed a “slip” issued to her for the press conference, which was being attended by “10 people” from her group.







Journalist Zofeen Ebrahim, who was barred from attending the press conference, recalled to Dawn: “Police stationed outside KPC stopped me and asked me where I was going.
“I told them I am here for the press conference, to which they said that it is not going to happen,” she continued.
Ebrahim said that when she tried to make her way towards the KPC and was stopped by the police, she called the organisers to ask whether the press conference had been cancelled. “They also did not know what was going on,” she said.
“Some other women who were trying to enter were stopped at the gate as well,” the journalist added.
She also shared a video on X, asking, “What’s happening to my city, my country?”







In a press release issued yesterday, Aurat March had said their press conference would “address the escalating pattern of enforced disappearances in Balochistan — particularly the alarming rise in the abduction of Baloch women and girls”.
“The 4th Schedule has become a tool of coercion in Balochistan, with women — many of them entirely unaffiliated with activism — being placed on the list and denied freedom of movement,” the statement read.
On November 27, police had detained 24 PTI leaders and workers following a protest at KPC to voice their concerns over former prime minister Imran Khan’s well-being.
A week before that, the police had detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the venue of a scheduled protest by the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) against the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In March, Karachi police had arrested six people at Fawara Chowk as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) attempted to reach the KPC for a protest against the arrests of its leadership.
Civil society seeks recovery of Mahjabeen Baloch, teenage Nasreen Baloch
The press conference, which was held to demand the recovery of two Baloch girls — 15-year-old Nasreen Baloch and 24-year-old Mahjabeen Baloch — was held amid a heavy police presence outside KPC, with roads leading to the press club blocked at various points.

According to the Aurat March, Nasreen was “abducted from Hub” in Balochistan in November, while Mahjabeen was “taken from Quetta” earlier this year.
Mahjabeen, the daughter of Ghulam Mustafa and a student of the University of Balochistan, was picked up from Quetta Civil Hospital in May, as per the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) Chairman Nasrullah Baloch.
Scheduled to start at 3pm, the press conference began approximately 20 minutes later as the organisers said they were “stopped by the police” at the gate of the KPC.
At the outset, Kirmani said she was “grabbed and pushed around” by police outside and questioned why the state was stopping them from holding a press conference.
“What right did the state have to stop them from demanding the recovery of young Baloch girls?” she asked.
“Are you a fascist government or a democratic government? What are you scared of?” Kirmani said furiously, adding that by meting out such treatment, the state was creating an atmosphere of hatred.
Aurat March organiser Moneeza Ahmed asked, “Why are the families of Nasreena and Mahjabeen not even being allowed to ask the state about the whereabouts of their daughters?”
She alleged that the state was attempting to intimidate activists and families of the missing young girls. “To what extent is the state willing to go?” Ahmed wondered.
Kirmani claimed that police had also attempted to arrest BYC activist Sammi Deen Baloch as she made her way to the press conference.

 

“The Baloch women have repeatedly stated that they have no relation to BLA, yet the state continues to harass them,” she lamented, referring to the banned so-called Baloch Liberation Army.
Khizer, the vice chairman of the HRCP’s Sindh chapter, addressing the press conference, noted that “at the moment, KPC is surrounded by police from every corner”. “This is fear,” he added.
He stressed that the “young Baloch girls fighting for their rights and those [militants] in remote mountains were not the same”.
“The state has now resorted to picking up young girls,” he alleged, expressing his disappointment.
Kirmani called on the government to “negotiate”, asking, “Why should they not know where their daughters are?”

 

“Seven months have gone by ever since she has been gone, and we don’t know anything,” she said, referring to Mahjabeen. “Why are we not allowed to ask about their whereabouts?” she questioned.
The activists demanded the “immediate recovery and safe return of both the girls, an end to enforced disappearances, protection for families of missing persons, and transparency from state institutions”.</p><small>2025-12-04 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/04165151c495da3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959162/pakistan-uses-highly-invasive-israeli-spyware-says-amnesty-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan uses highly invasive Israeli spyware, says Amnesty report</strong></a><br><p>A spyware, manufactured by an Israeli company, was being actively used in Pakistan, according to an investigation by Amnesty International on Thursday.
Predator, a highly invasive spyware that has been linked to human rights abuses in multiple countries, was manufactured by the Israeli company Intellexa. Israel, the country where the company is based, has no diplomatic relations with Pakistan.
The investigation, titled “Intellexa Leaks,” described the story of a human rights lawyer based in Balochistan. He approached Amnesty International in the summer of 2025 after receiving a suspicious link on WhatsApp from an unknown number. Amnesty Security Lab investigated the link and identified it as a Predator attack attempt based on the technical behavior of the infection server. Specific characteristics of the one-time infection link were also consistent with previously observed Predator one-click links.
This was the first case reported in Pakistan.
Intellexa Leaks is based on a combination of highly sensitive documents and other material leaked from the company, including internal company documents, sales and marketing materials, and training videos.
The months-long investigation was published in collaboration with Inside Story in Greece, Haaretz in Israel, and WAV Research Collective in Switzerland.
Amnesty International previously sent detailed questions to Intellexa about its products, operations and corporate structure. Intellexa declined to answer the questions.
In 2023, Intellexa was fined by the Greek Data Protection Authority for failing to comply with its investigations into the company.
Google started sending spyware threat notifications to several hundred of its users across various countries, including Pakistan. The accounts were identified as Predator spyware targets.
How Predator works
Intellexa’s Predator relies on “1-click” attacks to infect a device, which require a malicious link to be opened in the target’s phone. The malicious link then loads a browser exploit for Chrome or Safari to gain initial access to the device and download the full spyware payload.
Once the spyware is installed, it can access encrypted instant messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, audio recordings, emails, device locations, screenshots and camera photos, stored passwords, contacts, and call logs. It also activates the device’s microphone.
The spyware then communicates with, and uploads surveillance data to, a Predator backend server physically located in the customer’s country.
All data from the spyware is first relayed through a chain of anonymization servers, termed the “CNC Anonymization Network” to prevent the risk of exposure for the operator with the 1-click attack link.
The surveillance company overcame the limitation of exposure by using different approaches to trigger the opening of an infection link on the target’s phone, without requiring the target to manually click the link.
Intellexa also developed a strategic infection vector, ‘Aladdin,’ which could enable silent zero-click infections of target devices anywhere in the world. The vector exploits the commercial mobile advertising ecosystem to carry out these infections.
Intellexa is a surveillance company that develops spyware, with Predator as its signature product, and sells it for use by governments. According to the investigation, the company’s internal operations remained largely unknown to researchers.</p><small>2025-12-04 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041355444bbedd5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959150/third-afghan-national-arrested-in-us-accused-of-providing-material-support-to-isis-k' target='_blank'><strong>Third Afghan national arrested in US, accused of providing ‘material support to ISIS-K’</strong></a><br><p>A third Afghan national has been arrested in the US, days after another Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, shot two National Guards, for providing “material support to ISIS-K”, according to a statement issued by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Wednesday.
Jaan Shah Shafi, who entered the US in 2021 under former president Joe Biden’s Operation Allies Welcome, “provided support to the ISIS-K. He also provided weapons to his father, who is a commander of a militia group in Afghanistan,” the press release stated.
It further stated that Shafi applied for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), but his application was terminated once DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ended TPS for Afghans. He was arrested in Waynesboro, Virginia.
The Trump administration halted the Afghan refugee resettlement program on January 20 and suspended the entry of Afghan nationals, for “protection and safety of Americans”.
Nearly 190,000 Afghan nationals entered the US during Biden administration, the statement read.
Lakanwal, who worked alongside US forces in Afghanistan, is accused of shooting two National Guard soldiers near White House last week, according to US media.
Another Afghan man Mohammad Dawood Alokozay was charged with threatening to build a bomb and carry out a suicide attack, according to the US officials.</p><small>2025-12-04 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/04164416b5ea3e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959163/kp-cm-sohail-afridi-denied-access-for-9th-time-to-meet-imran-khan-at-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Sohail Afridi denied access for ‘9th’ time to meet Imran Khan at Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was prevented for the ninth time by prison authorities from meeting PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail on Thursday.
Imran’s sister Uzma Khan met the party founder in prison on Tuesday after weeks of effort, with CM Afridi and other party leaders scheduled to meet him today. The meeting took place as rumours regarding Imran’s health began circulating in local and foreign media, despite claims by the government and PTI leaders that the former prime minister was in good health.
These speculations, however, gained traction due to the government’s reluctance to let visitors, including his family members and legal team, meet Imran over the past few weeks.
According to a post on X by the PTI, CM Afridi went to Adiala jail to visit Imran, but access was not granted.
Afridi addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access. He said he would update the media on the immediate course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not.







The PTI also shared a video of the KP CM and his delegation in a waiting room, saying that today was the ninth instance of Afridi not being allowed to meet Imran.







In a talk with the media after exiting the room, CM Afridi said: “I think the meeting is not being allowed. Today is the ninth time I have come; a chief minister of a province is repeatedly coming, but even a five-minute meeting is not being allowed. The whole world is witnessing this discriminatory treatment, and their actions are being noted and will be remembered.”
“This government won’t remain forever and then no one will get a chance to complain.”
When asked if he planned to spend another night outside the prison in protest, he said that Imran’s good physical health had been confirmed in the meeting with Uzma. He added that the party would now devise its next course of action regarding concerns about the party founder’s mental duress.
“I have been told to play on the front foot, and there are instructions that the umpires are colluding, so be careful. So we will play on the front foot and also keep a watch on the umpires.”
The provincial chief executive said the continued denial of a meeting showed that “our coming here pains them, so we will mete out that pain again and again.” CM Afridi said street protests were certainly an option for the party, as per the law and Constitution.
On a question about the possible imposition of governor’s rule in KP, Afridi responded: “What are they waiting for … impose it today. We are not afraid of any governor’s rule.”
“They will not be able to control and handle the conditions that I am foreseeing,” warned KP CM.
He also lashed out at the government for not being able to tolerate and bear a chief minister from the tribal areas for the first time. Afridi said removing him would cause anger and frustration among the people from the tribal belt.
“The people of KP and Pakistan see their future in me,” Afridi claimed, adding that the governor’s rule would be a “win-win” situation for him since he would be able to operate freely.
The KP CM said he would visit Punjab soon.



Visuals shared by the party showed a large group of supporters gathered outside the prison as well.

An initial statement by the rescue service said, “As soon as the Central Command and Control of the Rescue 1122 received the information, a fire and rescue team, along with an ambulance and a fire brigade truck, were dispatched to the scene.”
It added that the team was trying to bring the fire under control.
An update by Rescue 1122 later said the factory’s building had collapsed due to the intensity of the fire, adding that two firefighters had been injured due to the collapse.
They were being provided first aid, the statement said.
Separately, a statement by Sukkan police said that the fire erupted in a warehouse and no casualties had been reported thus far.
Further investigation was under way, the statement added.

This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate. We will strive to ensure timeliness and accuracy by relying on credible sources, such as concerned, qualified authorities and our staff reporters.</p><small>2025-12-04 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/04123955c7c81b1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959141/centre-here-to-listen-to-provinces-stance-finance-minister-tells-inaugural-meeting-of-11th-nfc' target='_blank'><strong>Centre here to listen to provinces’ stance, finance minister tells inaugural meeting of 11th NFC</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday told the inaugural meeting of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) that the Centre was there to listen to the stance of the provinces.
State broadcaster PTV shared images from the meeting on social media platform X, which showed Aurangzeb greeting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.
It said that the meeting was held at the Finance Division.







According to a handout issued by the finance ministry, he made the comments in his opening remarks. The minister chaired the meeting as negotiations for the sharing of federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces formally began.
The press release said that at the outset of the meeting, the minister stressed that it had provided an opportunity for mutual cooperation, upholding constitutional responsibility.
He noted that the forum was established under Article 150 of the Constitution, adding that the 10th NFC Award had expired in July this year.
“In this context, the importance of this meeting increases further,” he said. He said that the federal government was of the view that the 11th NFC meeting be convened “without any delay”.







He noted that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif himself had stated that he wanted to hold the meeting as soon as possible.
“The provinces had also expressed their determination to fulfil this constitutional responsibility,” he said. The minister added that, however, it had to be postponed due to floods in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh.
He further said that the best solution for speculations and concerns regarding the NFC was a “sincere and transparent” dialogue.
“We are here today with an open mind and without any prejudice,” he said, stressing that “our first priority is to listen to each other.” He assured the participants that the federal government was “here to listen to them”.
The minister voiced optimism that the provinces “will move forward within the spirit of cooperation.”
He noted that the “signing of the National Fiscal Pact by the provinces was very significant.”
It is a “testament to our shared commitment and ability to work together in the national interest,” the finance minister said.
He appreciated the cooperation of provinces in “achieving the required surpluses and ensuring the implementation of the IMF programme”.
The finance minister recalled that the country faced “unprecedented threats” this year, citing the May conflict with India and recent floods.
“In these difficult times, we stood united as a strong federation,” he said, calling for the “same spirit” in the 11th NFC Award process.
“The role of the NFC is fundamental for the equitable distribution of resources, fiscal stability and sustainable economic growth in the country,” Aurangzeb said.
He noted that the forum provided an “opportunity to bring together the best minds and advance the process of shared thinking and mutual learning”.
He hoped that the discussions would continue in the upcoming weeks, and urged members to “move forward with full commitment”.
“We will listen to each other and move forward with a spirit of unity, cooperation and mutual respect,” the minister said.
“Our goal is to successfully conclude the 11th NFC Award process,” the minister said.
It was decided at the meeting that five to six groups would be formed on different subjects, and the next meeting would be called between January 7 and 15.
The 11th NFC was constituted on August 22 to give a new award for sharing federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces. Its first meeting, initially called for August 27, was postponed repeatedly.
The terms of reference, set under Clause 2 of Article 160, require the 11th NFC to distribute between the federal government and the provinces the net proceeds of five major tax categories. These include taxes on income — including capital value tax and corporation tax but excluding taxes on income consisting of remuneration paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund.
The four provincial finance ministers and four non-statutory members — Dr Asad Sayeed (Sindh), Mehfooz Ali Khan (Baloc­histan), Nasir Mehmood Khosa (Punjab) and Dr Musharraf Rasool Cyan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) — are members of the NFC.
Murad, Afridi share meeting details
Provincial chief executives Murad and Afridi separately spoke to the media after the meeting.
Murad said today’s meeting was held in a cordial environment, where the Centre and provinces detailed their fiscal positions.

He also confirmed that groups would be formed for different subjects. “Discussions will he held regarding this and, God willing, they will be formed next week.”
Meanwhile, Afridi said that at the meeting, “we presented the case for the people of KP”.
He recalled that after the 25th Constitutional Amendment, federally administered tribal areas (Fata) were merged into the province administratively.
“So they have been a part of KP since 2018,” he said, further stating that under Article 160, which deals with the subject of NFC, funds had to be distributed among four provinces.

“But they were distributed among three and a half provinces. The tribal areas did not get their share,” he alleged, adding that they had raised the matter during today’s meeting. “We raised the point that this was unconstitutional […]. After putting forward the stance, all participants agreed with this in principle,” he claimed.
Afridi said the next NFC meeting was expected in mid-January, and “we will take this further in mid-January”.
KP CM holds consultations ahead of NFC
Ahead of the meeting, KP CM Afridi last night also held consultations in preparation for the inaugural meeting in the presence of senior PTI leadership, where it was decided to “fully and effectively” uphold KP’s interests, with a special emphasis on the “financial merger of Fata.”
Detailing the meeting in a post on X, the government of KP said that Afridi was briefed that Fata was “entitled to Rs1,375 billion,” adding that the funds had not yet been provided.







During the meeting, the chief minister was briefed that “at the time of the merger of the former Fata, a promise was made to provide Rs100bn annually, which now amounts to Rs700bn”.
It was further discussed that out of the total amount, the Centre had only released Rs168bn, while Rs531.9bn remained pending.
CM Afridi termed the delay in the issuance of funds a “violation of Article 160” of the Constitution, vowing to protect the province’s “financial and constitutional rights”.
The participants of the meeting included PTI’s Asad Qaiser, provincial minister Meena Khan Afridi, Finance Adviser Muzammil Aslam and others.</p><small>2025-12-04 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041656061c7cad3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959164/russias-putin-heads-to-india-for-defence-trade-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Russia’s Putin heads to India for defence, trade talks</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin was due in India on Thursday for a two-day visit aimed at deepening defence ties, as New Delhi faces heavy US pressure to stop buying oil from Moscow.
Putin, on his first visit to India since the Ukraine war, is accompanied by his Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, with possible deals on fighter jets and air defence systems expected to be discussed.
In an interview with India Today ahead of his trip, Putin said he was “very happy” to be meeting “my friend” Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“The range of our cooperation with India is huge,” he said in remarks translated by the broadcaster, citing ship and aircraft manufacturing, nuclear energy and space exploration.
Modi is due to host Putin for a private dinner on Thursday evening, followed by a summit meeting on Friday.
Beyond defence, trade relations are expected to feature prominently as India walks a diplomatic tightrope – relying on strategic Russian oil imports while trying not to provoke US President Donald Trump during ongoing tariff negotiations.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said talks to expand the supply of Russia’s advanced S-400 air defence systems had an “important place on the agenda”.
Indian media reports suggested Moscow may also offer co-production of Russia’s Su-57 fighter jets.
India is one of the world’s top arms importers, and Russia has long been a principal supplier.
But New Delhi has also sought alternative suppliers, as well as boosting domestic production – with the Russian share of India’s arms imports falling from 76 percent in 2009-13 to 36 percent in 2019-23, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
Energy imports
Putin’s visit comes after Trump imposed 50-percent tariffs on most Indian products in August, citing Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil – revenue Washington argues helps fund the war in Ukraine.
India, the world’s most populous nation, has become a major buyer of Russian oil, saving itself billions of dollars and providing Moscow with a much-needed export market after it was cut off from traditional buyers in Europe because of the war.
But Delhi has recently cut down on crude imports under pressure from sanctions on Russia’s top oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil.

The Indian government fears any fresh energy or defence deals with Russia could irk Trump, with possible ramifications on trade negotiations with Washington.
Peskov said Russia was not concerned about US tariffs.
“What concerns us is how we are going to maintain and increase the volume of our bilateral business with India, without allowing anyone to interfere,” he said Tuesday at a briefing for Indian media organised by Sputnik India.
Nandan Unnikrishnan, of the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation, told AFP: “There may be some reduction in energy purchases – under US pressure – but the overall direction of the ties will be maintained because both countries need each other at the strategic level.”
‘Critical moment’
A senior Indian foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was a need to address the trade imbalance “one way or the other”.
Bilateral trade reached $68.7 billion in 2024-25 – almost six times higher than the pre-pandemic levels – but Indian exports accounted for only $4.88 billion.
Delhi has been pressing Moscow for expanded market access for its key industries including pharmaceuticals, automobiles and the service sector.
Harsh V Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College London, said the visit was an attempt by “to reset their relationship at a critical geopolitical moment for both”.
“For India, the optics is a statement of intent for strategic autonomy, and Putin, who rarely travels, is sending a message about the importance of the relationship by travelling here,” Pant told AFP.
The Indian foreign ministry official described the ties between Moscow and Delhi as the “most stable relationship in modern times”.
The official acknowledged the global geopolitical significance, but insisted that the meeting should seen in the context as “just another annual summit”.</p><small>2025-12-04 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0415240388d8095.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959137/pakistan-ready-to-provide-kyrgyzstan-access-to-regional-and-global-markets-through-our-ports-says-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan ready to provide Kyrgyzstan access to regional and global markets through our ports, says PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that Pakistan was ready to provide landlocked Kyrgyzstan access to regional and global markets through its ports.
The premier made the remarks as he addressed the media in Islamabad alongside Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Zhaparov, following discussions between the two leaders.
Zhaparov arrived in Islamabad yesterday on a two-day maiden visit to Pakistan. PM Shehbaz said in a post on X that the visit was the first by a Kyrgyz president in 20 years.
Detailing the discussions held today, the prime minister said that Kyrgyzstan was a landlocked country and therefore, “Pakistan stands ready to provide Kyrgyz Republic access to regional and global markets through our ports of Karachi, Bin Qasim and Gwadar”.

“During our fruitful discussions today, we had a detailed exchange on […] bilateral relations as well as important regional and international developments,” PM Shehbaz said about his meeting with Zharapov.
Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, intelligence chief and National Security Adviser Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik, and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, alongside others, were present at that and another delegation-level meeting, visuals showed.







“We have reaffirmed today, and of course in no uncertain terms, our shared resolve to elevate Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan relations to a much higher level by enhancing collaboration in political, trade, connectivity, energy, agriculture, education, defence, and of course, in cultural domains.”
The prime minister noted that a business forum would be held later today to “chart new pathways for proactive collaboration in vital sectors of economic cooperation”.
PM Shehbaz said that the business forum, comprising the business community from both sides, will be akin to “signing an MoU which is worth $200 million”, pledging to increase mutual trade from the current $15-16m to $200m in the next two years.
The bilateral trade volume had declined significantly from $11.2m in 2022-23 to $5.18m in 2024-25.

 

PM Shehbaz called Islamabad the Kyrgyz president’s “second home”. “There cannot be a better moment of joy and bliss for all of us.”
Noting that a Kyrgyz president was visiting Pakistan after a period of 20 years, the premier said that “this gap between two brotherly countries is not acceptable”. “As I said, it’s never too late,” he added, extending the visiting dignitary a warm welcome.
Stating that the two nations had “timeless” links, the prime minister said the people of both countries were connected “not only by geography but by centuries of caravans, and ideas of faiths and friendships”.
“Our discussions also highlighted the need to strengthen people-to-people exchanges through cultural initiatives, tourism promotion, and academic partnerships,” the premier said, adding that they agreed to hold cultural events in Islamabad and other parts of Pakistan, as well as similar activities in Bishkek.
“Our interaction today is far more than a meeting between two brothers whose hearts beat in unison. It is as though the ancient Karakoram and the majestic Ala-Too stretch out across the horizon to embrace one another,” PM Shehbaz said.
He expressed the confidence that the visit will “most definitely give a fresh impetus to our already strong bilateral relations in all fields of mutual interaction”.
The prime minister thanked the Kyrgyz president and his delegation for their “commitment to strengthening our bilateral relations”.
“May the radiant sun of Kyrgyzstan and the guiding glow of Pakistan’s crescent and star unite to illuminate a future between our two countries of enduring peace, shared prosperity and hope for both the peoples and, of course our region, and the world beyond.”
Zhaparov calls Pakistan ‘important partner’
In his remarks, President Zhaparov appreciated the Pakistani government and its people for their “warm reception and generous hospitality”. He also confirmed that his visit was the first by a head of Kyrgyzstan in 20 years.
“I would like to emphasise that Pakistan is an important partner of Kyrgyzstan in South Asia,” Zhaparov said. He later also termed Pakistan a “brotherly country and a reliable partner”.
“I view Pakistan’s dynamic development, its growing economic potential and its ambitious infrastructure projects as a testament to the prime minister’s effective leadership,” he added.



Zhaparov noted that he and PM Shehbaz held “extensive discussions on the current agenda and future prospects of the Kyrgyz-Pakistani cooperation”.
“We paid special attention to activating collaboration in trade, economy, investment, transport, logistics, education and science,” he detailed. “We attach particular importance to further developing the Kyrgyz-Pakistan Business Council as an effective mechanism for bringing together the business communities of both countries.”
The visiting dignitary further said he considered the “full use of the transport and transit potential of Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan to be one of the most important areas of our partnership”.
Zhaparov also mentioned the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000), saying it would “serve as a cornerstone in establishing a unified energy system between Central and South Asia”.

 

The $1.2 billion regional power project — designed to bring the benefits of interconnectivity to Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan — is expected to become operational by January 2027, as per a Tajik minister.
Speaking on academic cooperation, Zhaparov noted that more than 12,000 Pakistani students were studying at higher education institutions in Kyrgyzstan.
“In the field of security, we reaffirmed our shared commitment to combating terrorism, extremism and transnational crime,” he said, adding that both countries also agreed to strengthen coordination between the “competent authorities to ensure peace, stability and security in the region”.
Zhaparov extended an invitation to PM Shehbaz to pay a state visit to Kyrgyzstan when convenient for him.
He also invited the prime minister as a guest of honour to the 2026 Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit that will take place in Bishkek, as well as to the World Nomad Games 2026.
15 MoUs signed
Separately, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan signed 15 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) in various fields, including commerce, energy and health, to boost bilateral cooperation between the two nations.
The exchange of MoUs took place in Islamabad, with PM Shehbaz, Zhaparov and ministers from both sides present at the signing ceremony.

Following the inking of the MoUs, PM Shehbaz and Zhaparov also signed a joint statement on the strengthening of “comprehensive cooperation” in the interest of both countries.
The prime minister said the MoUs would “serve as a framework for structured result-oriented engagement and closer institutional linkages between our two countries”.
An MoU between Pakistan’s Foreign Services Academy and the Diplomatic Academy of Kyrgyzstan was exchanged by Foreign Minister Dar and his Kyrgyz counterpart Zheenbek Kulubayev.
Kulubayev also exchanged an MoU in the field of mining and geosciences with Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik.
Power Minister Awais Leghari also exchanged an MoU with Energy Minister Taalaibek Ibraev on cooperation in the energy sector.

 

An MoU between both countries’ commerce ministries was exchanged by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan and his Kyrgyz counterpart Bakyt Sydykov.
Sydykov and Railways Minister Bilal Azhar Kayani also inked an MoU for cooperation in utilising Pakistan’s ports for regional connectivity.
The Kyrgyz FM exchanged an MoU with Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema on cooperation in agriculture, and another pact with Kamal on the establishment of an electronic data interchange between the customs services of both countries.
An agreement was also exchanged by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Kyrgyz Prosecutor General Maksat Asanaliev on the transfer of convicted persons to prisons to serve their sentence.
Sydykov also exchanged an MoU with Rana Sanaullah, minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC), on cooperation in the sphere of tourism.

 

Another pact was signed about surgical instruments, exchanged by Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath, minister of state for National Health Services, and Kulubayev.
An agreement in the field of culture was inked by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and his Kyrgyz counterpart Mirbek Mambetaliev.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar exchanged an MoU with Kulubayev for cooperation between the justice ministries of the two countries.
A pact was signed to establish sister city relations between both countries’ federal capitals, exchanged by Chaudhry and Bishkek Mayor Aibek Junushaliev.







An MoU was exchanged between the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme and Kyrgyzstan’s Culture, Information and Youth Policy Ministry, signed by the programme’s head, Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan, and Mambetaliev.
Finally, the director of the National University of Modern Languages (NUML), retired Major Gen Shahid Mahmood Kayani, and Kyrgyz Ambassador to Pakistan Kylychbek Sultan exchanged an MoU between NUML and the Diplomatic Academy of the Kyrgyz foreign ministry.
In the morning, a formal welcome ceremony in honour of Zhaparov was held at Prime Minister House in Islamabad, Radio Pakistan reported. PM Shehbaz received the Kyrgyz president upon his arrival.
A smartly turned out contingent of armed forces presented a guard of honour to the visiting dignitary, and both countries’ national anthems were played on the occasion.



Dar meets Kyrgyz president
Earlier today, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met Zhaparov and reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to strengthening ties between the two countries, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
Dar called on President Zhaparov and welcomed his delegation to Pakistan, the FO said in a post on X. It added that Dar conveyed the “warm greetings” of President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz.







“He reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong commitment, at the highest political level, to further strengthening Pak–Kyrgyz relations in all areas of mutual interest,” the FO added.
Dar also briefed Zhaparov on his planned engagements with Pakistan’s leadership, interactions with both countries’ business communities, and discussions aimed at advancing broad-based bilateral cooperation.
Dar had also welcomed Kyrgyz FM Zheenbek Kulubaev at the FO yesterday, where the two held “important consultations ranging over areas of mutual interest”.







Pakistan and the Kyrgyz Republic share longstanding relations, founded on deep-rooted cultural, historical, and spiritual affinities.
The two countries had agreed to promote bilateral cooperation in cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and digital finance in August.
In July, they reaffirmed an agreement to increase bilateral trade to $100 million at a session of their intergovernmental commission.
Alongside bilateral relations, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan are both members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa­tion, a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose other members include China, Russia, India, and Iran.</p><small>2025-12-04 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041602065d59cdc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959158/whats-in-a-name-how-koreans-faked-their-way-to-kim-lee-and-park' target='_blank'><strong>What’s in a name? How Koreans faked their way to Kim, Lee and Park</strong></a><br><p>If you meet a South Korean, there‘s a 45 per cent chance that their surname is either Kim, Lee or Park. And there’s an even higher probability — some say nearly 90 per cent — that their surname originates from a bogus family tree.
According to the latest census data from Statistics Korea, these three surnames account for nearly half the population, which is over 20 million people. Expand that to the top 10 surnames, and you’re looking at 64 per cent of the population.
This remarkable concentration has given rise to the Korean expression, “finding Mr Kim in Seoul,” to describe an impossible task — something akin to finding a needle in a haystack.
Name game
Korean family names may seem simple at first glance. Most are a single syllable, with a staggering concentration of a few popular names rarely seen elsewhere.
However, there are many sub-branches even within the same surname. Each surname is associated with a clan name, which indicates the name‘s regional origin or ancestral hometown. Although there are traditionally only 288 surnames, they are connected to over 4,000 different clans.
For example, a person surnamed Kim could belong to the Gimhae Kim clan, the Gyeongju Kim clan or the Andong Kim clan, each representing the supposed birthplace of the first ancestor to ever bear the name.
Many families keep family records known as “jokbo” to trace this intricate genealogy dating back centuries or even millennia. But the accuracy of these cherished family trees is often, shall we say, questionable.
Questionable because, for much of the Korean Peninsula‘s 5,000-year history, most people lived without surnames.
According to historians, in ancient times, family names were reserved exclusively for royals and nobles. It wasn‘t until the Goryeo era (918-1392) that surnames began to filter down to the general population.
By the late 10th century, even most commoners had acquired at least a clan name, if not a proper surname. But the lowest class, including slaves, butchers and shamans, remained without surnames or clan names until much later.
Enter the early Joseon era (1392–1910), a period marked by the transition to a Neo-Confucian hierarchy with four classes, devastating wars and some seriously creative record-keeping.
As the kingdom struggled to fill the coffers after major conflicts like the Imjin War (1592-1598) and the Qing invasion of 1636, they hit upon a novel idea: selling positions and aristocrat status to commoners.
Following the aftermath of the Imjin War, the government, desperate for funds, began selling away government positions in earnest. This practice expanded significantly over subsequent decades, particularly during times of crisis or conflict when the state coffers ran low.
By the late 17th century, the floodgates had opened. Men with enough resources could buy their way into the privileged “yangban” class, complete with exemptions from taxes, military service and other pesky obligations.
And what better way for a man to cement his newly purchased status than by cooking up an illustrious family history?
Fabricating family trees, or jokbo, hence became a popular practice among the masses from the middle to the end of the Joseon era. The newly minted yangban began inserting their names into others‘ prominent family trees, claiming ancestry from prestigious clans and regions.
The more creative among them listed their earliest ancestors as hailing from China —  a convenient way to avoid any awkward cross-checking.
By the late Joseon era, jokbo forgery had become a full-blown industry. The Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty even document a case from 1764 where a bureaucrat was caught running a full-blown counterfeiting operation.
Every man’s surname
More importantly, this period of flux also saw the expansion of surname usage to the lowest classes.
As the government‘s practice of selling positions extended to men at all levels of society, those in the lowest class found an unprecedented opportunity. For a payment in kind, they could now purchase commoner status, which came with the right to adopt surnames.
This development marked a significant erosion of the class hierarchy that had defined the early Joseon era. By the time its class system was officially abolished in 1894, nearly everyone had a surname as we know it today.
This trend is evident in historical records: A longitudinal study of the Danseong prefecture (now Sancheong-gun, South Gyeongsang Province) census register shows that the percentage of households without surnames dropped from 45 per cent in 1681 to just 6 per cent in 1816.
In the end, while most Koreans now share a handful of common surnames, these names carry within them a legacy of striving for social mobility and reinvention — faking it if necessary.
For those who might wonder if Koreans today care about the authenticity of their genealogy, the answer is: not so much. With so many people sharing the same family names, distinctions based on claims of Joseon-era noble status — genuine or not — have diminished in importance.
After all, in contemporary Korea, social status tends to depend less on one‘s great-great-grandfather’s titles and more on the wealth of one‘s parents, one’s educational background and professional achievements.
So, the next time you meet a Kim, Lee or Park here — which will probably be within the next minute — just remember their ancestral claims might be a bit more imaginative than they appear.

The development comes three days after Naqvi announced a crackdown on those involved in fake news, declaring that the government would repatriate from the UK YouTubers involved in this activity or the targeting of state institutions.
According to a statement released by the interior ministry, Naqvi held an “important” meeting with Marriott in Islamabad, where the two discussed Pak-UK relations, security cooperation and issues of mutual interest.
Federal Secretary for Interior Muhammad Khurram Agha and other relevant officers were also present, it said. They also discussed the return of Pakistanis illegally residing in the UK, it added.
“The extradition papers for Akbar and Raja from the government of Pakistan were handed over [to Marriott],” the statement said.
“Both individuals are wanted in Pakistan. They should be handed over to Pakistan immediately,” Naqvi was quoted as saying.
He also provided evidence against Pakistani citizens who were spreading propaganda, the statement said.
“I fully believe in freedom of expression, but fake news is a problem for every country,” he said, as per the statement.
“No country can allow slander and defamation against state institutions from those sitting abroad,” the minister said. Naqvi also said that Pakistan would welcome British cooperation for the return of those who “spread anti-Pakistan propaganda”.
The statement further said that the interior ministry had initiated the extradition process through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Reacting to the news, Akbar took to social media platform x, “It has become increasingly clear that my publications, broadcasts, and political commentary on human rights abuses in Pakistan, the rise of authoritarianism, unconstitutional amendments, and the current impasse over military appointments have deeply angered the regime.”
Tagging Marriott as well as the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), he said, “I urge you to note that, as I have repeatedly stated, the worst forms of retaliation have already been used against me, including the abduction of my family members in Pakistan and an acid attack against me here in the UK.”
In 2023, Akbar said he was attacked at his England home, adding that “acidic liquid” was thrown at him. He had initiated legal action against the Pakistan government last year, after which the Foreign Office said the claims by Akbar were “simply preposterous”.
“I trust that UK authorities will uphold due process, rule of law, and human-rights obligations,” he said.







“The Pakistani regime’s standing on the world stage is reflected in its failing economy, rampant corruption, and poor governance — all of which were detailed in the recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) review,” said Raja, while responding to Akbar.
“They may call the British High Commissioner to complain, but such a complaint is itself unlawful under UK statutes, as we have committed no wrongdoing,” he said.







Both Akbar and Raja have been residing in the UK. Raja, who is also a former Pakistan Army officer and has positioned himself as a whistleblower, was ordered to pay £350,000 in damages and legal costs after a London high court ruled he had defamed a former intelligence officer with unfounded allegations of corruption and electoral interference.
Akbar also runs his own YouTube channel, where he comments on Pakistan’s political developments.
Naqvi announces crackdown on fake news mongers
In his press conference on Monday, the interior minister had said the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) and the information ministry will jointly initiate action on a massive scale against those spreading fake news.
“The state will no longer allow individuals to declare a living person dead, a dead person alive (a reference to fake news about the health of Imran Khan), or make any allegation they please without evidence. Since the past few days, 90 per cent news on social media was fake,” Naqvi told a press conference in Lahore.
The remarks had come as social media was abuzz with reports about the health of former prime minister Imran Khan.
Naqvi had singled out some so-called social media journalists for spreading fake news.
“Mainstream journalists are a part of a strong editorial system unlike those on social media who spread fake news. We will not allow anyone to create panic in the garb of journalism on social media. Those who spread fake news are not journalists for us. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) takes action on incorrect reporting in the mainstream media but social media lacks accountability mechanisms,” he explained and added that a regulatory body for online content was being established.
When asked about criticism directed towards Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Gen Asim Munir, Naqvi said: “The state is clear. We will not spare them. The other day someone was saying in London that there was a dispute within the institutions. This will have to stop. Those sitting out there (UK) will be brought back soon.”</p><small>2025-12-04 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/04151847be3ed89.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959156/mitchell-starc-surpasses-wasim-akram-as-most-prolific-left-arm-pacer-in-test-history' target='_blank'><strong>Mitchell Starc surpasses Wasim Akram as most prolific left-arm pacer in Test history</strong></a><br><p>Australian veteran Mitchell Starc became the most prolific left-arm paceman in Test history on Thursday, surpassing Pakistan great Wasim Akram.
The 35-year-old bagged England’s Harry Brook at the Gabba in Brisbane on day one of the day-night second Ashes Test for his 415th wicket since his debut at the same ground 14 years ago.
It moved him past Wasim, widely recognised as the greatest left-arm bowler the sport has seen.







Wasim played 104 Tests for his 414 wickets with Starc reaching the milestone in his 102nd, helped by a career-best 7-58 in the first innings of the opening Ashes Test at Perth.
Starc is now 16th on the all-time wicket-taker list and could move above both India’s Harbhajan Singh (417) and South Africa’s Shaun Pollock (421) in the current pink-ball Test.
After that he will have New Zealand’s Richard Hadlee (431) in his sights.</p><small>2025-12-04 10:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041349148f5e470.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959149/controversial-social-media-posts-case-islamabad-court-rejects-imaan-mazaris-acquittal-plea' target='_blank'><strong>Controversial social media posts case: Islamabad court rejects Imaan Mazari’s acquittal plea</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court rejected on Thursday an application submitted by lawyer and rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, seeking her acquittal in a controversial social media posts case.
Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka, who was presiding over the proceedings, also rejected an application moved by Mazari and her husband, co-accused Hadi Ali Chattha, challenging the appointment of a counsel by the state to represent them in the case registered with the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
Both of them have been accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
At the hearing today, Mazari and Chattha, along with lawyer Sher Afzal Marwat, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) President Naeem Ali Gujjar, Islamabad Bar Council member Raja Aleem Abbasi and other legal representatives, appeared before the court.
The court’s previous orders were read out to Marwat, who presented arguments challenging the appointment of a counsel by the state to represent Mazari and Chattha.
He contended that under relevant rules, a lawyer should have at least five years of practice in criminal cases for such an appointment. He further argued that the accused, too, must have confidence in the counsel appointed for them.
Marwat cited several Supreme Court judgments in support of his arguments.
Abbasi endorsed the arguments presented by Marwat, pointing out that the accused had “explicitly expressed a lack of confidence” in the state-appointed counsel.
Mazari and Chattha have been objecting to the appointment of a counsel by the state to represent them in the case, with Mazari even alleging at one instance that the court had “forcibly appointed [a] state defence counsel”.
During a previous hearing on November 29, she had a heated exchange with the state-appointed counsel and accused him of being a “tout”.
The examination of the prosecution’s witnesses was also completed during that hearing.
Abbasi, however, urged the court today to recall the prosecution’s witnesses, saying that the defence should be allowed to conduct a “surgery” through proper cross-examination.
For his part, Gujjar complained about “heavy police presence and the treatment of lawyers” at previous hearings.
He requested the court to treat the case against Mazari and Chattha “as a routine case” and summon the witnesses again to “ensure fairness”.
Then, Marwat sought more time from the court, saying that “things might improve if proceedings are reset”.
After the completion of arguments on the application challenging the appointment of a counsel by the state for Mazari and Chattha, the court reserved its decision on the matter and later dismissed it.
Subsequently, it also dismissed an application submitted by Mazari at the hearing on November 29 for her acquittal. The court has already rejected Chattha’s acquittal application.
Separately, IBA President Gujjar submitted a power of attorney to the court to represent Mazari and Chattha.
At that instance, Judge Majoka also enquired about the recording of statements by the accused under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
Before concluding the November 29 hearing, Judge Majoka had directed the prosecution to prepare and submit the questionnaire under Section 342 of the CrPC to the accused by December 4 (today) and instructed Mazari and Chattha to submit their replies.
Upon his enquiry today, Chattha told him that they had not received a copy of the questionnaire yet. At that, the judge assured that a typed copy would be provided to the accused by 10am.
The next hearing of the case will be held tomorrow.
Mazari urges SC to urgently take up plea against denial of interim relief
Separately, Mazari today rushed an application before the SC, urging it to take up, preferably by tomorrow, her and Chattha’s joint appeal against the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) denial of interim relief to them in the social media post case.
On December 1, the IHC had issued notices but denied ad-interim relief of staying the trial without a just legal cause.
Subsequently, Mazari and Chattha had moved a joint appeal yesterday before the SC through their counsel Faisal Siddiqi under Article 185(3) of the Constitution, seeking to set aside the IHC order.
Now in their fresh application before the SC, the lawyers reiterated their request before the SC and pleaded that the criminal trial against them was at its concluding stage, highlighting extreme urgency in the matter.
Therefore, Mazari and Chattha urged the SC to fix the hearing by December 5 (tomorrow).

 

The application contended that the petitioners had filed a criminal revision before the IHC to question the trial proceedings in view of violations of due process as prescribed under CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in the absence of the petitioners.
The plea argued that the petitioners have a clear prima facie case because the recording of evidence in their absence was not only a violation of Section 353 (evidence to be taken in presence of accused) of the CrPC, but also their due process and fair trial rights under Article 10A of the Constitution.
As the criminal trial is at its concluding stage, the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioners because the prosecution would not be prejudiced if the trial is delayed for two weeks, the application argued.
However, it added, the criminal revision application filed by the petitioners before the IHC would become infructuous due to the lack of a grant of ad-interim relief to stay the trial.
Thus, the petitioners would suffer irreparable loss not only because the criminal revision application would become infructuous, but more importantly because of the gross violations of due process and principles of fair trial.
It is obvious and apparent that this unfair trial is leading to a criminal conviction of the petitioners, the application said.

 

It recalled Judge Majoka’s November 29 order — wherein Chattha’s acquittal plea had been denied — and said it “clearly showed” that the criminal trial was at the stage of recording of statements under Section 342 of CrPC, adding that there was a “clear and present danger” that this unfair trial would conclude in Mazari and her husband’s criminal conviction.
Thus, the present criminal appeal will become infructuous, the application argued.
It highlighted that in terms of Section 7 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, it is expressly stated that any application pleading urgency will be fixed for hearing within a period of 14 days.
Even otherwise, this is a criminal appeal involving the liberty of the petitioners and therefore should be treated urgently in terms of the policy of urgent applications before the SC, the plea contended.
“Failing an urgency being allowed by this court, the interest of justice will seriously be prejudiced and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioners in the form of possible criminal convictions,” it asserted.
On August 12, the NCCIA had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha before the Cyber Crime Reporting Centre of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca).</p><small>2025-12-04 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0414255530795b2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957939/wildlife-what-rano-left-behind' target='_blank'><strong>WILDLIFE: WHAT RANO LEFT BEHIND</strong></a><br><p>When Rano was airlifted to Islamabad on November 5, 2025, the 25-year-old Himalayan brown bear left behind more than just a confined, concrete enclosure at Karachi Zoo.
She left eight years of untreated injuries and the memory of her companion — an Asiatic black bear who died five years ago. Her relocation to a rehabilitation centre under the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) came by court order, pushed by animal rights activists who had watched her deteriorate for years.
Rano isn’t the first animal to be relocated from a zoo in Pakistan. Last year, the elephant Madhubala was relocated, following an outcry in the wake of viral videos of the distressed and disease-addled animal, to the sprawling Safari Park in Karachi. Before that, another elephant called Kaavan, dubbed the “loneliest elephant on the planet”, was relocated from a zoo in Islamabad to a wildlife sanctuary in Cambodia.
Such relocations have been hailed as symbolic victories by animal rights’ activists in Pakistan; rare moments of optimism and hope where such sentiments have become increasingly difficult to summon.

The relocation of a brown bear called Rano from the Karachi Zoo to an Islamabad sanctuary is as much a glimmer of hope as it is a damning indictment. Rano’s years of untreated injuries and psychological trauma are a microcosm of the suffering endured by every species at the zoo…

However, Karachi-based activist Jude Allen Pereira cautions that it takes time to reverse the long-term physical and emotional damage endured by these animals at zoos. Even as videos emerge of Rano appearing playful and content in her new surroundings, Allen tells Eos that the animal is still suffering from multiple chronic health issues, most critically severe dental problems that hinder her ability to eat a diet appropriate for her species.
While Rano is in a place where her battered body might begin to heal, her second chance casts a harsh light on those left behind. The same court that ordered her rescue also demanded answers: what is happening inside Karachi Zoo? On November 2 — three days before Rano’s departure — an inspection team was ordered to find out.

WHAT THE INSPECTORS FOUND
The members who eventually took part in the inspection on November 2 included Pereira, WWF-Pakistan President Nadeem Khalid, wildlife photographer Zafeer Ahmed Shaikh, Sindh Institute of Animal Health Director General Dr Nazeer Kalhoro, documentary filmmaker Mahera Omar and journalist Yusra Askari. Assisting them was a team from the IWMB.
Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir, who accompanied the team as an observer, says that the government members of the committee asked them not to use their cameras to document evidence. “Even the media was initially barred from entering the zoo,” Nasir tells Eos.
After initial hiccups, the team made it to the lions’ enclosure, where one of the lions had a visible patch of skin disease, but the zoo veterinarian Dr Amir Rizvi failed to explain it adequately. Khalid points out that the enclosure housing the big cats is a little over half the recommended size.
In a small, dimly lit cage not far away were two miniature horses, Bruno and Brownie. Bruno appeared to have a limp while Brownie was rooted to her spot. Upon inquiring about their health, Pereira says the zoo staff insisted the equines were in “optimal health and were even sometimes used for riding by visitors.”
Pereira says that zoo staff were dismissive of concerns that public riding violates zoo protocol, saying it happens only sometimes. “Such statements epitomise the normalisation of cruelty and ignorance within KMC’s animal care practices,” he says.

PATTERNS OF DISTRESS
At the cage holding porcupines, only three were left out of more than a dozen not too long ago. The enclosure is concrete-floored, which is alien to a species that instinctively burrows and lives on soft soil. According to the zoo doctor, the animals had been shifted to the cage “temporarily” due to a large renovation project. A photo shared by one of the inspection team members showed the porcupines in the same cage in 2023 as well.
Inside the cage, one of the porcupines repeatedly rammed his head against the concrete wall of the resting area; an aggressive, self-harming behaviour that wildlife experts link to extreme anxiety or distress.
The jackal’s enclosure offered yet another display of distress. For 15 minutes, says Nasir, the committee watched the animal trace the same pattern over and over again: a tight, continuous figure-of-eight.
Animal welfare experts have a term for this behaviour: zoochosis. It is a form of psychosis that develops in animals held captive in zoos. These behaviours — sometimes called stereotypical behaviour — include pacing, swaying, head-bobbing, feather plucking, bar-biting, and even self-mutilation.

SYSTEMIC FAILURES
In one enclosure for rhesus macaque monkeys, the inspection team noted there was no water or food. One monkey was gnawing on the wrapping paper of a cupcake. Another displayed a classic indicator of stress and boredom: every 45 seconds, it ran and flipped into an upside-down posture, a behaviour triggered by anxiety.
Two other monkeys bore visible injuries. Their inner thighs were blood-red from repeated contact with a rusted, corroded swing (the only entertainment provided). As more visitors gathered, the monkeys tried to seek refuge in their resting area, but they were locked out. For 10-12 hours a day, the monkeys are forced to remain in the public zone, exposed and on display. “These primates require immediate relocation to a sanctuary environment rich in greenery and stimulation,” says Pereira.
In the marine life section of the zoo, a water tank meant to display Oscar fish — a vibrant species native to South America — four fish lay heaped at the bottom, motionless. But instead of concern, the zoo management’s first instinct appeared to be deflection, Nasir tells Eos. “The officials told us the aquarium has been handed over to a private contractor and was not their responsibility.”
The team then met with the man said to be the in-charge of the aquatic section and learned that he had previously worked as a plumber in the same section. “At some point, the management simply assigned him control over the entire aquatic collection,” says Nasir.

THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), which oversees the 43-acre zoo, has long defended the zoo’s management. KMC spokesperson Daniyal Siyal insists the system is transparent: funds flow from the Sindh government through the octroi and zilla tax mechanism (a local taxation system), and the zoo’s revenue from tickets and concessions goes directly to KMC, which then allocates about 15 per cent back to operations.
“In the first three months of 2025 alone, the zoo brought in roughly 10 to 15 million rupees,” Siyal tells Eos. He rejects accusations of ghost employees or financial mismanagement, pointing to what he describes as a dedicated veterinary team and an 11-member caretaking staff.
However, members of the inspection team, including Khalid, note that there is only one veterinarian responsible for the entire facility. “[There is] no diagnostic equipment [X-ray, microscope] available and the quarantine section comprises only a few vacant cages,” Khalid tells Eos.
Pereira was scathing in his assessment, saying that the clinic was “a dumping area masquerading as a medical room.” Another inspection team member, who requested not be named, says the operation theatre “was in disrepair and seemed not to have been used in years.”
Aside from that, the team highlighted issues ranging from animal tagging, record keeping, medical details and feed storage. Khalid says that the feed is stored under unhygienic conditions, with evidence of worms in freezers. He also points out that treatment records are maintained informally by the veterinarian and no standardised documentation system exists.
As of now, according to Siyal, the zoo houses 765 animals, including 121 mammals, 512 birds and 132 reptiles. These belong to 59 species in total. The records show that, while the zoo hosts a range of species, many of them are living alone, without mates. Among the unpaired animals are a female white lion, a female chimpanzee, a male puma, a male jackal, and a male Arabian oryx. The absence of appropriate pairs has long raised concerns among wildlife experts, who argue that social isolation adds another layer of stress to already confined animals. KMC acknowledges this imbalance but frames it as a logistical challenge rather than neglect.
Siyal also provided a list of prominent deaths over the past five years. These include a male white lion, a male zebra, both a male and female chimpanzee, a female tiger and a male tabby tiger.
WHERE TO NEXT?
Experts and activists who study Karachi Zoo agree on the diagnosis but diverge sharply on the solution. For Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar, the collapse reflects Pakistan’s broader reliance on generalists rather than specialists.
“Improving the zoo is neither difficult nor costly,” he tells Eos. “What it requires is leadership from a trained ecologist, a wildlife biologist, and an architect — expertise Pakistan has long sidelined.” He envisions a deliberate, well-designed improvement plan spanning two to five years, rooted in legislative reform and structural change.
But for Periera, reform isn’t enough. He argues for an orderly and humane phase-out of all captive wildlife, returning the facility to its original purpose as a botanical garden and heritage site — “a space for empathy, education and environmental awareness, not animal exploitation.”
Rano’s escape from Karachi Zoo is an emblem of what is possible when trained hands, structured care and institutional transparency align. But her story also reveals the extent of the suffering that remains. Her untreated wound, her years without a comforting human touch and her psychological scars reflect the experience of countless animals still confined in the failing institution she has finally left behind.
As Allen put it, “Karachi Zoo today stands as a mirror of administrative rot and cruelty, not of conservation or education.”
Its transformation into a space of compassion, accountability, and learning would not only honour the animals who have suffered within its walls but would finally bring meaning to Rano’s long-awaited freedom.

She was one of the lucky ones on Wednesday, when soldiers in military fatigues oversaw the distribution of rice to flood survivors.
Her town Sibolga has been almost entirely cut off after damage to access routes, leaving residents with no electricity and dwindling food, fuel and water.
“It has never been like this in Sibolga before,” said the 28-year-old, who waited at the state-owned rice warehouse in neighbouring Sarudik with her parents.
“There is no food, the money has run out, there are no jobs. How can we eat?” she said.

Flooding and landslides last week killed more than 770 people and buried homes, washed away bridges and severed transportation links across the island of Sumatra.
With many areas inaccessible by land and more rain expected, humanitarian groups warned that the scale of rescue and recovery efforts was unprecedented.
While the seaside town of Sibolga in Central Tapanuli district escaped the worst of the flood damage, it was left without electricity and little access to the rest of the country.
Nur called the situation an “emergency”, adding that people recently looted minimarkets in town.
“Imagine, people who should not have done that, did it because there is no helping hand from the government,” she told AFP.

Coordinating Human Development and Culture Minister Pratikno said that the rice handouts were part of its efforts to “ease the people’s burden”.
AFP saw the lucky recipients on Wednesday have their fingers marked with ink to prevent double distribution and hoarding.
Some men tossed the 50-kilogramme rice sacks on their backs, while women placed them atop their heads to carry them away.
Queues outside the warehouse and fuel pumps have begun to improve, though forecasts of fresh rain have raised fears of new damage and worsening shortages.
‘Everything is scarce’

Many stores in Sibolga remain shuttered with no electricity supply after the disaster. The few that remain open depend on generators.
Local resident Sahmila Pasaribu told AFP she spent hours searching for essential supplies.
Even if she had the money, she said “there is nothing that can be bought”.
“It’s sad that because of the disasters like this, everything is scarce: fuel, rice, cooking oil,” the 55-year-old said.

At a local government-owned water company office in Sibolga, Sopian Hadi filled gallon containers as a queue stretched behind him.
He said he has regularly visited the office over the past week after landslides disrupted the water line to his house.
“We need [water] for our daily lives… water is our source of life,” the 30-year-old grocery store owner said.
Other supplies are limited, and he described queuing for six hours to fill his motorcycle gas tank.
Despite the circumstances, Sopian said he refused to be beaten down by the situation.“I am not desperate, because to survive, [we] can’t despair.”

“He is not [a] Pakistani national or [of] Pakistan origin. He is an Afghan, spent a few years as a refugee [in Pakistan] and then went to the US, where he spent most of his life,” Andrabi said in a statement shared with journalists.
His clarification came after several media reports, including those from Indian and American news outlets, identified the suspect as a man of Pakistani origin.
A USA Today report said the arrested man, Luqman Khan, was a Pakistan-born US citizen, who was arrested on November 24.
Similarly, reports by the New York Post and India’s Hindustan Times and Times of India, among others, also identified him as a Pakistani immigrant.
According to a report by The Associated Press from earlier today, which also does not identify Khan as a man of Pakistani origin, the suspect was a student of the University of Delaware.
Meanwhile, a press release issued by the US Department of Justice on Dec 1 detailing charges against Khan identified him as a resident of Delaware’s Wilmington city and did not make any mention of his nationality.
It said that Khan was stopped by police at a traffic stop on November 24, and when he refused to comply, was arrested.
“During their investigation, officers discovered in Khan’s vehicle a .357 caliber Glock handgun loaded with 27 rounds,” it said. It added that officials also discovered a handwritten notebook, in which Khan discussed “additional weapons and firearms, how they could be used in an attack, and how law enforcement detection could be avoided once an attack was carried out”.
“The notebook referenced a member of the University of Delaware’s Police Department by name, and included a layout of a building with entry and exit points under which the words ‘UD Police Station’ were printed,” it said.
It added that later, law enforcement searched his residence and recovered “a Glock 19 9mm handgun equipped with an illegal machinegun conversion device, commonly called a ‘switch’”.
“Law enforcement also recovered a .556 rifle with a scope and a red dot sight, eleven more extended magazines, hollow point rounds of ammunition, and a two-plate tactical vest equipped with a single ballistic plate,” the department said.
According to the Department of Justice press release, Khan was charged with illegally possessing a machine gun on November 26.
“If convicted of the charge, Khan faces a maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment. If Khan is ultimately convicted, a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors,” it said.</p><small>2025-12-04 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/03214127d83c6c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958986/in-pictures-engine-roar-and-polished-chrome-steal-the-spotlight-at-lahore-car-meetups' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Engine roar and polished chrome steal the spotlight at Lahore car meetups</strong></a><br><p>Car enthusiasts from across Lahore gathered at a recent meetup to celebrate the passion that has long fuelled Pakistan’s automotive community.

A supermoon occurs when the moon reaches its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, causing it to appear unusually large and bright — up to 14 per cent larger and nearly 30pc brighter than a typical full moon.
The final supermoon of the year, known as the Cold Moon, will be visible across Pakistan tonight and tomorrow night, Radio Pakistan said, quoting the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco).
“It marks the third consecutive supermoon of the year and the last supermoon of 2025,” it said.
Suparco encourages the public, astronomy enthusiasts, students, and families to observe this natural spectacle, the report said.
“No special equipment is required; the supermoon will be easily visible to the naked eye, provided the skies remain clear,” it added.
According to CNN, the moniker ‘Cold Moon’ indicates that it’s the full moon event closest to the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.
The first of the three supermoons lit up the country’s skies on October 7, followed by another on November 5, called the Beaver Supermoon, which was “the closest, biggest, and brightest full moon of the year,” as per the space agency.
In September, a rare blood moon — a total lunar eclipse — eluded Karachi stargazers as heavy cloud cover blocked the view.</p><small>2025-12-04 06:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041019421e0940b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959136/probe-found-us-defence-secretarys-signal-use-to-discuss-strikes-on-yemen-could-have-put-us-troops-at-risk-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Probe found US defence secretary’s Signal use to discuss strikes on Yemen could have put US troops at risk: reports</strong></a><br><p>The Pentagon’s independent watchdog said US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of the commercial messaging app Signal to discuss strikes on Yemen could have put American troops at risk, US media reported on Wednesday.
The probe by the inspector general’s office concluded that Hegseth did not, however, violate rules on classification because he has the authority to declassify information, the reports said, citing sources familiar with the results of the investigation.
The watchdog’s conclusion — which has been transmitted to Congress — is nonetheless likely to reignite debate over conduct by Hegseth, who is already under fire over US strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats that experts say amount to extrajudicial killings.
The probe was sparked by the Atlantic magazine’s revelation in late March that its editor-in-chief was inadvertently included in a Signal chat in which US officials, including Hegseth and then-national security adviser Mike Waltz, discussed strikes on Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels.
The magazine initially withheld the details the officials discussed, but later published them after the White House insisted that no classified information was shared and attacked the editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, as a liar.
The chat included messages in which Hegseth revealed the timing of strikes hours before they happened and information on aircraft and missiles involved, while Waltz sent real-time intelligence on the aftermath of the military action.
In a post to X late on Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell called the review “a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth”.







Waltz fired, Hegseth survives
The Atlantic said that Waltz had set some of the Signal messages to disappear after one week, and others after four, saying it raised questions about whether federal records law was violated.
Trump rejected calls for Hegseth to be fired and largely pinned the blame on Waltz, whom he ultimately replaced as national security advisor, appointing him as US ambassador to the United Nations instead.
US media then reported in April that Hegseth had created a second Signal chat in which the March Yemen strikes were discussed with people, including his wife and brother, but the Pentagon chief likewise weathered that storm and remained in office.
The Houthis began targeting shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden after Israel’s offensive in Gaza began in 2023, claiming solidarity with Palestinians.
Houthi attacks prevented ships from passing through the Suez Canal, a vital route that normally carries about 12 per cent of world shipping traffic, forcing many companies into a costly detour around southern Africa.
The United States first began conducting strikes in response to the attacks under the Biden administration, and US forces launched a renewed air campaign against the Houthis on March 15.
Trump’s strikes against the Houthis lasted until early May, when a ceasefire agreement was reached with the help of Omani mediation.</p><small>2025-12-04 05:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0410070682606a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959134/trump-administration-orders-enhanced-vetting-for-applicants-of-h-1b-visa' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration orders enhanced vetting for applicants of H-1B visa</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration on Wednesday announced increased vetting of applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, with an internal State Department memo saying that anyone involved in “censorship” of free speech be considered for rejection.
H-1B visas, which allow US employers to hire foreign workers in speciality fields, are crucial for US tech companies which recruit heavily from countries including India and China.
Many of those companies’ leaders threw their support behind Trump in the last presidential election.
The cable, sent to all US missions on December 2, orders US consular officers to review resumes or LinkedIn profiles of H-1B applicants – and family members who would be travelling with them – to see if they have worked in areas that include activities such as misinformation, disinformation, content moderation, fact-checking, compliance and online safety, among others.
“If you uncover evidence an applicant was responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States, you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible,” under a specific article of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the cable said.
Details on the enhanced vetting for H-1B visas, including the focus on censorship and free speech, have not been previously reported.
The cable said all visa applicants were subject to this policy, but sought a heightened review for the H-1B applicants given they frequently worked in the technology sector “including in social media or financial services companies involved in the suppression of protected expression”.
“You must thoroughly explore their employment histories to ensure no participation in such activities,” the cable said.
The new vetting requirements apply to both new and repeat applicants.
“We do not support aliens coming to the United States to work as censors muzzling Americans,” a State Department spokesperson said, but added that it does not comment on “allegedly leaked documents”.
“In the past, the president himself was the victim of this kind of abuse when social media companies locked his accounts.
He does not want other Americans to suffer this way. Allowing foreigners to lead this type of censorship would both insult and injure the American people,” the spokesperson said.
The Trump administration has made free speech, particularly what it sees as the stifling of conservative voices online, a focus of its foreign policy.
Officials have repeatedly weighed in on European politics to denounce what they say is suppression of right-wing politicians, including in Romania, Germany and France, accusing European authorities of censoring views like criticism of immigration in the name of countering disinformation.
In May, Rubio threatened visa bans for people who censor speech by Americans, including on social media, and suggested the policy could target foreign officials regulating US tech companies.
The Trump administration has already significantly tightened its vetting of applicants for student visas, ordering US consular officers to screen for any social media posts that may be hostile towards the United States.
As part of his wide-ranging crackdown on immigration, Trump in September imposed new fees on H-1B visas.
Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly accused the administration of Democratic former president Joe Biden of encouraging suppression of free speech on online platforms, claims that have centred on efforts to stem false claims about vaccines and elections.</p><small>2025-12-04 05:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/04093530094c007.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959122/beware-your-dream-job-offer-can-be-a-nightmare-warns-fia' target='_blank'><strong>Beware! Your dream job offer can be a nightmare, warns FIA</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) says criminal syndicates are operating in Southeast Asia targeting Pakistanis with fake job offers and warned all those availing themselves of such “phony opportunities” should thoroughly verify to save them from trouble.
“Criminal syndicates operating in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia are targeting Pakistanis with fake job offers, especially in the IT sector – call center and relevant jobs, promising high salaries. However, upon arrival, these Pakistanis are forced into illegal activities, including cyber and financial crimes. Those who resist face severe consequences, including violence and extortion from the victim’s family,” FIA deputy director Mehmood Ali Khokhar said on Wednesday.

 

He urged the aspirants to first verify such job offers through legitimate sources or report such suspicious activity or persons to FIA.
“Beware of false promises! As your dream job offer could be a nightmare,” the FIA official said.

Criminal syndicates operate in Thailand, Myanmar and target Pakistanis with fake job offers

The FIA has also run a public campaign on social media in this regard after incidents surfaced wherein several Pakistanis were rescued from fake call centres in Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia.
Thai and Cambodian authorities this year conducted a joint raid on a three-story building suspected of housing a major cyber fraud operation. A total of 215 foreign nationals were freed, including 50 Pakistanis, 109 Thais, 48 Indians, five Taiwanese, and three Indonesians.
Similarly, in the other incident this year, the Thai army crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar led hundreds of trapped workers to flee across the border into Thailand. Some 38 Pakistanis were among those who crossed the border. Another 60 Pakistanis were in a shelter house awaiting identification and document verification for repatriation.
According to the FIA, the victims in these cases were often lured with false promises of lucrative jobs, but upon arrival, their passports were seized and they were forced into illegal cyber and financial crimes, such as “pig butchering” scams.
Hundreds of thousands of people reportedly are trafficked across Southeast Asia annually and forced into these scam operations.
Meanwhile, FIA Lahore Director Ali Zia paid a visit to the Allama Iqbal International Airport and reviewed the immigration counters and the facilities being provided to passengers. Immigration officials were instructed to ensure courtesy and complete transparency while dealing with passengers.
“Officers deployed at international departures and arrivals were directed to maintain the highest standards of professionalism in their conduct. The FIA is committed to strengthening the immigration system in line with international standards,” he said.
“Actions against illegal travel, fake visas, and human smuggling will be further intensified,” he said and reaffirmed the agency’s resolve that the FIA would continue its operations against human smuggling, illegal travel and corruption.

First it was an inquiry report by the KMC on the incident which attributed the tragedy to the “carelessness” of officials of the Red Line project and a department store adjacent to where the incident took place.
The body of the child, who died after falling into an open manhole near Nipa in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night, was found on Monday, around 15 hours after the incident.
The report by the KMC said that the department had received instructions from Mayor Murtaza Wahab and the municipal commissioner to initiate an operation for recovering the body of the child from the drain.

Assistant commissioner among five officials suspended by CM

It said that following the recovery of the child’s body “the site was meticulously inspected to ascertain the exact cause of the drowning”.
According to the report, the inspection revealed the ongoing BRT construction work at the location to be a “significant contributing factor”.
“Based on reports from the inspector concerned and area residents, the BRT construction has resulted in the severe damage and disruption of the entire drainage system, which runs from Nipa towards Aziz Bhatti Park,” it said.
“It was observed that, at most locations, the drains were covered with temporary two by two feet square covers. Unfortunately, one of these covers was reportedly left open in front of the departmental store. It is pertinent to mention that the procedure of covering cleaning pits with two by two feet square covers from Nipa to Aziz Bhatti Park road is a non-standard practice never implemented by the KMC at any location.”
It further stressed that BRT service officials had failed to formally notify or obtain clearance from the KMC before carrying out excavation work. “These pits were excavated by BRT officials and subsequently paved over during road construction,” the report said.
In light of those facts, the report concluded that the incident occurred due to the “carelessness of both the concerned BRT officials and the management of Chase Departmental Store” as “neither took adequate measures to secure the open drain”.
Blaming Red Line project represents ‘serious oversight’
However, within hours of the report hitting television screens and going viral across social media platforms, the Red Line management issued a strong rebuttal to the KMC’s claims, calling the findings “a distraction from the actual responsibilities” and insisting the tragedy occurred far from any of its construction activity.
In a letter to KMC authorities, it said that there has been no civil works activity on or near the site of the unfortunate incident.
“It is important to clarify that the location of the incident is at a considerable distance from the BRT Red Line construction works,” reads the letter, a copy of which is provided to Dawn.
“There is currently no excavation, no barrication for construction, or any form of activity by the BRT Red Line team at or near the incident site, even the road pavement is intact. Moreover, the BRT project has no administrative, operational, or maintenance responsibility for the sewerage or Nullah infrastructure where the incident occurred. Furthermore, there have been no civil works activity on or near the site of the unfortunate incident,” it said.

 

It said that the ongoing works of the BRT were initiated after obtaining a no-objection certificate from the relevant authorities, who all were taken on board for construction before start of any activity on the site.
“The parking area where the incident took place is utilised by the store and is [at] considerable distance from BRT works, thus, attributing this tragic incident to the BRT Red Line project represents serious oversight and distraction from the actual responsibilities,” added the letter.
Five officials suspended
Also on Wednesday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah ordered the suspension of five officials over their alleged negligence.
The officials are Senior Director of Municipal Services at KMC Imran Rajput, Assistant Executive Engineer of Town Municipal Corporation Gulshan-i-Iqbal Rashid Fayaz, Executive Engineer of Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation Waqar Ahmed, Gulshan Assistant Commissioner and Mukhtiarkar Amir Ali Shah and Salman Farsi.

The petitioner argued that Mr Khan was facing “multiple health complications” and “required assessment from specialist doctors”.
He claimed that the PTI founder had been jailed as a political victim under alleged pressure from the government and, therefore, was entitled to quality medical facilities in the interest of justice.
The Punjab government has been made a respondent in the petition through its prison department.
The IHC has fixed the petition for hearing and sought records from relevant authorities.

Plea moved by KP CM says ex-premier facing multiple health complications

The plea comes a day after Mr Khan’s sister, Uzma Khanum, dispelled rumours regarding her brother’s health following a supervised meeting with him in Adiala jail.
Speaking to the media, she said the former premier was “perfectly fine”, though “extremely angry” and alleging that he and his wife Bushra Bibi were being subjected to “mental torture” by confining them to a small room and denied communication for weeks.
She said her brother complained that he had not been allowed to meet anyone for four weeks and was confined to his cell most of the day with minimal time outdoors. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes and was held under strict monitoring without mobile devices.
Weekly protests
Separately, Aleema Khanum announ­ced that she and Uzma would stage a sit-in outside Adiala jail on Tuesdays until six family members and six lawyers were allowed visitation, while PTI workers would hold their own sit-in on Thursdays.
PTI supporters had staged demonstrations outside the jail and the IHC a day earlier to protest restrictions on the former prime minister’s visitation rights, claiming that no one had been allowed to meet him or Bushra Bibi since Oct 27. Islam­abad and Rawalpindi administrations had imposed Section 144 ahead of the protests.
Four protesters remanded to jail
Meanwhile, Judicial Magistrate Shahzad Khan on Wednesday sent four PTI workers to Adiala jail on judicial remand after they were arrested for violating the ban imposed on gatherings in twin cities by staging protests.
According to the police, the accused were detained from Sector G-14 and were found in possession of PTI flags, badges and photographs of Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi.
An FIR was registered at Sumbal police station, and the police told the magistrate that further investigation was underway.

Workers aged 55 and older have been the fastest-growing group in the US labour force for more than two decades. Their share has risen from 10 per cent in 1994 to 24pc in 2022. Yet the distribution of older workers is far from uniform across industries and states. Some sectors and regions have far higher concentrations of older employees than others, according to the Census Bureau’s survey of Business Dynamics Statistics of Human Capital (BDS-HC).
The utilities sector has seen the most dramatic shift. In 2006, 35pc of employment in this sector was at firms where at least a quarter of workers were over 55. By 2022, that figure had jumped to 80pc.

 

Manufacturing and wholesale trades have also seen substantial increases: in 2000, only 14pc of employment in these sectors was at firms with at least a quarter of older workers; by 2022, the share exceeded 40pc.
In contrast, Retail Trade and Accommodation and Food Services remain largely populated by younger workers. Only 14pc of Retail Trade employment and 10pc of Accommodation and Food Services employment is at firms with high shares of older employees.
State-level differences are equally pronounced. Maine, with the nation’s highest median age of 44.7 in 2022, has 39pc of employment at firms where at least a quarter of workers are over 55. Utah, the youngest state with a median age of 32, has only 14pc.
States with median ages between 39 and 41 — including New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois — have at least 30pc of employment at firms with high shares of older workers.
Even within states with older populations, patterns vary: Florida’s median age of 42.6 is higher than New York’s, yet only 25pc of employment is at firms with a quarter of older employees, reflecting differences in local industries and occupations. The survey also shows how workforce age shapes firm dynamics. Companies with more older workers tend to create fewer jobs and launch fewer new establishments, though they are equally likely to close existing ones compared with younger-workforce firms.
On average, firms with 25pc – 50pc of employees over 55 shrank about 2pc per year, while firms with less than 10pc older employees grew around 2pc. Start-ups are consistently younger: 10pc of employment at newly opened firms is at businesses where over half of workers are aged 19–24, compared with only 3pc at firms older than 11 years.
More mature firms are more likely to have higher shares of employees over 55, while start-ups tend to hire younger workers in their 20s, 30s, and early 40s.
Metro-level population trends reinforce the picture. Nearly all of the nation’s 387 metropolitan areas saw growth in residents aged 65 and older between 2020 and 2023, while about 80pc of metro areas experienced declines in children aged 0–14. Large metros such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago have seen the number of children decline, whereas younger metros like Provo–Orem–Lehi, Utah, and some Texas cities retain a lower median age and more children.

ISLAMABAD: Amid disagreements within the opposition party, PTI founding chairman Imran Khan has dissolved the party’s political committee in his first move after weeks of being incommunicado.
A tweet posted on his X account, which the ex-prime minister does not have access to while incarcerated, said a smaller committee would replace the existing body and put Salman Akram Raja in charge of the reconstitution process.
“I am dissolving the political committee of the PTI today. Party’s Secretary General Salman Akram Raja has full authority to form a smaller committee to formulate a political strategy and implement it,” the tweet based on the account of the Tuesday meeting said.







It may be noted that a day earlier, Uzma Khan met her brother in prison after weeks of effort.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram told Dawn the political committee, comprising about 40 members, would be replaced by a smaller body. been resolved, and a committee having fewer members will replace it. He said the new committee most likely will include provincial heads, leaders of the opposition, and a few other members.
Since the PTI’s intra-party elections have been repeatedly rejected by the Election Commission of Pakistan, the party does not have an elected leadership structure in the form of a core committee, and the day-to-day functions of the party are being handled by the political committee.
Senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser said the proposal for the dissolution of the political committee had been floated many a time by the members. He said one of the reasons for its dissolution was that its decisions were being leaked, adding that the timing of the decision did not matter since the proposal had been under consideration for some time. He said a coordination committee, comprising the provincial and central leaders as well as the allies, will be established instead.
It may be noted that an internal memo by the party was issued recently, which aimed to centralise control in the office of the secretary general, Salman Akram Raja.
The move had come under fire, as party insiders said it seemed to be an attempt to “end democracy and silence dissent” in the PTI.
Imran Khan also said Shahid Khattak should be appointed as the parliamentary leader in the National Assembly. It may be noted that Zartaj Gul, who was convicted earlier this year, was the parliamentary leader. Imran Khan also authorised Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to reorganise the body of the Insaf Lawyer Forum (ILF).
NDU meeting
The PTI founder also said there was no place for those who were fraternising with his opponents. “The participation of PTI people in the NDU workshop is shameful. On the one hand, we are enduring all kinds of hardships, and on the other hand, when our own people try to increase social ties with those who oppress us, I feel extremely hurt,” his tweet read.
This was an apparent reference to the presence of several PTI leaders at a workshop hosted by the National Defence Univ­e­r­sity. The participation att­racted flak on social media as well, particularly the “socialisation” at the eve­nt. KP spokesperson Shafi­ullah Jan, while speaking on a DawnNewsTV show, said these leaders participated in the NDU workshop after their names were forwarded by the parliamentary committee and the KP Assembly speaker.
He said in future, such decisions will be taken following the approval of the leadership.

The government has completely suspended customs clearance for both exports and imports, along with Afghan Transit Trade (ATT) cargos, at major border crossings — including Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda — effective October 12, and at the Chaman border from October 15.
An official letter was issued to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Directorate Gen­eral of Transit Trade to initiate the movement of consignments belonging to three United Nations agencies through the border crossings at Chaman and Torkham.
In the first phase, a total of 143 containers of humanitarian goods will be allowed for clearance at Chaman and Torkham. The breakdown shows that the containers incl­ude 67 containers of food assistance from the World Food Programme (WFP), 74 containers of supplies for children from Unicef, and two containers of healthcare and family support items from UNFPA.
Officials confirmed that the decision followed instr­uctions issued by the foreign ministry after consultations with the UN resident coordinator in Pakistan.
According to letter, the cargo movement will proceed in three stages: the first covers food shipments, the second covers medicine and medical equipment, and the third covers items for education services. More consignments are expected to follow once agencies provide updated requirements.
It further stated that the Directorate General of Transit Trade and FBR were requested to undertake the necessary actions for the clearance and onward transportation of the mentioned containers via Chaman and Torkham, as originally manifested under the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement and ATT rules.
Truck drivers and customs workers in Chaman and Torkham had faced long periods without cargo activity, with hundreds of vehicles parked along the routes during the closure.

 

Officials said the reopening applied only to humanitarian ATT cargos and did not signal the restoration of routine trade. Senior officials added that the remaining UN cargo lists would be shared in stages once documentation was verified.
In terms of transit cargo, approximately 495 vehicles are queued for border crossing at Torkham and Chaman. Of these, the majority — 412 vehicles — are stranded at Chaman, while the remaining 83 are held up at Torkham, the announcement added.

 

In the fiscal year 2024–25, Pakistan recorded transit trade imports valued at $1.012 billion, comprising a total of 42,959 containers.
