“Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the approval of a $1bn dollar instalment for Pakistan by the IMF and the failure of India’s high-handed tactics against it,” the PMO said.
The approval of the IMF’s executive board has led to an immediate disbursement of $1bn, bringing total disbursements under the loan programme to about $2bn. On successful completion of seven half-yearly reviews, Pakistan is entitled to seven equal instalments of about $1bn (SDR 760 million) under the loan programme.
Pakis­tan and the IMF had reached a three-year, $7bn aid package deal in July, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
The two sides had reached a staff-level agreement on March 25 on the first biannual review of the 39-month $7bn loan programme, agreeing on a series of reforms including the introduction of a carbon levy, timely revisions to electricity tariffs, increased water pricing and liberalisation of the automobile sector.
The staff-level agreem­ent also entailed a new 28-month RSF arrangement, providing total acc­ess to around $1.3bn (1bn special drawing rights, or SDRs).
This takes the combined size of the IMF support to about $8.3bn. The additional RSF fina­n­cing, unlike the bailout package’s biannual review and disbursement schedule, is subject to disbursement on completion of specific projects and policy actions to build climate resilience.
The board approval would be soon followed by another IMF mission visiting Pakistan to finalise the 2025-26 budget to be presented in the National Assembly in the first week of June.
The implementation of major reforms — including the carbon levy, water pricing and automobile protectionism — would begin gradually from July 1.
The overall ongoing fiscal consolidation will continue in the coming budget through a reduction in energy subsidies and tight development spending.</p><small>2025-05-09 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/091957189625492.jpg?r=195813' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909763/govts-priority-in-upcoming-budget-is-to-provide-relief-to-common-man-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Govt’s priority in upcoming budget is to provide relief to common man: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that the government’s priority in the upcoming budget was to provide relief to the common man, stating that all-out resources will be utilised to reduce the financial difficulties of the poor and the middle class.
Chairing a meeting on the preparation of the federal budget 2025-26, the premier directed that the upcoming budget should be prepared with a focus on sustainable export-driven growth and considering the projects to promote industries and increase production
“The budget should also focus extensively on the creation of jobs, agriculture, information technology, small and medium enterprises, and the housing sector,” he added.
The prime minister said that the government and private sector must work together for development and prosperity.
Calling the public-private partnerships and youth vocational training among the government’s priorities, the premier noted that positive results were emerging from the power sector reforms, as the reduction in electricity prices for industries would help promote industry and production.
He said that automation and digitisation were being promoted to bring transparency to the government system and facilitate the business community and investors, adding that the government would continue the process of rightsizing to reduce the size of the federal government in the next fiscal year.
During the briefing, it was revealed that consultations with the private sector on budget preparation had been in process for the past three months, besides consultative sessions with stakeholders from various sectors.
The meeting was informed that the five-year trade policy framework for 2025-30 and the e-commerce 2.0 framework would be completed soon, and a plan for tariff rationalisation was also being prepared.
The delegation of businessmen and experts expressed confidence in the government’s economic policies and presented their suggestions, which the prime minister welcomed, directing the inclusion of feasible proposals in the budget.
The meeting was attended by federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muhammad Aurangzeb, Jam Kamal Khan, Shaza Fatima, Sardar Awais Ahmad Leghari, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, Special Assistant to PM Haroon Akhtar, and relevant senior government officials.</p><small>2025-05-09 15:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09185948d2228db.jpg?r=190456' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909757/thousands-rally-in-bangladesh-seeking-ban-on-former-pms-party' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands rally in Bangladesh seeking ban on former PM’s party</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of people rallied on Friday outside the residence of Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus, demanding that he ban the political party of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Yunus, 84, has led an interim government since Hasina was overthrown by student-led mass protests in August 2024 and fled into exile as crowds stormed her palace.
Friday’s rally came after the sudden departure of Abdul Hamid, a former leader of Hasina’s Awami League party, from Bangladesh early on Thursday.
A crowd, mainly made up of young people, had started gathering outside Yunus’ residence on Thursday night.
Hasnat Abdullah, the chief organiser of the newly formed National Citizen’s Party, said the demonstration would continue until their demands were met.
“Sheikh Hasina robbed the people of Bangladesh of their democratic rights.
She manipulated the system to prevent any real opposition from participating in the election,” Kamrul said.
“We saw Abdul Hamid leave the country safely. The actions of certain advisers are highly suspicious. The delay in justice appears to be part of a broader plan to bring back the fallen dictator and her party,” he added.
Hasina remains in self-imposed exile in India and has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.
According to the United Nations, up to 1,400 protesters died in July when Hasina’s government launched a brutal crackdown on the opposition, for which she and Hamid are being investigated.
At least three police officers responsible for overseeing airport arrivals and departures have been dismissed for negligence, according to officials, after Hamid’s departure.
While citizens are generally barred from assembling outside the chief adviser’s residence, the student demonstrators were allowed through. The government said on Friday it was seriously considering the demand raised by various quarters to ban the Awami League.
“The government has begun communicating with different political parties to reach a final decision on the matter. It has reviewed UN-documented evidence of atrocities committed by the Awami League and its affiliates,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-05-09 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09180548cd67464.jpg?r=180606' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909752/karachi-to-host-35th-national-games-in-december-murad-shah' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to host 35th National Games in December: Murad Shah</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah announced on Friday that Karachi would host the 35th National Games from December 6 to 13 after it was  postponed from its initial dates in May.
The games were set to be held from May 1-9 in Karachi but were postponed in April due to “unavoidable circumstances,” according to an official letter issued by the Sindh Olympic Association.
Murad held a meeting today at CM House with a high-level delegation of the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) to finalise preparations for the games.
He welcomed the opportunity to host National Games, pledging full cooperation to ensure the games are organised in accordance with international standards.
He directed all relevant departments to provide essential facilities to athletes, including training, medical care, transportation, and modern infrastructure.
CM Murad announced the construction of a new swimming pool and  acquisition of modern electronic timing and scoring systems. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was also signed between the POA, the Government of Sindh, and the Sindh Olympic Association to establish a coordinated framework for organising the games.
“This initiative will be a milestone for athlete welfare and institutional coordination,” the CM said. He emphasised the importance of nurturing young talent and promoting broader interest in sports across the province.
POA President Arif Saeed briefed the chief minister on the history of the National Games and lauded the government’s commitment to their development. He noted that the upcoming event has already sparked fresh enthusiasm among athletes nationwide.
Both the Government and the POA reaffirmed their dedication to enhancing athlete performance and making the 35th National Games a landmark event in Pakistan’s sporting history.
The POA delegation was led by its President, Arif Saeed, and included Senior Vice President Ms. Fatima Lakhani, Secretary General Khalid Mehmood, and Sindh Secretary Ahmed Ali Rajput. Also present were Principal Secretary to CM Agha Wasif and Sports Secretary Aleem Lashari. Secretary Abdul Aleem Lashari gave a detailed briefing on the ongoing preparations, logistics, and planning for the upcoming games.</p><small>2025-05-09 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09162358958e49b.jpg?r=172304' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746/unfortunate-that-indias-reckless-conduct-brought-two-nuclear-armed-states-closer-to-major-conflict-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Unfortunate that India’s reckless conduct brought two nuclear-armed states closer to major conflict: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Friday said it was unfortunate that “India’s reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict” as military tensions between Pakistan and India escalate.
The statement comes amid the ongoing escalation between Pakistan and India, which started after New Delhi launched attacks in several Pakistani cities. Islamabad promptly responded to the attacks.
The escalation began following the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, killing 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
While addressing his weekly press briefing in Islamabad today, FO Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: “Indian actions are a flagrant violation of the UN charter, international law, and established norms governing interstate relations.
 






“It is most unfortunate that India’s reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict,” he said.
“India’s jingoism and war hysteria should be a source of serious concern for the world,” he added.
The spokesperson noted that South Asia is home to one-fifth of the world’s population, who can “ill-afford the irresponsible actions like the ones being carried out by India.”
He said that in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has “once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace.”
The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan rejected any attempt to link it to the attack in Pahalgam.
He noted that a number of countries and international organisations had called on both countries to exercise restraint over the past two weeks, and it was “highly deplorable that India did not pay heed to these calls”.
“The international community should hold India accountable for its irresponsible, unlawful and belligerent conduct,” he said.
He rebutted referenced remarks made yesterday by India’s Foreign Secretary Shri Vikram Misri during a press briefing.
“The assertion that Pakistan escalated the situation through the Pahalgam attack of April 22 is totally absurd. To date, India has not been able to produce any credible and verifiable evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the attack.
“To the contrary, the acts of aggression committed by its armed forces had the approval and support of its entire government,” he said. “Thus, it is India that has escalated the situation by violating Pakistan’s sovereignty and killing civilians.”
He continued that “the Pakistani forces did not attack Pahalgam, but the Indian forces did attack multiple locations in Pakistan,” adding that Pakistan reserves the right to take all measures in its self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.
Earlier in the day, state-run PTV said that Pakistan has taken down a total of 77 Indian drones so far.
The spokesperson noted that on April 26, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for a “neutral and transparent” investigation into the Pahalgam attack, yet “India chose the path of belligerence and aggression.”
“We are amazed to see the importance Pakistan attaches to the anonymous and devious social media post upon which it has bid the case for the resistance front’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack,” Khan said.
“Can any country in the world be allowed to attack another country on the basis of a few social media posts? India is attempting to act as the judge, jury and executioner.”
He added that “while India portrays itself as a victim of terror, it conveniently ignores its own role in planning, sponsoring and abetting terrorism in Pakistan.”
The FO spokesperson said Indian claims of targeting terrorists or terrorist infrastructure “are blatantly false [and] it is a matter of record that Indian strikes resulted in the martyrdom of civilians, including women and children.”
 
 

He noted that Pakistan was “well within its rights” to demand that India be held accountable for its “crimes”, referring to Indian strikes on mosques in Pakistan. As many as three civilians were kil­led when four Indian missiles struck Jamia Masjid Ummul Qura and an ad­­joining house in Muridke, some 40 kilometres from Lahore.
Khan said that “the current Indian dispensation is bent upon weaponising water; holding in abeyance of IWT is unilateral and illegal.
“Pakistan is an agrarian economy. Millions of people are dependent on the water being regulated by the treaty. The Indian decision is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and the economy.
“For Pakistan, the Indian announcement is of no legal consequence. The treaty remains enforced and fully binding on the parties,” he said.
He further said that the Indian allegation of Pakistan’s refusal to enter into government-to-government negotiations is incorrect. “Pakistan has been continuously engaged with India on the subject.”
“We particularly regret the Indian foreign secretary’s indecent and undiplomatic remarks that Pakistan has been in the habit of lying since its creation in 1947. We expected better from a diplomat of his status,” he said.
“It is most unfortunate that nowadays, India’s ruling dispensation is trying to rewrite history, making a number of absurd claims. India’s founding fathers must be turning in their graves.
“In fact, India remains a permanent factor of instability in the region owing to its hegemonic ambitions. It has constantly been working to destabilise its smaller neighbours and has stonewalled all efforts to promote regional cooperation.”</p><small>2025-05-09 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/091751577518391.gif?r=175213' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909699/from-journalism-to-jingoism-for-the-indian-media-truth-be-damned' target='_blank'><strong>From journalism to jingoism: For the Indian media, truth be damned</strong></a><br><p>In war, truth is the first casualty. The Indian media, it would appear, isn’t happy to just kill the truth. Over the last few days, hysterical war-crazed news anchors, buoyed by trolls and pundits on social media, have made every effort to crush the truth, stomp on it, tear it up, chop it into fine pieces, set it on fire and throw away the ashes in the Indian Ocean.
When Greek dramatic Aeschylus (525/524 bc — 456/455 bc) coined the phrase, he may have been referring to the propaganda spread by states through scrolls and word of mouth. That was a simpler time — states could get away with untruths and falsehoods, with the other side none the wiser.
It takes a different kind of arrogance, however, to try to pull this off in the 21st century, when the information ecosystem is no longer inhibited by geographical limitations or even the imperative of a closed media landscape.
Into the metaverse
Over the last 24 hours, in particular, the kind of disinformation coming out of the Indian information ecosystem has been particularly bewildering — ranging from the incredulous to batshit crazy. To put this in context, here’s what the Indian media would have you believe was going on in Pakistan on the night of Thursday and Friday:

The Karachi Port had been destroyed by the Indian Navy (It wasn’t, we
know. We had shrimp karahi and grilled Red Snapper at a restaurant
adjacent to it.)

 



The Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir was arrested following a
coup (No one in Pakistan knows this but the Indian media is super confident.)

 



The Indian Army had attacked and laid claim to Islamabad and Shehbaz Sharif had been shifted to a safe house (could they also please let us know where this ‘safe house’ is?)

 



An F-16 or a JF-17 Pakistani fighter jet had been shot down (This one was confusing to the Indians too because they couldn’t decide which one they wanted to have shot down.)

 



A Pakistan Air Force pilot had been captured (They really can’t get over Abhinandan, can they?)

 



Lahore was overrun by Indian forces (What even is this obsession with Lahore? They’ll just misdirect you back to India)

 


It would be almost comical if it wasn’t so morose. Since the Indian military carried out airstrikes in Pakistan on Wednesday, over 31 civilians have been slain on this side of the border, while dozens have been injured. There are reports of casualties on the other side too. And while civilians pay the ultimate cost, the Indian media has continued to beat the war drums, cheering the BJP government’s unhinged rhetoric with some even calling for the complete annihilation of Pakistan — a country of 250 million people.
One can only imagine how dim-witted you have to be to cheer a war between two nuclear-armed countries. And yet, the Indian media seems to have no qualms about the impending doom should this escalate any further.
Let saner heads prevail
In a parallel universe, where sanity isn’t lost to jingoism and anchors aren’t screeching war cries, the media on both sides of the border would attempt to act as a communication bridge and simmer down tensions in a what is already a volatile situation.
Good journalism relies on facts, not fiction. Good journalism questions authorities’ actions, instead of inciting them to commit more acts of violence. Good journalism seeks to investigate rather than gulp down the state narrative. Most of all, good journalism calls for speaking the truth and trying to get the other side’s version, particularly in times of conflict where there is a huge cost to pay for the minutest misunderstanding.
Misreporting can also create panic among the people and pile on the pressure for action, giving rival actors little time to process and strategise before they make a move, leading to even graver consequences. Moreover, it is equally important to keep your own people adequately informed so they can make decisions for their own safety.
According to handbook on Conflict-Sensitive Reporting published by the German-based Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, in times of conflict, the media must play its role for consensus-building, correcting misconceptions and humanising the other side, among other functions.
Granted, there will always be the fog of war. A lack of credible, verifiable information, combined with misinformation are a part of conflict. It is difficult to know what is happening in real time, and even for a long time afterwards — but the Indian media went far beyond that to report entirely made-up events.
At the same time, the Indian media has never exactly been known for its predilection for the truth. In fact, quite the contrary — in 2016, the EU Disinfo Lab’s excellent report, titled India Chronicles, uncovered a rather sophisticated disinformation campaign involving “resurrected dead media, dead think-tanks and NGOs” to serve Indian interests.
But what we have witnessed over the last couple of days is one for the history books. It’s not just the self-proclaimed pundits on social media peddling the state’s narrative and dehumanising people on this side of the border; it’s not even the mainstream media’s blatant disregard for facts and accuracy when pushing the BJP government’s vitriol; what is most incredible is that many seemingly progressive voices seemed only too eager to jump the bandwagon and push the same falsehoods, sprinkled with cries of war and revenge.
All of this begs the question: was this all about ratings? Perhaps, but it is more likely a  sloppy, panicked attempt to save face, even if temporarily, in front of a bloodthirsty population amid international confirmation of IAF jets being shot down. It was, after all, incredibly humiliating for India to lose multiple jets, especially the much-vaunted Rafale — the purchase of which was at the heart of a corruption scandal in India — in a single ‘surprise’ operation. Coincidentally, the media blitz began just before a Reuters story of US officials confirming it.
Perhaps this was part of the psychological operations against their own people to create the impression of a victorious India for the time being. What no one seemed to care about was a potential backlash from the masses who have been cheering them on once the truth does come out or even the dent in the credibility and moral legitimacy of the Indian media in the eyes of international observers.
As I write this, there are reports that the Indian government has banned The Wire, one of the few publications questioning the popular narrative. In a sea of yes-men, The Wire stood out, refusing to lap up the hateful rhetoric and trying to tell the full story. It’s about time more Indian journalists realise that becoming the BJP’s propaganda arm and spewing hate for those across the border will only take them so far — without credibility and the courage to speak to the truth, a journalist is but a pen-pusher.</p><small>2025-05-09 12:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0916190450c5004.jpg?r=161926' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909732/workers-remittances-clock-in-32bn-for-april' target='_blank'><strong>Workers remittances clock in $3.2bn for April</strong></a><br><p>Remittances from overseas Pakistani workers clocked in at $3.2 billion for the month of April, up 13 per cent year-on-year, according to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data released on Friday.
Topline Securities, a brokerage firm in Karachi, noted, “Worker remittances clocked in at US$3.2bn, up 13pc YoY in Apr-2025.
“This takes 10MFY25 remittances to US$31bn, up 31pc YoY,” it added.
 


According to the firm, inflows during April were mainly sourced from Saudi Arabia ($725m), UAE ($658m), UK ($535m), and US ($302m).
Earlier, the government had set a target of $35bn in remittances for the current fiscal year (FY25), but financial experts believe the inflow would exceed the estimate. “The inflows could reach up to $36bn in FY25,” said a currency dealer in the banking market.
A study published by the Asian Development Bank found that Pakistani migrants tend to remit more when economic conditions are improving back home and when there is a positive association between remittances and domestic economic activity.
The study’s findings indicate that domestic and abroad economic activity is positively associated with remittances to Pakistan.</p><small>2025-05-09 11:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0915520954ea7a4.jpg?r=164013' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909733/new-pope-leo-xiv-vows-to-bring-light-to-worlds-dark-nights' target='_blank'><strong>New Pope Leo XIV vows to bring light to world’s ‘dark nights’</strong></a><br><p>Pope Leo XIV on Friday celebrated his first Mass in Vatican City’s Sistine Chapel where he was elected less than 24 hours earlier and prayed that his historic papacy can help the Catholic Church be a beacon illuminating “the dark nights of this world”.
Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost and the first US pope, looked serene as he said the Mass in the famous, frescoed chapel with the same cardinals who chose him to be the 267th pontiff and the successor to Pope Francis.
Dressed in relatively simple white and gold vestments, Leo, who was born in Chicago but spent two decades as a missionary in Peru, said a few words in English before continuing his homily in fluent Italian. He painted the spiritual picture of the Church he would like to see under his papacy.
“God has …. entrusted this treasure to me so that, with his help, I may be its faithful administrator for the sake of the entire mystical Body of the Church,” he said.
“He has done so in order that she may be ever more fully a city set on a hill, an ark of salvation sailing through the waters of history and a beacon that illumines the dark nights of this world,” he added, according to the official translation.
The 1.4 billion-member Church, was great not because of “the magnificence of her structures or the grandeur of her buildings … but rather through the holiness of her members.”
Swift Appointment
Leo, aged 69, was elected at the end of a swift two-day conclave that was wrapped up on Thursday evening when white smoke billowed from the chimney of the chapel.
Before his election, US cardinals had largely been written off as papal contenders because of a widespread assumption that the global Church could not be run by a superpower pope.
However, he also holds Peruvian citizenship, meaning that he has deep knowledge of both the West and less developed nations.
After the Mass, Leo will have lunch with the cardinals who elected him and they will then be free to leave the Vatican and return to their homes around the world.
The successor to Pope Francis, who died last month at the age of 88, inherits a number of major challenges, ranging from a budget shortfall to divisions over whether the Church should be more welcoming towards the LGBT community and divorcees, and should let women play a greater role in its affairs.
US President Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Leo. However, the new pope has a history of criticizing Trump and Vice President JD Vance’s policies, according to posts on the X account of Robert Prevost.
The new pope worked for decades in the north of Peru, first as a missionary and later as Bishop of Chiclayo from 2015 to 2023. Catholics took to the streets of the small city in northwestern Peru, and church bells rang out to celebrate the election of a man who they embraced as one of their own.
One of the clues to what kind of a Church leader Leo would be was in his choice of name, something that pontiffs often use to send a signal about the priorities of their new papacy.
The last pope with this name was Leo XIII, who led the Church from 1878-1903. He was known for his devoted focus on social justice issues and is often credited with laying the foundation for modern Catholic social teaching.
Prevost became a cardinal only in 2023. He has given a few media interviews and is known to have a shy personality.
Francis brought him to Rome two years ago to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops across the globe, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world’s bishops.</p><small>2025-05-09 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0911072972b8454.jpg?r=110740' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909677/psx-gallops-to-recovery-after-day-of-historic-losses' target='_blank'><strong>PSX gallops to recovery after day of historic losses</strong></a><br><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recovered nearly 4,000 points on Friday after the index suffered its largest-ever plunge a day earlier, causing losses to the tune of Rs820 billion loss to equity investors following Indian drone attacks in major cities across the country.
The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 799.65, or 0.77 per cent, to stand at 104,326.46 from the previous close of 103,526.81 at 11:06am.
At 4:31pm, the index recovered 3647.82, or 3.52pc, to stand at 107,174.63 from the last close.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, said that after falling sharply by 6pc yesterday, the stocks had recovered.
“So far, there has been no news of any major escalation which helped restore confidence,” he said.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted, “Stocks on the PSX remained volatile today, opening higher as participants increasingly factored in that an all-out war with India is unlikely.
“Some investors have begun accumulating stocks trading at highly attractive valuations following the sharp drawdown over the past week,” he added.
“Technical analysts also noted this morning that the market had entered oversold territory,” Farooq said.
On yesterday’s decline, he stated it was primarily “driven by individuals unwinding leveraged positions and redemptions from mutual funds”.
“Such corrections and short-term volatility are a normal feature of equity markets,” he said, adding that they continued to “advise that only long-term investors participate in the market, maintaining discipline during periods of uncertainty and gradually building their portfolios over time”.
“Market attention now remains on developments in Pakistan-India tensions and the IMF board meeting scheduled for today, where Pakistan’s next tranche will be considered,” he said.
Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, noted that the primary reason behind the recovery was investor optimism regarding the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting today.
“Most likely, the Executive Board will approve the tranche today,” she said.
The Fund is set to meet today to approve the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing Extended Fund Faci­li­ty and allow an additional arrangement for the $1.3bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
Furthermore, she highlighted that the market now provided “attractive valuations” due to yesterday’s market dip.
“Lastly, fears of a major escalation have been placated due to no major development on that front,” she added.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said that the “panic triggered by yesterday’s drone attacks from the Indian side is subsiding, as the Pakistan Armed Forces demonstrated ability to intercept the threats has reassured investors”.
“The recent market correction following the onset of the escalation has presented investors with a valuable opportunity to build their portfolios at more attractive valuations,” he added.
The market capital had lost Rs1.3 trillion in value in the previous three sessions as jittery investors preferred to exit the market amid growing uncertainty about the economic outlook as geopolitical tensions turned into a military standoff after India hit three cities with missiles in the wee hours of Wednesday, martyring over 31 innocent civilians. Pakistan’s armed forces responded with the downing of five Indian fighter planes.
The market crash followed alarming geopolitical developments after ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry announced that Pakistani forces had neutralised 25 drones sent by India since last night. He also confirmed that four army personnel were injured after one drone managed to partially strike a military target, despite the majority being intercepted.

“The legal fate of some 103 individuals facing military trials remained in limbo from December 2023 till Tuesday, a period of about a year and a half,” noted Dawn’s editorial today.
The 5-2 verdict by the Constitutional Bench overturns an earlier ruling that had declared military trials of civilians null and void, and restores key sections of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) that allow military jurisdiction over certain civilian offences.
The bench not only overturned that decision but also restored three contentious provisions of the PAA that had previously been struck down. It also directed the government to introduce legislation within 45 days to ensure that civilians tried in military courts are granted the right to appeal their sentences in a high court.
However, the decision was not unanimous — the two dissenting judges, Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afghan — declared military court convictions “without jurisdiction” and unconstitutional. Rights groups and leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have likewise decried the ruling, citing concerns over due process.
The legal fraternity has weighed in too, warning that the judgment threatens the right to a fair trial and chips away at civilian justice system.
‘Total surrender of civilian rights’
Lawyer Basil Nabi Malik criticised the SC’s verdict, calling it “as shambolic as it was hurried”. He added, however, that the ruling was unfortunately expected. “As many are saying out loud nowadays, the purpose of the 26th Amendment has been achieved. And with history as its witness, judges are being said to be doing the bidding of the ruling elite, once again,” he remarked.
Malik added that the verdict shows “a total surrender of civilian rights”, with “fundamental rights becoming nothing more than irrelevant provisions in a Constitution that is being treated like a book of fiction by those ordained to protect it”.
‘A setback for our justice system’
In a similar vein, Barrister Rida Hosain said that by sanctioning the trial of civilians by military courts, “the court has surrendered our fundamental rights and displayed a complete lack of faith in the civilian justice system. The verdict is a huge setback for our justice system”.
“In a remarkable finding, the court held that the right to a fair trial is ‘fully protected’ under the Army Act. Under military law, members of the executive act as judges, trials take place behind closed doors, and there is no reasoned judgment. Fundamental rights are at the discretion of executive authorities, who grant or deny them at their whim,” she noted.
Hosain further pointed out an apparent contradiction in the judgment’s reasoning: “The court has referred the matter to Parliament for ‘considering and making’ a law providing an independent right of appeal to the High Court. If the right to a fair trial is protected in military courts, why is an independent right to appeal required?” According to her, “this is a concession by the bench, that the law, as it currently stands, does not comply with fair trial standards”.
“Civilian judges have revived a law first introduced by a military dictator, Ayub Khan, allowing the court martial of civilians. The order is rife with contradictions and undermines the principle of institutions acting within their constitutional domain,” she concluded.
‘Death of citizens’ right to a fair trial’
Drawing on the said concerns, lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig added that the ruling “spells the death of citizens’ right to a fair trial”.
“While the announcement of the verdict coinciding with India launching an attack on Pakistan may have obviated any serious critique, the judgment gives short shrift to the ways in which military court trials offend against the right to due process and a fair trial,” he pointed out.
Like Rida, he expressed concern over the erosion of public trust in the judiciary, noting: “With serious concerns already surrounding the constitutional benches formed after the 26th Amendment, the judgment further erodes public confidence in the SC’s ability to uphold citizens’ rights”.
Baig, however, admitted that it would be remiss to not acknowledge the importance of Justice Mandokhel and Afghan’s dissents, adding, “Will the brooding spirit of the law heed their words though?”
Absence of an independent forum of appeal
Lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii described the SC’s ruling as “devoid of any reasoning other than the regurgitation of facts as narrated by the government”. He shed light on the absence of an independent forum of appeal against such convictions rendered by military courts. “The judgement is pinned upon the hope that an admitted fundamental legal defect … will hopefully be cured,” he says.
Jaferii went on to argue that the Constitutional Benches had fulfilled their mandate. “They have given back to the establishment the ability to play judge, jury and executioner with civilians they deem worthy of their attention,” he said. Referring to the delay in the court’s decision, he added, “These benches took six months after the 26th Amendment to put this order together. It was perhaps an effort to try and make us all forget this was their raison d’être (reason for being)”.
Institutional inconsistency
“The recent short order reveals how deep the rot runs,” commented lawyer Ahmad Maudood Ausaf.
He noted that legal scholars across the board have long maintained that military courts clash with fundamental rights — particularly the right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution. “That debate has been laid bare, and I will not revisit its anatomy here,” he remarked.
Instead, he highlighted the court’s institutional inconsistency. “In a common law jurisdiction where precedent is seminal, what demands urgent attention is how, within just six months, the court has reversed its decision without any change in facts, law, or context,” he said. “Such institutional inconsistency doesn’t just confuse precedent — it erodes the trust essential for the apex court to exercise its writ”.
“Some might even argue that the court has lost its writ, or a significant part of it, as a consequence of its past decisions and their execution. And if the honourable justices continue interpreting in the same fashion, one must ask: how relevant will the apex court remain?” he said, questioning the very authority of the court in the public eye.
He also cast doubt on the timing of the ruling, stating, “At a time when Pakistan confronts a palpable external threat from India, this judgment — so hollow in reasoning and so strategically timed — feels like a quiet calculation: perhaps, under the pressure of war drums, the public would look away”.
“An effort to dismantle judicial independence
According to lawyer Zainab Shahid the SC’s short order, is “a major setback for fundamental rights, constitutionalism and the separation of powers in Pakistan”. She argued the ruling is the result of a “two-year executive effort to dismantle judicial independence”, particularly through the 26th Amendment aimed at overturning the court’s earlier decision against military trials.
Shahid said the judgment “makes a mockery of Articles 8(5) and 10A of the Constitution,” which guarantee the right to a fair trial and prohibit suspension of fundamental rights except as clearly provided by the Constitution. “The Constitution envisions an exception for members of the armed forces — not civilians,” she stressed.
Criticising the bench’s reliance on the government’s narrative of the May 9 events, she said the court “assumes the guilt of those involved” and aims to “make an example of PTI’s protestors” while sidestepping why ordinary courts aren’t fit to try civilians.
She also flagged a “bizarre contradiction” in the ruling: while claiming military courts uphold due process, the bench still asked the government to legislate an independent right to appeal. “This convoluted judicial maneuver is more likely to be a face-saving device… than a just outcome for civilians left at the mercy of court martials,” she said.</p><small>2025-05-09 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909605/military-trials' target='_blank'><strong>Military trials</strong></a><br><p>THE October 2023 judgement had been widely hailed as ‘historic’. The one issued by five judges this Tuesday will one day prove equally significant, albeit for entirely different reasons. Earlier this week, while Pakistanis were still cheering for their air force after it successfully tackled the late-night marauders next door, the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench threw a wet blanket on the public mood with the announcement that it was restoring sections of the Pakistan Army Act that allow for civilians to be court-martialled.
Ruling with a 5-2 majority, the bench overturned the unanimous decision issued in October 2023 by five senior justices of the Supreme Court — including three who are still serving, most notably the incumbent chief justice of Pakistan — who had ruled that there could be no justification under the Constitution for military trials of civilians.
It may be recalled that the original judgement also ruled that all cases against civilians being tried under the Act should be transferred to civilian courts, where they would be retried under ordinary criminal law. Unfortunately, that was never to be.
The latest ruling issued by the Constitutional Bench was salt on the wound for many in the legal community, who had hailed the original judgement for restoring a measure of sanctity, fairness, transparency and due process in the Pakistani justice system, only to see it taken away within two months by an appellate bench set up by former chief justice Qazi Faez Isa.
It may also be recalled that, as the then senior puisne judge had alleged, this appellate bench was formed in violation of the Practice and Procedure Act and in response to petitions moved by controversial caretaker governments whose tenure had already exceeded their constitutional expiry dates. To top it off, the appellate bench was then handed over to a judge who had already revealed their mind on the military trial of civilians.
Thereafter, the legal fate of some 103 individuals facing military trials remained in limbo from December 2023 till Tuesday, a period of about a year and a half. The final call was to undo the gains achieved for civilian rights under the original verdict and revert to status quo ante. Sadly, while the people took heart from the victory in the skies, they were defeated by the courts. It is up to the people to draw their own conclusions.

Security analysts and diplomats say China’s military modernisation has reached a point where it has the ability to deeply scrutinise Indian actions in real-time from its border installations and Indian Ocean fleets as well as from space.
“From an intelligence perspective, this is a rare target of opportunity right on China’s borders involving a key potential adversary,” said Singapore-based security analyst Alexander Neill.
Two US officials said a Chinese-made J-10 Pakistani jet fighter shot down at least two Indian military planes — one of them a French-made Rafale fighter.
India has not acknowledged the loss of any of its planes while Pakistan’s defence and foreign ministers have confirmed the use of J-10 aircraft but have not commented on which missiles or other weapons were used.
The aerial clash is a rare opportunity for militaries around the world to study the performance of pilots, fighter jets and air-to-air missiles in active combat, and use that knowledge to prepare their own air forces for battle.
Competing regional giants and nuclear powers, India and China are widely seen as long-term strategic rivals, sharing a 3,800 (2,400 mile) Himalayan border that has been disputed since the 1950s and sparked a brief war in 1962.
The most recent standoff — which started in 2020 — thawed in October as the two sides struck a patrolling agreement.
Security analysts say both sides have taken steps to strengthen their military facilities and capabilities along the border, but it is also from above that China packs an intelligence-gathering punch.
The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) notes that China now fields 267 satellites — including 115 devoted to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and a further 81 that monitor military electronic and signals information. It is a network that dwarfs its regional rivals, including India, and is second only to the US.
“Both in terms of space and missile tracking capabilities, China is much better off now in terms of being able to monitor things as they happen,” said Neill, who is an adjunct fellow at Hawaii’s Pacific Forum think-tank.
China’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters’ questions about the deployment of its military satellites and other questions about its intelligence gathering.
Pakistan’s military media wing and information minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on any information sharing with China. Pakistan has previously said it has an “all-weather strategic, cooperative partnership” with China.
India has not commented on the issue, but its top diplomat in Britain, High Commissioner Vikram Doraiswami, told Sky News on Thursday that China’s relationship with Pakistan was not a concern for India.
“China requires a relationship with all of its neighbours, that includes us,” he said.
Missile deployments
Chinese military intelligence teams would be eager to garner information on any Indian use of air defences and launches of cruise and ballistic missiles - not just in terms of flight paths and accuracy but also command and control information, analysts and diplomats say.
Any deployment of India’s BrahMos supersonic cruise missile — a weapon it developed jointly with Russia — would be of particular interest, some analysts say, given they do not believe it has been used in combat.
China has also beefed up its intelligence gathering at sea. It has been increasingly active in the Indian Ocean in recent years, with China deploying space tracking ships as well as oceanographic research and fishing vessels on extended deployments, open-source intelligence trackers say.
Regional diplomats say that while the Chinese navy has been relatively cautious about extensive warship deployments into the Indian Ocean, still lacking a broad network of bases, it actively seeks intelligence with these other vessels.
Over the last week, some trackers noted unusually large fleets of Chinese fishing vessels moving apparently in unison to within 120 nautical miles of Indian naval drills in the Arabian Sea as tensions rose with Pakistan.
Pentagon reports on China’s military modernisation and analysts note that China’s fishing fleets routinely perform a coordinated militia function that plays an important intelligence-gathering role.
“These vessels may double up as listening posts, tracking development rhythms and response patterns, feeding early warning, naval intel to their sponsors,” wrote open source tracker Damien Symon in an X post that highlighted the deployment of 224 Chinese vessels near Indian naval exercises on May 1.
Chinese officials do not usually acknowledge the existence of fishing militia or intelligence work carried out by other nominally civilian vessels.
Given its deep and broad strategic relationship with Pakistan, Beijing can also be expected to fully exploit its network of envoys and military teams there for key nuggets.
“The presence of Chinese military advisers and other personnel in Pakistan is well-known given how Pakistan’s Ministry of Defence has been importing some of its most advanced military hardware from China, so we can be certain the PLA would be able to access relevant data,” said James Char, a Chinese security scholar at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.</p><small>2025-05-09 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09123102d8b5801.jpg?r=123106' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909693/bcci-suspends-ipl-with-immediate-effect-for-one-week' target='_blank'><strong>BCCI suspends IPL ‘with immediate effect for one week’</strong></a><br><p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to suspend the remainder of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 “with immediate effect for one week”, according to a statement on Friday.
An IPL match on Thursday was abandoned midway after fighting began in India’s border regions, but the cricket board attributed the disruption to a power failure at the stadium in the hill city of Dharamsala.
“Further updates regarding the new schedule and venues of the tournament will be announced in due course after a comprehensive assessment of the situation in consultation with relevant authorities and stakeholders,” said the statement from BCCI Honorary Secretary Devajit Saikia, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
“The decision was taken by the IPL Governing Council after due consultation with all key stakeholders following the representations from most of the franchisees, who conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans; while the BCCI reposes full faith in the strength and preparedness of our armed forces, the Board considered it prudent to act in the collective interest of all stakeholders.
“At this critical juncture, the BCCI stands firmly with the nation. We express our solidarity with the Government of India, the Armed Forces and the people of our country,” the statement said.
“While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country. The BCCI remains firmly committed to support all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions in the best interest of the nation,” the statement added.
Earlier today, the Press Trust  of India reported that “a cloud of uncertainty had loomed over the future of the ongoing edition since the cancellation of Thursday’s match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala midway following air raid alerts in neighbouring cities of Jammu and Pathankot.”
“It does not look nice that cricket goes on while the country is at war,” a BCCI official told PTI, confirming the suspension of the league, which was to wind up on May 25 in Kolkata.
 






The world’s richest cricket tournament began its current season on March 22, and the final fixture was scheduled to be played on May 25, with matches being spread over 13 venues across the country.
According to ESPN Cricinfo, IPL 2025 was 58 games old, including the abandonment in Dharamsala. There were 12 games left to play in the group stage, scheduled for Lucknow (2), Hyderabad, Ahmedabad (3), Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru (2), Mumbai, Jaipur, followed by the playoffs, to be played in Hyderabad and Kolkata.
Pakistan and India have been locked in conflict since Wednesday, when India targeted multiple locations in Pakistan, claiming they were “terrorist infrastructure” in response to a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir last month.
New Delhi named two Pakistani nationals as suspects and accused Islamabad of being involved in the attack, a charge Pakistan denied. Subsequently, Islamabad sought an independent probe.</p><small>2025-05-09 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09140807a811eff.jpg?r=140948' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909714/global-militaries-to-study-india-pakistan-fighter-jet-battle' target='_blank'><strong>Global militaries to study India-Pakistan fighter jet battle</strong></a><br><p>A dogfight between Chinese-made Pakistani jets and French-made Indian Rafale fighters will be closely scrutinised by militaries seeking insights that could offer an edge in future conflicts.
A Chinese-made Pakistani fighter plane shot down at least two Indian military aircraft on Wednesday, two US officials told Reuters, marking a potential major milestone for Beijing’s advanced fighter jet.
The aerial clash is a rare opportunity for militaries to study the performance of pilots, fighter jets and air-to-air missiles in active combat, and use that knowledge to prepare their own air forces for battle.
Experts said the live use of advanced weapons would be analysed across the world, including in China and the United States which are both preparing for a potential conflict over Taiwan or in the wider Indo-Pacific region.
 
 

One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters there was high confidence that Pakistan had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets.
Social media posts focused on the performance of China’s PL-15 air-to-air missile against the Meteor, a radar-guided air-to-air missile produced by European group MBDA. There has been no official confirmation these weapons were used.
“Air warfare communities in China, the US, and a number of European countries will be extremely interested to try and get as much ground truth as they can on tactics, techniques, procedures, what kit was used, what worked and what didn’t,” said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
“You have arguably China’s most capable weapon against the West’s most capable weapon, if indeed it was being carried; we don’t know that,” Barrie said. The French and Americans would likely be hoping for similar intelligence from India, Barrie said.
“The PL-15 is a big problem. It is something that the US military pays a lot of attention to,” a defense industry executive said.
Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation declined comment and the MBDA consortium could not immediately be reached for comment on a French public holiday.
Scant details
Western analysts and industry sources said crucial details remained unclear including whether the Meteor was carried and the type and amount of training the pilots had received. Arms firms would also be anxious to separate technical performance from operational factors, analysts said.
“There will be audits of what works and what doesn’t work, but I think the other overlay is the proverbial fog of war,” said Byron Callan, a Washington-based defense expert and managing partner of Capital Alpha Partners.
US arms companies are getting constant feedback about how their products are working in the war in Ukraine, he said.
“So I absolutely expect the same to be the case with India’s European suppliers, and Pakistan and China are probably sharing the same feedback. If the PL-15 is working as advertised or better than expected, the Chinese would like to hear that.”
A defense industry source from a Western country operating the Meteor said an online picture of a seeker appeared to feature the component of a missile that had missed its target.
There are conflicting reports on whether Pakistan has the domestic version of the PL-15 from the PLAAF, China’s air force, or the lower-range export version publicly unveiled in 2021.
Barrie, who has written extensively on the missile, said he believed that Pakistan most likely has the export version.
A Western industry source dismissed claims that the rocket-powered PL-15 had longer range than the air-breathing Meteor but acknowledged that its capability “may be greater than was thought.” The Meteor’s range has not been officially published. “At the moment it’s not possible to judge anything. We know so little,” the industry source said.
The PL-15’s range and performance have been a focus of Western interest for years. Its emergence was seen as one of many signals that China had moved well beyond reliance on Soviet-era derivative technology.
The United States is developing the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile via Lockheed Martin partly in response to the PL-15 and its beyond-visual-range performance — part of a broader reset of Western priorities toward China.
European nations are exploring a mid-life upgrade for Meteor, which specialist publication Janes says could involve propulsion and guidance, but analysts say progress has been slow.
US President Donald Trump in March awarded Boeing the contract to build the US Air Force’s most sophisticated fighter jet yet, which would likely include stealth, advanced sensors and cutting-edge engines.</p><small>2025-05-09 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09091118f656999.jpg?r=091139' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909567/held-kashmir-struck-plane-hit-disinfo-from-across-the-border-rebuffed' target='_blank'><strong>‘Held Kashmir struck, plane hit’: Disinfo from across the border rebuffed</strong></a><br><p>AS tensions with India continued to escalate, Pakistani officials responded to a number of apparently false claims made by Indian officials and media.
On Thursday night, Indian news channels were flooded with reports claiming that India’s air defence systems had shot down Pakistani jets during alleged attacks on  multiple locations across Jammu in India-held Kashmir and Punjab in  India.
Although the claims were widely repeated, no evidence or footage was offered to substantiate them.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar dismissed the claims that India shot down Pakistani jets, including an F-16 and two JF-17 fighter jets. He termed the claim “absurd and false”.
“Fake and concocted stories will get you nowhere. Such false claims only reflect your desperation. Denied and rejected,” the minister said in a post on X.
 






Separately, speaking to Geo News, the information minister challenged the Indian government to provide proof of downing any PAF fighters or capturing a pilot.
“I am 100 per cent denying it. With fullest confidence at my command, I am denying it,” the information minister said.
 






Jammu attacks
Also on Thursday evening, Indian media claimed Pakistan had launched attacks using missiles and drones across Jammu in India-occupied Kashmir.
The Foreign Office immediately rubbished this claim as well.
 
 

“[Pakistan] categorically rejects the baseless and irresponsible allegations propagated by the Indian media, accusing Pakistan of launching attacks on Pathankot, Jaisalmer, and Srinagar. These claims are entirely unfounded, politically motivated, and part of a reckless propaganda campaign aimed at maligning Pakistan,” it said in a statement on Thursday night.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also contradicted the Indian misinformation.
“We deny it, we have not mounted anything so far,” Mr Asif told BBC in an interview. The minister added that when Pakistan does strike, everyone will know it. “We will not strike and then deny.”
He said Pakistan will not deny any actions it takes.
Earlier, Indian media reports claimed that explosions were heard in held Kashmir and there was a blackout in the region.
In a statement on X, the Indian military said there have been no losses reported and that the threat has been “neutralised”, without giving any proof.

“ISPR sahib, listen to me carefully. Respect is not [confined] to a single institution; respect should be for every single citizen,” thundered then-PTI chief Imran Khan in a video released a little after 11am before departing for the Islamabad High Court on May 9 last year.

Hours later, he was arrested in the Al Qadir Trust case. The case was irrelevant to his supporters and the development was expected — nevertheless, Imran Khan was “a red line” and so, protests erupted almost immediately. But within hours, they turned into riots that lasted more than 24 hours across Pakistan.
When the smoke from torched vehicles and tear gas finally cleared, condemnations poured in and a chase ensued. Nearly 500 first information reports were registered. Thousands were arrested, of whom 105 were handed into military custody weeks, if not days, later.
In December 2024, 85 of the accused were convicted in military courts, 19 of whom were released a month later after their mercy petitions were accepted.

What happened on May 9
At least 10 people lost their lives and hundreds sustained injuries, while approximately 40 public buildings and military installations were damaged, including Lahore Corps Commander’s House (Jinnah House) and Askari Tower in Lahore, General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Office in Faisalabad, FC Fort in Chakdara, Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar, Toll Plaza at Swat Motorway and the Mianwali Air Base.
In total, 62 outbreaks of violence were documented, inflicting a loss of Rs2.5 billion on the country, of which, according to the State, Rs1.98 billion in losses were suffered by the army.
 


To this day, the military says the events were a coordinated attack by the PTI leadership.
“Nothing is hidden about May 9. The public, the army and we all have irrefutable evidence. All of us saw this incident unfolding, we all saw how everyone was [brainwashed] against the army, its leadership, agencies and institutions through lies and propaganda,” Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, Maj Gen Ahmed Sharif, said two days before the first anniversary of the May 9 riots.
He added that “some political leaders” had issued orders to their supporters on May 9 to selectively target military installations.
PTI, meanwhile, is demanding a judicial inquiry into May 9 for the “real culprits” while Imran Khan remains behind bars.
Battleground Cantt
Between roughly 2:30pm and 3pm, when Jasmine* (female, age 35-40) received instructions to go home from her office, she opted to return to her house in Cantt, considering it to be the “safest” place in Lahore.
“Normally, there would be army personnel at the entrance to Cantt, but that day there was no one there when my car passed through,” she recalled.
 

This is an AI generated image, reflective of the situation in Lahore on May 9. Any resemblance to persons or objects is purely coincidental.

Another resident of Cantt, Shazia* (female, age 65-70), was at home when she learnt about Imran’s arrest. Her younger sister, who lived nearby, was out shopping at Liberty Market and called her to inform her that shops were closing.
“I was really worried, so I kept calling her to know her whereabouts,” she said. Her sister told her that when she entered the gated society between 3:30pm and 4pm, there was no one present at the checkpoints.
Shazia, residing close to Rahat Bakery on Sarwar Road, started hearing the clamour of cars, and screams and shouts of people around 5:30pm.
Around 6:15pm, she and her husband went outside their residence to find the source of the nearby commotion. “We had no inkling of what was about to unfold; we were simply standing at Rahat Bakery Chowk out of curiosity,” she explained.
 


Shortly after, she observed two buses arriving, packed with police officers. They disembarked and then proceeded towards the Corps Commander’s House. Merely five minutes later, she saw the officers rushing back.
“There were a few young boys and girls coming from the direction of the Corps Commander’s House. They even threw stones at the police,” she stated.

In the midst of this, Shazia witnessed Tayyaba Raja stepping forward and throwing her dupatta near the chowk, a scene which was captured and shared on social media widely. “The moment she did that, a police officer approached and dragged her by the hair from the chowk towards Shabbir Road,” she recounted.
She saw a protester in the driver’s seat of a police van while two others were pushing the vehicle towards the chowk. “At the chowk, they set fire to the police van,” she recounted.
Ahmed* (male, age 25-30), a Cantt resident who lives further away from the military installations, was at home that day when calls for protests surfaced online. “My friends and I did go around 2pm or 3pm but then we rushed back when things appeared to be getting out of hand around 5pm to 6pm,” he said. “It seemed as if Lahore had become a war zone.”
 


Upon returning home, Shazia and her husband continued to hear the commotion until 5am. “We could still hear the sound of gunshots, and there was so much tear gas that even after closing all our windows, my husband had trouble breathing due to his asthma problems.”
Not too far away from them, Jasmine also felt her eyes burning around 7pm. Her house was a few minutes’ walk away from the Corps Commander’s House. “I couldn’t understand why my eyes were burning,” she recalled. Through her work group on WhatsApp, she learned of protests erupting inside Cantt.
“I was terrified after that day,” said Shazia.
For Ahmed, the scenes from May 9 stayed long beyond the day with him; whenever he ventured towards Jinnah House, he felt as if he was being followed. He shrugged it off as paranoia.

All of the 10 families that Dawn.com spoke to said the same thing; after the arrest by police and subsequent transfer into military custody, there was silence on the whereabouts of the suspect for at least one or one-and-a-half months.
Tariq*, a resident of Lahore, was at work in Lahore’s Gulberg II area when television channels, almost in unison, broke the news of Imran’s arrest on May 9. He barely paid any attention to it though. “We all knew it was going to happen sooner or later.”
“But then,” he recalled to Dawn.com, “they started running footage of the protests; everything was burning and within a few minutes, we were told to go back home.”
The first thing Tariq did was call his younger brother. The duo, hailing from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla, has been living at a hostel in Lahore for the past few years; one earns while the other studies.

But the phone kept ringing. Tariq grew more anxious as dusk settled atop the walled city. After a dozen unanswered calls, he made his way to Liberty Chowk — the nucleus of Lahore and the protests that day — but his brother was nowhere in sight.
After a search of four days — which felt excruciatingly longer — he received a call from an unknown number. In the brief conversation that Tariq said skipped the formalities of an introduction, he was told to come to the Lahore Anti-Terrorism Court the next day. Feeling unsure and helpless, he made his way to the overcrowded ATC on May 14. Despite the swarm of families, Tariq spotted his younger brother who stood subdued in a queue of young men. But he couldn’t get close enough to talk to him.
In the coming days, Tariq would make multiple visits to the court for his brother but return home alone. And then one day, he got a call from a policeman informing him that his brother was being held at the Camp Jail.
 


“But when I visited the prison the next day, the officials said he wasn’t there anymore. Upon my insistence, one of the jail officials retrieved a list from his pocket and said my brother had been handed into military custody,” he recalled. “They said he was implicated for attacking the Lahore Corps Commander’s House.”
This was the last time he heard about his brother for several days.
Salima*, another resident of Lahore, said her son was arrested by “Punjab Police officials and plain-clothed men” from a hospital on the night of May 18. “They said his call data record from May 9 showed he was near the Lahore Corps Commander’s House.
“He had just gone out to get some groceries that day,” she insisted.

Salima said her son was taken to the Factory Area Police Station after the arrest and presented before an ATC the next day. “He was then shifted to the Camp Jail. But when we went to meet him there, we were told that he had been handed over into the custody of the army,” she told Dawn.com.
Then came the silence.
Sultan*, whose son has been in military custody for more than 352 days, said he feels more helpless every passing day.
“I searched for him tirelessly … went from one police station to the other. And then I thought that ’agar zinda hoga to wapis ajayega (he will come back if alive)’,” the father said.
He eventually found out that his son was arrested on May 21 for allegedly attacking the FC Fort in Lower Dir. “The police said they had a photograph of him inside the building,” Sultan said, adding that he didn’t hear about his son for over a month after the arrest.
“I have been driving cement trucks for a year to make ends meet … I am tired now,” the octogenarian father said.
Military calls
Both Tariq and Salima, like other families Dawn.com spoke to, received a call from the military more than — at least — 30 days later after the accused was handed into military custody for investigation. They were given a time and location for a meeting with the accused and told to engage a lawyer.
“We were allowed to meet for 15 minutes in the presence of uniformed officers,” Tariq said**. “My brother looked very weak … sunken eyes and a bony face … I could barely recognise him.”
The meeting, he described, was held inside a small room with a few chairs and a desk. “When my brother was brought inside the room, his face was covered with a black cloth and his hands were cuffed at the back. The cloth eventually came off and so did the handcuffs, but the officials never left the room.”
Hamza*, a resident of KP’s Chakdara, recalled a similar setting from the first meeting with his brother, who is in military custody in Malakand**.
He was led towards a room after meandering his way through the checks. “A few minutes later, two officers brought my brother — his face covered with a black cloth — inside. He had lost a lot of weight and his usually trimmed beard now resembled a bush,” Hamza told Dawn.com.
His brother was arrested from outside their family’s shop on May 22 for allegedly attacking the FC Fort in Lower Dir and was handed into military custody a week later. “The police said they had a video in which he could be seen inside the building … he had not even touched or damaged anything,” he insisted.

Sultan got a call 33 days after his arrest, and found out his son was in Peshawar. Soon afterward, the father and son were reunited, albeit briefly, as their meetings began** — first in Timergarah, now in Malakand.
Recalling their first meeting, Sultan said his son had lost weight, had dark circles and an overgrown beard. “My heart was crying when I saw him,” he said.
These meetings, as the families told Dawn.com, have since continued once a week. Sometimes, video calls are also allowed. Initially, food from outside the prison was not allowed, but that restriction has been removed now.
On April 8, the federal government revealed to the Supreme Court that 20 persons who were arrested and convicted for their involvement in the May 9 violence had been released so that they could celebrate Eidul Fitr with their families after they served a major part of their sentence while the remaining period of their punishment was remitted by the army chief.
Among them, four belonged to KP while all other 16 hailed from Punjab. It said 20 persons were awarded sentences of one year, of which 17 had served a period of 10.5 months and three persons had served a period of 9.5 months. While none of the persons served a full period of one year, upon confirmation of their sentence, the remaining period of their punishment was remitted by the chief of army staff (COAS) under Section 143(1)(i) of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952.
This development has given families of the remaining persons in custody hope while battling their frustration.

Trials under the Secrets Act
The trials of Hamza and Tariq’s brothers as well the other accused have concluded. According to Attorney-General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, military courts have completed recording of evidence and have to announce orders, but can not do so in view of the restraining order passed by the apex court to not convict or acquit any suspect until the pendency of government-instituted intra-court appeals.
The families, however, have no knowledge of what went on inside the military courts nor have they been provided with any case-related documents.
“No paper/file was allowed to enter or exit those fenced boundaries,” said Rehana*, whose husband has been in the army’s custody in Lahore for almost a year now.
The reason behind the secrecy surrounding the trials is the Official Secrets Act, a colonial-era law that deals with the disclosure of information and espionage under which the accused have been charged. This was corroborated by the request for custody of civilians sent to courts by the military.
Section 2(1)(d) of the Army Act grants the military powers to try civilians accused of “seducing or attempting to seduce any person from duty or allegiance to government” or having committed an offence under the Official Secrets Act. But before that, permission needs to be taken from a court for custody, as mentioned in the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 


Those written applications which Dawn.com has seen, submitted by the military in courts seeking custody of civilians, stated that the suspects “are found guilty of offences under sections 3, 7 and 9 of the Official Secrets Act, 1923 read with Section 2(1)(d) of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952”.
 


The courts had subsequently accepted the request under Section 549(3) of the CrPC and directed the jail authorities to hand over the suspects to the army.
Before the military trial of a civilian commences, the commanding officer (CO) submits a request to the sessions judge seeking the custody of the suspects.
“An investigation report, prepared by the police, is also presented in court after which the judge approves the transfer of custody,” retired Lt Col advocate Inamur Rahim said, elaborating that the general officer commanding (GOC) of the area — who already has a warrant issued by either the army chief or the federal government — then constitutes the military court.
Under the Army Act and Article 10A (right to fair trial) of the Constitution, the accused is supposed to be given the choice to appoint a counsel, who is provided a charge sheet and “summary of evidence” 24 hours before the trial begins. Similarly, during the trial, the prosecution’s witnesses appear in court and the defence has the right of both cross-examination and presenting witnesses.
Once the proceedings conclude, the verdict is reserved. The president then puts it down on paper with the sentencing. The accused is told “guilty or not guilty” in the next hearing. The document is then sent to the convening authority for confirmation after which the accused, in the final hearing, is told the sentencing.
Advocate M, who has represented three accused in military custody, elaborated further on the covertness of the trial. “Before the proceedings began, I was given clear instructions that the details of the hearing could not be disclosed in public,” he said.
This is also mentioned in Section 14 (Exclusion of public from proceedings) of the Official Secrets Act, which states: “In addition and without prejudice to any powers which a Court may possess to order the exclusion of the public from any proceedings if, in the course of proceedings before a Court against any person for an offence under this Act or the proceedings on appeal, or in the course of the trial of a person under this Act, the application is made by the prosecution, on the ground that the publication of any evidence to be given or of any statement to be made in the course of the proceedings would be prejudicial to the safety of the State, that all or any portion of the public shall be excluded during any part of the hearing, the Court may make an order to that effect, but the passing of sentence shall, in any case, take place in public.”
Same is the case with documents. No one, not even the lawyers, is supposed to be given the case file — which includes the charge sheet and evidence. “We were shown the papers but were not allowed to take them home, get photocopies or even take pictures,” Advocate M recalled.
“At most, they allow you to take important notes in a diary. But that is it,” he said.
All the 10 lawyers Dawn.com reached out to recounted a similar experience. They shared that when first called by the military, the defence counsels were asked to bring three documents with them: identity card, power of attorney and bar licence.

None of the lawyers Dawn.com spoke to commented on the proceedings due to procedure.

Advocate A, who represented two people in military custody in Lahore, said the accused and their families were asked if they wanted to appoint a lawyer. “If they said no, the army appointed an ‘accused’s friend’, a major who would represent the civilian in the trial.
“But for those who chose to get a lawyer of their choice, they provided the names of the same to the CO who would then call the nominated counsel and ask them if they were willing to represent the accused. Upon saying yes, we were given a time and location where the trial was going to be held,” he said.
 


At the location**, he continued, the lawyers were first given a briefing on the rules and regulations of the trial after which the proceedings commenced.
The rest of the procedure, the lawyers said, was almost similar to that of a civilian trial.
“On the first day of the hearing, charges are read out loud and the accused is asked if he pleads guilty or not. Even if the latter’s response is guilty, the trial commences on the presumption of innocence,” Advocate A told Dawn.com. Next comes the cross-examination of witnesses following which the final arguments occur and the verdict is then reserved.
But unlike civilian courts where cases are generally drawn out, these military trials were speedy and were wrapped up in less than 10 hearings, with the verdicts now awaited.

Most of the families and lawyers Dawn.com reached out to claimed that the accused were met with stringent conditions behind bars. Unlike civilian jails where prisoners are allowed outside their cells from sunrise to sunset, the people in military detention were only taken out of their cells twice a day, for 15 minutes, in the presence of a military personnel.
It should be noted that during Supreme Court hearings on military trials in June and July, the AGP had toldthe court that all those in custody were being provided health facilities and were “kept in military units, not with hardened criminals”.
Advocate R, who represented three persons in military custody, stated that all of the accused wanted to be shifted to civilian prisons.
He also claimed that most of the accused persons were those whose videos or photos inside army installations had gone viral. “Most of them were never involved in arson or rioting in the first place,” he alleged. Advocate M backed the claim that people handed over into military custody were not directly involved in the acts of violence.
Advocate X, who has fought cases in military courts, gave a “simple explanation” for the way people were handed over into military custody. “It needs to be understood that a military court is not meant to try ordinary civilians; it is either for the enemies or the army’s own people suspected of treason.
“It appears that the military did not have SOPs for civilians on such trials, so they followed the same procedures that are used to try their own men,” he said.
Other lawyers concurred.

Controversial amendment
Interestingly, the Official Secrets Act was amended in August 2023, nearly two months after most of the arrests had been made.
On August 1 last year, the coalition government, just days before the completion of its five-year term, quietly got a bill to amend the century-old Secrets Act approved by the National Assembly. It was tabled in the lower house of the Parliament through a supplementary agenda on private members’ day — when bills are moved by members in their personal capacity and not ministers alone — through a supplementary agenda and was passed the same day despite protests from both sides of the aisle.
The bill was subsequently tabled in the upper house of the Parliament the next day where it was again met with fierce opposition. However, the Senate chairman referred it to the relevant standing committee even though lawmakers demanded that the proposed legislation be put to vote as they wanted to reject it.
Finally, on Aug 6 — a Sunday — the bill to amend the Official Secrets Act, 1923, was passed by the Senate, albeit with a few changes to the original amendments made by the standing committee.
After securing the approval of the Senate, the ‘amended’ bill was again presented in the NA on Aug 7. This time, it sailed through the lower house. Now, the bill only needed the president’s assent to become a law.
On Aug 19, it had emerged that the president at that time, Dr Arif Alvi, had given his assent to the bills to amend the Official Secrets Act and the Army Act. However, in a startling turn of events, Alvi denied assenting to the changes in the laws in a post on social media platform X.
“As God is my witness, I did not sign Official Sec­rets Amendment Bill, 2023 and Pakistan Army Ame­ndment Bill, 2023 as I disagreed with these laws,” the president said in his tweet.
Hours after Alvi’s statement, a gazette notification issued by the Senate Secretariat surfaced, stating that the two bills were “deemed to have been assented by the president”.
Alvi’s allegations, on the other hand, stand where they are. They haven’t been taken up in any court yet.
It must be noted that Section 3 of the Official Secrets Act, which appears to be the main provision under which the accused in military custody have been charged, was renamed from “penalties for spying” to “offences”, with the addition of photography through drone cameras of prohibited areas as a crime.
Other changes made to the law included the broadening of the definition of military installations and bringing digital and modern means of communication into the act’s ambit. Moreover, clauses related to prohibited areas were also amended and it would be an offence if someone was to “access, intrude, approach or attack any military installation, office, camp office or part of building”.
Earlier, the offence was restricted to such movement during the time of war only; however, the amendment has expanded this to peacetime as well.
Similarly, the definition of “enemy” introduced in the law states: “Any person who is directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally working for or engaged with a foreign power, foreign agent, non-state actor, organisation, entity, association or group guilty of a particular act… prejudicial to the safety and interest of Pakistan.”
The new amendments also empowered the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and officials of intelligence agencies to investigate suspects for violation of the Official Secrets Act. It states: “An investigating officer under this act shall be an officer of the Federal Investigation Agency not below the rank of BPS-17 or equivalent. The said officer shall be designated by the Director General [of] FIA for the purpose of investigation. If the Director General [of] FIA deems necessary, he may constitute a joint investigation team (JIT), convene by such officer and consisting [of] such other officers of intelligence agencies as he may appoint.”
The JIT is supposed to complete the investigation in 30 working days and the challan would be submitted to the special court through a public prosecutor.
The law also deals with the admissibility of the evidence and states: “All material collected during the course of inquiry or investigation, including electronic devices, data, information, documents, or such other related material, which facilitates the commission of any offence under this act, shall be admissible.”
A mere perusal of the amendments suggests that they were drafted while keeping in mind the May 9 violence. “A person cannot be charged and punished under a law in retrospective effect,” Advocate B said. “These trials undermine civilian courts and trust in the judiciary. It will set an extremely dangerous precedent if allowed.”
Anchorperson Hafeezullah Niazi, father of prominent PTI leader in military custody Hassaan Niazi, was of a similar opinion. “How can it be that the judge, jury and the prosecutor are all from the army?” he asked.
“We don’t know what to do, or who to reach out for appeals. My son is stuck in this tug of war between the military and Imran Khan,” the father rued.

Scope for appeal
The lawyers Dawn.com spoke to said that the verdict can be challenged in an army appellate court within 40 days of the judgment. The army chief or an officer of the brigadier rank (assigned by the COAS) decides on the appeal. Once a decision is taken there, the aggrieved can approach the high court but with a petition that challenges the constitutionality/framework of military trials.
There is no scope for a direct appeal.

Section 133B of the Army Act says: (1) Any person to whom a court-martial has awarded a sentence of death, imprisonment for life, imprisonment exceeding three months, or dismissal from the service after the commencement of the Pakistan Army (Amendment) Act, 5 [1992], may, within forty days from the date of announcement of finding or sentence or promulgation thereof, whichever is earlier, prefer an appeal against the finding or sentence to a Court of Appeals consisting of the Chief of the Army Staff or one or more officers designated by him in this behalf, presided by an officer not below the rank of Brigadier in the case of General Court-Martial or Field General Court Martial or District Court-Martial or Summary Court-Martial convened or confirmed or countersigned by an officer of the rank of Brigadier or below as the case may be, and one or more officers, presided by an officer not below the rank of Major General in other cases, hereinafter referred to as the Court of Appeals:
Provided that where the sentence is awarded by the court-martial under an Islamic law, the officer or officers so designated shall be Muslims: Provided further that every Court of Appeals may be attended by a judge advocate who shall be an officer belonging to the Judge Advocate General’s Department, Pakistan Army, or, if no such officer is available, a person appointed by the Chief of the Army Staff.
(2) A Court of Appeals shall have power to —
(a) accept or reject the appeal in whole or in part; or
(b) substitute a valid finding or sentence for an invalid finding or sentence; or
(c) call may witness, in its discretion for the purpose of recording additional evidence in the presence of the parties, who shall be afforded an opportunity to put any question to the witness; or
(d) annul the proceedings of the court-martial on the ground that they are illegal or unjust; or
(e) order retrial of the accused by a fresh court; or
(f) remit the whole or any part of the punishment or reduce or enhance the punishment or commute the punishment for any less punishment or punishments mentioned in this Act.
(3) The decision of a Court of Appeals shall be final and shall not be called in question before any court or other authority whatsoever.

However, in his press conference on June 26, the army’s spokesperson, Maj Gen Ahmed Sharif Chau­dhry, had said that the accused being tried by the military were entitled to legal rights, including the right to have a lawyer of their choice and the right to appeal before the high courts and the Supreme Court.
Retired Lt Col Rahim told Dawn.com that while an appeal against the verdict can be filed within 40 days, the process was not as simple; the army’s court of appeal is established under its own hierarchy. For example, if a brigadier or major general has announced a verdict, the head of the appellate court would be a lieutenant general.
However, he continued, it is high time now that an “independent” court of appeals comprising “judicial minds” is formed.
“When the British Army returned from India after World War II in 1945, they were given a right of appeal. For that, a court of appeals comprising retired judges was formed. The army could indeed punish its own, but the appeals would be heard by an appellate court comprising people of judicial minds because military courts are command-oriented.
“Naturally, even members of the appellate courts look towards the command for their career development. And if the command has given a decision, it would be very difficult for them to say something different than that. Therefore, it was decided that the appellate court should be independent of the command,” he elaborated.
This practice, Rahim said, was also adopted by other Commonwealth countries.

Supreme Court’s Justice Ayesha A. Malik, in her concurring note in the military trials case, terms the absence of an independent right to appeal one of the “glaring issues that arise within a military, from which it is clear that there is a lack of impartiality and independence within a military trial and the concept of fairness and due process is missing from the procedure”.
“The basic principle of the independence of the judiciary is that everyone is entitled to be tried by the ordinary courts or tribunals established under the law and the trial of a citizen by a military court for an offence which can be tried before the courts established under Article 175 (Establishment and Jurisdiction of Courts) of the Constitution offends the principles of independence of the judiciary and of fair trial,” she highlighted.
“In terms of the constitutional guarantee of fair trial and due process, the trial of a civilian before a military court does not meet the requirements” of the fundamental right provided under Article 10-A of the Constitution, Justice Ayesha noted.

Prolonged detention
According to Inamur Rahim, who was also formerly attached with the military’s JAG [Judge Advocate General] branch, the trial of an accused person, as per the military rules, should begin within eight days of being handed into custody.
“If, for some reason, the trial doesn’t begin, then the commanding officer [every area/jurisdiction has a CO] has to prepare an ‘eighth-day delay report’ and give reasoning. If eight more days pass, then the brigade commander has to write a report.”

Section 74 of the Army Act states: “Every commanding officer shall take care that a person under his command when charged with an offence is not detained in custody for more than forty-eight hours after the committal of such person into custody is reported to him, without the charge being, investigated, unless investigation within that period seems to him to be impracticable having due regard to the public service. Every case of a person detained in custody beyond a period of forty-eight hours and the reason therefore shall be reported by the commanding officer to the officer to whom application is to be made to convene a general or District court martial for the trial of the person charged: Provided that in reckoning the period of forty-eight hours all public holidays shall be excluded.”
Section 75: “In every case where any such person as is mentioned in Section 73 (Custody of offenders) as is not on active service remains in custody for a longer period than eight days, without a court martial for his trial being ordered to assemble, a special report giving reasons for the delay shall be made by his commanding officer in the manner prescribed and a similar report shall be forwarded at intervals of eight days until a court martial is assembled or such person is released from custody.”

Rahim said “if the trial still does not begin for some reason, then the matter will go to the General Officer Commanding (GOC) who will write a report after 24 days”.
“If the trial doesn’t begin after 32 days, a report titled ‘32 days delay report’ is prepared … the commanding officer will go to the accused and prepare a petition on the latter’s behalf which would be sent to the judge advocate general,” explained Rahim.
“The judge advocate will go through the petition and, if he deems it fit, will order the accused’s release subject to re-arrest,” he added.
In the case of the May 9 trials, while at least 102 people were in custody of the military by June 23, the trials hadn’t begun according to the AGP on June 27 as the “cases were at the investigation stage”.
These comments were made during a Supreme Court hearing after several petitions challenging the trials of civilians in military courts were brought to the apex court by former CJP Jawwad S. Khawaja, Aitzaz Ahsan, Karamat Ali, Imran Khan and others.
Former CJP Khawaja argued that Section 2(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Pakistan Army Act were inconsistent with constitutional fundamental rights and should be invalidated, seeking a suspension of proceedings against civilians based on these sections. Ahsan aimed to prevent civilians arrested for involvement in the May 9 violence from being tried in military courts. Imran sought a declaration against the arrest, investigation, and trial of civilians under specific laws during peacetime.
Earlier the same month, a nine-member bench, headed by then-CJP Umar Ata Bandial, was formed to hear the pleas. After Justice Qazi Faiz Isa expressed dissatisfaction with the bench’s composition, a seven-member bench resumed hearing the petitions. The revised proceedings concluded with Justice Bandial directing the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan to provide a list of individuals detained under various laws relating to the May 9 violence.
On June 23, the AGP informed the court that 102 individuals were held in military custody, adding that no women, juveniles, advocates, or journalists were among them.
Dawn.com reached out to the AGP for further understanding, but he said he could not comment because the matter is sub judice.

On June 26, Justice Bandial said: “I expect that no military trial [of civilians] will be conducted while proceedings are ongoing.”
ISPR DG Maj Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, on the other hand, in a presser later in the day, mentioned that proceedings against the 102 people handed over for trial under the army act were already underway. He also revealed the military had sacked three officers — including a lieutenant general — and concluded disciplinary proceedings against 15 officers, including three major generals and seven brigadiers, over the events of May 9.
However, when the court reconvened the following day on June 27, the AGP informed the court that trials of civilians in military custody had not yet commenced as the cases were still under investigation. He assured the court that none of them would face charges that could lead to capital punishment or lengthy sentences.
Subsequently, CJP adjourned the hearing indefinitely.
The hearing resumed 20 days later on July 18.
A day before the hearing, the federal government asserted that trying individuals involved in May 9 incidences under the Army Act was an “appropriate” response.
However, CJP Bandial observed that subjecting civilians to military courts’ procedures contradicted their constitutional rights, highlighting concerns about the lack of transparency and judicial review in military court verdicts.
Even though, in the next hearing on July 19, the apex court allowed the AGP to seek new instructions from the government regarding the provision of appeal against sentences handed down by military courts to those found guilty, the CJP stated that military trials should not start without informing the SC — a point the AGP assured the court of on August 3.
The court then postponed further proceedings for an indefinite period.
Finally, on Oct 23, in a widely hailed judgement, the apex court declared the military trials of civilians, for their alleged role in attacks on army installations, unconstitutional by a majority of 4-1.
Led by Justice Ijazul Ahsan, the bench emphasised that such cases should be tried in criminal courts. The ruling deemed provisions of the Pakistan Army Act related to these trials as “unconstitutional” and without legal effect.
The people, however, remained in military custody until Dec 13 when the SC suspended the operation of its previous Oct 23 order that had deemed the military trial of 103 civilians unconstitutional, in a majority decision of 5-1.
This allowed the trials to begin. The appeals, seeking suspension of the earlier order, were filed by various federal and provincial authorities.
According to Advocate B, as soon as the SC declared military trials of civilians unconstitutional, “the custody of the civilians by law should have been immediately handed over to ordinary courts”.
“During the two-month period, a number of writ petitions were filed in the Lahore High Court by various family members seeking the transfer of these suspects into civilian custody. But the high courts said they could not decide on them because the matter was being heard in the SC.”

Earlier this year, on January 28, a six-judge bench resumed hearings on civilians’ military trials. A petition was filed to bar governments from hiring private counsel while Justice Sardar Tariq Masood referred appeals in the military court case back to a three-judge committee for a larger bench reconstitution due to concerns about bench formation under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
The court ordered the AGP to furnish the details of the verdicts reserved by the military courts by March 28 after former CJP Khawaja, one of the petitioners challenging the military trials, requested an early hearing of the appeals, contending that the continued presence of civilians in military custody was “beyond compensation”.
On March 28, SC conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce reserved verdicts, directing that judgements be announced in cases in which the nominated suspects could be released before Eid.
In the most recent hearing on April 24, the apex court referred a set of appeals back to a three-judge committee to form a larger bench.
Senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui also requested the court to order the federal government to place on record the orders passed by the military trial court for the perusal of the apex court, adding that 85 accused were still under detention and therefore it required urgent hearing into the matter to decide their fate.
More than 365 days later, when the country witnessed one of the most widespread agitation against the state in its modern history, the highest court in the country is deliberating on the constitutionality of military courts, the families of the remaining 85 accused are desperately awaiting some good news, and the rest of Pakistan is watching with almost a pin-drop silence around these trials.
The question remains: what will these trials come to mean for the country’s judicial system?

In a press briefing on Thursday, Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, said the US was aware of Pakistan’s offer for a neutral investigation into the attack.
“Pakistan wants an independent investigation … and [the US] want the perpetrators to be held accountable, and we are supportive of any efforts to that end,” she added.
When asked if the two neighbours have offered any commitments,
Ms Bruce said Secretary Rubio had been clear on two things: “that this should not escalate” and “communication was fundamentally key”.
When the spokesperson was asked if the US shared India’s view that Pakistan was supporting terrorist groups, she refrained from affirming the accusation.
She said the Pahalgam attack was “awful”, but the “back and forth and continuation” of attacks should stop.
Ms Bruce added that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan over the past few weeks were “not surprising but very, very disappointing”.
She said both sides should remain engaged in conversation and the US would remain involved in this process.
Mr Rubio also spoke with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. They discussed regional security matters, economic engagement, and efforts to de-escalate tensions between India and Pakistan, Ms Bruce added.
She acknowledged the situation was “very delicate and dangerous” and said any discussion about ongoing negotiations shouldn’t be made public.
“That’s certainly our policy. We think it’s important to not put details in the midst of the worldwide media when the work is being done in private between leaders.”
When asked whether India provided the US with any intelligence to back up its claims against Pakistan, Ms Bruce refused to give details.
“We, though, will not engage in the nature of discussing what the conversations have been or what we have conveyed,” she added.
She urged both India and Pakistan to “work towards a responsible solution”.
US consulate advisory
The US Consulate General in Lahore has directed its staff to shelter in place after Indian drones were shot down in the city. The consulate said it has also received initial reports that authorities may be eva­cuating some areas adjacent to Lah­ore’s main airport, a statement said.

Heading the five-judge CB, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar questioned whether the authority to determine the seniority of superior court judges should lie with the President or the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP).
He also recalled how, under civil service procedures, when officers were transferred from the surplus pool to a different department, their seniority started from the bottom in the new department. He wondered whether there was any rule or convention for finalising the seniority of judges or whether it should be compared with civil service rules.
The bench was hearing a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.

Justice Mazhar questions who should determine seniority — president or CJP?

Senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, representing the petitioners, argued that the consultation process for transfer of the three judges to the IHC was neither purposive, meaningful, nor consensus-oriented on all relevant aspects. Consequently, he said, the transfers should be struck down.
During the hearing, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan recalled earlier transfers to the IHC, noting that one such transferred judge was even appointed as chief justice of the IHC. He also asked the counsel whether the judges in those instances had taken a fresh oath upon transfer.
The counsel replied that these transfers occurred after the IHC was re-established under the 18th Amendment, following its abolition by the 2009 SC judgement and subsequent re-establishment through the Islamabad High Court Act, 2010.
The counsel contended that, during the consultation process, the consultees — namely the CJP and the chief justices of the high courts concerned — were not presented with any information or data explaining why Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar was selected or shortlisted for transfer to the IHC out of a pool of 33 Lahore High Court judges, particularly when he was ranked 16th in seniority.
“You are suggesting as if there was no evidence that any option was afforded to other judges of the LHC to opt for transfer to the IHC,” remarked Justice Salahuddin Panhwar.
The counsel said Justice Dogar’s appo­intment was not random but premeditated, intended to place him ahead of the senior puisne judge of the IHC in seniority.
“You seem more aggrieved by the transfer of Justice Sarfraz Dogar,” Justice Panhwar observed.
When Justice Mazhar noted that one of the summaries had mentioned that the transferred judges would retain their seniority in the high court to which they were transferred, the counsel clarified that this communication was directed to the prime minister, not the CJP.
The counsel argued that following recent developments in the rules governing the appointment of judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), the top five judges of a high court now have a legitimate expectancy to become the chief justice. If a seventh-ranked judge is elevated over them, a writ of quo warranto may be filed in the Supreme Court to challenge the appointment.
He contended that the consultees never discussed critical issues such as emoluments or the selection procedure. He cited the example of Justice Muhammad Asif of the Balochistan High Court, who was serving as an additional judge at the time of his transfer. In his case, consent for the transfer was taken from the acting chief justice (ACJ).
When the counsel cited the Al-Jihad Trust case — in which it was held that an ACJ can only perform routine tasks for a limited period and cannot recommend a judge for elevation — Justice Mazhar noted that it made sense, as, at the time, consultations were carried out between the CJP and the President in the absence of the JCP. Now, however, the JCP exists, and every member has an equal vote.
The issue of seniority is critical, the counsel emphasised, because it is not merely about personal satisfaction. He pointed out that there is no law currently in place to fix the seniority of judges.
The hearing was adjourned to Wednesday (May 14).

CNN cited a senior US official saying as per their assessment, Pakistani forces shot down the jet during India’s air strikes inside Pakistan on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, Pakistan said it had shot down five Indian Air Force jets, including three Rafales.
Indian officials have yet to confirm the claim. When asked about the downed planes, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri didn’t answer the question directly, or issue a denial. He merely said that official information on this topic will be shared at the right time, BBC News reported.

BBC terms video showing wreckage of French-made jet in Bathinda ‘authentic’

Earlier, on Wednesday, a high-ranking French intelligence official had told CNN that one Rafale fighter jet operated by the Indian Air Force was downed by Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Reuters cited two US officials as saying that Pakistan had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to shoot down at least two Indian jets on Wednesday.
One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was high confidence that Pakistan launched air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets using the Chinese-made aircraft.
Another official said at least one Indian jet shot down by Pakistan was Rafale.
BBC has also confirmed that a Rafale aircraft fell in Indian territory.
BBC Verify said it had authenticated three videos purportedly showing the wreckage of a Rafale fighter jet in a field in Bathinda.
One of the clips geo-located by BBC Verify to a field near Bathinda in Indian Punjab showed troops collecting debris from the crashed jet.
“We have also located two further clips from the same location filmed at night. One shows debris in the field, while another shows a projectile catching fire in the sky, and then fire in an open field,” the British broadcaster added.
Justin Crump, a former British Army officer, confirmed to BBC Verify the wreckage visible in the video appeared to be of a French air-to-air missile used on both Mirage 2000 and Rafale fighter jets.

Pope Leo appeared on the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica after white smoke had billowed from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, signifying the 133 cardinal electors had chosen a new leader for the 1.4 billion-member Catholic Church.
“Peace be with you all,” he told the cheering crowd, speaking in fluent Italian. He also spoke in Spanish during his brief address, but did not say anything in English.
Prevost, 69 and originally from Chicago, has spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru and has dual Peruvian nationality. He became a cardinal only in 2023. He has given few media interviews and rarely speaks in public.
President Donald Trump swiftly congratulated Prevost on becoming the first US pope. “What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!”  Prevost beco­mes the 267th Catholic pope after the death last month of Pope Francis, who was the first Latin American pontiff and had led the Church for 12 years.
Francis had widely sought to open the staid institution up to the modern world, enacting a range of reforms and allowing debate on divisive issues such as women’s inclusion of LGBT Catholics.
Leo thanked Francis in his speech and repeated his predecessor’s call for a church that is engaged with the modern world and “is always looking for peace, charity and being close to people, especially those who are suffering”.
He had not been seen as a frontrunner and there was a brief moment of silence when his name was announced to the packed St Peter’s Square, before people started to clap and cheer.
“I’m just thrilled. I hope this can bring to America a more loving community. I think there’s a lot of hate in America. I think there’s a lot of racism. I have experienced it,” said Lailah Brown, 28, from Seattle, Washington, an African American.
“I hope America does not embarrass the pope,” he said.
Ahead of the conclave, some cardinals called for continuity with Francis’s vision of greater openness and reform, while others said they wanted to turn back the clock and embrace old traditions.
Unlike Francis, who spurned much of the trappings of the papacy from the day he was elected in 2013, Prevost wore a traditional red papal garment over his white cassock.
A crowd of clergy and staff members at Chicago’s Catholic Theological Union erupted in a joyful cheer as Pope Leo walked out onto the Vatican balcony, some four decades after he graduated from the South Side school.
It was an “explosion of excitement and cheers that went up in the room … many of us were just simply incredulous and just couldn’t even find words to express our delight, our pride,” said Sister Barbara Reid, president of the theology school.
Pope Leo graduated from the school in 1982 with a master’s degree. Reid called Leo intellectually brilliant, saying he has an extraordinarily compassionate heart.
“It’s an unusual blend that makes him a leader who can think critically, but listens to the cries of the poorest, and always has in mind those who are most needy,” she said.
The last pope to take the name Leo led the Church from 1878 to 1903. Leo XIII was known for his devoted focus on social justice issues, and is often credited with laying the foundation for modern Catholic social teaching.
Felicitations
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was among world leaders congratulating the new pope.
“May his pontificate contribute to strengthening dialogue and the defense of human rights in a world in need of hope and unity,” Sanchez said.
Prevost has attracted interest from his peers because of his quiet style and support for Francis, especially his commitment to social justice issues.
Prevost served as a bishop in Chiclayo, in northwestern Peru, from 2015 to 2023.
Francis brought him to Rome that year to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops across the globe, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world’s bishops.
“Most of us thought a US cardinal would never become pope, but Prevost got strong support from cardinals from Latin America where he worked for 20 years,” said Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit commentator who has covered the Vatican for decades.
“He is multilingual and has a reputation as a listener,” said Reese.  “The Holy Spirit continues to surprise us.”

The show, however, will go on with the closing stages of this season’s PSL to be held in the United Arab Emirates.
“The PCB confirms that the remaining fixtures of the HBL PSL X have been shifted to the UAE,” the PCB said in a statement in the early hours of Friday morning. “The exact sche­dule of matches, outlining the dates and venues, will be shared in due course.”
Four matches of the league stage of the country’s glitzy T20 extravaganza are still to be held, which will decide which four teams advance to the playoffs.
That, after Thursday’s match between Peshawar Zalmi and Karachi Kings, which was to be held at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, was called off hours before the scheduled start time.
Pakistan’s military on Thursday said it took down nearly two dozen Indian drones sent on this side of the border since the previous night. One of those drones crashed within the stadium’s complex, inflicting some damage.
The worsening situation saw the PCB, PSL and government officials gather for a meeting, which continued till late in the night with other venues, including Karachi and Dubai, coming into consideration for the remaining eight matches of the league.
PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement that the board had decided to shift the remaining matches to the UAE so that the domestic as well as foreign cricketers could be saved from “the possible reckless targeting by India”.
He also stressed it was important for the board “to ensure the mental well-being of all players” participating in the tournament.
PCB spokesperson Amir Mir had told Dawn earlier on Thursday the security of the players, especially the foreigners is the most important for us. “There have been drones brought down in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi We will decide in due course what needs to be done.”
Carrying out the matches in Rawalpindi only also came under discussion, sources said.
Asked if postponing all the remaining matches for an indefinite period was an option, sources in PCB said that it was highly unlikely as foreign players due the national and international commitments of foreign players.
BBC Sport had reported that a postponement was being considered.
Earlier on Thursday, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also Pakistan’s interior minister held a meeting with the PSL teams — except Multan Sultans, who are currently in their home city — in Islamabad and met foreign players.
Out of remaining eight matches — four were slated to be held in Rawalpindi, one in Multan and three in Lahore, including the final.
The cross border tensions also affected Thursday’s Indian Premier League match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in the Himalayan region of Dharamsala, which was called off midway due to a “floodlight malfunction” according to the Board of Control for Cricket in India.
The incident occurred hours after the BCCI had said that it had shifted the match between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians — scheduled to be held on Sunday in Dharamsala – to Ahmedabad.
Cricket boards around the world were monitoring the situation across the two countries with several foreign-based players featuring in both the PSL and the IPL.
Bangladeshi media reported that The Bangladesh Cricket Board was working to bring home Nahid Rana and Rishad Hossain — participating in the PSL for Peshawar Zalmi and Lahore Qalandars respectively — “in a timely and secure manner”.
“The BCB is in active coordination with the PCB and the Bangladesh High Commission in Islamabad to ensure that all necessary measures are in place to guarantee the security of our players,” the board said in a statement.
BBC Sport reported that some English players participating in the PSL were considering leaving while others wanted to stay.
The Professional Cricketers’ Association (PCA) has been in regular contact with the 15-person contingent, it said.
Cricket West Indies (CWI) also said that it was in touch with their players in the PSL and IPL and has engaged West Indies Players’ Association (WIPA) “to coordinate and ensure the safety, security, and well-being of all West Indies players and support personnel in the region”.

ISLAMABAD: At least three people lost their lives and seven, including four soldiers, sustained injuries as Pakistan intercepted and destroyed as many as 25 Indian drones that had intruded into its airspace across the country, possibly to target military installations.
According to the military, the locations where these drones were neutralised included Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur, Umerkot and Karachi in Sindh.
Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military’s chief spokesperson, confirmed that one civilian lost their life while another sustained injuries in Miano.
Moreover, as per police, one person each was slain in Attock and Rawalpindi.
“One drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,” said the army spokesperson. “Four men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to an equipment has occurred,” he said.
The rest of the drones apparently missed their potential targets and caused damages in densely populated areas.
 
 

Three drones were shot down in Walton and Burki, near Lahore. Officials said two drones crashed in Walton, while another crashed in Burki soon after security forces intercepted them. According to a witness, they heard multiple explosions in the old Walton airport area, leading to widespread confusion among locals.
In Rawalpindi, one person — a resident of Lahore — lost his life and two were inj­ured after a drone crashed near the Pindi Cricket Stadium on the Murree Road.
A police officer said that the stadium’s food street was not fully open and there were not many people around ; otherwise, there could have been more casualties.
Another drone damaged a house after it crashed on its rooftop in the Westridge locality of the garrison city. However, no casualties were reported.
In Attock, a farmer was killed near Jabbi Kasran — a town in Fateh Jang tehsil — after an Indian drone was downed. The injured person was taken to hospital, but could not survive.
In Gujranwala, three drones were destroyed in different locations of the district. The locals found wreckage of the drones in the Tokrian village of Wahndo and Solakhanabad village on the outskirts of the city. Another drone was found in a field near Aimanabad’s Agu Bhandar village of Gujranwala.
In Gujrat, parts of an Indian drone were found in Peer Jhand village in the jurisdiction of the Dinga police station. According to eyewitnesses, some parts of the drone fell in the field while some crashed on a house, falling through its roof into a room on the ground floor. However, everyone remained safe.
In Bahawalpur, an Ind­ian drone was destroyed in the Cholistan desert. According to the announcement, the Indian drone hit the area of Chapoowala in the desert in the limits of tehsil Yazman.
In Karachi, two drones fell on the outskirts of the Malir district, partially damaging the roof of a house. The first drone fell on a house in the Sharafi Goth slum, said area police SHO Sadaruddin Mirani. It damaged the roof partially, but no one was hurt. He said the incident occu­rred at around 10:30am.
The officer said that the drone was two and a half feet long.
Soon after, another dr­­o­ne fell near the residential neighbourhood of Gulshan-i-Hadeed.
Malir SP Mansoor Gulzar Bozdar told Dawn the drone fell in a hilly area near Link Road. He said it did not cause any damage to life or property.
In Umerkot, an Indian drone also crashed near the village of Sufi Akbar, close to the Chhor cantonment. Fortunately, no casualties or injuries were reported.
‘Serious, serious provocation’
India also admitted that it targetted military installations.
A statement by India’s Press Information Bureau said army installations were targeted “at a number of locations across Pakistan”. However, the attacks mostly took place in areas heavily populated by civilians.
As he shared details about the operation that downed drones, Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that the Pakistan Army used “their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully” to shoot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones.
Referring to Pakistan’s response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said, “After the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.”
“This cowardly attack is a sign of India’s worry and panic,” it added.
“The debris of these Israeli-made Harop drones is being collected from various locations across Pakistan,” the military’s media wing said. It asserted that the Pakistan Army was “giving a befitting reply to the enemy and crushing all its nefarious designs”.
During the press briefing, the military’s media spokesman also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones. He added that the debris and downed drones were being collected from multiple locations.
“As we speak, the process of India sending across these Harop drones, this naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,” Lt-Gen Chaudhry continued.
“This is a serious, serious provocation,” the ISPR chief added.
According to BBC News, Lt-Gen Chaudhry said the Indian government needs to transition from “cinema” into the “real world we live in” and called the strikes a “phantom defence”.

Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Sialkot airports were the most affected, as air traffic was halted for several hours amid rising tensions between Pakistan and India. How­ever, flight operations at the four airports later resumed on Thursday after temporary suspensions.
The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) initially said that flight operations at Karachi’s Jinnah Inter­nat­ional Airport would remain suspen­ded until midnight, but they resu­med earlier than scheduled. Flight operations at Islamabad, Lah­ore and Sialkot airports resumed by evening.
Earlier in the day, the PAA had temporarily suspended operations at Karachi, Lahore and Sialkot airports until Thursday noon, citing operational reasons. Islamabad International Airport also briefly suspended flights during the day.
Later, the PAA extended the closure at Lahore, Islamabad and Sialkot until 6pm before confirming their reopening.
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) confirmed that the country’s ongoing security situation severely disrupted air operations nationwide.
“In the interest of air safety, some routes have been restricted as a precaution, affecting several flights,” a PIA spokesperson said. “The temporary closure of air routes has been undertaken to protect the assets of domestic carriers and ensure passenger safety.”
The airline urged passengers to remain patient and cooperate with airline staff, adding that its call centre was actively contacting affected travellers.
For passengers of diverted flights, PIA said it had made arrangements for meals and accommodation. Passengers were advised to check flight status via the PIA website or helpline before heading to the airport.
Passengers stranded
Passengers said that they faced immense difficulties due to last-minute cancellations. “I was scheduled to fly to Washington via Doha in the early hours of Thursday from Lahore airport, but the airline rescheduled the flight for later that morning.
Ghazala Bibi, another traveller, said her flight to Dubai from Sialkot was cancelled at the last minute due to the airport’s suddenclosure.
Passengers arriving from abroad also faced immense difficulties due to diversions. Domestic air travellers encountered similar issues, with flight operations disrupted for a third consecutive day due to intermittent airport closures.
“Domestic flights have been badly affected over the past three days,” an official said.
The Haj flight operation, which began recently, has also been almost suspended amid the escalating situation between the two countries.
While a tour operator told Dawn that most international airlines had suspended flights to and from Pakistan until May 10, the PAA said it was continuously issuing revised notices to airmen or Notams to update the status of airport operations and the opening of airspace.

• 200 ongoing uplift projects likely to be closed
• Ahsan says proper allocations cannot be made for key schemes                        
ISLAMABAD: The federal government will present the next fiscal year’s budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.
This was announced at a press conference by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who disclosed that an indicative budget ceiling (IBC) of Rs921bn for the next year provided by the Ministry of Finance was over three times lower than Rs2.9 trillion demanded by the Planning Commission based on requirements of various ministries for development projects.
The figure is also around 16pc lower than the current year’s revised allocation of Rs1.1tr, slashed on the instructions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from Rs1.4tr approved by the parliament as part of the federal budget 2024-25.
The minister said he would contest the IBC provided by the finance ministry and request the prime minister for higher allocations of at least Rs1.6tr to provide the rupee cover for foreign-funded projects.
The minister also launched the Planning Ministry’s Monthly Development Update for May 2025 during the press conference, a new initiative on the pattern of finance ministry’s monthly economic outlook.
Responding to a question, Mr Iqbal said authorisation for the disbursement had been issued for about Rs900bn out of Rs1.1tr PSDP for the current year.
He hoped the authorisation would increase during May and June. However, he hastened to add that the finance division had its own constraints, as resources were needed to increase the development budget, which required an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio.
He said the Annual Plan Coordination Com­mittee would meet on May 23 to finalise the next year’s development programme in consultations with provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Meanwhile, the National Economic Council (NEC) is expected to meet on May 26 or 27 to approve the development programme and macroeconomic targets for the next fiscal year. The federal budget would be presented on June 2, he said.
For the next fiscal year’s development budget, the minister bemoaned that Rs2.9tr was requested from the Ministry of Finance, which provided an IBC of only Rs 921bn, about Rs178bn lower than the current year.
“This is a cause of concern for us,” he said. “This will affect even the inflow of foreign exchange. We will need Rs700bn to provide rupee cover to foreign-funded projects during the next development budget. If we do not have enough rupee cover, we cannot utilise all the allocated foreign exchange component.”
Mr Iqbal said that with such a meagre IBC, proper allocations could not be made to the important projects, which would result in delays and cost escalations of such schemes. He said that the number of provincial projects in the PSDP would be reduced, while about 200 slow-moving projects would be closed.
Irregularities in key projects
He said the cost of Diamer-Bhasha Dam has escalated from Rs480bn to Rs1.5tr due to delays. Likewise, the cost of the Dasu Hydropower Project has increased from Rs500bn to Rs1.7tr.
The minister said there were several lapses in the implementation of the Dasu Hydropower Project. No project director or CFO was hired for such a huge project, and it was operated by Wapda’s own people.
He said that even the contracts for the construction of roads in the project area were allotted in dollars. “There are irregularities in the Dasu project and we want that responsibility to be fixed,” he emphasised, regretting that the financial viability of these projects had diminished due to rising costs.
Similarly, the minister said that there were shocking irregularities in the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project. The plan was started in such a hurry that the contractor was mobilised prior to the consultant, which the minister said was a serious irregularity.
“Interestingly, once in a meeting I asked the CFO of Neelum-Jhelum regarding his qualification, and I was stunned to know that he had a Master’s in Geography,” he said.
Mr Iqbal said the report of the International Marine Corps regarding the failure in the Ne­­e­lum-Jhelum Hydropower Project was awaited.
In reply to a question as to why a civilian could not be appointed as Wapda chairman, the minister said: “In my opinion, a civilian should be appointed as Wapda chairman and he should be a hydrology expert of international repute. I will recommend this to the prime minister.”
He reiterated that funding priorities under the next PSDP would align with the government’s Uraan Pakistan programme, aimed at job creation and economic uplift. “Projects approved under Uraan are expected to generate 120,000 direct and indirect jobs,” he said.

In a press conference, Ishaq Dar said India “deliberately fired” projectiles, three of which were dropped in Amritsar, the capital of Indian Punjab, located around 54km from Lahore.
He added that a fourth projectile entered Pakistani airspace, which was shot down by the air defense system in Dinga, Gujrat, around 87km from the nearest point on the India-Pakistan border.
Mr Dar’s remarks were in response to claims by New Delhi that it neutralised attempts by Pakistan to hit multiple “military targets” using “drones and missiles” on the night of Wednesday and Thursday.
Mr Dar added that India’s “deliberate” attack was a “malicious strategy” to “falsely implicate Pakistan” for targeting civilians and incite Indian Sikhs.
Sitting beside Mr Dar, the armed forces spokesperson also accused India of launching a false flag operation. 
ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the projectiles, which he claimed were launched by India the previous night. 
He claimed India fired four projectiles from Adampur, a town in Jalan­dhar district of Indian Punjab. Three projectiles were “intently targeted” at Amritsar while one was taken down over Dinga, Lt-Gen Chaudhry added.
He said India’s claim that Pakistan attacked 15 locations was a “fantastic and cooked-up story”.
Every projectile leaves a digital signature, Lt-Gen Chaudhry said, asking India to share details about the origin of the projectiles it claimed were launched by Pakistan. 
The military spokesperson also lambasted the Indian media for falsely accusing Pakistan of launching attacks.
“When Pakistan strikes, we won’t need the Indian media to report it. The whole world will come to know. Its reverberations will be felt everywhere.”
