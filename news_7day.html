• Mills barred from using wheat for manufacturing poultry feed
LAHORE: The Punjab government has stepped up measures, including geotagging of stocks, to avert a potential wheat crisis in the province after floods in the eastern rivers washed away farmlands and destroyed stockpiles in its central districts.
The move comes amid restrictions on the interprovincial movement of the commodity by the provincial government, which has raised prices in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by up to 68 per cent, also prompting protests by Sindh and KP.
Sources told Dawn that the decision to restrict the wheat trade was taken to ensure an ample supply of the grain in the province and to avert a looming crisis. Besides this measure, the Punjab Price Control and Commodities Management also decided to start geotagging and physically verifying wheat stocks in warehouses across the province.
 
 

Its secretary Dr Kiran Khurshid notified a four-member departmental monitoring committee led by Deputy Secretary Shazia Rehman to collect data from all districts in collaboration with the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera) and the food directorate. Through this practice, the wheat stocks stored in government and private warehouses will be registered to meet the food crisis feared in the aftermath of the floods.
Dr Khurshid said her department would implement the government policy to avert the unpredictable and unforeseen crisis post-floods. She said people had lost massive wheat stocks in the recent floods and now it was the government’s responsibility to take care of its citizens.
She said the price control and commodities department was geotagging wheat warehouses to gather information about the actual stocks and resources for predictive analysis and anticipative planning.
“The geotagging is just an intervention, not a solution,” she said, adding that it would take time to trace wheat.
She said the department had established a strategic management wing (SWM) to digitise the department’s assets, resources and activities of the department’s eight directorates. “All the scattered information would be available for the department and higher authorities in one dashboard for monitoring and taking informed decisions,” she said.
 
 

The Punjab Home Department, at the request of the price control department, had also imposed Section 144 and prohibited the mills in the province from using 10,184 metric tonnes of wheat for feed manufacturing.
Interprovincial curbs
Sources said the provincial government was keeping a strict check on the movement of wheat at the exit points of the province. They claimed that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had made it clear that her foremost duty was to stave off a food crisis in her province and ensure that the citizens got their due wheat share through government packages or other means.
She had also been quoted as saying that some four million people had been affected by floods and the executive machinery needed to ensure the availability of wheat for the flood survivors.
The price control secretary, Dr Khurshid, also acknowledged that Punjab was monitoring the wheat movement at the Sindh and KP borders because “businessmen would always like to sell their commodities, where they would get a better price”.
“In this situation, the government’s role is to ensure that wheat stocks in the province meet the needs of its people. It will be insane if the government lets its wheat go to other provinces at a lower price and later purchase it at a higher cost for its own people,” Dr Khurshid said. It may be mentioned that the government had not purchased wheat and there were no hefty stocks in government warehouses.
Meanwhile, the department arrested 107 profiteers, fined 12,043 profiteers, and registered cases against seven individuals. In the matter of over-charging in wheat flour prices, the department officials arrested 18 officials, registered cases against four individuals and fined 1,074 persons. In a crackdown on hoarders, the department has already recovered 334,000 metric tonnes of wheat across the province.
These measures helped increase wheat stocks in flour mills by 165,000 metric tonnes this month alone.
Additionally, the grinding of 360,000 metric tonnes of wheat has ensured a steady supply of flour and brought down wheat prices from Rs3,800 to Rs3,000 per 40kg.

• One dead as boat capsizes in Muzaffargarh; three of a family drown in Alipur
LAHORE: In a catastrophic escalation of Punjab’s flood disaster, a massive new section of the Multan-Sukkur Motorway  (M5) was completely washed away near Jalalpur Pirwala, severing a vital national infrastructure link and stranding the region for the eighth consecutive day.
The breach, which rapidly expanded due to unrelenting water pressure from the Sutlej River, has now devoured all six lanes of both tracks, paralysing all traffic between southern and central Punjab. The collapse has disrupted supply chains, stranded thousands of vehicles and forced travellers onto perilous alternate routes.
“This is the second major breach to cripple the M5,” confirmed an Irrigation Department spokesperson. “The new breach is actively widening. Our emergency teams are working around the clock, placing boulders in a desperate attempt to stabilise the ground.”
The scale of the disaster is vast. The Sutlej River has effectively created a 20 to 25km-long inland lake between Gilani Road and the M5 motorway, submerging and damaging the highway along its entire length in the area.
A district administration official, speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, revealed that the scale of the damage might have been mitigated by a difficult decision. “It would have been better to make a controlled breach on the motorway to pass the Sutlej River water into the Chenab, but the decision was not taken in time,” the official stated.
Due to medium level flood in the Sutlej River, thousands of people were being evacuated from Multan, Lodhran and Bahawalpur districts.
 
 

Water continued to change its way from the Norja Bhutta breach to inundate the villages between Gilani Road and the M5 motorway.
Meanwhile, a man drowned and 14 people were recovered when a rescue boat carrying 15 people capsized in the Seetpur area of Alipur tehsil in Muzaffargarh district. In another incident, three members of a family drowned in Basti Arain in Alipur when they were trying to cross the standing water.
Multan district administration spokesperson Waseem Yousuf said that all flood relief camps in Multan city and Shujabad tehsil were closed as flood-affected people were returning to their homes.
He said that the administration had also started a survey to calculate losses in areas that were cleared of floodwaters.
However, he said that the relief camps in Saddar tehsil, Multan, were not closed as flood-affected people had not returned yet, and flood relief camps would not be closed in Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil until the situation returned to normal.
The teams of the urban unit would conduct the survey using the latest technology, he said, adding that the district administration officials have started the process of spraying flood-affected houses, and health department teams were tasked with using sprays to kill germs in standing waters.
In Muzaffargarh, the water level in the Chenab River has returned to normal,and water has receded from the low-lying areas. Flood-affected individuals have started returning to their homes in areas where the water has receded.
Flood-hit people are residing in 20 out of the 30 relief camps established. Some 16,650 flood-affected people are residing in relief camps, while 10,350 affected individuals are staying in tents set up on flood embankments.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia said the flood situation in Punjab’s rivers has returned to normal and the water flow in most rivers of Punjab has normalised.
He said that a significant decrease in water levels has been observed in flood-affected areas.
On the Sutlej River, the water flow was 104,000 cusecs at Ganda Singh Wala and 81,000 cusecs at Sulemanki.
He said that the water flow was 42,000 cusecs at the Marala point of the Chenab River, 44,000 cusecs at Khanki Headworks, 37,000 cusecs at Qadirabad, 41,000 cusecs at Head Trimmu and 133,000 cusecs at Panjnad.
On the Ravi River, the water flow was 8,000 cusecs at the Jassar point, 9,000 cusecs at Shahdara, 31,000 cusecs at Balloki and 29,000 cusecs at Sidhnai.
According to a PDMA report on losses caused by floods in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers, as many as 127 citizens have lost their lives in various incidents during the recent floods.
Over 4.755 million people of 4,700 villages have been affected due to the flood situation in the rivers. As many as 2.09m animals have been relocated to safe locations during rescue and relief activities in the affected districts.
Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javaid said that Mangla Dam was 96 per cent full and Tarbela Dam was 100pc full.
He said that the Indian Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River was 88pc full, Pong Dam was 99pc full, while the Thien Dam was 90pc full.

A first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Sukkur’s Kandhra police station under sections 114 (abettor present), 428 (mischief by killing or maiming animal with value of Rs10 or more), 429 (killing or maiming cattle, etc, of any value), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on the complaint of Ghulam Mustafa.
The incident took place at 2pm yesterday, according to the FIR, wherein three suspects were nominated.
According to the complainant, when his camels were returning after drinking water from a pond on the land, one of the suspects hit one of them with an axe, breaking its leg. Then he dragged the camel with his tractor.
The complainant said he kept pleading with the suspects to spare the camel, but they did not listen.
According to the FIR, the suspects reacted angrily, saying that the camel had destroyed crops.
Sukkur Senior Superintendent of Police Azhar Mughal said while speaking to the media that police had arrested two of the suspects.
This was also confirmed in a post on X by the  Sindh Chief Minister House’s official account. It said that police had so far arrested two suspects and the hunt for a third suspect was under way.
 






The statement also condemned the “the gruesome” attack, adding that the CM had ordered strict action against the culprits.
On the CM Murad Ali Shah’s directive, Sukkur District Council Chairman Syed Kumail Hyder Shah was “supervising” the injured camel’s treatment, it added.
 






Kumail Shah also posted about the incident on X, saying: “Heartbreaking to witness such cruelty against a helpless camel in Rohri.
“I’ve personally spoken to the owner, the wounded camel has been shifted to Karachi for immediate treatment. No animal should ever suffer such cruelty, every life, human or voiceless, deserves compassion and care.”
 






Separately, Sukkur Commissioner Abid Saleem told Dawn.com on the phone that the camel was shifted to Karachi after coordination with a private sector organisation that deals with such cases of injuries.
He said the camel would undergo surgery on its leg, adding that she had also sustained injuries on her jaw.
 
 

Meanwhile, the Comprehensive Disaster Response Services (CDRS) Benji Project for Animal Welfare in Karachi, which had helped another mutilated camel stand back with a prosthetic leg, said earlier today that its veterinary doctors would examine the camel.
“On Friday, September 19, a two-year-old female camel suffered unspeakable abuse in Sukkur. She had wandered onto land in search of water, where the landowner viciously broke her leg and then dragged her with a tractor,” the CDRS project wrote in a post on Instagram.
The organisation said it “immediately began coordinating with the Government of Sindh to rescue her”, adding that it was extremely grateful to Faryal Talpur, Sukkur MPA Awaiz Shah and MPA Sumeta Syed “for their efforts in helping us secure this camel […] and for so vehemently taking action”.
“Once our vets have examined her properly, we will share an update,” CDRS said, affirming that its team will try its “very best to give her love, comfort, and some semblance of peace”.

“There are no words left to explain the cruelty we continue to see. It is unimaginably painful to witness these beautiful, voiceless beings — created in such perfection and innocence — suffering at the hands of humans who were meant to protect them. All we can do is keep standing up for them and take one day at a time,” CDRS wrote.
A statement from CM Shah’s office said the camel was moved to the CDRS shelter and named “Sumi”.
It added that as per the shelter administration, her leg was crushed, jaw was broken, tongue was burnt and there were serious injuries on her body. The chief minister was told that she could not eat and was being administered intravenous fluids.
“On the instructions of the Sindh CM, Livestock Secretary Kazim Jatoi has been entrusted with the responsibility of providing the best treatment for Sumi,” the statement said.
The shelter posted various videos on its Facebook page of the treatment being provided to her.
The recent incident bears similarity to that of Cammie, a camel who had her front leg chopped off allegedly by a landlord in June 2024 as punishment for foraging in his field for fodder. She was taken in by the CDRS Benji Project, where she got her prosthetic leg in July and is still in care.

“Pakistan will not be holding their pre-match press conference today,” ACC said in a short statement.
Andy Pycroft will be officiating the match as the referee again after last week’s controversy.
A senior Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official confirmed to Dawn.com that the board had moved on after Pycroft’s ‘apology’ and had no issue with his appointment for the Pakistan-India match.
 
 

The Group A clash between the fierce rivals last Sunday ended on a bitter note when Indian players refused to shake hands with their opponents.
It was the first meeting between the regional neighbours since a four-day conflict in May left more than 70 people dead.
While the match itself passed without incident, there was no shaking of hands between the captains at the toss or among the players at the end.
Then, at the post-match ceremony, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav seemingly ‘politicised’ the victory by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country.
PCB called for match referee Andy Pycroft’s immediate removal for a code of conduct “violation” and considered withdrawing from the tournament before going ahead with Wednesday’s match. The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Yadav before the match.
Pakistan’s last group game — which they won easily against the United Arab Emirates — was delayed for an hour due to the stand-off before the matter was resolved with Pycroft’s apology.
Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for Sunday’s clash.
India won all three of their group games, narrowly edging out a brave Oman by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi on Friday, as well as beating Pakistan by seven and the UAE by nine wickets respectively.
Ramiz Raja says Pakistan need to ‘reset’ strategy
Former PCB chairperson Ramiz Raja said Pakistan “need to reset their strategy as it’s not working out.”
Speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan, “This strategy, which is akin to a sparkler that fizzles out quickly, is not working out at all,” the former Pakistan men’s captain said.
The team needs to get to a 150+ score first, Ramiz said, adding that the over-reliance on all-rounders was not the way to go.
“If Saim Ayub or Hassan Nawaz are critical players and if they fire tomorrow, then I see Pakistan competing with India,” Ramiz said.
He also said that the dot-ball percentage needed to go down for the Green Shirts.
Speaking on the Indian team’s refusal to shake hands, he said, “Who resorts to things like this in this day and age?”
PCB chairperson Mohsin Naqvi also met the team ahead of the Pakistan-India clash in Dubai.

Last Sunday’s match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to boycott the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands, as is customary, at the toss and after the match.
A potential third India-Pakistan showdown looms if both sides qualify for the final on September 28 in Dubai.
India lifted the Asia Cup in its last, 50-over edition and were the favourites to retain the crown.
Pakistan and India advanced to the next stage from Group ‘A’, while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh qualified from Group ‘B’.
Along with regional bragging rights, the Asia Cup serves as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.</p><small>2025-09-20 19:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/210005089395e2d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943458/iran-says-cooperation-with-iaea-suspended-after-european-move-on-un-sanctions' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says cooperation with IAEA suspended after European move on UN sanctions</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s top security body said on Saturday that action by Britain, France and Germany to reimpose United Nations sanctions will “effectively suspend” its cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog.
“Despite the foreign ministry’s cooperation with the [International Atomic Energy] Agency and the presentation of plans to resolve the issue, the actions of European countries will effectively suspend the path of cooperation with the agency,” the Supreme National Security Council said in a televised statement.
Britain, France and Germany were among the parties to a 2015 deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that gave Iran relief from UN sanctions in return for UN-monitored restrictions on its nuclear activities.
 
 

The three governments say Iran has reneged on its commitments under the deal which has been effectively moribund since Washington pulled out in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term.
The UN Security Council voted on Friday, after European pressure, to reimpose the UN sanctions on Iran.
Russia slammed the vote earlier today and warned of a risk of an “escalation of tensions”.
“The Russian side has repeatedly pointed out the provocative and illegal nature of the actions of the European countries participating in the JCPOA,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
“These actions have nothing to do with diplomacy and lead exclusively to a further escalation of tensions surrounding the Iranian nuclear program,” the Russian ministry said.
In August, Moscow warned that the reimposition of sanctions against Iran, its key ally, risked “irreparable consequences”.
Tehran and Moscow have been bolstering political, military and economic ties over the past decade as Russia drifted away from the West.
Relations between the two countries grew even closer after Russia launched its offensive in Ukraine.</p><small>2025-09-20 19:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/201046448a15cd9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943398/trumps-100000-fee-for-h-1b-visas-a-tech-industry-favourite-concerns-india' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, a tech industry favourite, concerns India</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Friday ordered an annual $100,000 fee be added to H-1B skilled worker visas, creating potentially major repercussions for the tech industry where such permits are prolific.
The new measure, which could likely face legal challenges, was announced alongside the introduction of a $1 million “gold card“ residency programme that Trump had previewed months earlier.
“The main thing is, we’re going to have great people coming in, and they’re going to be paying,” Trump told reporters as he signed the orders in the Oval Office.
Later, the White House issued a major clarification to the new visa policy, saying the $100,000 fee will be a “one-time” payment imposed on new applicants.
“This is a one-time fee that applies only to the petition. It only applies to new visas, not renewals or current visa holders,” a White House official said on condition of anonymity.
H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States, initially for three years, but extendable to six years.
The United States awards 85,000 H-1B visas per year on a lottery system, with India accounting for around three-quarters of the recipients.
Large technology firms rely on Indian workers who either relocate to the United States or come and go between the two countries.
Tech entrepreneurs — including Trump’s former ally Elon Musk — have warned against targeting H-1B visas, saying that the United States does not have enough homegrown talent to fill important tech sector job vacancies.
“All the big companies are on board,” said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who joined Trump in the Oval Office.
Trump has had the H-1B programme in his sights since his first term in office, but faced court challenges to his earlier approach, which targeted the types of jobs that qualify. The current iteration has become the latest move in the major immigration crackdown of his second term.
According to Trump’s order, the fee will be required for those seeking to enter the country beginning Sunday, with the Homeland Security secretary able to exempt individuals, entire companies, or entire industries.
The order expires in a year, though Trump can extend it.
The number of H-1B visa applications has risen sharply in recent years, with a peak in approvals in 2022 under then-president Joe Biden.
In contrast, the peak in rejections was recorded in 2018, during Trump’s first term in the White House.
The United States approved approximately 400,000 H-1B visas in 2024, two-thirds of which were renewals.
Trump also signed an order creating a new expedited pathway to US residency for people who pay $1 million, or for corporate sponsors to pay $2 million.
“I think it’s going to be tremendously successful,” Trump added.
India says visa fee hike could disrupt families
India’s foreign ministry has said that the Trump administration’s move to increase H1-B visa fees was likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of potential disruptions for families affected by the policy.
 






Meanwhile, India’s leading trade body Nasscom has said the timeline for implementing the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas for high-tech workers in the United States was a “concern”.
“A one-day deadline creates considerable uncertainty for businesses, professionals, and students across the world,” it said in a statement after President Donald Trump announced the fee, which comes into force from Sunday.
It added that policy changes of this scale were best “introduced with adequate transition periods, allowing organisations and individuals to plan effectively and minimise disruption.”
India’s opposition leader Rahul Gandhi shared clippings of previous developments as well as the current one on X to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“I repeated, India has a weak PM,” he wrote.
 






South Asia Analyst Michael Kugelman, in a post on X, said: “The new H1B visa fee is the latest blow to what’s long been one of the most resilient elements of US-India partnership: People-to-people ties.”

Having been rolled over by Sri Lanka in the first round, Bangladesh got their act together after winning the toss and choosing to bowl first.
Bangladesh required 10 runs off 10 balls with seven wickets in hand but the dismissal of Hridoy spiced things up. He was trapped leg before by Dushmantha Chameera in the 19th over, and Dasun Shanaka then struck twice in the last over to keep the contest alive.
In the end, tail-ender Nasum Ahmed scampered a cheeky single to cover off the penultimate ball to see Bangladesh home.
Their bowlers had set it up by limiting Sri Lanka to 168 for seven on a belter of a track and thanks to Hridoy and Hassan, Bangladesh crossed the line with one delivery to spare.
Sri Lanka could have been bundled out for much less, but three spilt catches let them off the hook. In the end, the drops didn’t hurt as the chase looked comfortable.
 






Hassan provided an electric start, making the most of the powerplay with 61 off 45 balls studded with two fours and four sixes. Hridoy ensured they didn’t waste the opportunity, posting 58 off 37 with four fours and two sixes. In the process he brought up 1000 T20I runs.
Sri Lanka rued being a bowler short as part-timers filled in four overs and Bangladesh cashed in gleefully.
All-rounder Dunith Wellalage featured after landing in Dubai the morning of the game, having returned home to Colombo to pay his last respects to his father who passed away on Thursday.
Former captain Shanaka had earlier top-scored for Sri Lanka with 64 off 37, his first half-century since January 2023.
The pitch for the match was the same as the one used for the Pakistan-UAE clash.
From Group A, Pakistan and India will face each other in their second encounter of the tournament tomorrow.
A potential third Pakistan-India showdown looms if both sides qualify for the final on September 28 in Dubai.

The new guidelines, laid out in a lengthy memo distributed to reporters on Friday, require them to sign an affidavit promising to comply, or risk losing their media credentials.
The move is the latest by the administration of President Donald Trump to control media coverage of his policies, after he suggested that negative stories could be “illegal.”
The Pentagon “remains committed to transparency to promote accountability and public trust,” the memo says.
But it adds: “Information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorising official before it is released, even if it is unclassified”, effectively barring material sourced to unnamed officials.
This new restriction would apply to both classified and “controlled unclassified information.”
The memo also details sweeping new restrictions on where Pentagon reporters can actually go without official escorts within the military’s vast headquarters just outside Washington.
“The ‘press’ does not run the Pentagon — the people do,” Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. “The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility. Wear a badge and follow the rules — or go home.”
 






The new rules come months after Hegseth faced stark criticism for revealing timings of US air strikes on Yemen’s Houthis in a Signal group chat that inadvertently included a reporter.
Hegseth, a former Fox News co-host and Army National Guard veteran, was also reported to have shared those details in a separate Signal group chain that included his wife.
A spokesperson for The New York Times — a frequent target of Trump’s ire — called the new rules “yet another step in a concerning pattern of reducing access to what the US military is undertaking at taxpayer expense.”
National Press Club President Mike Balsamo hit out at the new rules, and called on the Pentagon to quickly rescind them.
“If the news about our military must first be approved by the government, then the public is no longer getting independent reporting,” Balsamo said in a statement. “It is getting only what officials want them to see. That should alarm every American.”
Trump terms his negative media coverage ‘illegal’
A day prior, Trump bashed US media coverage that he claimed was unduly negative and therefore “illegal,” stoking a debate over free speech following the suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s TV show by ABC.
“They’ll take a great story and they’ll make it bad. See, I think it’s really illegal, personally,” Trump, who has sued multiple major news organisations this year, told reporters gathered in the Oval Office.
The 79-year-old Republican, an avid television watcher, chiefly focused his diatribe on US television networks, reiterating a claim that coverage of him and his administration is “97 per cent bad”.
 


He also defended the head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, whose threats against broadcasters have sparked a national debate over free speech and caused some unease even among Republicans.
Carr on Wednesday criticised Kimmel’s remarks on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and threatened broadcasters who carry his show with possible sanctions. Hours later, ABC announced Kimmel’s show was suspended indefinitely.
On Friday, Trump called Carr “an incredible American patriot with courage.”
Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a close Trump ally, meanwhile, said he believes it’s dangerous for a government to put itself in a position to say what speech it may or may not like.
Commenting on Carr’s threat to fine broadcasters or pull their licenses over the content of their shows, Cruz referenced a Martin Scorsese gangster movie.
“I got to say that’s right out of Goodfellas,” Cruz said. “That’s right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, ‘Nice bar you have here. It would be a shame if something happened to it.’”

In a post on X following his meeting with Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) Chairman Raja Ali Raza Anwar on the sidelines of the 69th IAEA General Conference in Vienna, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi highlighted Pakistan’s achievements in expanding its civil nuclear energy capacity.
He observed that Pakistan’s nuclear power programme was advancing “at a good pace”, particularly with the ongoing construction of Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Unit-5 (C-5).
Grossi recalled witnessing the first concrete pouring at the site in February, which he described as a “major milestone in Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen energy security through clean and sustainable nuclear power”.
 






The IAEA DG and PAEC chairman reviewed areas of cooperation under various agency initiatives.
These included Atoms4Food, which applies nuclear technology to improve crop yields, food safety and pest control, and Rays of Hope, which aims to expand access to nuclear medicine and radiotherapy for cancer care across the Asia-Pacific region.
Grossi appreciated Pakistan’s active engagement with the agency, especially in capacity-building, training, and the application of nuclear knowledge for socio-economic development.
He noted that Pakistan continued to serve as an important partner in the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology.
The PAEC chairman reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the peaceful applications of nuclear technology, in line with national development priorities and IAEA frameworks. He underlined that Pakistan’s nuclear power plants operated under the highest safety standards and contributed significantly to the energy mix by providing reliable, low-carbon electricity.
“The PAEC’s activities were closely aligned with the IAEA’s vision of promoting nuclear technology for peace, health, and prosperity,“Anwar added.
The meeting also provided an opportunity to discuss Pakistan’s contributions to regional initiatives under the IAEA, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, where Pakistani expertise in nuclear applications is being shared with other member states.
The Pakistani delegation reiterated the country’s resolve to continue working with the IAEA and member states in advancing peaceful nuclear cooperation, sustainable development and improved quality of life for people across the region.
Pakistan and the IAEA signed the fifth Country Programme Framework (CPF) for 2026-2031 on the sidelines of the IAEA General Conference on Wednesday.
The CPF 2026-2031 stands as a testament to the enduring partnership between Pakistan and the IAEA. Its implementation will strengthen Pakistan’s socio-economic development and reinforce its role as a responsible member state committed to the global mission of the IAEA, a press release of PAEC said.
 






The country programme outlined national priorities where nuclear science and technology will directly support socio-economic development. It builds on decades of collaboration and aligns with Pakistan’s development agenda and international commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals.
Covering three technical cooperation cycles, it identified five key areas: food and agriculture, human health and nutrition, climate change and water resource management, nuclear power, and radiation and nuclear safety.</p><small>2025-09-20 17:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/20123841c88d4da.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943402/shireen-mazari-says-islamabad-police-surrounded-her-house-enquired-about-daughter-imaan-and-son-in-law-hadi' target='_blank'><strong>Shireen Mazari says Islamabad police ‘surrounded’ her house, enquired about daughter Imaan and son-in-law Hadi</strong></a><br><p>Former minister Shireen Mazari said on Saturday that a “heavily armed raiding party” of the Islamabad police had surrounded her house at 1am and enquired about her daughter, Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, and son-in-law, Hadi Ali Chattha.
“At 1am this morning, a heavily armed raiding party of ICT police from Secretariat thana (police station) surrounded my home and asked for Imaan and Hadi. They were not there, and we informed them of the same. Cops said they had an FIR (first information report) against them and they should report to the thana. Eventually they left,” she posted on X.
 






In a subsequent post, she referred to a protest at the Islamabad High Court yesterday, where Imaan — who is a lawyer and rights activist — and others had raised slogans in support of judicial independence.
The lawyers had staged a protest on the premises of the IHC to oppose the suspension of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work.
Isl­a­mabad Bar Council member Ale­­em Abbasi, ex-president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) Riasat Ali and Imaan were prominent among the demonstrators.
However, tensions flared when — after the demonstration — PTI-affiliated lawyers, including Intizar Hussain Panjotha, Naeem Panjotha, and Fatehullah Barki, confronted IHCBA President Wa­­j­id Ali Gilani. Witnesses reported the PTI lawyers pushed Gilani, leading to an altercation, before IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jaja and other lawyers intervened.
 






The IHCBA president, accompanied by the secretary and bar council Vice Chairman Naseer Ahmed Kayani, later condemned the incident and announced that a reference would be sent to the bar council seeking the registration of a terrorism case against the lawyers concerned, as well as the cancellation of their licences.
He alleged that a group of lawyers, including Imaan, physically assaulted him, dragged him, and branded him a traitor. Gilani further claimed that they were armed and pressured him to support demands for filing cases against PTI foun­der Imran Khan, which he refu­sed. Jaja also claimed that the protest had been held without a formal requisition to the bar, in violation of due procedure.
Subsequently, police booked Imaan, Hadi and several PTI-linked lawyers under anti-terror laws.
Referring to the episode, Shireen Mazari posted on X that “all videos of the IHC protest yesterday show clearly the FIR charges are absolutely false. Eye witness accounts reveal the same. But persecution of Imaan and Hadi has become a daily routine by the state.”
 






Imaan, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, recently also approached inquiry committees of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against IHC Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar.
The lawyer announced the development on X, saying that she had filed a complaint against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC.
This followed her altercation with Justice Dogar during a hearing earlier this month and his subsequent remarks over the exchange, which Imaan described as “sexist”.
Meanwhile, she and husband Hadi also face charges of alleged anti-state activities on social media.
Imaan was also among the voices calling for a probe into the allegations made by six IHC judges against interference in judicial affairs by the country’s intelligence apparatus in March.
The same month, an Islamabad court had issued arrest warrants for Mazari and Pashtun Tahaffuz Move­ment leaders Ali Wazir and Manzoor Pash­teen due to their repeated failure to appear in a case concerning an alleged anti-state march.</p><small>2025-09-20 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2016244325b8ec3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943427/americans-would-dominate-board-of-new-tiktok-us-entity-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>Americans would dominate board of new TikTok US entity: White House</strong></a><br><p>A deal for the Chinese parent company of popular video-sharing app TikTok to sell its US operations would see the creation of a board dominated by Americans, the White House said on Saturday.
“There will be seven seats on the board that controls the app in the United States, and six of those seats will be Americans,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.
She said a deal could be signed “in the coming days.”
 


The United States has forcefully sought to take TikTok’s US operations out of the hands of Chinese parent company ByteDance for national security reasons. Under President Donald Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, the US Congress passed a law to force ByteDance to sell its US operations or face a ban on the app.
US policymakers, including in Trump’s first term, have warned that China could use TikTok to mine data from Americans or exert influence on what they see on social media.
But Trump turned to the platform, which is hugely popular with young Americans, to garner support during his ultimately successful 2024 presidential campaign. The Republican president has repeatedly pushed off implementation of the ban while a deal has been sought.
Investors reportedly being eyed to take over the app include Oracle, the tech firm owned by Larry Ellison — one of the world’s richest people — and a major Trump supporter.
Leavitt seemed to confirm Oracle’s participation.
“The data and privacy will be led by one of America’s greatest tech companies, Oracle, and the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well,” she told Fox News. “So all of those details have already been agreed upon. Now we just need this deal to be signed.”
Earlier, China stuck to its stance on the future of TikTok in the United States, a day after  Trump said a deal to switch ownership was progressing.
“China’s position on TikTok is clear: The Chinese government respects the wishes of the enterprise, and welcomes it to carry out commercial negotiations in accordance with market rules to reach a solution compliant with China’s laws and regulations, and strikes a balance of interests,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement, reiterating a position it has maintained over the past week.
Questions remain, including the precise ownership structure of TikTok, how much control China will retain over the app’s inner workings, and what Beijing gets from backing down and letting the US muscle in on one of China’s most successful companies.
Progress over the future of the social media app, which has 170 million US users, is seen as key to unlocking concessions in other areas — from aeroplanes to soybeans — as the world’s two largest economies chart a path beyond their current tariff truce.
“It is hoped that the US side will work towards the same goal as China, earnestly fulfil its corresponding commitments, and provide an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory business environment for the continued operation of Chinese enterprises in the US, including TikTok,” the Commerce Ministry statement added.
Since a framework deal was struck in Madrid earlier this week, Chinese officials and state media have called it a “win-win”, promising to review TikTok’s technology exports and intellectual property licensing.
The framework deal was one hurdle Trump needed to clear to keep TikTok open. The US Congress had originally ordered the app to be shut down for US users by January 2025 if its US assets were not sold by Chinese owner ByteDance.
He Yadong, a spokesperson for China’s Commerce Ministry, reiterated China’s hope that the US reduce the barriers to trade facing Chinese firms, when asked what Beijing had got out of the Madrid deal during a news conference on Thursday.</p><small>2025-09-20 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2017522255a9a9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943435/five-children-among-7-killed-in-punjabs-hafizabad-district-roof-collapse-police' target='_blank'><strong>Five children among 7 killed in Punjab’s Hafizabad district roof collapse: police</strong></a><br><p>Seven people, including five children, died when the roof of a room in a house collapsed in the Farooq Azam neighbourhood of Punjab’s Hafizabad district on Saturday, according to police.

The statement said DPO Kadhar reached the site after receiving information about the incident and oversaw the rescue work.
According to data shared by the Rescue 1122, one child also suffered a critical head injury in the incident.
 


Last month, three members of a family died after the roof of their under-construction house caved-in in the Islampura locality of Nankana Sahib in Punjab.

As the country fights to keep its head above the rising floodwaters, many questions abound. Could the damage so far have been contained? How has climate change contributed? Has India’s release of floodwater — which it had warned about — exacerbated the loss and damage of its lower riparian neighbour? Have the floods been down to bad governance, or a lack of preparedness?
To understand these matters, Dialogue Earth spoke to Muhammad Ehsan Leghari, an expert on water resource management and member for the Sindh province at the Pakistani water regulator, the Indus River System Authority. He discussed the factors that have contributed to the unprecedented floods in Pakistan, what has and hasn’t worked for flood control, and how the country can manage future floods effectively. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What are the main natural and human-made factors that cause recurrent floods along the Indus River and its tributaries, particularly the massive inflows in the Punjab rivers?
As the geographer Gilbert F. White noted in 1942, “Floods are ‘acts of God’, but flood losses are largely acts of man”. Human choices in building and managing floodplains can turn natural hazards into disasters. The world, including Pakistan, has been slow to adopt behavioural adjustments alongside engineering, often implementing solutions poorly or unnecessarily.
There are some key factors, generally, regarding the exacerbation of flood impacts. Weak governance turns emergencies into disasters, as seen in recent deaths from floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other parts of Pakistan. Lack of rational spatial or land-use planning exacerbates urban and riverine flooding. Top-down planning ignores real issues and experiences for most Pakistanis. Political and bureaucratic elites prioritise “brick-and-mortar” development that increases flood and hazard impacts.
 


Intense monsoons with 200 to 300mm rainfall that had been forecasted, glacial melt and storms, predicted amid northern heatwaves, are natural factors that caused the floods. But human-made factors cannot be ignored: deforestation increases runoff, and urbanisation and encroachments block natural flows. Similarly, the Ravi Urban Development Authority’s paving of floodplains along the Ravi River in Punjab turned absorbent areas into concrete, inviting devastation by turning them into river paths.
Reports like Pakistan’s 2025 Monsoon Prediction, the National Adaptation Plan and the updated Climate Change Policy highlight reduced river capacity from bridges and encroachments. They’ve urged resilience through wetlands and habitat restoration, but have been ignored.
The 2025 inflows have been a result of exceptional upstream rains, Himalayan melt, and India’s dam releases amid heavy rainfall that overwhelmed Punjab’s flatlands, displacing over 2m people and impacting more 3.6m, with millions more at risk as waters reach Sindh. This exposes systemic issues: encroached plains displace water onto communities, costing billions. Enforced zoning is needed to break the cycle.
How do glacial melt and changing monsoon patterns contribute to flooding in Pakistan?
They drive unpredictability. Accelerated melting in the Himalayan, Hindu Kush and Karakoram mountain ranges due to warming heightens during heatwaves, synchronising with erratic, concentrated rains that overload the Chenab and Sutlej rivers in Punjab. The province faces riverine overflows, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh see flash and urban floods.
With Pakistan contributing to less than one per cent of global emissions, it’s an unjust hit when the country suffers from climate extremes, and in turn, $2 billion in losses. Pakistan will have to adapt to this new normal via basin monitoring, integrating it into development paradigms.
How effective are barrages, embankments and canals in managing floods? Do they worsen downstream flooding?
Controlled systems often increase downstream floods and droughts. Punjab mostly managed its headworks (structures at waterway diversion points) and barrages well during 2025 peaks, ensuring safely passing overflows. But Head Panjnad, a barrage where five rivers converge, faced aggressive flood waves, as forecasts by the Flood Forecasting Division had forewarned us. Punjab has rehabilitated most of its barrages; Sindh is upgrading its Guddu and Sukkur barrages.
However, these hydraulic structures can cause bottlenecks, blocking river paths and causing breaches, shifting burdens without adequate warning. Our infrastructure is old and inadequate, fostering a false sense of security for nearby developments. The solution is to shift strategy: live with floods, remove bottlenecks, let rivers flow and nourish floodplains. In addition, we must combine nature-based solutions — such as restoring floodplains — and controlling overflows with modern technology like automated barrage gates and AI forecasting.
What role does silt and sediment buildup in rivers and barrages play in increasing flood risks?
It raises riverbeds. Sediment buildup has elevated the River Indus riverbed, reducing the river’s flood handling capacity by 17.75pc. Research has shown that over a 24-year period, this issue, combined with diminished water flow, has decreased the river’s capacity to manage high water levels by nearly half. Without management, sediment buildup causes spills, erosion, breaches and waterlogging.
It’s a cyclical issue: earlier deforestation upstream caused more soil to wash into the river, and the continued failure to manage this sediment has made recent floods, such as those in 2025, much worse, costing billions and impacting thousands of people. We need basin-wide sediment strategies such as integrated watershed management for the Indus, involving India and Afghanistan.
How is climate change expected to alter the intensity and frequency of floods in the Indus River basin over the next 20–30 years?
Climate change will increase the intensity and frequency of floods in the basin over the next few decades. This will mainly be caused by more intense monsoon rains, surging glacier melt and rising sea levels that block drainage in Sindh. It will lead to a new normal of more severe flooding, such as that seen in the 2010, 2022 and 2025 events. That means increased losses and vulnerability, with models predicting even more economic and human damage. Research from the World Weather Attribution supports the overall trend of rising flood vulnerability.
To counter this, a combination of nature-based solutions like restoring wetlands to help absorb floodwaters and engineering solutions are needed, along with improved governance across the entire river basin.
Which groups or regions in Punjab have been most vulnerable to floods, and what local strategies could reduce their risk?
In my opinion, with around 4m people affected, the low-lying districts along the Sutlej, Chenab, Ravi and Indus rivers, especially Multan, Jhang, Layyah, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Bahawalnagar, have borne the brunt of recent floods. Urban risk zones include cities like Sialkot, Rawalpindi, Chakwal and Lahore; they face serious flood threats due to drainage and planning challenges.
If we seriously want to safeguard these regions, several measures will have to be taken, such as rebuilding and maintaining concrete embankments, in addition to offering seasonal relocation incentives for local people, deploying mobile and veterinary health units, and mobilising elder-led evacuation plans that draw on ancestral knowledge. Also, empowering communities through bridging skills gaps [in disaster preparedness] can lower risks drastically.
Are flood warning systems in Pakistan good enough, and if not, how can they be improved?
While flood warning systems have gotten better since 2010, they still need improvement. There is a definite lack of preparedness. Currently, one of the main problems is poor communication. Warnings don’t always reach rural areas, and sometimes they aren’t broadcast in local languages or communication channels. We also have accuracy issues: the information is not always reliable or delivered in real time. This is occasionally made worse by a lack of shared data between countries, as seen in the 2025 events involving India, particularly the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty in April.
To improve these systems, we need to take steps such as using 24/7 monitoring and expanding communication through community radio and text message alerts, and ensure better coordination between all groups involved, especially at the community level. Most importantly, we need to shift from a top-down, reactive approach, to a bottom-up, community-driven one that empowers local people, especially the most vulnerable.
Did India release water that caused Punjab’s floods, and if so, was Pakistan warned?
India released excess dam water — including from the Bhakra dam upstream of Pakistan’s Punjab province — worsening monsoon surges. Under the Indus Water Treaty, India should have restored effective communications mechanisms. Pakistan implies that India may have used water as a weapon; however, warnings came earlier through diplomatic channels — the first since the Indus Waters Treaty suspension — on humanitarian grounds.
What should Pakistan prioritise in order to mitigate floods?
Pakistan should prioritise rainwater harvesting, urban water reuse, developing green building codes, restoring its wetlands and floodplains, watershed management and forestation, which together can cut flood peaks by 10-20pc. A 2023 Dutch white paper also stresses integrated resilience through three methods: water “reuse” (spreading so as to recharge groundwater) and “retention/reduction” (via cross-drainage and flood channels), as well as the concept of “removing”, or making space for the river through bridge redesign and bund removals, rather than resort to mega-dam projects.
Dams are not the solution. They bring high costs, ecological damage, displacement, and can even worsen floods. We saw this in 2025, when water was released from India’s full dams on the Ravi and Sutlej rivers into encroached plains, and the part of the Chenab river without dams surged to 1m cusecs (cubic flow per second). Dams are widely seen as anti-poor, anti-environment and unjust.
Which province has suffered the most in the floods of 2025?
Nationwide, since late-June, there have been over 900 monsoon-related deaths, and as of September 11, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has had the most fatalities (504) from flash floods, landslides and cloudbursts. From August 14 to 16, cloudbursts triggered flash floods in the province. Buner, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was worst hit, with at least 380 deaths. Shangla, Swat and Swabi, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saw similar destruction. Intense rain, deforestation, valley blockages and unregulated construction turned debris deadly, showing an urgent need for mountain-area planning and regulation.
Punjab faces the biggest infrastructure and agricultural losses. Sindh has suffered the longest inundation and displacement due to its flat [and poorly draining] terrain. The terrain drives impacts; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s slopes are deadly, while Punjab and Sindh bear economic and geographically spread-out damage [due to being relatively flat]. The whole country is in need of multidimensional recovery.
What are the risks to Sindh, as the lower riparian province?
Sindh’s lower riparian status exposes it to unmanaged upstream floods. But despite that, it lacks input on water releases or land use. In the province, rains amplify to become disasters due to its flat terrain with no flood escape routes, forcing river flows to reclaim floodplains through devastating breaches and prolonged inundation.
What are the biggest governance or policy gaps preventing effective flood management in Pakistan?
The main obstacle is weak governance. More than 400 flood path obstructions were identified in 2011 in a government report I worked on, which mapped over 350 coordinates. Flood responses are often fragmented and reactive, while agencies like the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and its provincial counterparts remain disconnected from communities.
Irrigation departments are under-resourced and politicised, and the 10-year Flood Plan IV has stalled. Spatial planning rules are poorly enforced, and elite development projects by the Ravi Urban Development Authority tend to overshadow public safety. Mandates remain unclear, with overlapping institutions and unresolved inter-provincial disputes. To move forward, Pakistan needs clearly defined roles — who is responsible, when, how and at what cost.

The Group A clash between the fierce rivals last Sunday ended on a bitter note when Indian players refused to shake hands with their opponents.
It was the first meeting between the regional neighbours since a four-day conflict in May left more than 70 people dead.
While the match itself passed without incident, there was no shaking of hands between the captains at the toss or among the players at the end.
Then, at the post-match ceremony, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav seemingly ‘politicised’ the victory by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) called for match referee Andy Pycroft’s immediate removal for a code of conduct “violation” and considered withdrawing from the tournament before going ahead with Wednesday’s match. The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Yadav before the match.
Yadav changed the subject when asked about the handshake issue and Pycroft’s presence, saying, “It will be a good contest between the ball and the bat”.
He added: “Close your room, switch off your phone and sleep. I think that’s the best thing to shut the noise. It’s easy to say, but sometimes it is difficult.”
 
 

The matter was settled after the PCB said ahead of yesterday’s match that Pycroft had apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts over a controversy during the recent Pakistan-India match.
Pakistan’s last group game — which they won easily against the United Arab Emirates — was delayed for an hour due to the stand-off before the matter was resolved with Pycroft’s apology.
Pycroft remained the match referee for Wednesday’s game and is still scheduled to officiate on Sunday.
Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for Sunday’s clash.
India won all three of their group games, narrowly edging out a brave Oman by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi on Friday, as well as beating Pakistan by seven and the UAE by nine wickets respectively.
Suryakumar praised minnows Oman, appearing in the Asia Cup for the first time, for putting up a good fight.
“I feel they played a good brand of cricket,” he said of a team who ended on 167-4 in reply to India’s 188-8.
“They batted very well, but we also managed to give a good outing to our players.”
Last Sunday’s match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to ‘boycott’ the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands, as is customary, at the toss and after the match.
A potential third India-Pakistan showdown looms if both sides qualify for the final on September 28 in Dubai.
India lifted the Asia Cup in its last, 50-over edition and are the favourites to retain the crown.
India and Pakistan advanced to the next stage from Group A, while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh qualified from Group B.
Along with regional bragging rights, the Asia Cup serves as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.</p><small>2025-09-20 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/201549284bf017e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943407/judiciary-under-siege-rule-of-law-or-rule-of-men' target='_blank'><strong>Judiciary under siege: Rule of law or rule of men?</strong></a><br><p>History has a strange way of rhyming. Sometimes it repeats as farce, sometimes as tragedy — and sometimes, in Pakistan, it comes back wearing the same last name.
The last time a Justice Dogar was in the news, the country was under military rule. When Musharraf imposed an emergency in November 2007, Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar took oath under a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) and validated his actions. After the judiciary was restored, contempt proceedings were initiated against Justice Dogar for endorsing the dictator’s actions and violating an order of the court. In Abdul Hameed Dogar vs Federation (2011), Justice Dogar claimed that his actions were, “under confusion, misconception and misunderstanding” He pleaded that he was “really sorry”. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar, who had supported a military dictator, was ultimately required to place himself at the mercy of the post-restoration judiciary.
Nearly a decade later, the judiciary faces another crisis. This time, with Justice Sarfraz Dogar at the centre. On September 16, an Islamabad High Court (IHC) bench led by Justice Dogar restrained his fellow judge, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, from holding court and performing judicial functions. For context, Justice Jahangiri is a signatory to the six judges’ letter alleging executive interference in the judiciary, and was one of the petitioners challenging Justice Dogar’s transfer to the IHC.
Yesterday, five brave judges of the IHC fought back. The judges approached the highest court pleading that this was “a desperate measure of the last resort”, and that “there hangs a big question mark over whether we are being governed by rule of law or rule of men”. There is a powerful visual of the five judges entering the Supreme Court (SC) for justice. Justice Jahangiri appealed Justice Dogar’s order restraining him from holding court. The other judges challenged various administrative decisions taken by Justice Dogar, and questioned the ability of one High Court judge to restrain another from exercising judicial functions.
It bears mentioning that the present situation would not have been possible without the consent of the Chief Justice Yahya Afridi. It was CJP Afridi who gave his consent for the transfer of judges from other provinces to the IHC. There is, however, still time to reverse part of the damage that has been caused and stop further erosion of judicial independence.
Sidelining independent judges
When General Yahya Khan sought to restrain a judge from exercising judicial functions, the President’s Order No. 27 of 1970 was passed. As per Yahya Khan’s law, if the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) was inquiring into the conduct of a judge, the president could require the judge to go on leave.
When the Supreme Court was hearing Chaudhary Iftikhar’s case, it held: “Even General Yahya Khan, as the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator of the country never claimed any divine rights in the matter of suspending a Superior Court Judge or in the matter of restraining him from exercising his judicial powers and enacted a law for the purpose … whether it was during the constitutional and the democratic rule or whether it was during the days when martial law stood clamped in the country and the Constitution stood abrogated, the executive, including the head of the state never asserted any inherent powers to suspend judges or to send them on forced leave or even to restrain them from acting as such judges. Even during the martial law regimes when no constitutional security existed for the Judges guaranteeing them their tenure in office, the Presidents/the Chief Martial Law Administrators made specific legislative provisions for such a purpose.”
The law was eventually struck down.
Crucially, the SC, in Chaudhary Iftikhar’s case, went so far as to hold that a judge cannot be restrained from judicial work. Per this case, even the SJC did not have the power to order a judge to go on “leave”; the SJC can only render a report to the president that a judge be removed from office. The court ruled that even a temporary bar on a judge in the matter of discharging his constitutional duties amounts to removal, which is not permissible.
The order by Justice Dogar “restraining” Justice Jahangiri from holding court cites no legal provision in its support; he does not even attempt to explain the legal basis on which one high court judge could prevent another from exercising judicial functions, even on an interim basis. This is because there is no such authority. General Yahya Khan passed a law to shield his unconstitutional actions. Justice Dogar’s order mentions no law or authority.
The five IHC judges assert that the judges are being punished for decisions that members of the executive found disagreeable. When Justice Jahangiri was appointed head of the election tribunal for Islamabad constituencies, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) sought to replace him with a retired judge. Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani has been passing orders against the executive in cases of enforced disappearances. Justice Babar Sattar’s ruling that ordered the removal of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Chairman was suspended the very next day by a divisional bench. He was also prevented from proceeding in a case where he held that there is a mass surveillance system capable of monitoring millions of citizens.
Courageous decisions are being suspended, independent judges are being sidelined, and judicial independence itself is under siege.
Criminalising opposition
Lawyers at the IHC staged a protest on Friday against Justice Dogar’s actions. In the aftermath, Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) President Wajid Gilani registered an FIR against several lawyers. Instead of resisting executive interference in the judiciary, the IHCBA president chose to target lawyers who were standing up for judicial independence. The FIR includes provisions from anti-terrorism laws. This case joins the long list of cases in our regrettable history where terrorism laws have been misused to stifle opposition. The videos of the protest are widely available online for all to see what is being labelled as ‘terrorism’.
An independent bar association is vital to safeguard the judiciary from external pressures and to provide a collective voice for the legal community. A compromised bar association, on the other hand, enables and emboldens the executive. 
Under this president, the IHCBA withdrew its support for the five judges who had challenged Justice Dogar’s transfer and seniority. In another remarkable press conference, the IHCBA president expressed his support and welcomed a 27th amendment to the Constitution; an amendment that has still not been made public was being eagerly supported. To date, the IHCBA has issued no statement condemning Justice Dogar’s recent actions. In this silence, and in the positions it has chosen instead, the association has revealed exactly where it stands.
The office of the President of the Bar carries trust, responsibility, and the duty to represent and defend the legal fraternity. By initiating criminal proceedings against fellow lawyers, those very values have been betrayed.
Approaching the Supreme Court
As the judiciary faces a moment of crisis, it falls to the SC and the chief justice to determine their course.
The independence of the courts is not an abstract principle — it is the foundation of every citizen’s right to justice. When that independence is undermined, so too is the protection of constitutional rights. An attack on independent judges is an attack on the very access to justice.
The time to act was when the 26th Amendment was passed. The Supreme Court did not. As we approach a year to the date the 26th Amendment was passed, the credibility of the judiciary has suffered considerably, and the destruction of judicial independence is evident. If the SC and the chief justice are to preserve what remains of institutional integrity, continued inaction can no longer be an option.</p><small>2025-09-20 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/20125752b4e5265.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943409/islamabad-court-indicts-accused-in-teenage-social-media-influencer-sana-yousafs-murder-case' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court indicts accused in teenage social media influencer Sana Yousaf’s murder case</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad court indicted accused Umar Hayat in the murder case of 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf on Saturday.
The accused pled not guilty to murdering Yousaf, who was shot dead at her house in June.
During the hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Mohammad Afzal Majoka enquired whether Hayat had killed Sana.
“I did not commit any such crime,” the accused replied.
The judge then asked him whether he was falsely accused in the case.
“Is this all a lie?” the judge remarked. He also pointed out that Hayat had also been accused of snatching Yousaf’s mobile phone.
At that, the accused maintained that all allegations levelled against him were “based on falsehood”.
The court then adjourned the hearing until September 25.
Islamabad police had arrested Hayat on June 3, a day after Yousaf was killed at her house in Islamabad.
Preceding his arrest, a first information report (FIR) of the murder was registered at Islamabad’s Sumbal police station against an unidentified man on the complaint of Sana’s mother, Farzana Yousaf, invoking Section 302 (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
In the FIR, Yousaf’s mother said that a man with a pistol in his hand had entered their house suddenly at around 5pm and “shot straight at my daughter with the intention to kill”.
Later, Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi had said during a press conference the police had arrested a suspect, who was a was a 22-year-old man, from Faisalabad.
He said Hayat had tried to contact Yousaf repeatedly and was being “rejected by her again and again”, adding that the accused had taken Yousaf’s mobile phone in a bid to wipe out the evidence but it had been recovered along with the weapon of offence.
On July 25, police had formally submitted the challan against Hayat to the prosecution branch of the district and sessions courts. It also included Hayat’s confessional statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
In his statement, Hayat — son of a retired government official and a TikToker himself — said he had developed a one-sided infatuation with Sana after connecting with her through social media. He had confessed that suspicion and jealousy drove him to kill her.
 
 

Hayat revealed that he had travelled from Jaranwala to Islamabad on May 28 to wish Sana on her birthday. When she did not meet him, he became convinced she was deliberately avoiding him, he said, adding that On June 2, he returned to the capital after renting a Toyota Fortuner and carrying a 30-bore pistol, intending to confront her.
According to his account, when Sana did not respond to his repeated calls, he went to her home in G-13 sector of the capital, forced his way inside, and fatally shot her in front of her mother and maternal aunt. He then took Sana’s mobile phone to erase their conversations and fled.
Hayat said he directed the driver to drive fast and later hid the murder weapon near a railway bridge before returning to Jaranwala.
 


Following the last hearing of the case on September 13, Dawn reported that Hayat had expressed remorse for his actions, telling the magistrate that he felt deeply ashamed for having taken the life of an innocent teenage girl.
“I feel deeply ashamed for committing such a cruel act,” he had reportedly said, adding that his confession was voluntary and not made under pressure.</p><small>2025-09-20 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/20150259605b486.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943422/cyberattack-disrupts-european-airports-including-heathrow-brussels' target='_blank'><strong>Cyberattack disrupts European airports including Heathrow, Brussels</strong></a><br><p>A cyberattack on a provider of check-in and boarding systems has disrupted operations at several major European airports, including London’s Heathrow — the continent’s busiest — causing flight delays and cancellations on Saturday.
Collins Aerospace, which provides systems for several airlines at airports globally, is experiencing a technical issue that may cause delays for departing passengers, Heathrow Airport said, having warned of delays.
Brussels Airport and Berlin Airport were also affected by the attack, they said in separate statements.
RTX, Collins Aerospace’s parent company, said it had become aware of a “cyber-related disruption” to its software at selected airports, without naming them.
Electronic check-in affected
“The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations,” RTX said in an e-mailed statement, adding that it was working to fix the issue as quickly as possible.
The attack has rendered automated systems inoperable, allowing only manual check-in and boarding procedures, Brussels Airport said on its website, adding the incident had occurred on Friday night.
“This has a large impact on the flight schedule and will unfortunately cause delays and cancellations of flights…The service provider is actively working on the issue and trying to resolve the problem as quickly as possible.”
Passengers with a flight scheduled for Saturday were advised by the affected airports to confirm their travel with airlines before heading to the airport.
Frankfurt Airport not impacted
“Due to a technical issue at a system provider … there are longer waiting times at check-in. We are working on a quick solution,” Berlin Airport said in a banner on its website.
Frankfurt Airport, Germany’s largest, was not affected, a spokesperson said. An official from the operations control centre at Zurich Airport also said it had not been impacted.
EasyJet, among Europe’s biggest airlines, said it was currently operating as normal and did not expect the issue to impact its flights for the rest of the day.
Other major airlines Ryanair and British Airways owner IAG did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
There were no indications of threats to Polish airports, Deputy Prime Minister and Digital Affairs Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said.</p><small>2025-09-20 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/201517418a8ce64.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943423/ukraine-president-zelensky-says-will-meet-trump-next-week-as-russia-intensifies-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine President Zelensky says will meet Trump next week as Russia intensifies attacks</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would meet US counterpart Donald Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly next week as Russia intensified attacks across his country.
Russia carried out one of its largest aerial attacks overnight, firing 40 missiles and some 580 drones at Ukraine in a barrage that killed at least three people and wounded dozens, Zelensky said on Saturday.
Zelensky said he would hold “a meeting with the President of the United States”, adding he would discuss security guarantees for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia during the talks with Trump.
Ukraine has insisted on Western-backed security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks. Russian President Vladimir Putin has meanwhile warned that any Western troops in Ukraine would be unacceptable and legitimate targets.
A US-led push for a quick end to the war has stalled and Russia effectively ruled out a meeting between Putin and Zelensky — something that Kyiv says is the only way towards peace.
“We expect sanctions if there is no meeting between the leaders or, for example, no ceasefire,” Zelensky said in comments released by the Ukrainian presidency on Saturday.
“We are ready for a meeting with Putin. I have spoken about this. Both bilateral and trilateral. He is not ready,” Zelensky added.
In Russia’s latest aerial assault of Ukraine, “a missile with cluster munitions directly struck an apartment building” in the central city of Dnipro, Zelensky said earlier on social media.
He posted pictures of cars and a building on fire and rescuers carrying a person to safety amid rubble scattered nearby.
In the Dnipropetrovsk region, the strikes killed one person and wounded 26, with one man in a serious condition, Sergiy Lysak, the head of regional military administration, said.
‘Intense’ fighting
The strikes come a day after three Russian fighter jets violated the airspace of Estonia — a Nato member on the alliance’s eastern flank — an allegation Moscow denied.
But it triggered fears in the West of a dangerous new provocation from Moscow after Poland last week complained that around 20 Russian drones overflew its territory.
Zelensky repeated the call for “joint solutions” to shoot down drones over Ukraine “together with other countries”.
Russia, which has been chipping away at Ukrainian territory for months, announced on Saturday its troops had captured the village of Berezove in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
In the northeastern Kharkiv region, “intense actions” were ongoing in the key area of Kupiansk, Zelensky said, referring to a rail hub Ukraine recaptured in its 2022 offensive.
Russian officials meanwhile said their forces had repelled “massive” Ukrainian attacks in the Volgograd and Rostov regions, while one person was wounded in the nearby region of Saratov.
The governor of Russia’s Samara region said “fuel and energy facilities” were targeted, without specifying the damage.
The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday its air defence alert systems “intercepted and destroyed” 149 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 27 over the Saratov region and 15 over the Samara region.
Three rounds of direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul have failed to yield anything more than large-scale prisoner exchanges.
Russia has maintained a series of hardline demands, including that Ukraine fully cedes the eastern Donbas region — parts of which it still controls.
Kyiv has rejected territorial concessions and wants European troops to be deployed to Ukraine as a peacekeeping force, something Moscow sees as unacceptable.</p><small>2025-09-20 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68cddc3d0f09c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943377/thousands-gather-in-swat-for-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands gather in Swat for peace</strong></a><br><p>SWAT: Residents of Swat on Friday announced that there would be no place for terrorists in the valley, warning that if the provincial government and police failed to expel terrorists present in the border areas of Swat and Dir, they would confront the terrorists on their own.
The announcement was made during a large public gathering held by the Swat Qaumi Jirga at Matta Chowk here under the slogan Swat Aman Pasoon (Swat Peace March).
Speakers included MNA Dr Amjad Ali, Swat City Mayor Shahid Ali Khan and elders Rahmat Ali Khan, Sher Badar Khan, Bahadar Sher Afghan, Ayoub Asharey, Sher Shah Khan and Mukhtar Yousafzai, Provincial minister Fazal Hakim Khan Yousafzai, PTI MNA Dr Amjad Ali Khan, MPAs Ali Shah Khan, Sultan Rom Khan and Mohammad Naeem Khan, and chairman of the Kabal tehsil council Saeed Khan were also in attendance.
Thousands of people from all walks of life showed up, filling the adjoining roads of Matta Chowk. Many participants climbed rooftops to listen to the speeches due to a lack of space. Scores of women and children also attended the march.

Warn they’ll challenge terrorists if govt fails to oust them

The speakers emphasised that today’s Swat was no longer a place where terrorists could find refuge.
They said they knew who brought terrorists to the mountains of Swat. They asked the terrorists to leave the valley to prevent a stern action by residents. The speakers pointed out that Swat had more than 7,000 policemen equipped with modern weapons but they are not authorised to launch operations against terrorists.
They said the Matta gathering should be taken as a “referendum against terrorism” as thousands of residents voted against violence.
The jirga leaders described terrorism in Bajaur and southern districts “artificial” and rejected by the people. They demanded lasting peace across the province, reminding the state that it was responsible under the Constitution to protect every citizen.
The Aman Pasoon gave the provincial government and police a one-month ultimatum to take decisive action against terrorists and warned that if no operation was launched within that period, protest rallies would be staged across Swat not only against terrorism but against the provincial government and police as well.
Leaders and office-bearers of political parties and organisations, including Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), joined the peace march.
According to local peace activists, the Aman Pasoon gathering at Matta Chowk was unprecedented in the region’s history. In 2022, when terrorists re-emerged in Swat’s mountainous areas, the Swat Olasi Pasoon staged a historic rally at Nishat Chowk.
Two years later, the Swat Qaumi Jirga’s peace march at the same venue was even bigger.

According to police spokesperson Zeeshan Randhawa, the police were continuously chasing the dacoits after they kidnapped several people from the motorway a few days ago. He said that after a tip-off, action was taken against the kidnappers and all of the hostages were safely recovered.
As per details, on the night between Sept 4 and Sept 5, the Katcha area dacoits kidnapped 11 people from different vehicles on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway near Nawazabad in Sadiqabad tehsil. The bandits fired at vehicles on the motorway between 1 and 2am to force them to stop at the Azampur Rest Area and the Guddu Interchange.
In the attack, crew of a passenger bus was reportedly injured and shifted to the emergency ward of the Sheikh Zayed Medical College Hospital (SZMCH) in Rahim Yar Khan. Traffic also remained suspended on the motorway for more than four hours, before it was finally restored at dawn.

Incident happened after police operation near Punjab-Sindh border and Indhar gang threatened retribution

South Punjab Additi­onal Inspector General (IG) Kamran Khan told Dawn that between 20 and 25 suspects attacked vehicles on the motorway. “Three people were injured, two of whom suffered minor injuries, so they were discharged. One remains admitted at the hospital with gunshot wounds to the waist and leg,” he said.
SZMCH spokesperson Rana Ilyas Ahmed confirmed to Dawn that three injured were admitted to the facility and one was receiving treatment for a gunshot wound to the leg. The injured were aboard the same coach and hailed from Sheikhupura, he said.
The motorway incident came amid a police operation against the Katcha criminals in which the police used drones in Ronti near the Punjab-Sindh border. The police had destroyed the hideouts of Katcha criminals during the operation.
On the same day, Indhar gang leader Tanvir alias Dodu Indhar threatened the police with retribution. Later on September 8, Dodu Indhar claimed responsibility of the kidnapping. He also claimed that police had killed a person of his tribe after he was released from jail.
He claimed the police was planning a same fate for his brother who would be released in a few months. In another video showing nine of the hostages standing in the floodwater, he claimed that they had killed two of the passengers and demanded the release of his brother. However, all 11 passengers had been recovered alive during the operation.
It is pertinent to mention here that Katcha criminals have kidnapped 72 people so far this year. This is not the first time that the M-5 motorway was targeted by the criminals and after several incidents, the police started escorting vehicles in convoys.

The accused was presented before a court, which granted four days’ physical remand on Friday for further investigation.
The remand was approved on the police’s request after the court expressed satisfaction that more inquiry was required in the sensitive case.
A police spokesman said a shroud was found near the grave of the girl in the last week of August. Following the discovery, Dhamial police launched an investigation and arrested the suspect accused of desecrating the grave. According to initial findings, the suspect dug up the grave for witchcraft purposes and then attempted to cover it again.
Police immediately responded to the information and had the grave exhumed. No direct evidence of desecration of the body was initially observed. However, forensic reports are awaited for a conclusive determination. Samples were collected during the exhumation, the spokesman added.
The arrest posed a challenge, for which special teams were formed. Police said they worked tirelessly using technical and human intelligence to trace the suspect. Once forensic reports are received, the accused will be charged with solid evidence, and all legal formalities will be completed to ensure punishment for the crime.
A medical board, accompanied by a judicial magistrate, conducted the exhumation of the girl’s grave in Girja Road graveyard. The girl had been buried three days earlier. Samples from her body were collected for DNA and forensic analysis.
Police confirmed that no signs of violence or injuries were found on the body. Nevertheless, a case was registered for desecration of the grave and tampering with the remains.
Zafar Iqbal, father of the girl, lodged the initial complaint. He stated that his daughter died on August 26.
When he visited the grave the following morning for fateha, he found the grave disturbed and the shroud lying in a nearby mansion.
Upon receiving the report, City Police Officer Khalid Hamdani ordered legal action, considering all aspects of the case. Police later sought court approval for exhumation and the appointment of a medical board to establish facts without disturbing the grave unnecessarily.
When exhumation began, the girl’s head and parts of her body became visible, as though the soil had been filled hastily. Her lower torso remained under stone slabs, and the body was without a shroud. According to sources, decomposition had already begun as the body had been buried for three days. Samples were collected before the body was reburied.
A senior police official said the exhumation and postmortem were completed, with tissues and samples sent to the Forensic Science Agency for DNA and other tests. He confirmed that the grave had indeed been tampered with, and a case was registered against unidentified suspects.
As the investigation progressed, police traced the suspect, who turned out to be a black magic practitioner from Mansehra. He was arrested and remanded into custody for four days to aid further investigation.

Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) Chairman Dr Kabir Ahmed Sidhu told the committee that the case had been under review for 18 months due to its complex nature. He added that untimely responses from PTCL management partly caused delays.
Committee Chairperson Senator Palwasha Khan raised concerns about appointments to the boards of PTCL and its subsidiary Ufone, noting that while PTCL board details were available online, Ufone’s board composition was missing from its website. She said the names had also not been shared in previous meetings.
Senator Kamran Murtaza questioned the perks and privileges enjoyed by board members, including reports of $5,000 allowances and foreign trips. “This is public information and should be disclosed,” Senator Khan remarked.
Stolen data
Meanwhile, Senator Afnan Ullah revealed that stolen data worth over Rs65bn is being sold on the dark web, including the personal information of nearly 300,000 Haj applicants.
He warned of external pressure on Pakistan not to legislate data protection laws and urged urgent action to avoid serious consequences.
 
 

Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Chairman confirmed that SIM data, including his own, had been circulating on the dark web since 2022. He also acknowledged poor telecom service in Balochistan and widespread call drop issues.
Senators criticised IT Minister Shaza Fatima for her repeated absence from committee proceedings, questioning the ministry’s commitment to addressing sectoral issues.

Committee flags delays, lapses in telecom sector oversight

Senator Nadeem Bhutto highlighted the lack of mobile signals in several areas, including the Karachi–Sukkur Motorway.The PTA informed the committee that it was prepared to proceed with a 5G auction in December, with consultant reports completed. However, pending court cases could delay the process. The committee urged the ministry to coordinate with the Attorney General’s office to resolve legal hurdles promptly.

• FO adopts cautious approach; cites ‘evolving doctrine’ but offers no specifics
• Dar hints other states also interested in defence deals
ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s conflicting statements about Pakistan’s new defence agreement with Saudi Arabia have intensified speculation about the pact’s nuclear dimension.
During an appearance on a TV talk show on Thursday night, Mr Asif had suggested that Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities could be made available to Riyadh under the new framework.
“What we have, and the capabilities we possess, will be made available to (Saudi Arabia) according to this agreement,” he said, stressing that Pakistan has always acted as a responsible nuclear state.
The remarks were interpreted as the first explicit signal that Pakistan might extend its nuclear deterrence to the kingdom, particularly as Mr Asif was present at the signing ceremony in Riyadh.
However, in a subsequent interview with Reuters, the minister denied that nuclear weapons were part of the accord, saying they were “not on the radar”.
 
 

Amid the confusion, the Foreign Office on Friday seemed to choose ‘strategic silence’, adopting a cautious approach.
At the weekly media briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan sidestepped repeated questions on whether the pact alters Pakistan’s long-declared policy of keeping its nuclear deterrent India-centric, and not extending it to another country.
Asked twice whether that stance had changed, Mr Khan only referred to an evolving doctrine. “The doctrine has evolved and continues to do so,” he said. “I am not here to comment on the specificity of the doctrine, but our position is well known.”
Pakistan has consistently declared its nuclear programme is intended to deter India alone.
In Dec, the Foreign Office said: “Pakistan has made it abundantly clear that our strategic programme and allied capabilities are solely meant to deter and thwart a clear and visible existential threat from our neighbourhood and should not be perceived as a threat to any other country.”
Mr Khan, while parrying question about whether rules of engagement related to troop deployment in Saudi Arabia have been revised, framed the agreement as a consolidation of longstanding ties with Riyadh.
 
 

“Since the 1960s, defence cooperation has served as one of the principal pillars of Pakistan-Saudi Arabia’s all-encompassing bilateral relations,” Mr Khan said. “The strategic mutual defence agreement formalises this decades-old and robust defence partnership.”
When asked if the agreement was aimed to check Israel’s aggressive designs in the region, he said, “It is defensive in nature and not directed against any third country. It will contribute to regional peace, security and stability.”
Speculation about extended deterrence was first sparked by a Saudi official who, shortly after the agreement was signed, hinted to a Western news agency that Riyadh would under the agreement get nuclear cover. Saudi commentators later amplified the claim.
The joint statement that announced the accord, formally titled the “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement”, described it as an initiative “to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression”.
Other states ‘interested’: Dar
Separately, speaking to reports in London, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar hinted that some other states were also showing an interest in building strategic defence agreements with Pakistan.
“It’s premature to say anything, but some other countries want to enter into an agreement of this nature,” Mr Dar told reporters in London, replying to a question about whether other states will join the pact or ink similar deals. “This was not signed overnight; it has taken several months.”
Calling the agreement a “historic pact”, FM Dar said Pakistan has always maintained an informal defence arrangement with Saudi Arabia, which is the same as the agreement signed on Wednesday.
“I believe that both sides are very happy. Let’s be frank: Saudi Arabia has stood with us during difficult times, such as the sanctions. Their support was very relevant and important,” he added. “Similarly, during the current crisis since 2022-2023, when we needed IMF (International Monetary Fund) support, Saudi Arabia stood with us.”

• Plan missile early warning system; joint drills
GULF Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have pledged sweeping steps to bolster collective defence, including plans to increase intelligence sharing, develop new missile warning systems, and hold joint defence drills, after Israel launched a deadly strike on Doha earlier this month.
Following an emergency Arab-Islamic summit, where leaders expressed alarm about Israel’s attacks across the Middle East, GCC officials met in Doha to discuss military intelligence unification, UAE-based The National reported.
The GCC — a political and economic alliance of six Middle Eastern nations: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates — has agreed to expand intelligence sharing through Unified Military Command.
The six-member bloc said they would fast-track the creation of a regional early-warning system to counter ballistic missiles and share the “air situation” with all affected countries.
The measures will also see joint troops and command-centre drills within three months, to be followed by live air defence exercises, the statement said.
 
 

To address all risks and challenges, continuous efforts across military and intelligence sectors will be undertaken to enhance Gulf security cooperation and integrate the security systems, the statement added.
“The priority is ensuring the security, stability and safety of all GCC countries,” the council said, warning of the risks to a region already unsettled by months of conflict.
The decision comes days after Israel targeted a Hamas delegation in Doha that had been discussing ceasefire terms for the war in Gaza.
 
 

The strike killed five members of the Palestinian group, including the son of exiled political leader, alongside a Qatari security officer. Qatar said it had received no prior warning before the explosions erupted in its capital and Hamas said its senior leadership survived the attack
During the meeting, the council denounced Israeli strikes as a “dangerous and unacceptable” provocation.
Delegates in Doha included senior defence officials from all six Gulf states, with the Mohammed Al Mazrouei, the UAE’s Minister of State for Defence Affairs; Bahrain’s Minister of Defence Affairs, Lt Gen Abdullah Al Nuaimi; Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Minister of Defence, Prince Abdulrahman bin Mohammed; Secretary General of the Oman’s Ministry of Defence, Mohammed Al Zaabi; Kuwait’s Minister of Defence Sheikh Abdullah Ali Al Abdullah Al Sabah; and Jasem Al Budaiwi.
The presence of all ministers underscored, officials said, the urgency of forging a common regional shield.
While the GCC has long spoken of greater military integration, efforts have often faltered amid political rivalries and divergent threat perceptions.
Thursday’s agreement, amid the gravity of Israel’s unprecedented strike inside Qatar, was presented as a turning point.

• Non-compliant individuals to be treated as abettors, facilitators
QUETTA: The Balochistan government has directed families to immediately report if any of their relatives go missing or join non-state or militant groups, warning that strict legal action will be taken against those who fail to comply.
According to an official notification issued by the Home Department, families are required to provide such information within seven days and submit sworn declarations disowning relatives involved in militancy, or else face action under anti-terrorism laws.
The notification stated that citizens, parents and guardians must inform the nearest police station and FC/army unit within one week if a family member goes missing or is found to have joined any non-state or militant group.
It further directed that details of individuals already missing must also be submitted within seven days under Sections 118 and 202 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), read with Section 11(1)(EEE) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997.
Similarly, families of those who have already joined militant outfits must file a sworn affidavit of separation and disownment within a week, in line with sections 120/120-A of the PPC, read with Section 11(1)(a)(EEE) of the ATA.
 
 

The notification warned that if families fail to report missing persons or refuse to disown them, and it is later established that the individual was involved in terrorism, the family will be treated as abettors/facilitators under the ATA. Their names may also be placed in the Fourth Schedule under sections 107, 109 and 114 of the PPC, read with ATA provisions.
The Home Department warned that facilitators will face strict legal action, including confiscation of property, dismissal from government service, and denial of all state financial and welfare benefits.

Filed by Justice Jahangiri in person, the appeal before the Supreme Court pleaded for the Sept 16 restraining order to be set aside and suspended during the pendency of the petition, and for the division bench to be directed to hold back from proceeding further.
The two-judge IHC bench, headed by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar alongside  Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, had issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed by lawyer Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution. The petition sought a writ of quo warranto, questioning “by what authority” Justice Jahangiri held judicial office.
 
 

In his appeal under Article 185(3), Justice Jahangiri cited the 2010 Iftikhar Chaudhry case, in which the SC had held that the Constitution did not permit any restraint on the exercise of judicial powers by a judge or any limitation on him during proceedings envisaged by Article 209. The ruling also held that even a temporary disability placed on a judge in the discharge of constitutional and official obligations amounts to removal from office and is therefore not permissible under the Constitution.
The Sept 16 order, the appeal argued, was patently mala fide in its conception and contrary to what transpired in open court. It added that the restraining order was passed in a palpable conflict of interest, opening the door to an egregious encroachment on judicial independence, allowing a larger bench of the high court to restrain fellow judges from performing their judicial functions.
The appeal stressed that although interference in interlocutory matters is an exception to the general rule, an exception arises when an order is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to settled principles of law.
In such cases, he argued, the Supreme Court is bound to intervene to prevent miscarriage of justice. It is a settled principle that no injunction may be granted without the three prerequisites of a prima facie case, irreparable loss, and balance of convenience being satisfied.
However, the Sept 16 order, which the appeal described as a non-speaking order, contains no discussion of these indispensable elements, thereby lacking legal foundation. It argued that the order overturns the convention that the court is a collegiate body of judges, each exercising equal judicial power, who are required to discharge their duties in a manner that upholds comity among them.
