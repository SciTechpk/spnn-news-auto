The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,785.25 points, or 1.31 per cent, to stand at 138,165.21 points at 11:57am, from the previous close of 136,379.96 points.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said: “Investor optimism over a potential rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy, expected later this month, has strengthened following a decline in yields during yesterday’s PIBs (Pakistan Investment Bond) auction.
“A stable external account and easing inflation further support the case for bringing interest rates down into single digits,” he told Dawn.com.
The PSX had staged a modest recovery yesterday as investors resumed buying, encouraged by the formation of a high-level committee to address the business community’s concerns over the recently introduced taxation measures.
 
 

The development has helped the KSE-100 index gain momentum despite the July 19 strike call by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry to protest against the powers to arrest and prosecute businessmen introduced in the federal budget.
Investor confidence was also reinforced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s recent briefing to Moody’s on Pakistan’s improved macroeconomic outlook and financial stability, bolstering optimism for a potential ratings upgrade in the credit rating agency’s upcoming review.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday issued a warning of torrential rains with wind-thundershowers that will last throughout the country till July 17.
“Sixty-three citizens have died while 290 were injured due to monsoon rains [across the province] in the past 24 hours,” read a statement by the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority spokesperson.
“At least 15 were reported dead in Lahore, nine in Faisalabad, five in Sahiwal, three in Pakpattan and nine in Okara,” the PDMA statement detailed, adding that the families of the deceased will receive compensation from the government.
Subsequently, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced on X: “A rain emergency has been imposed in different areas of Punjab due to unprecedented torrential rains and a flood situation.”
CM Maryam added that directives have been issued to keep the public alert through sirens and announcements. She urged the public to cooperate with the local authorities and take safety precautions.
 






In Jhelum, rescue operations were underway to evacuate citizens trapped in floodwaters in Dhok Biddar, Dhok Shah Arif, Sohawa, Rasoolpur, Chak Muhammad and Bhampar villages, according to Punjab Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad.
Around 57 people have been rescued so far with the help of the Pakistan Army, he said in a statement, with more than 50 rescue boats involved in the Jhelum operations.
The spokesperson added that rescue teams have been deployed across the province — including in Mianwali, Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Attock, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Layyah. Over 15,000 rescue personnel and 800 rescue boats were on high alert, Ahmad added.
“Pakistan Army personnel and rescue teams are currently rushing the citizens to safe locations,” he said.
 






Punjab Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Director General Tayyab Farid said that “rivers have overflowed due to heavy rains in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and surrounding areas”, leading to a flood situation.
“Citizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, stay away from power lines and open manholes,” the Wasa DG said in a statement.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Flood alert issued for Rawalpindi
Meanwhile, the PMD issued a flood alert for the Gawalmandi and Kattarian bridges in Rawalpindi as the water level in the Leh Nullah continued to rise.
Subsequently, the PDMA imposed a rain emergency in Rawalpindi, with Director General Irfan Ali Kathia noting that a local holiday has been announced in the district.
DG Kathia urged residents of low-lying areas near Leh Nullah to “cooperate with the administration if evacuation becomes necessary”. In a statement, he warned that strict action will be taken against those gathering or bathing near Leh Nullah.
 


In a separate statement, the PDMA also detailed the equipment provided to the Rawalpindi administration for its relief efforts. This included 16 outboard motor boats, 205 life jackets, 31 ambulances, 19 fire brigade vehicles and four rescue vehicles.
The PDMA provided 28 de-watering sets, five suction pumps, six tractors and as many jetting machines to Wasa.
Another five de-watering sets, seven mini trucks and three jetting machines were given to the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC), the statement added.
The Pakistan Army rescued a family stranded in the flood on Rawalpindi’s Chakri Road using a helicopter, Radio Pakistan reported.
 






Chakwal records 400mm of rain in 10 hours
Punjab’s Chakwal district was among the heaviest hit by the recent rains as it recorded 400 millimetres of rain overnight due to a cloudburst, triggering flash floods across the city, a statement from the PDMA said.
“Chawkwal recorded 400mm of rain in 10 hours, which left many areas flooded,” the PDMA said in a statement issued in the early hours of Wednesday.
However, a rainfall record issued by it at 8am stated 142mm of rainfall in the previous 24 hours.
Footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed water gushing across vast swathes of land, with floodwater entering various buildings, including a Rescue 1122 office.
 


In a statement, the PDMA said water levels had begun to recede with the cessation of the downpour, and evacuation efforts were underway to rescue trapped citizens.
PDMA DG Kathia spoke on the phone with Chakwal Deputy Commissioner Sarah Hayat, who briefed the former on the relief efforts.
She said the relevant departments, including Wasa, Rescue 1122 and other civil personnel, were present on the ground to take part in the rescue operation.
Relief arrangements had been made in hospitals and public buildings, Hayat said.
DG Kathia assured Hayat of providing all possible resources and assistance, according to the PDMA statement. He added that the district administration was in contact with the army as well for additional support.
“The district administration is continuing to monitor the situation, particularly in low-lying areas.”
District Emergency Operation Centre, including the PDMA Control Room, were on high alert, he said, adding that “helicopters and other rescue resources” were also on standby.
NDMA forecasts more heavy rainfall across country
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that heavy rains will continue to lash parts of the country over the next 24 hours, Radio Pakistan reported.
“Various districts in Punjab — including Lahore, Chakwal, Attock, Jhelum, Khushab, Sargodha, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Kasur, Sheikhupura, and Hafizabad — are likely to experience thunderstorms and heavy rain in the next 12 hours,” the report read.

Amid heavy rains and flooding in Punjab, authorities in the federal capital were also directed to remain on high alert by Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa.
“Field teams should provide all possible assistance to citizens in case of an emergency,” Randhawa, also the Capital Development Authority (CDA) chairman, said.
The chief commissioner directed that strict monitoring of all highways, drains and waterways of Islamabad should be ensured.
In case of any emergency, citizens were advised to contact the CDA and district administration on 16 and 1334, respectively.
Child dead, 11 injured in Mandi Bahauddin
Separately, heavy downpour in Mandi Bahauddin left one dead and injured 11 people on Wednesday, rescue officials said. According to the PMD, Mandi Bahauddin recorded 167mm of rainfall in 24 hours up till 8am.
Shah Hussain, aged 10, drowned while bathing in the rainwater, while in another incident, two boys — eight-year-old Qasim and six-year-old Huzaifa — were injured due to electrocution during the rain.
Nine people were injured after the roofs of three dilapidated houses collapsed at separate locations in Mandi Bahauddin. College Chowk, Pindi Purani, Jail Chowk and several other areas remained submerged under two to four feet of water.</p><small>2025-07-17 10:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/171425163869c9b.jpg?r=142524' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924786/fm-dar-to-sign-trilateral-agreement-on-railway-project-during-day-long-visit-to-kabul' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar to sign trilateral agreement on railway project during day-long visit to Kabul</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will embark on a day-long visit to Kabul to sign the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Thursday.
In 2023, the three countries agreed on the UAP Railway project to build a rail link, which will pass through Termiz in Uzbekistan, Mazar-i-Sharif and Logar in Afghanistan and enter Pakistan via the Kharlachi border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The project will facilitate regional, transit, and bilateral trade among­­st participating countries, while supporting both passenger and freight services.
“The railway project aims to build a rail link to connect Uzbekistan with Pakistan via Afghanistan and facilitate access to Pakistani seaports for Central Asian States,” the FO statement said.
“By facilitating regional trade and transit, the project is expected to promote regional stability, growth and development.”
It added that the agreement between the three participating countries will be an “important step towards its implementation”.
Dar will be accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi, the special representative for Afghanistan, and the secretary of the Ministry of Railways, per the statement.
 






“During the visit, the deputy prime minister (Dar) will also hold a meeting with the Afghan acting foreign minister and will call on [the] acting prime minister of Afghanistan to discuss bilateral matters and exchange views on regional and international developments,” it said.
Earlier this month, Dar spoke with Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov and discussed progress on the Framework Agreement for the project.
In June, Pakistan and Uzbekistan decided to begin work on the trilateral railway transit corridor project, describing it as a milestone for regional economic growth and stronger trade ties.</p><small>2025-07-17 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1714101874b5ee8.png?r=141051' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924787/pm-shehbaz-directs-authorities-to-provide-easy-loans-to-farmers' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz directs authorities to provide easy loans to farmers</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday directed the relevant authorities to present a policy framework by the end of this month for the provision of easy loans to farmers engaged in medium and small-scale agricultural activities.
In June, the prime minister reaffirmed his government’s commitment to revitalising the agriculture sector, urging relevant authorities to reduce the tax burden on the sector. He also called for introducing sustainable reforms to boost agriculture.
Chairing a review meeting on planning for agricultural development and agri-financing today, PM Shehbaz directed the authorities to “prepare and present a comprehensive plan by the end of this month for providing farmers with easy loans and introducing a system in the agri-financing sector aligned with modern requirements”.
“Priority should be given to providing modern agricultural facilities to farmers owning less than 12 acres of land,” the prime minister said.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Federal Ministers Ahad Khan Cheema and Rana Tanveer Hussain, Advisor to the Prime Minister Muhammad Ali, Ministers of State Bilal Azhar Kiani and Abdul Rehman Kanju, Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar, Governor State Bank Jameel Ahmed, Chief Coordinator Musharraf Zaidi, and other senior officials attended the meeting.
 






He said the development of Pakistan was linked to the progress of the agriculture sector and value addition of the agri-products.
“Comprehensive planning should also be carried out for small-scale industrial machinery access, aimed at processing farmers’ produce into exportable goods,” the prime minister stressed.
The premier also pointed out that the government was accelerating the reform process to provide farmers with modern agricultural equipment, quality seeds, artificial intelligence, better water use, on-farm small industries, and other facilities.
“Steps are also being included in the reforms for providing farmers with necessary facilities and training for increasing exports through the processing of agricultural produce,” he added.
On the occasion, a detailed briefing was given on ongoing agricultural reforms, the performance of the Agricultural Development Bank Limited, and the loans being provided to farmers.
Earlier this month, PM had unveiled a scheme for offering soft agricultural loans to farmers under the Public Private Partnership model.
In March, the PM had vowed to revitalise the country’s agriculture sector, achieve food self-sufficiency, and boost farm exports, saying that in the next few years, an agricultural revolution can be brought to Pakistan if the federal government, in collaboration with provinces, provides reasonably priced inputs to farmers.</p><small>2025-07-17 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/171337362f407e8.jpg?r=133920' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924784/syrias-sharaa-vows-to-protect-druze-rights-as-ceasefire-holds' target='_blank'><strong>Syria’s Sharaa vows to protect Druze rights as ceasefire holds</strong></a><br><p>Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa promised to protect the rights of Druze citizens on Thursday as a ceasefire appeared to be holding in the country’s south following US intervention to end fighting between government forces and Druze fighters.
Overnight, the government’s troops withdrew from the predominantly Druze city of Sweida, where scores of people have been killed in days of conflict pitting local fighters against the Damascus authorities and Bedouin tribes.
The violence in Syria escalated sharply on Wednesday as Israel launched airstrikes in Damascus while pressing attacks on government forces in the south, demanding they withdraw and saying Israel aimed to protect Syria’s Druze minority.
 
 

Describing Syria’s new rulers as “barely disguised jihadists”, Israel has bombed repeatedly this year, saying it will not allow Syrian government forces to deploy into areas near its frontier.
Facing calls from Israel’s own Druze minority to shield Syria’s Druze, Israel has also seized ground in the south.
In a speech to the Syrian nation on Thursday, Sharaa said Israel had “consistently targeted our stability and created discord among us since the fall of the former regime”, accusing it of seeking to “dismantle the unity of our people”.
Reuters footage showed Syrian forces moving out of Sweida overnight. The situation in Sweida was calm on Thursday morning, according to two people in contact with residents there.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late on Wednesday that the United States had engaged all the parties involved.
“We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight,” he said on social media.
 






The violence has underlined the challenges that Sharaa faces in stabilising Syria and exerting centralised rule over the country, despite his warming ties with the United States and his administration’s evolving security contacts with Israel.
In his first televised statement after the outbreak of violence, Sharaa said protecting Druze citizens and their rights was “our priority” and rejected any attempt to drag Druze citizens into the hands of an “external party”.
“We have spent our lives facing challenges and defending our people, but we have put the interests of the Syrians before chaos and destruction,” he said.
Israeli strikes
Israel’s airstrikes on Wednesday blew up part of Syria’s defence ministry and hit near the presidential palace as it vowed to destroy government forces attacking Druze in southern Syria
“We will not allow southern Syria to become a terror stronghold,” said Eyal Zamir, Israel’s military chief of staff.
The United Nations Security Council will meet on Thursday to address the conflict, diplomats said.
“The council must condemn the barbaric crimes committed against innocent civilians on Syrian soil,” said Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon.
“Israel will continue to act resolutely against any terrorist threat on its borders, anywhere and at any time.”
The Syrian Network for Human Rights said 193 people had been killed in this week’s violence, including six women and six children.
Sharaa faces challenges to stitch Syria back together in the face of deep misgivings from groups that fear “Islamist rule”. In March, mass killings of members of the Alawite minority exacerbated the mistrust.
 
 

Druze, followers of a religion that is an offshoot of Islam, are spread between Syria, Lebanon and Israel.
Scores of Israeli Druze broke through the border fence on Wednesday, linking up with Druze on the Syrian side.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Israeli Druze citizens not to cross the border.
The Israeli military said it was working to safely return civilians who had crossed.</p><small>2025-07-17 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17120352f3e41f8.jpg?r=120358' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/three-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>Three terrorists killed during joint operation in KP’s Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>Three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Wednesday night, police said.
The spokesperson for the Bannu police, Khanzala Quraishi, told Dawn.com, “The three terrorists, belonging to the Zarar group, had been eliminated in an intelligence-based joint operation conducted in the Bannu city outskirts at midnight.”
He said that the “terrorists were wanted for attacks on security forces and the target killing of police personnel”.
According to the spokesperson, the terrorists were identified and all of them were residents of Bannu.
“Three Kalashnikovs, magazines, pistols and handmade improvised explosive devices were recovered from their possession,” he said.
 
 

Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents, with a series of attacks across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur in the last few months.
Yesterday, two policemen were gunned down in a terrorist attack in Kulachi area of KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district, police said.
In early July, at least five people, including an assistant commissioner, were killed and 11 others injured in an explosion targeting a government vehicle in Bajaur.
Six killed in DI Khan clash
Separately, six people were killed as a result of a clash between two parties over personal enmity in the Panyala area of KP’s Dera Ismail Khan early on Thursday morning.
According to the DI Khan police spokesperson, Yaqoob Khan, “the two parties were close relatives, and the clash took place due to a long-standing family dispute.”
The bodies and the injured parties were transported to Panyala Hospital. The police have cordoned off the area and started an investigation, but no arrests have been made yet, he added.</p><small>2025-07-17 07:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1711453083c9d20.jpg?r=114643' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924755/paf-to-showcase-advanced-jf-17-thunder-jets-at-uk-airshow' target='_blank'><strong>PAF to showcase advanced JF-17 Thunder jets at UK airshow</strong></a><br><p>A contingent of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) featuring the advanced JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets arrived in the United Kingdom to take part in the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) 2025, a statement from the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
RIAT, which will run from July 18 to 20, is one of the world’s largest military airshows, has been running for over 50 years and powers the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, according to its website.
A PAF contingent comprising “state-of-the-art JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter aircraft and the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, has landed at the Royal Air Force Base Fairford, United Kingdom, to participate in the prestigious” RIAT 2025, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.

“PAF’s participation in RIAT, one of the world’s largest military airshows, underscores Pakistan Air Force’s commitment to showcasing its professional excellence, operational capability and the indigenous strength of its aviation industry,” the ISPR highlighted.
Adding to the operational significance of this international deployment, Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker.
“The intricate refuelling operation demonstrated PAF’s long-range operational capabilities and the proficiency of its air and ground crew in conducting extended operations beyond national borders.
“JF-17 Block-III is an EASA Radar and Long Range BVR equipped 4.5 generation multi-role fighter aircraft which is capable of undertaking a wide variety of combat missions, bolstering airpower application in the face of contemporary challenges, thereby strengthening national security,” the statement added.
In May, when Pakistan downed 5 Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the Pakistan-India conflict, the PAF formally acknowledged a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down the jets.
The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.
“There is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III,” the statement said.
“The aircraft’s combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.”</p><small>2025-07-17 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17135538a30c222.jpg?r=135616' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924763/fire-at-mall-in-iraq-leaves-at-least-60-dead-officials-say' target='_blank'><strong>Fire at mall in Iraq leaves at least 60 dead, officials say</strong></a><br><p>A massive fire in a hypermarket in al-Kut city in eastern Iraq has left at least 60 people dead and 11 others missing, the city’s health authorities and two police sources told Reuters on Thursday.

ISLAMABAD: Over 65 US companies joined a landmark webinar on Wednesday to explore commercial opportunities at Karachi Port and Port Qasim.
The webinar hosted by the US Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration and the US Department of State, in collaboration with the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, part of the ‘Gateways to Growth: South Asia Port Opportunities’ series, has opened new doors for American commercial services in the port sector of Pakistan.
The webinar served as a strategic platform for American companies to engage directly with Pakistani port officials and private operators.
 






“US investors have made substantial contributions to Pakistan’s development, and we are confident that the port sector will be another area where we can achieve great success together,” said US Consul General Scott Urbom in Karachi, emphasising the role of partnership in fostering long-term commercial ties.
“We believe that by working together, we can unlock the full potential of Pakistan’s port sector, create new opportunities for American businesses, and contribute to Pakistan’s economic development,” he said.
Senior representatives from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Port Qasim Authority, Abu Dhabi Ports, which operates Karachi Gateway Terminal Ltd, and Dubai Ports World, which operates Qasim International Container Terminal, outlined Pakistan’s infrastructure goals, regulatory landscape, and trade priorities, and participated in the webinar.
 
 

The hybrid session highlighted how American firms can support Pakistan’s port development plans, helping expedite trade flows and build new supply chain linkages between our countries.
Ean Hundley, Director of ICT and Infrastructure Policy at the US International Development Finance Corporation, noted, “This initiative equips US companies with market intelligence and direct access to local decision-makers, enabling them to capitalise on infrastructure opportunities across South Asia.”

The seminar, hosted by the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) on Tuesday, was attended by leaders and workers from various political parties.
Speaking at the event, participants voiced grave concern over the worsening law and order situation in Balochistan, alleged genocide of the Baloch people, the arrest of female leaders and activists, enforced disappearances, human rights violations and the controversial adoption of the Balochistan Mines and Mineral Act.
BNP-M President Sardar Akhtar Mengal presided over the hours-long seminar.
 







Political leaders slam human rights violations, call for end to military operations

The speakers criticised the military operations, enforced disappearances and the discovery of mutilated bodies in the province. They denounced the inclusion of political activists in the Fourth Schedule (a terror watch list) and condemned the violation of the sanctity of homes during nighttime raids.
The speakers also denounced the systematic political killings and the installation of “puppet leadership” in both Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The declaration made during the seminar referred to the suppression of national movements through force as a modern form of colonialism that threatens the federation’s integrity.
The seminar also pointed to the denial of democratic space and the promotion of artificial leadership as a strategy to facilitate the exploitation of the region’s natural resources. The amendments to the Balochistan Mines and Minerals Act were described as legislative tools designed to enable the exploitation of Balochistan’s vast mineral wealth.
Political victimisation of Sardar Akhtar Mengal and his family was described as part of a campaign to silence dissent.
The seminar also drew parallels with the deteriorating security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former Fata regions, which they said was also rooted in the desire to control local mineral resources under the guise of counterinsurgency.

In a statement, Kuts expressed concern over the attack on Prof Afaq Ahmad Siddiqui of the faculty of pharmacy and called for an impartial investigation into the matter.
“It is deeply troubling that a respected academic, who has dedicated his life to education and research, was subjected to such behaviour,” it said.
The teachers’ body demanded an appropriate action against those responsible and urged the Rangers’ top leadership to take a serious notice of the incident and play its role in maintaining a peaceful and respectful environment on the campus.

Kuts demands Rangers leadership to take notice of attack on Prof Afaq Siddiqui

“The teachers of the University of Karachi have always respected state institutions and we expect this respect to be mutual so that a relationship of trust and cooperation between institutions and men of knowledge is established,” the statement concluded. 
The incident came to light when Prof Siddiqui narrated his ordeal to the Kuts leadership and university administration via a WhatsApp voice message on Tuesday night.
Prof Siddiqui, who lives in KU Staff Town for the past many years, said his next-door neighbour was a senior Rangers official. He said that for the past some time, garbage was being burnt regularly outside his residence as a means to “repel mosquitoes affecting goats kept on the premises”.
He added that on the evening of July 15, he returned home after Maghrib prayers and saw burning garbage. He approached a guard posted at the residence and requested him not to burn the garbage and cited health concerns due to the smoke.
However, a verbal exchange ensued, during which the guard misbehaved with him and then slapped him on the face, damaging his spectacles and causing an injury to his eye, the professor said, adding that other residents gathered and he was taken to the university clinic, where a doctor examined his eye. 
When contacted, Prof Siddiqui confirmed the incident. However, he was reluctant to share more details.
The KU campus security adviser and a spokesperson for the Sindh Rangers did not respond when Dawn reached out to them for their version.
However, a KU official told Dawn that Vice Chancellor Prof Khalid Mahmood Iraqi met Prof Siddiqui and following that, the university administration held a meeting with senior officials of Rangers, asking them for an immediate and strict action against those involved.

The case is one of a number lined up against Imamoglu, the main rival of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is already being held over an investigation into alleged corruption.
His arrest in March as part of that case triggered Turkiye’s worst street protests in more than a decade. Wednesday’s hearing was held at Silivri court and prison complex on the western outskirts of Istanbul, where Imamoglu has been held since his arrest.
The court handed him a jail term of one year, five months and 15 days for having insulted a civil servant and two months and 15 days for threats, the court document showed.
Imamoglu, who appeared in court, has denied all the allegations, arguing that he was being targeted because of his plans to challenge Erdogan in the 2028 presidential elections. The prosecutor had initially called for Imamoglu to face up to seven years and four months behind bars, and to be banned from holding political office.
On Wednesday, that ban — which is handed down when the suspect gets a minimum two-year jail term — was not applied. Imamoglu was elected Istanbul mayor in 2019 and re-elected in 2024. He was arrested on March 19 in connection with a graft probe and allegations of terror ties.
The string of charges against him could prevent him taking part in the next presidential race. His arrest sparked demonstrations across the country in the worst street unrest since the 2013 Gezi Park protests, which spread across Turkiye and were brutally suppressed by police.

After days of struggling to brush off what he now claims is a Democratic hoax, Trump took his most combative tone yet to try and shut down the issue.
“It’s all been a big hoax, it’s perpetrated by the Democrats. And some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net and so they try and do the Democrats’ work,” Trump told reporters when asked about Epstein.
But Trump is facing the most serious split in his loyal right-wing base since he returned to power, over claims that his administration is covering up lurid details of disgraced financier Epstein’s crimes to protect rich and powerful figures.
Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 — during Trump’s first term — after being charged with sex trafficking in a scheme where he allegedly groomed young and underage women for abuse by the rich and powerful.
The Trump-supporting far-right has long latched on to the scandal, claiming the existence of a secret list of Epstein’s powerful clients and that the late financier was in fact murdered in his cell.
Trump supporters expected the Republican to answer their questions on his return to office this January but now find themselves being told the conspiracy theories are false.

And against this backlash, we see the old instincts swinging into play.
The prime minister has reportedly asked the FBR to ‘go slow’ with the powers they have been vested in the Finance Act for FY26, and the finance ministry has formed a committee to hold talks with the business community around these powers. Against these steps, the leadership of the Karachi-based Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry has reportedly postponed its strike call given for this Saturday, while the Lahore business community appears steadfast in its resolve to continue with the strike plan.
This is as per newspaper reports, and it is still possible that either of these associations could change their minds before the big day. The business communities of these cities are usually very risk-averse in their dealings with the government and issue strike statements routinely to get attention from the policymakers and then walk it all back once this goal is achieved. We will know by Saturday how serious they are in their resolve this time round.
But we don’t need to wait for Saturday to see that coercive powers such as these are usually not very helpful in realising revenues or aiding documentation. Efforts have been launched in the past to push the business community to document themselves by requiring conditions such as retaining the CNIC of their vendors for each transaction, or manually serving notices on hundreds of thousands of individuals in an effort to get them to file their returns.
Remember when Shabbar Zaidi, as FBR chairman back in 2019, announced that 3.1 million consumers had commercial electricity connections without any presence on the tax rolls, and 347,000 had industrial electricity connections without being registered? Remember when he served approximately 100,000 tax notices on non-sales tax compliant people who could be seen to be running businesses otherwise? That was probably the strongest single effort at manual documentation we had seen in a long time. But despite a very strong push, it came to nothing, as a strike call by the traders forced the government to capitulate rapidly.

Having failed to broaden the tax net, they are now talking of ‘tax deepening’.

This time there are important differences, no doubt. But the fact that it is a manual documentation drive, rather than an automated process, that they are launching is common to both efforts. Our own history shows us that despite the claims of the government of the time, the brunt of such efforts falls first on those that are already compliant, from whom they extract more and more. Meanwhile, the non-compliant find ways to ward off the administrative machinery of the FBR.
This time, a rather large confrontation seems to be getting going. The FBR’s powers have been ramped up significantly, with the most important one being the power to arrest people for the purpose of tax recovery. Anecdotal evidence suggests the courts are clearing out the pipeline of stay orders that had been issued against tax demands in the past, and this process has helped clear the way for more than Rs800 billion worth of recovery through ‘enforcement measures’ that the government claims for FY25. In the coming year, it appears the courts are not likely to be of much help to those who have had tax demands served on them, and the FBR will have significantly more power to pile on the pressure on those who have had a demand created on them. Whether this results in smoother and more buoyant revenue collection or turns into a source of significant friction between state and capital remains to be seen, but it is difficult to envision how this can become a sustainable model for meeting the next generation of the country’s revenue needs.
At best, they will squeeze another year’s worth of revenue out of existing taxpayers through means such as these, after having squeezed them dry in FY25 already. After that, they will turn to more radical steps to meet their revenue needs — perhaps a constitutional amendment to allow them to reverse the NFC award and let resources from the provinces flow back to the centre.
The state hit the limits of its resource envelope a few years ago. Perhaps the year in which it had to pay out more in interest payments than it could bring in as tax revenue was one of these turning points. From there onwards, it has been scrounging harder and harder to find the next generation of revenues to meet its needs. Having failed to broaden the tax net, they are now talking of ‘tax deepening’ and searching within their own professed tax gaps to see if ramped-up enforcement can serve up the next generation of revenues.
It is easy to see how this effort will fail, and FY26 is likely the year when this failure point is hit. The FBR does not have the machinery to reach the vast majority of incomes that comprise this tax gap, nor can it reach the incomes of the traders or small enterprises it is trying to reach with its ramped-up powers this fiscal year. They are going to try nonetheless, and most likely along the way increase the burden on those they can reach.
The question is, how much damage will they do along the way? They are trying to act like a ‘hard state’ without actually being a hard state, and this sort of behaviour does more harm than good. So far, they’ve managed to squeeze an annual target’s worth of revenues out of the compliant citizenry using these means. And their effort to ramp up this drive has already hit choppy waters at the outset of the new fiscal year, forcing them to retreat just a tad. But the months ahead promise ramped-up confrontation and a more muscular approach to taxation that borders on outright appropriation.

Climate risks are interprovincial and multi-sectoral. There is a disconnect between well-intentioned policies and their effective implementation oversight by apex institutions, largely due to coordination and operational bottlenecks. Our climate governance architecture encompasses at least six apex councils, in addition to several commissions, authorities, boards and autonomous bodies. These institutions collectively form the backbone of our administrative state, designed to ensure coherent climate policy implementation and democratic oversight.
Infrequent institutional meetings: At the heart of our climate governance difficulties is insufficient coordination and the infrequent convening of vital policymaking bodies. Many institutions, despite constitutional or statutory mandates for regular meetings, struggle to maintain a consistent schedule. For example, the Council of Common Interests, crucial for interprovincial climate policy coordination, meets far less often than constitutionally required. Similarly, the National Economic Council (NEC) frequently misses its mandated biannual gatherings, hindering the alignment of economic planning with climate targets.
A closer look reveals direct impediments to sectoral progress. The National Security Council, despite acknowledging non-traditional threats in its National Security Policy (2021), has primarily focused on conventional security issues, neglecting crucial decisions on climate-induced risks and threats. This oversight prevents the systematic integration of climate security into national planning.
In water management, the Pakistan Water Council’s single meeting since its inception in 2018 means crucial opportunities for a unified approach to the nation’s severe water crisis are missed, leaving Pakistan without cohesive climate-integrated water strategies. Even more striking, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Council, despite its coordination mandate, has convened just twice in four decades, leaving a significant void as Pakistan faces escalating environmental challenges. It has not convened stakeholders since the 18th Amendment was passed. The Pakistan Climate Change Council, designed to spearhead climate action across sectors, has also met far less often than its required biannual schedule since its creation in 2017.

Addressing climate action gaps is fundamental to transforming our aspirations into action.

Despite our extreme vulnerability, climate considerations and coordination remain virtually absent across the six councils, hindering comprehensive planning to address climate threats. Some national commissions grapple with similar dilemmas. For disaster management, for example, the National Disaster Management Commission’s infrequent meetings since its inception in 2010 prevent interprovincial coordination and the systematic integration of climate science into disaster risk management.
Approval bottlenecks: Many other institutions face delays due to required formal approval for key appointments. Frequent delays in leadership appointments at the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council, Pakistan Council for Research on Water Resources and the Pakistan Council for Science & Technology have routinely hindered development in climate-resilient agriculture, water and scientific research.Examples abound where the lack of high-level engagement has compromised the integration of climate into national development strategies, leading to critical climate decisions being delayed or overlooked.
These challenges have tangible consequences for climate commitments. For example, the ambitious 60 per cent renewable electricity goal by 2030 is hindered by lack of provincial coordination. Similarly, the National Adaptation Plan needs strong cross-sectoral coordination, but dormant key bodies leave adaptation efforts fragmented.
Pathways to reform: These are chronic challenges, yet opportunities exist to address them. The prime minister can convene a joint meeting of the six apex councils, along with the planning and other commissions, to craft a shared vision. It will boost coordination of the national climate agenda, and not only help clear the existing backlog but also inject renewed vigour into languishing institutions. The latter include the National Commission for Science & Technology — Pakistan’s apex body for science and technology development and the National Commission on the Status of Women(NSCW) — a marginalised institution mandated to promote gender equity. Such a collaborative approach is vital for revitalising institutional effectiveness and accelerating Pakistan’s climate action.
There are at least two examples where the PM’s powers are effectively delegated. The finance minister has become the de facto head of the NEC. The Planning Commission has historically been managed by the deputy chairman. Can this functioning model be replicated to appoint deputy chairmen of all the six councils as well as commissions for managing routine functioning? The delegated authority arrangements with prime ministerial oversight could significantly enhance operational continuity.
Streamlining appointment processes is crucial for preventing prolonged leadership vacancies. Some professional bodies have successfully elected chairmen — the Pakistan Engineering Council has had at least 12 chosen since its inception in 1976. Pakistan has also experimented with parliamentary committees partially overseeing chairperson selections.
Finally, a systemic challenge arises from the fact that the concerned ministries are not always prompt in initiating the necessary summaries for meetings. This presents the potential for a conflict of interest when the ministry itself is responsible for driving discussions that might involve critical self-assessment or policy adjustments. To address this, an independent cell, potentially housed within the PM’s office, could proactively maintain a roster of upcoming meetings and help the executive office clear backlogs, thereby enhancing whole-of-government coordination and efficiency.
After all, Pakistan’s journey towards climate resilience is intrinsically linked to the effectiveness of its apex institutions. While the nation has articulated climate policies and commitments, the present challenges stem from institutional shortcomings. Addressing these governance issues, leadership gaps and coordination failures is not merely an administrative task; it is fundamental to transforming our climate aspirations into tangible action.
The path forward requires sustained political commitment to reform, recognising that robust institutional effectiveness is the bedrock upon which successful climate action is built. The urgency of this endeavour cannot be overstated as the costs of inaction continue to mount.

A meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, presided over by Syed Naveed Qamar, expressed concern over tax exemptions on the import of sugar.
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial informed the committee that sugar imports were subject to a total of 54 per cent tax, resulting in higher retail prices of the commodity. He said the FBR had granted tax exemptions on sugar imports after receiving the federal cabinet’s decision in this regard.
Mr Qamar observed that the government should disengage from sugar-related matters and allow the private sector to handle its import and export. He said that while the prices of other commodities fluctuate based on supply and demand, increases in sugar prices consistently trigger public outcry. He added that it was surprising the government had deregulated wheat operations yet continued to focus on sugar prices, despite sufficient sugar stocks being available in the country.
 
 


Food ministry says retail price to be capped at Rs175 per kilogram

Committee member Javed Hanif inquired about the IMF’s stance on the tax exemption for sugar imports. He criticised the government for attributing every budgetary measure to IMF requirements, noting that taxes had been imposed even on poultry chicks and mutual funds, while sugar had been granted an exemption.
The finance secretary told the committee that discussions with the IMF were still ongoing on the issue.
The committee also considered “The Parliamentary Budget Office Bill, 2025”, moved by MNA Rana Iradat Sharif Khan, and constituted a subcommittee under the convenorship of MNA Nafisa Shah for detailed deliberation and submission of a report within 30 days. MNAs Ali Zahid, Arshad Abdullah Vohra and Muhammad Mobeen Arif will serve as members of the subcommittee.
The standing committee expressed serious concern over the absence of the industries and production secretary, who was scheduled to give a detailed briefing on the new electric vehicle (EV) policy.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani regretted the absence and agreed with the committee’s decision to defer the agenda item related to the EV policy.
MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig presented the report of the subcommittee on “The Corporate Social Responsibility Bill, 2025”, moved by Nafisa Shah. The committee adopted the report but deferred discussion on it to the next meeting.
The Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) opposed the bill and requested additional time to consult all stakeholders. However, Nafisa Shah, Ikhtiar Baig and Javed Hanif opposed granting further time to the government on the matter.
Mr Kayani said it would be premature for him to state whether the draft bill would be supported or opposed, but emphasised that broader consultation with stakeholders was necessary before any informed discussion could take place in the committee.
The committee chairman allowed the government one month to complete its consultations.
Sugar price at Rs175 a kg
Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Food Security and Research on Wednesday said that the retail price of sugar in the market will not exceed Rs173 to Rs175 in the wake of the ex-mill price of sugar fixed at Rs165 per kg.
A formal notification, fixing the retail price, is being finalised and will be issued after approval from the federal cabinet, the ministry says. Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain emphasised that all provincial governments will be responsible for ensuring the implementation of the approved retail price of sugar, providing relief to consumers and maintaining price stability across the country.

The KCCI has installed hoardings and billboards across major arteries of Karachi announcing the complete strike, with slogans demanding respect for taxpayers “instead of handcuffs”.
Despite the formation of a high-level committee by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to hold consultations with traders on budgetary measures aimed at documenting the economy, the KCCI leadership remains resolute in its decision. The committee, comprised of multiple stakeholders, has been tasked with conducting a 30-day consultation process to formulate a consensus-based proposal for submission to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet.
Mr Bilwani said the strike decision was reaffirmed following an unproductive meeting with the finance minister, where key demands to suspend five major anti-business measures were left unaddressed. These demands include the immediate withdrawal of Sections 37A and 37B, which grant sweeping powers of arrest and prosecution to tax officials; repeal of Section 21(S), which imposes penalties on cash transactions of Rs200,000 or more; abolition of Section 40C, mandating the e-Bilty system for goods transport; rollback of SRO 709, which enforces a flawed digital invoicing system; and restoration of the Final Tax Regime (FTR) for exporters.
 
 


KCCI confirms July 19 shutdown over unaddressed tax grievances

In a statement, Mr Bilwani criticised those spreading rumours about the strike, stating that such elements have no affiliation with the movement and are not part of the consultative process.
He stressed that the strike call was the result of extensive discussions with presidents and representatives of leading chambers of commerce and industry from all four provinces.
He further clarified that any decision to defer or cancel the strike would only be made through mutual consensus and formally announced at a joint press conference attended by all supporting chambers. “No decision will be made unilaterally or behind closed doors,” he assured.
Mr Bilwani lashed out at those disseminating false narratives, calling them enemies of the business community attempting to derail a unified national cause. He reaffirmed that preparations for the strike are complete across the country and appealed to industrialists, wholesalers, shopkeepers, and traders to stand in solidarity with the movement for the sake of the economy and the nation.
He concluded by urging the business community and the public to disregard misinformation and rely solely on official announcements issued by the KCCI and its legitimate partners.

The call comes as more than 1.3 million Afghans have returned to the country this year, straining communities where 70 percent of people live in poverty, the UN envoy said in a press statement.
“Afghanistan’s stability hinges on shared responsibility,” Ms Otunbayeva said in the statement circulated by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).
“We cannot afford indifference; the cost of inaction will be measured in lives lost and conflicts reignited.”
 
 

Women and children face the gravest risks, returning not only to dire economic hardships but to a context where their access to basic services and social protections remains severely constrained, Ms Otunbayeva said.
“Do not turn away,” she appealed to donors, development partners and regional governments.
“The returnees must not be abandoned. What we are witnessing are the direct consequences of unmet global responsibilities. We must act now — with resources, with coordination, and with resolve.”
Ms Otunbayeva said the United Nations in Afghanistan is calling for an integrated approach that resources humanitarian needs while scaling up assistance in areas of return.
She underscored the need for immediate reintegration assistance, including livelihood programs and community infrastructure investments, to stabilise communities.
Without swift interventions, the UN warned that remittance losses, labour market pressures and cyclical migration could lead to destabilisation, renewed displacement and risks to regional stability.
“What should be a positive homecoming moment for families who fled conflict decades ago is instead marked by exhaustion, trauma, and profound uncertainty,” she said after visiting the Islam Qala border crossing.
“The sheer volume of returns — many abrupt, many involuntary — should be setting off alarm bells across the global community.”
“It is a test of our collective humanity,” she added. “Afghanistan, already grappling with drought, and a chronic humanitarian crisis, cannot absorb this shock alone.”
Humanitarian operations remain dangerously underfunded, forcing agonising choices between food, shelter and safe passage, according to UNAMA.
Meanwhile, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (UNOCHA), said in a recent report that the number of Afghans returning from Iran has increased significantly following the recent escalation in hostilities between Israel and Iran.
Approximately 167,000 Afghans returned from Iran between July 1 and July 5 alone.
The report noted that as political tensions and anti-Afghan sentiment rise, the profile of returnees has shifted, with families now comprising over 60 percent of those returning, in contrast to the predominantly single males of previous waves.

Although alert, both Indus River System Authority (Irsa) and Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) responding to warning are jubilant and promising to “absorb” the entire stream at Mangla Dam, where such cushion is available.
According to Irsa spokesman Khalid Idrees Rana, the authority would do its best to store the entire stream. “In fact, the authority was hoping, and praying, for River Jehlum to swell during this monsoon and yield some additional water. At present, Mangla Dam is standing at 1,186 feet, against its maximum level of 1,242 feet – it still can go up by 56 feet. It is holding 3.41 million acre feet of water, whereas it can go up to 7.3 million feet.
 
 

“Irsa’s optimism of absorbing the entire flood wave is based on the filling criteria. Unlike Tarbella, where after reaching a certain level, only one foot of water can be stored in 24 hours. Mangla Dam does not have any such restriction. It can absorb triple the amount of water which is being warned against, the authority’s spokesman claimed.

Irsa, Wapda officials say Mangla Dam still has 56 feet to fill; ex-official cautions about a catch

“Wapda is also determined to host it all,” says Azam Joya, General Manager (Coordination and Monitoring). But still, Wapda has moved all experts to Mangla Dam, set up a control room and is now evaluating all reports and monitoring river and its tributaries. Those managing Tarbella Dam are also onboard and providing back-up to the Mangla mangers. “Yes, Mangla Dam does not have any filling restrictions, but history of its filling is a guide and the authority is keeping that in mind. If the wave remains within the limits of forecast, things would remain under control,” he believed.
Mangla Dam GM Fakhar Jahan is equally confident and terms the situation at Dam “normal.” In an official communication, he says “in this regard (warning of high stream in river Jhelum), it is to inform that dam is being monitored vigilantly in accordance with approved standard operating procedures (SOPs). At present, the situation at dam is normal.
The hydrology directorate remains fully operational round-the-clock and closely observing the prevailing conditions. There is ample storage available to safely absorb the anticipated inflows and any potential peak. And relevant stakeholders will be promptly informed of the actual inflows received at Mangla Reservoir.“

• Women make up only 13.5pc of workforce
ISLAMABAD: Women in wage employment earn substantially lower wages than their male counterparts in Pakistan, according to a report launched by the International Labour Organ­isation (ILO) on Wednesday.
The ‘Pakistan Gender Pay Gap Report 2025’ estimates the gender pay gap at approximately 25 per cent based on hourly wages and 30pc based on monthly wages. The gender pay gap in Pakistan is also significant by international standards. In comparison, lower-middle-income countries — the income group Pakistan falls under — have an average gender pay gap of 21pc based on monthly wages and 17pc based on hourly wages.
While launching the report, Secretary of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis Nadeem Aslam Chaudhary reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to ensuring equal pay for work of equal value.
 
 

He said the report and accompanying action plan represent a vital step towards identifying and addressing the barriers that hinder women’s participation in the economy.
This, he added, would support Pakistan in progressively fulfilling its obligations under the ratified ILO Convention on Equal Remuneration and the Convention on Discrimination.
ILO Country Director Geir Tonstol said: “We now have the evidence, the commitment, and the partnerships to move from promise to practice. The ILO stands ready to support Pakistan in advancing fair and transparent wage-setting systems, formalising informal work, and creating real opportunities for women across all sectors.”
Alongside a large gender pay gap, women’s employment is limited in Pakistan. In 2021, women’s employment rate was around 23pc compared to 79pc for men.
This reflects a gender gap in employment of 56 percentage points, higher than the gap in other countries in the South Asia region. This means that Pakistani women are substantially less likely than men to have paid jobs and that, even when they are in wage employment, women earn substantially lower than men.
 
 

The report also finds that women account for just 13.5pc of employees in Pakistan.
Data in the report also showed that women who are in wage employment are more likely than their male counterparts to have a high level of education.
Moreover, women employees are more likely than men to work in the public sector and in formal employment, as well as in jobs with permanent contracts, in professional occupations and in larger firms.

Trump will host the Qatari leader for dinner at the White House on Wednesday evening, the White House said in a daily schedule for the president. Trump on Sunday said he hoped talks for a ceasefire deal would be “straightened out” this week.
Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had said on Sunday he was “hopeful” about the ceasefire negotiations under way in Qatar, a key mediator between the two sides.

Hamas denies Israeli media claims of progress in ceasefire talks; 21 Palestinians killed in stampede at US-backed aid distribution site

Hamas says no progress in ceasefire talks
Hamas accused Israel on Wednesday of wanting to retain military control of the Gaza Strip, and denied Israeli media claims of progress in ceasefire talks.
The indirect negotiations in the Qatari capital Doha are now in their second week, with the future presence of Israeli troops in the Palestinian territory a key issue.
Hamas wants a full withdrawal and last week rejected an Israeli proposal which it said would have kept troops in more than 40 per cent of Gaza.
Israeli public broadcaster Kan on Wednesday quoted a foreign official it did not identify as saying that work was ongoing to revise Israeli pullback maps.
But Bassem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said: “(Israel) has not yet delivered any new or revised maps regarding military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
 
 

“The entire Gaza Strip is currently under the military control of Israel. What is happening on the ground confirms (Israel’s) intentions and plans to maintain and prolong military control within the Gaza Strip for the long term.”
21 Palestinians seeking aid killed
At least 21 Palestinians were killed on Wednesday at an aid distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in what the US-backed group claimed was a crowd surge instigated by armed agitators.
The GHF, which is supported by Israel, said 19 people were trampled and one fatally stabbed during the crush at one of its centres in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
“We have credible reason to believe that elements within the crowd armed and affiliated with Hamas deliberately fomented the unrest,” GHF claimed in a statement.
Hamas rejected the GHF allegation as false and misleading, saying GHF guards and Israeli soldiers sprayed people with pepper gas and opened fire.
 
 

Witnesses said that guards at the site sprayed pepper gas at them after they had locked the gates to the centre, trapping them between the gates and the outer wire-fence.
People kept gathering and pressuring each other; when people pushed each other…those who couldn’t stand fell under the people and were crushed,“ said eyewitness Mahmoud Fojo, 21, who was hurt in the stampede.
“Some people started jumping over the netted fence and got wounded. We were injured, and God saved us. We were under the people and we said the Shahada (death prayers). We thought we were dying, finished,” he added.
Palestinian health officials said that 21 people had died of suffocation at the site. One medic said lots of people had been crammed into a small space and had been crushed. On Tuesday, the UN rights office in Geneva said it had recorded at least 875 killings within the past six weeks in the vicinity of aid sites and food convoys in Gaza - the majority of them close to GHF distribution points.
Most of those deaths were caused by gunfire that locals have blamed on the Israeli military.
The UN has called the GHFs model unsafe and a breach of humanitarian impartiality standards. Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, accused the GHF on Wednesday of gross mismanagement.
“People who flock in their thousands (to GHF sites) are hungry and exhausted, and they get squeezed into narrow places, amid shortages of aid and the absence of organisation and discipline by the GHF,” he said.

The deceased were identified as Head Const­able Ghulam Muhammad, from Panyala village in Dera Ismail Khan, and Constable Shehzad, from Aba Khel village in Lakki Marwat district.
According to a police spokesperson, the constables were travelling on a motorcycle when the incident took place. One of the constables, who had a disability, was being transported to a hospital by his colleague when they were attacked. The assailants fired upon them as they reached Shahi Gate, resulting in the death of both officers on the spot.
Police and other law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area after the attack and initiated a search operation. As the attackers attempted to flee, police returned fire, killing one assailant and injuring two others. A Kalashnikov rifle and ammunition were recovered from the deceased militant.
The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and district police continue to conduct an extensive search operation in the area. The funeral prayer for the martyred constables was held with full official honours at Ijaz Shaheed Police Lines in Dera Ismail Khan.
The ceremony was attended by Commissioner Dera Zafarul Islam Khattak, Regional Police Officer Syed Ashfaq Anwar, District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmad Sahibzada, several civil and military officials A police contingent presented a guard of honour, and participants laid floral wreaths on the coffins and offered prayers for the elevation of the martyrs’ ranks.
The bodies of the constables were sent to their native villages, where they were laid to rest with full official honours. Initial investigations suggest that the attack was an act of terrorism.
Gas pipeline blown up
Meanwhile, a gas pipeline was blown up with explosives for the fourth time in a month in the Torwah area of Lakki Marwat district late Tuesday night.
According to police, an IED that had been planted along the pipeline detonated with a loud explosion that was heard in the surrounding areas. The blast caused significant damage to the pipeline, which supplies gas to Punjab.
 
 

The explosion occurred within the jurisdiction of Saddar police station. Police and bomb disposal units later arrived at the site to investigate the incident. The blast halted the supply of gas from the Bettani oil and gas field to several regions.
It was the fourth attack on the gas infrastructure in the district within a month. Police have noted increased terrorist activity in the area and have increased security measures around the gas facilities.

While PTI-backed lawmakers maintain their tally of 92 members, opposition parties have experienced slight variations in their seat allocations. The development has not impacted the overall seat count for the opposition, but individual party positions have shifted.
The ECP reduced one reserved seat each for JUI-F and PPP, while one has been allocated to PML-N.
With the latest notifications, JUI-F and PML-N each hold 17 seats in the 125-member house, while PPP holds 10 seats. The Awami National Party (ANP) and PTI-Parliamentarians (PTI-P) each have three seats.

ECP fears delay in oath-taking may affect Senate polls; asks PHC to designate ‘oath commissioner’

The fate of one of the 26 seats reserved for women is to be decided by a draw between ANP and PTI-P, while the reserved seat for non-Muslims will be determined through a similar process between JUI-F and PML-N.
The opposition now holds a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly. This shift follows the June 27 judgement by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench, which declared that PTI was not entitled to reserved seats in either the National or provincial assemblies.
Before that verdict, the opposition parties had 27 MPAs and were unable to requisition an assembly session. However, the opposition will now be able to requisition a session once their newly elected MPAs take the oath of office.
Both JUI-F and PML-N now hold seven general seats, nine seats rese­rved for women and one rese­rved seat for non-Muslims each.
The PPP holds four general seats, five reserved seats for women and one reserved seat for non-Muslims. ANP and PTI-P each hold two general seats and one reserved seat for women.
 
 

Before the ECP’s July 15 order, which granted PML-N entitlement to reserved seats for women and non-Muslims based on seven general seats, the commission had calculated these seats based on six general seats. In the 2024 general elections, JUI-F was entitled to 10 seats reserved for women and two reserved seats for non-Muslims based on the seven general seats it won.
PML-N had previously been allocated eight reserved seats for women and one reserved seat for non-Muslims, while PPP had six reserved seats for women and one for non-Muslims. ANP and PTI-P each held one MPA-elect each on seats reserved for women.
ECP approaches PHC
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) last week annulled the original distribution of reserved seats in the KP Assembly and ordered the ECP to redistribute these seats within 10 days.
A two-member bench, comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal, announced the reserved judgement on the petition of the PML-N against the distribution of reserved seats. In its verdict, the court declared both the ECP’s announcements regarding the allocation of reserved seats for women and minorities null and void.
The court had previously deemed the ECP’s Feb 22 deadline for independent candidates to join political parties unconstitutional.
In a desperate move, the ECP approached the PHC on Wednesday, requesting that it appoint a person to administer the oath to the notified MPAs-elect on reserved seats.
In a letter to the court’s registrar, the Election Commission pointed out that the Senate elections in KP were days away and the electoral college was still incomplete.
According to the letter seen by Dawn, the ECP requested that the PHC chief justice, under Article 255(2) of the Constitution, may appoint a person to administer the oath to the elected members of the KP Assembly on the reserved seats before the Senate polling date (July 21).
The commission had previously written letters to the speaker of the KP Assembly, the governor and the chief minister, urging them to ensure the oath-taking of the members-elect; however, no progress has been made so far.
Wednesday’s letter emphasised that the conduct of the Senate election and the administration of oath to the returned candidates are constitutional imperatives and also a fundamental right of the members-elect to represent their constituencies.
The commission said that it is entrusted with the responsibility to organise and conduct elections under Articles 219(b) and 224(3) of the Constitution, and Section 107 of the Elections Act, 2017. Furthermore, Article 218(3) of the Constitution mandates the ECP to ensure that elections are conducted honestly, justly, fairly, and in accordance with the law.

• Major leading Awaran operation martyred
QUETTA: Just days after the deadly bus attack in the Zhob area of Balochistan, another passenger bus came under attack that claimed three innocent lives, including two Karachi-based Sabri qawwals, and left 13 others injured on the outskirts of Kalat on Wednesday.
SSP Shahzad told Dawn that three people who lost their lives in bus firing Kalat included famous qawal Ahmed Hussain Sabri, his son Ahmed Raza Sabri, who left for Quetta along with other musicians of the group in a bus.
“My brother, nephew and one musician killed in the armed attack,” famous Karachi-based Qawal Majid Ali Sabri said on the phone. He said his brother, nephew and other musicians were travelling to Quetta for performance at a wedding ceremony.
“My close relatives and musicians are among the injured,” added Majid Sabri who along with his wife is due in the provincial capital on Thursday (today).
Officials said the armed assailants were lying in ambush on both sides of the Quetta-Karachi highway in Nemargh area and used automatic weapons to carry out the assault. “They first stopped the coach and then opened indiscriminate fire,” an official said while quoting eyewitness accounts.
The attack came on the day when a security forces killed three terrorists affiliated with India-backed proxy group “Fitna al Hindustan” in Awaran, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). It said an army officer, Major Syed Rub Nawaz Tariq, embraced martyrdom while leading the operation.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kalat Shahzad Akbar confirmed the bus shooting and said three individuals were killed on the spot, while 13 others sustained injuries. The victims were musicians from a Karachi-based band who were en route to Quetta for a performance, police said.
 
 

The injured were identified as Haider, Imran, Manzar, Abbas, Muhammad Saqib, Faysal, Muh­ammad Nadeem, Muha­mmad Rizwan, Musawir Abbas, Muha­m­mad Waris, Faizan, Dilshad (all from Karachi), Najeeb Ahmed (driver), and Bilal Ahmed.
Hospital officials said the victims had sustained multiple gunshot wounds, mostly to the head and upper part of their body. Some of the critically injured are being shifted to Quetta for advanced medical treatment, they said.
According to Imtiaz Lehri, who had booked the team, Majid Sabri was due in Quetta on Thursday along with his wife by air, and a hotel room was booked for them.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed the incident, casualties and location of the assault. He said, “Security forces, district administration, and rescue teams immediately reached the site. A search operation is underway, and the attackers are being pursued.”
He said the terrorists had planned the attack and launched it from both sides of the road. “We cannot yet confirm the number of assailants.”
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti wrote on X, “Targeting innocent and defenseless civilians is an unforgivable crime.” He also blamed India-backed terrorist organisations, stating, “These groups once targeted people based on identity, but are now indiscriminately attacking civilians. This is a war against every Pakistani.” He termed the attack a direct assault on Pakistan’s unity, sovereignty, and peace and pledged that the government would eradicate such threats at all costs.
 






Army officer martyred
On the other hand, the Inter-Services Public relations said on Wednesday night security forces killed three terrorists affiliated with India-backed proxy group “Fitna al Hindustan” while an officer of Pakistan Army embraced martyrdom while leading the operation conducted in Awaran area.
The ISPR reported that the operation was launched based on intelligence inputs about terrorist presence in the area.
“During the operation, troops effectively engaged the terrorist location, killing three Indian-sponsored terrorists,” it added.
Tragically, Major Syed Rub Nawaz Tariq, 34, a brave officer from Muzaffarabad, embraced martyrdom while leading his troops in the operation. “Major Tariq led from the front and paid the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the nation,” the statement read.
It said a sanitisation operation was underway in the area to eliminate any remaining threats.
The ISPR added, “Security forces of Pakistan are fully committed to eradicating Indian-sponsored terrorism, and the sacrifices of our brave soldiers only strengthen our resolve.”

Debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was banned from flying to the European Union, UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban on operating to Europe was lifted in November last year.
Today’s development comes after a team from the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.
“Following air safety improvements, the UK’s Air Safety Committee has lifted UK restrictions on Pakistani carriers,” said a statement from the British High Commission.
“Individual airline carriers will still need to apply for permits to operate to the UK through the UK Civil Aviation Authority.”
British High Commissioner Jane Marriott was quoted as saying: “I’m grateful to aviation experts in the UK and Pakistan for their collaborative work to drive improvements to meet international safety standards.
“While it will take time for flights to resume, once the logistics are in place, I look forward to using a Pakistani carrier when visiting family and friends.”
In a post on X, Marriott called the approval “an important step, and a testament” to PIA’s air safety improvements.
 






Decisions on de-listing states and air carriers from the UK Air Safety List are made through an independent aviation safety process, according to the statement.
“This is overseen by the UK’s Air Safety Committee, who have [sic] been closely engaging with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority over several years.
“The committee has judged that necessary safety improvements have been made since its original decision in 2021. Therefore, based on this independent and technically-driven process, it has decided to remove Pakistan and its air carriers from the list.”
PIA said it was all set to resume flights to the UK now.
“It became possible after adherence to the most stringent flight safety standards, reviewed by the UK’s Air Safety Committee.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the move, saying it will provide “ease in travel between the UK and Pakistan will help this vital trade relationship grow manifold”.
“With over 1.6 million people of Pakistani heritage living in the UK and thousands of British nationals in Pakistan, today’s announcement brings long-awaited relief and new opportunities for families and friends to reunite,” he wrote on X.
 






Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said the government had made concerted diplomatic efforts, in addition to technical and regulatory compliances, with the UK authorities on the matter to ensure the earliest possible lifting of the ban.
 






Reacting to today’s development, Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif commended the government led by his party for “crossing another milestone”. “Three years of continuous hard work have borne fruit,” he said on X.
“The green crescent flag is once again soaring proudly in the skies,” Asif added, commending his aviation ministry for its efforts.
 






In a press conference in Islamabad, Asif said the aviation ministry would now apply for licences to restore routes to Britain.
The minister said Airblue had also been removed from the safety list: “According to my knowledge, they have allowed not just PIA but also Airblue.”
Asif affirmed that the government was making efforts to resume New York flights.
The move adds to another positive development, with the UK government yesterday launching e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
A day prior to that, the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
Asif assails PTI for PIA losses, calls for ‘fixing’ responsibility
Asif hailed the removal of Pakistani airlines from UK’s Air Safety list, but stressed the need for fixing responsibility for the loss caused to the national carrier.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Asif strongly criticised the PTI government for the fiasco and reputational damage caused to PIA, which he called a “crime against state”.
He pinned the responsibility on former prime minister Imran Khan and then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, who had stated in the National Assembly after the 2020 crash that almost 40 per cent of the country’s pilots had fake licenses.
 


The minister called on the government to pursue whoever was responsible for this loss, as the nation’s image was affected and a negative impression was created about the national airline and its pilots.
“Imran Khan and Ghulam Sarwar turned PIA into a graveyard,” Asif quipped.
In reply to a question, he said Sarwar’s speech was “enough to fix responsibility” as the national flag carrier’s image was affected. He suggested that the prime minister could order an enquiry to conduct an investigation and hold individuals accountable.
The minister noted that PIA suffered a drop in business, planes became dysfunctional and the pilots’ reputation was tarnished. He highlighted that overseas Pakistanis used the airline due to cheaper and direct routes.
Asif hailed the civil aviation regulator and ministry officials for the “historic” day, saying that the decision has restored confidence in the national airline and aviation industry. He also thanked the UK and EU regulators for their guidance to plug loopholes and meet international standards.
The next step was privatising PIA, Asif noted, adding that the restoration of routes will assist the process as the government will receive a higher bid price. He asserted that the private sector would be able to revive the airline with higher investment, induct a new fleet and open new routes.
US regulators to visit Pakistan: Asif
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Ke Saath’ later, Asif expressed hope that by September, Pakistani flag carriers would fly to the United States as well.
“God willing, in September, regulators are coming from the US,” Asif said. “We are hoping our flights will start going there and we will start talks soon. Hopefully, they will be successful.”
Recalling the Pakistan Democratic Movement-led government’s pursuit of resuming the services of Pakistani flag carriers, the minister said that the foundation for PIA’s revival was laid by then-railway minister Khawaja Saad Rafique.
“Our regulator put in great efforts,” Asif said. “It was his competence, his international reputation and his contacts that made all of this possible.”
Asif expressed hope that PIA flights to the UK would be resumed by August 14.
“This is a success for our aviation industry as a whole,” he said. “Opening the aviation sector in Europe and the UK to us is a cause for happiness.”</p><small>2025-07-16 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16182330c339e3e.jpg?r=185730' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924588/israel-bombs-syria-army-hq-after-warning-damascus-to-leave-druze-alone' target='_blank'><strong>Israel bombs Syria army HQ after warning Damascus to leave Druze alone</strong></a><br><p>Israel bombed the Syrian army’s headquarters in Damascus on Wednesday after warning the government to leave the country’s Druze minority alone, as authorities announced a ceasefire in the community’s southern heartland after deadly sectarian clashes.
Syrian government forces entered the majority-Druze city of Sweida on Tuesday with the stated aim of overseeing a ceasefire agreed with Druze community leaders following days of fighting with local Bedouin tribes.
However, witnesses reported that the government forces joined with the Bedouin in attacking Druze fighters and civilians in a bloody rampage through the city.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said that the violence in Sweida province since Sunday had left more than 300 people dead, including government forces, local fighters and 27 Druze civilians killed in “summary executions … by members of the defence and interior ministries”.
The Syrian presidency vowed to investigate the “heinous acts” in Sweida and to punish “all those proven to be involved”.

State media said a fresh ceasefire had been agreed, announcing “the deployment of security checkpoints” in Sweida city. A previous truce declared on Tuesday appeared to have had little effect on the ground.
The fighting was the most serious outbreak of violence in Syria since government forces battled Druze fighters in Sweida province and near Damascus in April and May, leaving more than 100 people dead.
The authorities have had strained relations with Syria’s patchwork of religious and ethnic minorities since they toppled longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December.
Israel, which has its own Druze community, has presented itself as a defender of the group, although some analysts say that is a pretext for pursuing its own military goal of keeping Syrian government forces as far from their shared frontier as possible.
Following Assad’s fall, the Israeli military took control of the UN-monitored demilitarised zone in the Golan Heights and conducted hundreds of strikes on military targets in Syria.
Syrian state TV reported several Israeli strikes today near the army and defence ministry headquarters in central Damascus, with Israel’s army saying it had “struck the entrance of the Syrian regime’s military headquarters”.
 






AFP images showed the side of a building in the defence complex in ruins after the strike, as smoke billowed over the area.
Israel said it had also struck a “military target” in the area of the presidential palace in Damascus.
The Syrian health ministry said that at least one person was killed and 18 others wounded in the strikes on Damascus.
‘Existential battle’
Turkey, which has backed Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s administration, said “Israel’s attacks on Damascus … constitute an act of sabotage against Syria’s efforts to secure peace, stability and security.”
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz called on Damascus to “leave the Druze in Sweida alone”, later threatening to unleash “painful blows” to “eliminate the forces that attacked the Druze until their full withdrawal” from Syria’s south.
Israel said it was sending more troops to the armistice line between the occupied Golan Heights and Syrian-controlled territory.
A military official said some troops would be redeployed there from the Gaza Strip, where Israel’s conflict against Hamas was in its 22nd month.
Dozens of people were crossing the heavily fortified Golan frontier, according to an AFP correspondent in Majdal Shams, a mainly Druze town in the Israeli-annexed area.
A military statement said Israeli forces were “operating to prevent the infiltration” from Syrian territory and to “safely return the civilians who crossed the border” from the Israeli-controlled side.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in February that southern Syria must be completely demilitarised, warning that Israel would not accept the presence of forces of the government near territory it controls.
The head of the Druze community in Israel, Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, called the situation “an existential battle for the Druze community”.
Abuses ‘must stop’
Sporadic gunfire continued to ring out in Sweida today, an AFP correspondent reported before the latest ceasefire was announced.
The correspondent counted the bodies of around 30 combatants, some in plain clothes and some in military uniform.
The Observatory, witnesses and Druze armed groups have said government forces took part in fighting alongside the Bedouin against the Druze.
The Syrian defence ministry accused “outlaw groups” of attacking its forces inside the city, saying they are now “continuing to respond to the sources of fire”.
The Bedouin and the Druze have been at loggerheads for decades, with the latest violence triggered by the kidnapping of a Druze vegetable merchant, the Observatory said.
Since they toppled Assad in December, Syria’s authorities and their allies have been repeatedly accused of not doing enough to protect the country’s religious and ethnic minorities.
The United States, a close ally of Israel, was “talking to both sides, all the relevant sides on this and hopefully we can bring it to a conclusion, but we’re very concerned”, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
US President Donald Trump’s administration asked Israel again to halt strikes on Syria and engage in dialogue with the government in Damascus, Axios correspondent Barak Ravid reported, citing a senior US official.
Neither Axios nor Ravid said whether that request came before or after Israeli strikes on Syria’s military headquarters and near the presidential palace in Damascus.
 






France said that “the abuses targeting civilians, which we strongly condemn, must stop”, while the European Union urged “all external actors” to “fully respect Syria’s sovereignty”.
Germany criticised the airstrikes, urging Tel Aviv to refrain from actions that could destabilise the country, Anadolu reported.
The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) also condemned the attacks on Damascus in the “strongest terms”, Al Jazeera reported.
In a statement, GCC Secretary-General Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi said the air campaign represented a “flagrant violation” of Syria’s sovereignty, “a breach of international laws and norms, and a serious threat to regional security and stability”.
Albudaiwi reiterated the GCC’s support for Syria’s territorial integrity, adding that the continuation of the repeated Israeli attacks had constituted an “irresponsible escalation” and disregarded international efforts to achieve stability in Syria and the region.
He also called for international action to stop the “serious violations, hold the perpetrators accountable, and work diligently to protect the Syrian people and preserve its sovereignty in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law”.​</p><small>2025-07-16 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16201235279083b.jpg?r=203558' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924606/imran-prohibits-pti-members-from-going-public-with-partys-internal-matters' target='_blank'><strong>Imran prohibits PTI members from going public with party’s internal matters</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan has prohibited his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters, according to his conversation with his family and lawyers at Adiala Jail shared on his official X account on Wednesday.
On Sunday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide protest, annou­nced by Imran, which is expected to climax on August 5, marking two years of the former prime minister’s imprisonment.
At a press conference on Sunday, where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, CM Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’, with PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik later expressing her reservations over this announcement.
“Publicly airing internal matters or individual concerns before the media is entirely unacceptable,” Imran’s post read.
“My instruction is firm: whether a senior officeholder or a junior member, no one is to express internal differences on social media, electronic media, print media, or any other platform,” he added.
“At this time, many, including myself, are enduring some of the harshest imprisonments. Therefore, I direct every member of the party to put aside all personal grievances,” Imran continued.
He called upon the party to focus exclusively on the protest movement so that fundamental human rights are restored in Pakistan.
“If any party official fails to participate in this movement, I will make the final decision about them myself, even from within jail.”
Malik was conspicuous by her absence at the press conference by KP CM Gandapur. While PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja explained that she was “busy”, she questioned this claim in a subsequent tweet.
“What strategy has been announced for the release of Imran Khan, how and where the protest campaign will begin? Who replaced the Aug 5 plan with 90 days?”
“I myself do not know where I was busy for the past two days,” she said, in a jibe at Raja.
The dec­ision of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on the reserved seats dealt a serious blow to the PTI, which is already emb­roiled in numerous challenges, including internal disunity.
Background briefings revealed a complete lack of trust among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other’s sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding Imran’s messages.
Earlier in June, as the KP government passed the budget for the upcoming financial year without the approval of the PTI founder, his sister Aleema Khan claimed that a “minus Imran” formula was now in effect.
Speaking to the media, Aleema had said that if KP CM Gandapur lacked the courage to stand his ground, he should have resigned.
Later, she clarified that she meant that the government, not his party, was trying to isolate her brother.
“Minus Imran Khan, is the government trying to minus him. Is it not minusing that they imprisoned him?” she had said.
Many senior party members believed that the party was facing a crisis-like situation due to a “communication gap” and the leadership’s failure to hold regular meetings with the jailed leader.
Another senior leader suggested that Aleema Khan’s statement was emotional and provided an opportunity for Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to criticise the party.</p><small>2025-07-16 16:04</small></div><hr>
