The incident occurred at a residence in the Gul Rana Colony area of Soldier Bazaar. The injured and the deceased were shifted to Civil Hospital.
The director of Civil Hospital’s Trauma Centre, Dr Mohammad Sabir Memon, said 13 bodies and 18 injured from the incident were brought to the hospital.
“According to initial reports, the explosion occurred due to a gas leak, resulting in part of the building collapsing,” said a District East police spokesperson.
Rescue 1122 said that search and rescue operations are ongoing, with an urban search and rescue team and a disaster response vehicle present at the scene.
The police spokesperson added that a large contingent of law enforcers, along with rescue teams, reached the scene soon after the incident was reported.
“Police cordoned off the area and tightened security, while rescue agencies initiated a search and rescue operation,” said the police spokesperson.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and expressed sorrow and grief over the loss of lives, said a statement released CM House.
The statement added that Murad directed the relevant authorities to “immediately rescue people trapped under the debris” and provide the victims with the “best possible” medical assistance.
Murad also ordered all possible support be provided to the affected families and instructed Karachi commissioner to investigate the cause of the incident.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also expressed grief over the incident. He directed authorities to accelerate the pace of rescue efforts and ensure proper medical care for the injured citizens, said a statement from the minister’s office.
“All updates and details of the relief work should be regularly reported, the home minister directed,” added the statement.
In July 2025, at least 27 people died and 10 others were injured after a five-storey building collapsed in the Lyari area of the metropolis.
The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure.
In a statement back then, the Sindh Building Control Authority had noted that 588 buildings had been declared dangerous throughout Karachi.
A month later in August 2025, four workers of the Awami National Party (ANP) were injured, with one of them suffering severe burn wounds, when a gas explosion caused the collapse of their office in Orangi Town.
Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.
But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.</p><small>2026-02-19 07:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19100217d398d67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974341/no-leniency-attaullah-tarar-refutes-reports-of-deal-offered-to-pti-founder-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>‘No leniency’: Attaullah Tarar refutes reports of ‘deal’ offered to PTI founder Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday strongly rejected media speculations regarding any “deal” between the government and incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
In a statement shared on X, Tarar said, “There is neither any deal nor any leniency for Imran.”
He added that any impression of the government granting the ex-premier concessions was “entirely false and misleading”.







“Imran Khan is a criminal convicted by courts, and the reports about  leniency for him are baseless,” Tarar asserted.
“There is no truth in these reports.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and was months ago convicted in another case regarding state gifts. He also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
Tarar’s clarification follows recent statements made by Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah, wherein he said efforts were made to reach a solution, but Imran was not ready for “any deal”.
“He (Imran) is not ready for any deal,” Sanaullah said in an interview with ARY News aired on Wednesday.
“Two very serious efforts were made [and] not only is he not ready for a deal but his demands are such that the current government cannot fulfil them,” he added.
Sanaullah described the PTI founder as having a “non-political attitude” and being “stubborn”. “The way they (PTI supporters) say that he is standing tall,” he quipped.
According to the PML-N leader, “one serious effort” was made between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in the aftermath of the November 2024 protests.

 

“On the second [effort], I cannot go into details more than this that some individuals had arrived from abroad,” Sanaullah said, adding that they “had links” with Imran.
“They also met with Imran Khan sahib, and as per my information, Imran Khan sahib first agreed with them, but then he stepped back from it.”
In January 2026, Sanaullah had said PTI leaders were seeking dialogue with the government but Imran opposed the move.



On Tuesday, Parliamentary Secretary Barrister Danyal Chaudhry also denied any kind of “deal” with Imran, claiming that the latter wanted a deal and concession since day one.
“We are also ready for talks, but we will not accept any blackmail in this regard. The only reason for sending Imran Khan abroad for treatment can be that, God forbid, he may be suffering from a life-threatening disease that cannot be treated here,” he had said.
His statement came amid concerns raised by the PTI about the party founder’s health after a report submitted to the Supreme Court quoted him as saying he had lost partial vision in his right eye due to an ailment.</p><small>2026-02-19 06:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/191115575039f37.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974344/white-house-tells-iran-to-do-deal-as-trump-hints-at-us-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>White House tells Iran to do deal as Trump hints at US strikes</strong></a><br><p>The White House warned on Wednesday that Iran would be “wise” to do a deal with the United States as President Donald Trump once again hinted at military action.
The two sides recently resumed indirect talks, mediated by Oman, after Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
“Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with his administration,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.
On Wednesday, Trump again suggested the United States might strike Iran in a post on his Truth Social site, with a US military buildup underway in the Middle East.
He warned Britain against giving up sovereignty over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, saying that the archipelago’s Diego Garcia airbase might be needed were Iran not to agree a deal, “in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime”.
CNN and CBS reported Wednesday that the US military will be ready to launch strikes against Iran as early as this weekend, though Trump has reportedly not made a final decision yet.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Trump has been briefed on his military options with “all of them designed to maximise damage”, including a campaign to “kill scores of Iranian political and military leaders, with the goal of overthrowing the government”, unnamed US officials told the newspaper.
Earlier on Wednesday, Tehran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran was “drafting” a framework for future talks with the US.
Iran and the US held a second round of Oman-mediated negotiations on Tuesday in Geneva.
Araghchi said then that Tehran had agreed with Washington on “guiding principles”, but US Vice President JD Vance said Iran had not yet acknowledged all of Washington’s red lines.
‘Do not want war’
Speaking on Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted “We do not want war” but suggested Tehran could not give in to US demands.
“From the day I took office, I have believed that war must be set aside.
But if they are going to try to impose their will on us, humiliate us and demand that we bow our heads at any cost, should we accept that?”
Earlier on Wednesday, Araghchi held a phone call with Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
In the call, the Iranian foreign minister “stressed the Islamic Republic of Iran’s focus on drafting an initial and coherent framework to advance future talks”, according to a statement from his ministry.







Tehran has suspended some cooperation with the IAEA and restricted the watchdog’s inspectors from accessing sites bombed by Israel and the United States, accusing the UN body of bias and of failing to condemn the strikes.
Meanwhile, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned that Washington would deter Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons “one way or the other”.
“They’ve been very clear about what they would do with nuclear weapons.
It’s entirely unacceptable,” Wright told reporters in Paris on the sidelines of meetings of the International Energy Agency.
Displays of military might
The Omani-mediated talks were aimed at averting the possibility of US military action, while Tehran is demanding the lifting of US sanctions that are crippling its economy.
Iran has insisted that the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table.
While talks have resumed, the US has also been building up its military forces near Iran.
Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed.
Iran has sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps beginning a series of war games on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz.
Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a major global conduit for oil and gas.
On Tuesday state TV reported that Tehran would close parts of the waterway for safety measures during the drills.</p><small>2026-02-19 06:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/190947212e46649.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974340/pm-shehbaz-lands-in-washington-for-inaugural-meeting-of-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz lands in Washington for inaugural meeting of Board of Peace</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Washington DC on Thursday on an official visit to the United States, at the invitation of US President Donald Trump to attend the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier as part of the Pakistani delegation.

 


The prime minister will participate in the Board of Peace session in Washington today. He is also expected to hold meetings with senior US officials during the visit.
According to an official statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the visit reflects Pakistan’s inclusion in the Board of Peace, its “effective role for the promotion of global peace” and what it described as the country’s growing diplomatic outreach.
“In addition to attending the inaugural session of the BoP, the prime minister will also engage with senior US leadership, as well as his counterparts attending the meeting,” said a press release by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) dated Feb 18.
It added that the occasion would provide an opportunity for discussions on bilateral matters, as well as global issues of mutual concern.







All 22 invitees to the meeting have already joined the Board of Peace. Pakistan joined the board in late January, and signed the founding charter during the World Economic Forum in Davos.
The summit’s immediate focus is expected to be threefold: consolidating a ceasefire in Gaza, mobilising financial pledges for the BoP — with Washin­gton announcing an initial commitment of $5 billion — and finalising the contours of a proposed global forum that Trump hopes can achieve what the United Nations could not.
Participants are also likely to discuss the proposed International Stab­ilisation Force (ISF), tas­k­ed with securing reconstruction zones and supporting a post-conflict governance arrangement in Gaza.
Eight Muslim-majority countries are expected to participate in the meeting. They include Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar, and the UAE. Muslim participants are expected to adopt a unified position on Gaza-related issues.

It also submitted that the under-construction thoroughfares were excluded from e-ticketing system till the completion of development work and installation/upgradation of road infrastructure.  
The comments were filed on the behalf of deputy inspector general of police (traffic) in one of several identical petitions filed against implementation of e-challan system in Karachi.  
It further said that the provincial government had already provided relief by allowing 50 per cent discount if the challan was paid within 14 days and traffic courts were also being set up to ensure transparency.  
After taking the comments on record, a two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC headed by Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed adjourned the hearing till March 12 as a provincial law officer sought more time to file comments on the behalf of other respondents.  
Citing the chief secretary Sindh, secretary home department, excise and taxation department, inspector general of Sindh police, DIG traffic police and others as respondents, the petitioners asserted that the Al-based e-challan system was implemented in the city without ensuring necessary road infrastructure, vehicle ownership verification mechanism and other allied facilities.

The tipping point is the cost at which battery storage of a single unit of electricity becomes competitive with grid-connected power generation systems. Once we cross that point everything changes, and we could be less than a couple of years away now.
By one estimate, the total cost of a utility-scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) was almost $2,571 per kWh of electricity back in 2010. By now, this has fallen to $192, more than a 90 per cent reduction. Estimates vary, but some of the ones I have looked at say once this figure crosses $100 we would have passed a critical threshold. Past that point it will be cheaper to generate electricity using solar farms and store it in large utility-scale batteries than it is to generate it in large power plants that burn oil or gas. Meaning one large solar farm connected to a massive battery will credibly be able to replace one large power generation plant, to provide round-the-clock electricity either to the national grid, or to a micro grid.
Another report looks at actual projects coming online these days and notes that the price of an all-in BESS project has dropped to $125 in some places as of late 2025. This means projects are now being commissioned that have $75 per kWh for core equipment and $50 for installation and grid connection.
Some experts watching the battery revolution happen in real time are reporting that in China the cost of deploying some of the industry’s best kinds of batteries has already reached $75 as of 2025 and is continuing to drop. This means the tipping point may be a lot closer than many of the best estimates suggest.

With batteries, it will be possible to generate, store and use electricity round the clock using solar only.

This is the utility-scale battery cost we are talking about, massive batteries that can replace entire power plants. Once their cost breaches the critical threshold they become feasible for housing colonies, neighbourhoods and grid supply as well. After that, there is no stopping the revolution.
It was the same with solar panels. The critical threshold to be crossed with those was called “grid parity”, where the cost of one unit of electricity produced via a fully installed and functioning solar generation system would be equal to the cost of the same unit procured from the grid. We crossed that threshold somewhere in the middle of the 2010s. The revolution took off in earnest in Pakistan after 2020 when the inflationary fire of the following years sent the price of electricity spiralling upwards, making solar more and more viable. In the years 2015 to 2020, this price was relatively stable and solar offtake was slower as a result.

 

But now a second boost is about to come, and by some standards, may already have arrived. Once batteries cross the same threshold the critical weakness in solar renewable energy is plugged. Up until now the biggest weakness in solar power generation has been that it provides electricity only while the sun shines. But batteries change that. Now it will be possible to generate, store and use electricity round the clock using solar only. And the cost of setting up such a system will be competitive, and eventually below the cost of power purchased from the grid.
As the threshold approaches more and more people are asking themselves the critical question: should I get a battery? Based on a quick calculation I did on my own bills and solar net-metering benefit since it began, my short answer is “not yet”. As per my calculations the cost of a 10kWh battery with a payback period of 10 years becomes competitive once the buyback rate of home solar electricity drops below Rs30 per unit. For those who have active generation licences, this threshold has not yet been crossed. But if the government moves to offering Rs11 only for solar rooftop electricity, batteries will not only become viable but also a necessity. Selling your own electricity to the state for Rs11 and buying theirs for Rs50, or 60 or sometimes even 70 will make no sense at that point.
A lot of batteries currently on the market may not have enough charge cycles to be able to last 10 years. That is a very long payback period and most batteries on the market today could fizzle out midway through it. And even that system, with 10 units generation and storage capacity, will not take you off the grid altogether. It will comfortably cover you during the hours of peak billing, allowing you to use your units when you need them the most. For the rest of the day you will still be dependent on the grid. Complete off-grid viability could take more than five years. Until then, we will move towards hybrid systems, using a combination of own generation, storage and grid supply to balance our consumption and reduce the peak billing burden.
Capacity payments, which are the largest cost burden on our power system, will start declining from 2027 onward and diminish to their lowest point by 2035, according to data from Nepra’s annual reports. This will help power tariffs stabilise. But devaluations of the rupee could reverse these gains easily, depending on how irresponsible the government is in safeguarding macroeconomic stability. So the outlook for battery storage might take a little longer to cross viability as the grid finds its footing, and quality issues will plague the sector for a while as well. Substandard batteries will impose their own costs on consumers.
But the fact that the threshold is drawing near is undeniable. Once crossed all manner of business models suddenly become viable and the grid will struggle for its own viability, mainly because it will no longer have a captive consumer base upon whom to offload the costs of its myriad dysfunctions. At that point the revolution will have attained unbreakable momentum.

It smartly disguised its intentions as a move to fill in ownership gaps in the occupied areas; it plans to claim the ones where the Palestinians are unable to prove their ownership. While the specifics are yet to be known, it is a settled and trite principle of international law that an occupying power is not allowed to alter the local status quo, let alone attempt to find ways and means of claiming title to the territory itself.
This is the essence of the well-known Fourth Geneva Convention relating to the occupying power. The Convention was adopted in 1949, just four years after the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force, saw the light of day in 1945. The Charter had effectively declared that acquiring territory through the use of force is illegal. It was thus considered necessary to establish a global regime, building on the Hague Regulations of 1907, that would deny any occupying power the right to claim title of the territory it occupied.
Read together, the UN Charter of 1945 and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 made it clear that all occupations are by definition temporary and sooner or later they have to end. During the interim, the occupying forces who are de facto running the affairs of the occupied territory were to behave in a certain fashion. That’s what the Fourth Geneva Convention explains in 159 articles. It imposes a long list of actions and measures that the occupier will not take. Failure would mean a minor or a grave breach of the Convention.
Even in 1949, the principles were so widely agreed upon that Israel felt obliged to sign the Fourth Geneva Convention on Dec 8 of the same year and then, after due reflection and deliberation within the country, stretching over almost two years, it was ratified on July 6, 1951. This was in the backdrop of UNGA Resolution 181, which in 1947 had already proposed the partition of Palestine into a Jewish state, an Arab state and an international Jerusalem.

The BoP’s writ will be tested by Israel’s move to register parts of the West Bank as state land.

During its long occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, both referred to as ‘occupied territories’ in the world press for the last several decades, Israel has regrettably been violating several of the 159 articles of the Convention that it had ratified after almost two years of internal deliberations. Now the latest violation is the gradual registering of these lands as Israel state lands. What does all this mean for the Board of Peace?

 

The political domestic controversy with regard to the BoP is an issue for political parties to resolve but from a legal standpoint it is to be taken as a regional arrangement that member states can enter into under Chapter VIII of the UN Charter. UNSC Resolution 2803, which was passed a few months ago, positions itself as leading to a sort of “pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. Para 16 of the plan annexed to the UNSC Resolution declares that “Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza”. It also approves the raising of an International Security Force; once created, the right to use force of any kind and of any nature — to the extent of Gaza — by Hamas and the Israeli Defence Forces ought to cease.
However, it is to be borne in mind that Palestinians have a right to resist the occupation. That right is not negotiable and neither should the recent UNSC Resolution 2803 be read as curtailing this right. This right is given to every population — irrespective of race, religion or ethnicity — that is living under unlawful occupation. The more brutal the tactics of the occupying power the fiercer the tactics of resistance. The greater the repression of the local population in venues such as the West Bank, the greater the justification to seek assistance from third countries. That’s how Iran developed a legal basis to fund Hamas to support a population that is exercising its right of recognised resistance under international law and also arguably fulfilling Iran’s own obligation to make efforts to prevent genocide. Article 1 of the Genocide Convention of 1948 states that parties to the Convention “undertake to prevent” genocide. This obligation is not only for Iran but for all states that have acceded to the Genocide Convention, and which include almost all the members of the present BoP and other countries including the OIC member states.
The gradual transfer of West Bank land by the Israeli state to itself threatens the derailment of the BoP — alternatively, the board can establish its writ by asserting itself and prevailing over Israel to stop the illegal transfers and resort to status quo ante. Although the BoP was created by UNSC 2803 for Gaza’s reconstruction and its eventual handing over to the Palestinian Authority, it still has the political leverage to persuade Israel that it has to respect the Fourth Geneva Convention in the West Bank if the Gaza plan is to move forward.
We are aware that the International Court of Justice is on record as asserting that Israel’s policies in the West Bank — including settlement expansion and land appropriation — are incompatible with international law. No state recognises Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank. Even Israel’s closest allies, including the US and members of the European Union, have consistently treated the territory as occupied. Israel itself suspended Palestinian land registration in 1967, creating the legal vacuum it now exploits. Domestic claims cannot override international law; they remain unilateral assertions without recognition or legitimacy.
How BoP members handle this move in the West Bank by Israel will set the tone for the credibility of the sequential plan laid out in UNSC 2803.

Speaking on Tuesday, the interior minister accused the jailed leader’s sister, Aleema Khan, of “delaying” Mr Khan’s medical checkup for three days, allegedly so she could ‘do politics’ over his health.
“Alm­ost all political leaders were on board, but Aleema Khan sahiba vetoed them,” Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi claimed. According to the minister, her insistence that Mr Khan’s checkup and treatment be conducted under specific circumstances was merely a means to keep the matter of his deteriorating health alive for as long as possible. But while the opposition TTAP alliance quickly dismissed Mr Naqvi’s statement as “blatantly misleading and contrary to the facts”, remarks made by some PTI leaders regarding Mr Naqvi’s role and their interactions with the government seemed to partially endorse it.
Mr Khan’s sisters later made a set of counterclaims in their own press conference, presenting a very different picture compared to the interior minister’s version of events. According to them, their brother was “not fine”. They recalled he was not given prompt treatment when he flagged his eye condition some three months ago to jail authorities. They also claimed that the government had reneged on its promises to transfer Mr Khan to a private hospital and to grant the family access to the doctors nominated by it.

 

From where things stand, it is very difficult to ascertain how much of what each party says is true. Clearly, there is significant disagreement within the PTI camp concerning the right course of action regarding Imran Khan’s health, with some leaders seemingly willing to trust the government’s handling of his condition, while others, especially his family, insist on personal oversight.
That said, the government is also not without blame for how it has mismanaged the jailed leader’s health. It may be recalled that officials had initially denied that anything was wrong with Mr Khan, and the truth only came out after information regarding his visit to Pims in Islamabad was leaked to the press. By mishandling its communications on the matter, the government itself gave good reason for the family to doubt it can promise the former prime minister’s well-being, and it cannot now blame his sisters for wanting more oversight over his treatment by doctors they trust.
Therefore, while the PTI and Mr Khan’s family need to firmly decide what it is that they want, the government must also respect their wishes and ensure much greater transparency in how it is dealing with Mr Khan’s ailment. It must also ensure his sons can visit him. No one’s health should be held hostage to political bickering.

ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The Islamabad High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Ministry of Human Rights on a petition challenging the vires of the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2026, and sought their response.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir of the IHC heard the petition filed by Advocate Abdul Wahab Farid against the recently enacted law.
During the hearing, counsel for the petitioner, Maham Fatima and Sardar Tariq Hussain, arg­ued that the impugned legislation was contrary to several constitutional provisions, including Articles 4, 8, 10-A, 35 and 227. They contended that the law infringes fundamental rights and is inconsistent with Islamic injunctions.

 

The counsel submitted that the procedure prescribed under the new law for registration and redressal of complaints violates the right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 10-A of the Constitution. They further argued that certain provisions confer excessive and arbitrary powers that could be misused and undermine due process.
After a preliminary hearing, Justice Tahir issued notices to the respondents and adjourned further proceedings until a date to be fixed by the office.
Man convicted
Meanwhile, a model criminal court (minor offences) in Lahore issued a judgement Wednesday in a domestic abuse case, convicting a man of assaulting his wife and mother-in-law.
Judicial Magistrate Hamidul Rahman Nasir conducted the trial, which involved testimony from several witnesses, including the victims and police investigators.
The incident took place on April 2, 2021. According to the FIR, the conflict began when the man allegedly pressured his wife to seek employment against her wishes. When she refused, he and several of his family members reportedly began beating her.
Following a telephone call from the wife, her mother and brother arrived at the scene.
The prosecution argued that during the ensuing confrontation, the man assaulted his mother-in-law, tearing her clothes and beating her until she lost consciousness. Neighbours eventually intervened to rescue the victims.
The FIR stated that after only two months of marriage, the husband began subjecting his wife to routine physical abuse. As a result, she stayed at her parents’ house for about eight months and received medical treatment at their expense.
The defence contended that the FIR was fabricated and pointed to the absence of official medico-legal certificates.
However, the prosecution explained that hospital protocols during the Covid-19 pandemic and police negligence contributed to the lack of formal documentation.
The magistrate found the man guilty under Section 354 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which addresses assault or use of criminal force against a woman with intent to outrage her modesty.
In the judgement announced on Tuesday, the magistrate sentenced the husband to three months’ rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs1,500 for assaulting his wife. He was also awarded another three months’ rigorous imprisonment for assaulting his mother-in-law, along with a fine of Rs1,500.

France and Germany have called for Francesca Albanese to step down over remarks in which she referred to a “common enemy of humanity” after criticising “most of the world” and the media for enabling Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza.
Critics and Israel have accused the UN Special Rapporteur of referring to Israel as a “common enemy”, while Albanese has denounced this as a “manipulation” and “completely false”.
In response to a question about the comments, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Feb 11 told parliament she should step down.
In an open letter, the former diplomats criticised what they called “the use of inaccurate and manipulated elements to discredit a holder of an independent UN mandate”.
They called on Barrot to “retract his inaccurate statements about Ms Albanese and correct them.”
“This controversy must not divert attention from the massacres of civilians, nor from the humanitarian crisis and the massive human rights violations taking place in Gaza,” said the signatories.
The letter, written in French, was signed by mostly former foreign ministers and diplomats from the Netherlands.
More than a dozen current members of parliament and senators from Europe were also among the signatories, along with a former foreign minister of South Africa.
Columbia University activist
A US immigration judge has blocked the deportation of a Palestinian graduate student who helped organize protests at Columbia University against Israel’s war in Gaza, according to US media reports.
Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested by immigration agents last year as he was attending an interview to become a US citizen. Mahdawi had been involved in a wave of demonstrations that gripped several major US university campuses.

I have been on the roads for 14 years… I have grown old, and people have to hold my hand while disembarking from a vehicle. But I protest here so that I get justice.”
These are the words of the late Bibi Houri, immortalised in a brief clip that has been circulating on social media since her demise.
Since 2012, when her son went missing in Balochistan, Bibi Houri had been a regular fixture at demonstrations staged by relatives of missing persons. Despite her advanc­­ed years, she would sit from dawn to dusk at the protest camps, pining for her son Gul Mohammad Marri and hoping for his safe recovery.
The widow, in her 70s, who broke with societal norms by coming out of her home and seeking justice — on the roads, in court, and at police stations — breathed her last on Tuesday.

Septuagenarian had been campaigning for her missing son’s recovery since 2012

“She used to come to the missing persons’ camp along with her missing son’s daughter — even on Eid,” recalled Nasrullah Baloch, chairman of Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP).
Bibi Houri — also known af­­fectionately as ‘Amma Hou­­ri’ — hailed from Kohlu, a district dominated by the Marri tribe in eastern Balochistan.
After the end of the fourth Baloch insurgency, which was fought predominantly by Marri Baloch tribesmen, her family went to Afghanistan along with the other Marri tribesmen.
Upon their return, they settled in New Kahan, on the outskirts of Quetta, near the Hazarganji area.
“After his cousin, Dr Moh­a­mmad Akbar Marri, went mis­­sing in 2010, Gul Moham­mad started struggling for his safe release because (Dr Marri’s) children were too young to come out,” recalls Nasrullah Baloch.
“Instead, he himself beca­­me a missing person within two years.”
An activist who used to participate in demonstrations alongside the septuagenarian told Dawn that Bibi Houri came into the media limelight in 2023, when several Baloch families staged a long march to Islamabad.
At the time, the families of the missing — comprising mo­­stly women and children — were dealt with unsympathetically, being subjected to baton-charges and water cannons after they reached the capital.
Besides Islamabad, the eld­erly Bibi Houri attended public meetings and protests in Mastung, Quetta, and Dalba­ndin, among other places. She would stand among the cro­wd, holding her son’s photo while calling for the recovery of all missing persons.
“There are many women like Bibi Houri who search for their sons, brothers or husbands & sometimes die without ever knowing whether they are alive or dead,” journalist Munizae Jahangir wrote on X.







“Houri worried for her son Marri’s children who are growing up without a father, she said she was old but she braved the rain & the unforgiving sun for them,” she wrote in her epitaph.
Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari also lamented on X that there was no one to pursue Bibi Houri’s legal case following the imprisonment of her daughter, Imaan Mazari-Hazir, who had been handling it.

The “Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report 2026”, published on Wed­nesday by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), also reveals a picture of deeply imbalanced development in the region.
Gains in health and well-being, and poverty reduction over the past decades, are being overshadowed by severe environmental dec­line and widening inequalities. Evidence shows setbacks in ensuring equal access to education and com­pliance with labour rights.
Insufficient data on gender equality and on peace, justice and strong institutions are obscuring policymakers’ understanding of how effe­ctively the most vulnerable are being reached. In critical areas such as climate action, marine conservation and biodiversity, the situation is rapidly deteriorating.
For cities and communities, persistent regression, including damage to critical infrastructure, underscores a dangerous gap between planning and resilience on the ground.
“The very engines of gro­wth that once lifted millions out of poverty and fuelled rapid industrialisation are now undermining our future,” said UN Under-Secretary-General Armida Salsiah Alisja­hbana, who is also the ESCAP executive secretary. “Our collective challe­nge is also our ­greatest opportunity: to build a region that is not only wea­lthier but smarter and healthier,” she added.

The Israeli authorities also imposed age restrictions on West Bank Palestinians, permitting entry only to men aged 55 and older, women aged 50 and older, and children up to age 12 to attend the Friday prayers.

 

“Ten thousand Palestinian worshippers will be permitted to enter the Temple Mount for Friday prayers throughout the month of Ramadan, subject to obtaining a dedicated daily permit in advance,” COGAT, the Israeli agency in charge of civilian matters in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement.
“Entry for men will be permitted from age 55, for women from age 50, and for children up to age 12 when accompanied by a first-degree relative.” COGAT said, adding that restrictions apply only to Palestinians travelling from the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

Imam of Al Aqsa arrested by Israeli police; Hamas condemns arrest, restrictions on worshippers’ access to holy mosque

“It is emphasised that all permits are conditional upon prior security approval by the relevant security authorities,” COGAT said.
“In addition, residents travelling to prayers at the Temple Mount will be required to undergo digital documentation at the crossings upon their return to the areas of Judea and Samaria at the conclusion of the prayer day,” it said, using the Biblical term for the West Bank.
During Ramazan, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Al Aqsa, Islam’s third holiest site, located in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed in a move that is not internationally recognised.
Since the war in Gaza broke out in October 2023, the attendance of worshippers has declined due to tough Israeli restrictions.
Israel arrests Al Aqsa Mosque Imam
Israeli police on Monday arrested the Imam of Al Aqsa Mosque, Sheikh Moh­am­med al-Abbasi, from inside the mosque’s courtyards in occupied Jerusalem.
The Palestinian news agency WAFA, citing local sources, reported that Israeli forces detained Sheikh al-Abbasi inside the courtyards of Al Aqsa Mosque without giving any reason.
It said the arrest “comes amid escalating Israeli measures against the blessed Al Aqsa Mosque, including restrictions on imams, preachers and worshippers stationed there, limitations on the entry of worshippers, and intensifying incursions carried out by settlers under heavy protection from Israeli police”.
On Tuesday, Hamas condemned the arrest of al-Abbasi in a statement, saying he had been “served with an order banning him from the mosque”.
The movement said the measure “constitutes blatant interference in the affairs of Al Aqsa and an unacceptable assault on its imams”.

Ukraine has faced repeated pressure from US President Donald Tru­mp to agree to a deal that could mean painful concessions, as Russ­ian forces pound its power grid and slowly advance on the battlefield.
As the delegations met for a second day at a hotel in the Swiss city, under the mediation of US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Zelensky had called the first day “difficult”. “We can state that Russia is trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage,” he wrote on X.







No date for talks to resume
Moments after his statement, the delegations broke off the talks and said they would meet again in the future, without providing a date. Russia’s chief negotiator, former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, described the talks as “difficult, but business-like”.
Medinsky — whom Ukrainian officials have accused of engaging in history lectures rather than substantive talks — spoke with the Ukrainians for nearly two hours after formal talks ended, according to a representative of Kyiv’s chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov.
A spokesperson for Zelensky said the formal part of the talks had addressed territory in Ukraine’s east and the fate of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, both sticking points since the beginning of the process.
Moscow wants Ukraine to cede the roughly 20pc of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian forces have been unable to conquer — something Kyiv has repeatedly rejected. Kyiv, meanwhile, wants Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, to be operated by the US and Ukraine, which Russia has said is unacceptable.
Pressure from Trump
Tuesday is the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, which has killed hundreds of thousands, driven millions from their homes, and ravaged Ukrainian cities, towns and villages. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians.
Trump has twice suggested in recent days that it is up to Kyiv to make sure a deal is agreed quickly. He had told reporters on Monday: “Ukraine better come to the table fast. That’s all I’m telling you.” In an interview with the US news outlet Axios, Zelensky was quoted as saying that it was “not fair” that Tr­u­mp kept publicly demanding con­­c­essions from Ukraine, not Russia.
Zelensky also said any plan requiring Ukraine to give up territory that Russia had not captured in the east would be rejected if put to a referendum. “I hope it is just his tactics and not the decision,” Zelensky was quoted as saying.
The Geneva meeting follows two rounds of US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi that made no breakthrough. Both Zelensky and Umerov have made a point of repeatedly thanking the US for its mediation in recent weeks.
Zelensky has expressed concern that US Congressional mid-term elections in November could draw Washington’s attention away from efforts to end Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two.
Kyiv is also seeking strong US-backed security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks in the event of a peace deal. US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll and Brigadier General Michael Adamski took part in three-way military negotiations on Wednesday, according to a US official.

Addressing a crowded press conference at the Central Press Club, leaders of the opposition alliance — comprising the PML-N, the PTI and its dissidents — alleged that the government was evading constitutional accountability within the assembly.
PML-N regional president and Leader of the Opposition Shah Ghulam Qadir said a requisitioned session of the House, convened by the opposition, was abruptly adjourned despite quorum and agenda items.
“We ensured quorum. With business on the agenda, the sudden adjournment was incomprehensible,” he said, adding that at one stage only one minister was present to respond to questions.

Vows to resist ‘any attempt’ to derail polls

The session was prorogued before calling attention notices and resolutions could be taken up, prompting the opposition to pass what he described as an unprecedented resolution of condemnation against the government.
Mr Qadir claimed the PPP no longer commanded a majority in the House and accused it of making hasty appointments and distributing discretionary posts arbitrarily. Political advisers, he alleged, were being posted in the Kashmir Liberation Cell instead of subject experts.
Warning the government against what he termed complacency, he said: “If the PPP does not mend its ways, it will not take long to move a no-confidence motion. If they are under any illusion, they should disabuse themselves of it.”
However, he added that with elections approaching, the opposition did not wish to destabilise the system and would act within constitutional bounds. “The government will act, and we will react,” he said, making it clear that the opposition would not allow the assembly’s term to be extended “even by a single day”.
Referring to the Supreme Court’s restoration of the Third Party Act, he alleged that appointments were still being made without due process, including tests and interviews.
Former prime minister Raja Farooq Haider ter­med the present arrangement a deviation from what was initially agreed as a temporary set-up. He alleged that budgetary changes were being made without assembly appr­oval and warned that the prime minister was “walking a tightrope”.

The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) demanded a higher fuel cost on account of power consumed in January, even though almost 60 per cent of the power was generated from domestic, cheaper sources. Electricity consumption was reported to be around 12pc higher than the same month last year and 8pc higher than December 2025.
Once approved, the power companies would charge an additional amount of about Rs16bn to consumers of all the power companies, including ex-Wapda Distribution Companies (Discos) and K-Electric, in the billing month of March. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has called a public hearing on February 26 to examine the request for fuel cost adjustment (FCA).
The CPPA, which filed the petition for a higher FCA for January consumption, said the power consumption was around 12.1pc higher than the same month of the previous year and about 8pc higher than the previous month, December 2025. The power companies have claimed an average fuel cost of Rs12.18 per unit for January 2026, compared to Rs11.03 per unit of the same month of the previous year and almost Rs2.56 per unit higher than Rs9.62 per unit in December 2025.

CPPA demands higher fuel charges citing 12pc increase in demand

The CPPA reported that 8,762 billion units (gigawatt hours) of electricity were delivered to Discos in January.
The power companies have claimed that the average fuel cost amounted to Rs12.18 per unit in January, against a pre-approved reference fuel cost of Rs10.395 per unit. There is a need for an additional FCA of about Rs1.78 per unit.
The CPPA said about 9,140GWh of electricity was generated in January at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs106.4bn (Rs11.64 per unit), of which 8,762GWh of energy was delivered to Discos for Rs106.7bn (Rs12.18 per unit), leading to a higher fuel cost over what was already charged to consumers in December bills. Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG)- based power generation accounted for the largest share of the grid’s fuel, with almost 22pc.
This was followed by nuclear power with its 17.5pc share. Traditional hydropower generation dipped to just 8pc in the wake of the annual canal closure for maintenance. Third position was secured by imported coal, with a 17.28pc share, followed by local coal with a 15.4pc share.
The share of local gas-based generation stood at 12pc in January, up from 11pc in December. Furnace oil-based generation revived to 3pc, although the fuel has been officially phased out.
Furnace oil-based generation was the most expensive at Rs33.55 per unit, followed by Rs20 per unit from RLNG, Rs13.5 per unit from imported coal, Rs12.74 per unit from local gas, and Rs11.63 per unit from local coal. There was no power generation from high-speed diesel.
The nuclear fuel cost amounted to Rs2.23 per unit in January. The three renewable energy sources — wind, bagasse and solar — together contributed a 4.55pc share to the grid. Wind and solar have no fuel costs, while bagasse-based plants had a fuel cost of Rs10.39 per unit, with just 1.11pc contribution to the grid. Electricity imports from Iran accounted for 0.38pc of the total, with a fuel cost of Rs22.06 per unit.

Headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, a three-judge bench that had taken up a number of cases moved by the PTI founder.
National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Barrister Ali Zafar and others were present inside Courtroom No. 2.
During the hearing, Justice Salahuddin Panwhar wondered why the petitioner had not challenged the ECP notification, which had disqualified him. Justice Kakar observed that it would be better to summon the ECP to explain the disqualification.

Apex court adjourns proceedings in cipher, defamation cases against PTI chief

Sardar Latif Khosa argued that in the concealment of assets case, the sentence awarded to the petitioner was suspended, but not the judgement. Justice Kakar reminded the counsel that he had only requested the Islamabad High Court to suspend the sentence and the high court had granted him the relief.
Mr Khosa contended that he wanted to cite 2019 Nasir Mehmood case in which the SC had held that suspension of sentence would have the same consequence as the suspension of the judgement.
Prosecutor General Islamabad Sarwar Nahang, however, said that the suspension of the sentence and suspension of the conviction were two different things.
Despite reluctance by Mr Khosa, the court asked the counsel to read the particular paragraph from the 2019 judgement, wherein it was held by the SC that unless the conviction was specifically suspended or the appeal was ultimately allowed and conviction as well as sentence were set aside, the conviction of the appellant would continue to hold the field and the disqualification would remain intact.
Justice Kakar observed that the counsel, by invoking a citation against his case, had blocked the way the court was considering to provide relief. “It seems your eyesight has become weak,” Justice Kakar quipped. He added that another way was to listen to the ECP’s point of view to know why the petitioner was disqualified.
The SC then postponed the proceedings for an indefinite period.
The same bench adjourned further proceedings in the cipher case against PTI’s Shah Mehmood Qur­e­shi when Special Prosecutor Zulf­ikar Naqvi sought time to furnish a detailed judgement in the case.
Moreover, referring to a set of appeals against the interim orders in the defamation case, which was mov­ed by PM Shehbaz Sharif aga­i­nst Mr Khan, the court adjourned the proceedings until after Ramazan.

WASHINGTON: Pakistan joined the international community in asking Israel to immediately halt the expansion of its unlawful presence in the occupied West Bank, hours before Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Washington to attend a US-sponsored international summit on Gaza today (Thursday).
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar made the call while delivering Pakistan’s national statement at a high-level United Nations Security Council (UNSC) briefing on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.
Pakistan told the UNSC there can be “no durable peace without justice” in the region, reaffirming unwavering support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and announcing its participation in a new diplomatic initiative aimed at advancing a two-state solution.
“There can be no durable peace without justice, no stability without accountability, and no sustainable solution without the realization of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination,” the deputy premier said in his address.
Just a day earlier, the Palestinian mission to the United Nations issued a joint statement by 85 nations, calling for the immediate reversal of the Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank.
Also, the European Union (EU), Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Arab League and the foreign ministers of the eight-nation Muslim bloc condemned Israel for approving procedures for the registration and settlement of land ownership across extensive areas of the occupied West Bank. The foreign ministers reiterated their categorical rejection of all unilateral measures aimed at altering the legal, demographic, and historical status of the occupied Palestinian territory.
Ready to back peace initiatives
Highlighting Pakistan’s participation in the inaugural meeting of US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace” (BoP) in Washington on Feb 19, Deputy PM Dar said Pakistan was doing so with the objective of reinforcing ongoing diplomatic efforts for the resolution of the Palestinian issue.
“We engage in this process with the firm conviction that sustained diplomacy, anch­or­ed in international law and the UN Charter and guided by accountability, provides the only viable pathway to a just and lasting peace,” he said.
Reaffirming Islamabad’s political and moral position, the deputy prime minister said: “Pakistan’s solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters and their just cause remains unwavering. We stand with them in their legitimate pursuit of right to self-determination, dignity and freedom.”
He underscored Pakistan’s readiness to support multiple peace initiatives, noting: “Pakistan is ready and willing to contribute to all diplomatic initiatives, including President Trump’s Peace Plan, the BoP, the High-Level Conference on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Global Alliance for the Two-State Solution, which must reinforce one another through coordinated and concrete implementation, in the interest of our shared objective of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.”
Outcome of BoP meeting
Meanwhile, international observers say it remains unclear whether the BoP’s first meeting will “deliver reconstruction, legitimacy or simply controversy”.
US President Donald Trump will host the Board of Peace meeting in Washington today (Thursday), where he is expected to announce that member states have pledged more than $5 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts in Gaza, the White House said, adding that more than 20 countries will attend board of peace meeting.
The Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), an independent non-profit think tank established in Milan in 1934, noted that member states are expected to announce a collective $5bn commitment for Gaza’s reconstruction, against overall requirements of about $70bn, according to UN estimates.
ISPI said the BOP also plans to deploy thousands of personnel for international stabilisation and policing forces in Gaza and that the meeting is expected to clarify which countries will participate.
According to the think tank, key regional states — Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Turkiye, Bahrain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait — have confirmed their participation, along with Israel, which is sending its foreign minister to the summit-level meeting.
Indonesia has become the first country to signal readiness to contribute to the force, pledging to deploy 8,000 troops by June.

Speaking at a joint press conference following a seminar on ‘Rest­oring Peace in Balochistan and Confidence-Building, the Institutional Respo­nsibilities of Ulema and Mashaykh’, the scholars — including Maulana Dr Ata ur Rehman, Allama Muh­ammad Juma Asadi, Mau­lana Anwar-ul-Haq Haq­qani, and Qari Abdul Reh­man Noorzai — emphasised that lasting solutions lie in justice, mediation, and reconciliation rather than the use of force. 
The clerics urged the government to conduct transparent investigations into all missing persons’ cases. They said that anyone found guilty should be tried in open courts, while innocent individuals must be released immediately. 
Warning that the province now stands at a crossroads, the scholars noted one path leads toward com­­plete separation and the other toward a constituti­o­nal struggle for basic righ­­ts. They traced the current cycle of violence, the consequences of which are still being felt today, to the 2006 killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti, a former federal minister, Balochistan chief minister and governor. 
The scholars warned that hostile elements exp­loit local grievances and demanded that citizens be treated as partners of the state rather than suspects. 
To reduce frustration and anxiety among the youth, they demanded that locals be given jobs and a meaningful stake in Gwadar, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and mining projects.  
They also called for a major portion of revenue generated from provincial resources to be allocated to local development. 
The clerics blamed foreign interference for worsening the situation, alleging that external forces sought to create divisions, hatred and mistrust to prevent unity among Muslim countries and destabilise Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. 
Noting that the Quran declares peacemaking between disputing parties a religious duty, the scholars said the seminar proposed several specific measures to restore stability.  
These include holding transparent elections in the province; granting locals their rightful share in natural resources; expanding education, specifically technical and vocational training and employment opportunities; regulating border trade routes and eliminating drug and trawler mafias; empowering the Human Rights Commission; establishing a reconciliation council comprising ulema and respected community figures. 
They further called for improved intelligence systems with community participation and introduced the idea of special quotas for Balochistan in public and private sectors. 
The scholars reaffirmed that Balochistan’s leading ulema and mashaykh stand ready to shoulder any responsibility assigned to them for restoring peace and stability in the province.

The authority is offering 597 megahertz (MHz) in several bands in the upcoming auction and three existing telecom operators have been mandated to obtain a minimum of 100 MHz in the auction process.
“With the prescribed rate, even if 300 MHz is obtained by the telecommunication operators without any competitive bidding, the government will get $300 million,” PTA Director General Licensing retired brigadier Aamir Shahzad told a media briefing.
“And if all the 597 MHz is sold at auction at a slightly competitive rate, $700 million will be available for the government, but this scenario is less likely to happen,” he added.
Shahzad said that the auction would be conducted using a multi-round electronic clock auction format, with the main allocation stage starting on March 10. He said the 2600 MHz and 3500 MHz bands would be offered during the first round.
He added that after the auction process, the rollout of 5G services would take between three and six months as certain infrastructure was needed for the fresh spectrum.
Meanwhile, PTA Chairman Hafeezur Rehman said that the auction would lead to improved quality of service and data speed.
“Around 50 million new users have been added in the system during the last five years, but only 10MHz was increased in the 2021 spectrum auction,” the PTA chairman said.
“Improved data service and enhanced coverage will also increase average revenue per user (ARPU) for telecommunication operators,” he said.
The ARPU is a key performance indicator that measures the average revenue generated by a company from each consumer within a specific timeframe, monthly or annually.
“We started with $0.7 and now the ARPU has reached $1.3. Therefore, it is likely to increase as more data is consumed by the subscribers,” Rehman said.
“The authority expects mobile broadband speeds to improve by around 25 per cent following the auction,” he said.
He said that the government had offered many incentives to telecom companies in the new spectrum auction, but obligations to improve the quality of service as well as coverage area had been increased.
“This will help the country to embrace further upgradations like 6G and not like 5G, where we have been delayed,” the PTA Chairman said.
He added the government had also eliminated the right-of-way fee that used to be around Rs36,000 per kilometre annually; this, he said, would encourage fiberisation projects.
The chairman also said that telecom operators had already placed orders for 5G equipment, while local manufacturing of 5G-enabled smartphones had commenced, with 500,000 to 600,000 units produced so far.
He said the other measures being taken to facilitate the faster rollout of services after the auction were options for spectrum sharing, relaxation of certain regulatory terms and incentives for network expansion.
“Operators have been given one year to make the necessary capital investments without upfront spectrum payments, allowing them to focus on improving service quality,” Rehman added.

 

However, the operators will have to expand 5G coverage to additional cities apart from Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta, while fiber-to-the-site ratios will increase from 20 per cent to 35pc by 2035.
Besides, the minimum download speeds for 4G service have been increased from four megabytes per second (Mbps) to 20Mbps in 2026–27 and to 50Mbps by 2030–35.
For 5G, minimum download speeds will rise from 50Mbps initially to 100Mbps by 2030–35, with latency targets reduced to 35 milliseconds. Upload speeds are benchmarked at 20pc of download speeds across both technologies.</p><small>2026-02-18 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/182309476ecb600.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974194/ahead-of-inaugural-board-of-peace-meeting-asif-says-recognition-of-israel-not-on-the-cards-at-all' target='_blank'><strong>Ahead of inaugural Board of Peace meeting, Asif says recognition of Israel ‘not on the cards at all’</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Wednesday that recognition of Israel by Pakistan was “not on the cards at all” as he highlighted the country’s support for the Palestinian cause.
The minister made the remarks in an interview with France 24. The comments come as the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, led by US President Donald Trump, will be held in Washington on February 19. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar will be attending the meeting.



In the interview, Asif was asked about Pakistan’s decision to join the Board of Peace and if the country would contribute troops for a military force in Gaza.
“I don’t see any problem in that. It all depends on what sort of terms of reference are drafted for that peace force,” he said, highlighting that Pakistan was a part of UN peacekeeping missions.
“So we have that experience. Palestine is a cause that is very close to our hearts. We have been demonstrating solidarity with them for many, many, many decades,” he said.
He said that Pakistan had supported the cause of Palestine on countless international forums.
“So this is something worth attempting. This is a good opportunity. Let’s hope it brings us closer to the two-state solution in the Middle East,” he said.
The interviewer then pointed out that many Muslim countries had normalised ties with Israel and asked whether this was on the table for Pakistan.
“No, not yet. You know, I do not see this option even being considered by Pakistan. Maybe, in the future, when there is a total paradigm shift and two states are established and Palestinians have the right of self-determination, their own homeland,” he said.
“At the moment, it is not on the cards at all,” he said.
‘India waging proxy war’
The minister was then asked about the security situation in the country, including the attack at an imambargah in Islamabad.
In response, Asif said that there were almost “all franchises of terrorism” in neighbouring Afghanistan, which he attributed to the “non-seriousness” of the Afghan Taliban government. He said that the Afghan Taliban was providing terrorists safe haven on their soil.
“Nothing can happen from across the border from Afghanistan … any attack in Pakistan, it has the blessings of the Afghan government,” he said.
Asked about Pakistan’s strikes in Afghanistan, the minister said, “We always have that option and we can exercise that option. We won’t hesitate.”
He further said that if terrorist outfits were operating from Afghan soil, the responsibility lay with Kabul’s rulers.
Asked about India, the minister highlighted the military conflict between Pakistan and India in May 2025.
“Our air force practically decimated whatever attempt they were making to invade Pakistan. So now they are waging a proxy war against Pakistan,” he said.
“Delhi and Kabul and all these terrorist outfits are on the same page,” he said.
He said that friendly countries had attempted to mediate between Islamabad and Kabul but “these attempts did not produce any results”.
He said that the Afghan Taliban had accepted that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was operating from their territory.
“They indirectly said that they had no control over them. We told them that allow us to deal with them … they accepted their responsibility verbally, but whatever we agreed upon … they are not ready to give it in writing,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-18 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18214221ba4c16d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974189/no-basant-celebrations-before-february-2027-says-punjab-information-minister' target='_blank'><strong>No Basant celebrations before February 2027, says Punjab information minister</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari on Wednesday said that the Basant festival, which was revived by the provincial government earlier this month in Lahore after an 18-year hiatus, would now be celebrated in February 2027.
“I want to state categorically … that Basant will be celebrated in February 2027. No suggestion for celebrating it before that is under consideration,” she said in a video message posted by the Punjab government’s official account on X.







She also noted that people in a couple of cities had celebrated the festival over the last few days.
“We did not give a harsh reaction at that as there were no losses reported,” Bokhari added.
The Punjab minister highlighted people’s “excitement” for the festival and said she shared the same sentiment.
Bokhari reiterated that the Basant would be celebrated in February 2027 and would be “bigger and better than the one held this year”.
The three-day Basant festival was celebrated in Lahore from February 6-8, following the Punjab government’s decision to lift a ban on the historic event after 18 years, with strict regulations.
Subsequently, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif had praised authorities for organising a “safe Basant” festival in Lahore. She also stated that there was not a single death caused by injuries from kite strings during the festival.</p><small>2026-02-18 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18212100008c53e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974187/our-goal-win-t20-world-cup-says-shadab-as-pakistan-into-super-eights' target='_blank'><strong>Our goal? Win T20 World Cup, says Shadab as Pakistan into Super Eights</strong></a><br><p>Shadab Khan said Pakistan believed they could go on and win the T20 World Cup after their best performance of the tournament secured the last Super Eights berth on Wednesday.
Pakistan bowled out Namibia for 97 to win by a colossal 102 runs in Colombo and bounce back in style after a defeat to arch-rivals India had left them in danger of elimination.
Pakistan rode on an undefeated maiden T20 international century by opener Sahibzada Farhan to post 199-3.

 

Spinners Usman Tariq and Shadab Khan then shared seven wickets to rout Namibia in 17.3 overs.
“We didn’t take this game lightly after so much talk about one match against India,” said Shadab, who scored a brisk 22-ball 36 and grabbed 3-19.
“We are on the right track to achieve the goal of winning the World Cup and we are following a process,” he added.
Shadab warned that the Super Eights, which Pakistan will begin with a match against New Zealand in Colombo on Saturday before facing England and co-hosts Sri Lanka next week, will be a step up.
“There are eight good teams so it will be a tough stage and all matches will be high-pressure games,” said Shadab.
Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha was beaming when he described the win as a “complete performance”.
“We started really well and in the middle, we put partnerships on and then finished well,” he said.
“Sahibzada has been outstanding, the way he’s been batting for us for the last six months. He scored a hundred today and I’m very happy for him,” he said.
“When it comes to bowling, we were lethal and we were ruthless. We bowled in the right areas.”
Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus admitted there were lessons to be learned as they head home after losing all four of their group matches.
“I think for us, it’s always about nailing those specialist positions,” said Erasmus.
“It has been a great learning experience and will help us in future.”
Erasmus said Namibia were now looking forward to the ODI World Cup next year, which they will co-host with South Africa and Zimbabwe.
“There is a lot of cricket around and lots of really exciting things happening in and around cricket in Namibia, which gives the boys a lot of pleasing things to play for,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-18 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/181924491501a8f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974092/ramazan-moon-sighted-holy-month-to-begin-in-pakistan-on-thursday' target='_blank'><strong>Ramazan moon sighted; holy month to begin in Pakistan on Thursday</strong></a><br><p>The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee announced on Wednesday that the Ramazan moon was sighted, and the holy month would begin in Pakistan on Thursday (February 19).
The announcement was made by committee chairman, Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad, as it met in Peshawar for the moon sighting.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, Azad said that the skies were clear in some areas and cloudy in others.



He said that testimonies were received from several parts of the country, including Quetta, Islamabad, Waziristan, Dir, Karachi, Buner, Mardan and Tando Allahyar.
“Therefore, it was decided with consensus that the first day of Ramazan would be on Thursday,” he said.
Separately, according to the Daily Star, the crescent moon was sighted in Bangladesh, while The Hindu reported that it was also spotted in India.

 

Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Afghanistan observed their first day of fasting on Wednesday after the crescent moon was sighted on Tuesday night.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended “heartfelt” greetings to the nation, as well as Muslims around the world, on the beginning of Ramazan, state-run APP reported.
He said the holy month was a blessing from God and gave Muslims an opportunity to “renew the values of devotion and humility in worship, righteousness and piety and spiritual purification”.
“Fasting is not merely the observance of a religious obligation; rather, it is practical training in patience, discipline and a sense of responsibility in our daily lives,” the PM said.
He added that the government had launched a Ramazan Package to “provide maximum possible support to the vulnerable groups”.
“Under this initiative, financial assistance will be provided to deserving individuals in a dignified manner through digital wallets, ensuring that every household,” he said.
President Asif Ali Zardari also extended greetings to the nation and the Muslim Ummah, describing the sacred month as a period of mercy, forgiveness, and salvation,  according to APP.
“At a time when Pakistan faces various social and economic challenges, Ramazan brings a message of hope, patience, and collective solidarity,” the report quoted the president as saying.
He expressed the resolve that “the nation should rise above personal interests and give priority to national and collective welfare”.
In a post on X, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari congratulated the Muslim Ummah on the month of Ramazan.







National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also extended felicitations to the people of Pakistan and the Muslim Ummah on the commencement of the holy month.
He appealed to the public to “demonstrate patience, avoid hoarding and profiteering, and ensure the availability of essential commodities at reasonable prices”.







Earlier this month, based on the moon’s expected age, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) had predicted that the first day of Ramazan was “likely to fall” on February 19.
It is worth mentioning that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has announced a Rs38 billion Ramazan Relief Package for 12.1 million deserving families across the four provinces as well as Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
“Every deserving family will receive Rs13,000 through a digital wallet or bank transfer, without discrimination based on party affiliation or point of view,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-18 15:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18200121ab8ce97.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974182/uae-president-reemerges-in-video-with-us-senator-after-rumours-about-health' target='_blank'><strong>UAE president reemerges in video with US senator after rumours about health</strong></a><br><p>United Arab Emirates (UAE) President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has appeared in a meeting with US Senator Lindsey Graham for the first time after rumours about his health spread following a now-deleted Turkish presidency statement.
Earlier this month, Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan went to Saudi Arabia and was meant to later visit the neighbouring United Arab Emirates, amid an ongoing rift between the two Gulf powers.
But on Sunday, Erdogan said he was postponing his Abu Dhabi trip because the Emirati leader had a “health problem” — in a statement that was later deleted.
The incident fuelled rumours online about Sheikh Mohamed’s health, with his Wikipedia page even briefly being edited to say he had died.
On Wednesday, the presidential court shared video footage of the Emirati president, smiling alongside powerful US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham during a meeting at Qasr Al Shati in Abu Dhabi.

 


The UAE’s official WAM news agency also shared photographs of the meeting, in which Sheikh Mohamed appeared alongside Graham.
The Emirati leader’s team on Saturday evening released photos taken the same day showing Sheikh Mohamed, known as MBZ, smiling and apparently in good health, with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar.
Graham, writing on X, said he met the UAE president for an hour-and-a-half and dismissed those perpetuating false narratives against the UAE and President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed as “full of it”.

According to the cause list issued by the registrar’s office, IHC’s Justice Muhammad Asif will take up the appeals on Thursday (February 19).
The court also scheduled for hearing applications seeking the suspension of sentences awarded to the two lawyers.
Last month, Imaan and Hadi were handed a total of 17 years in jail on multiple charges under the Prevention of Electr­onic Crimes Act (Peca) by a sessions court in Islamabad, sparking outrage among rights groups, opposition parties, and other segments of society.
The written order by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka said the prosecution had proved its case against Imaan and Hadi under Sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyberterrorism) and 26-A (false information) of Peca. Under Section 9 of Peca, both were sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs5 million each, with an additional year in default.
For Section 10, they were each handed 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs30m, with two more years in default. Under Section 26-A, they received two years’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs1m each, with six months’ additional jail time in case of non-payment. All sentences will run concurrently.
On Feb 7, the couple had challenged the trial court’s order. In their appeals, the two contended that the impugned judgment was passed in blatant violation of settled legal principles and mandatory procedural requi­rements.
They argued that the trial court proceeded to pronounce the verdict despite the fact that an application seeking transfer of the case was pending adjudication before the IHC, rendering the decision “unlawful and without jurisdiction”.
On January 29, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and its partner organisations published a joint statement condemning the “arbitrary arrest” and conviction of the two lawyers, calling for their release.
Separately, the United Nations Human Rights Office also said that the conviction and sentencing of the couple “following fair trial concerns” was deeply disturbing”.







The European Union’s (EU) Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Anouar El Anouni had also raised concerns over the conviction of Imaan and Hadi. The EU official said their convictions “over social media activity goes against freedom of expression and independence of lawyers”.
“These are not only key democratic principles but also part of [Pakistan’s] international human rights commitments,” Anouni said.







Further, five United Nations experts on Feb 4 expressed alarm over the conviction. In a joint statement, UN special rapporteurs Margaret Satterthwaite, Ben Saul, Mary Lawlor, Irene Khan and Gina Romero noted that the two were convicted on multiple criminal charges, which resulted in lengthy prison sentences “for simply exercising rights guaranteed by international human rights law”.
“Lawyers, like other individuals, are entitled to freedom of expression. The exercise of this right should never be conflated with criminal conduct, especially not terrorism,” they were quoted as saying, while also emphasising the vague definition of terrorism-related offences under Pakistan’s counter-terrorism framework.
“Doing so risks undermining and criminalising the work of lawyers and human rights defenders across Pakistan and has a chilling effect on civil society in the country,” the experts said.</p><small>2026-02-18 14:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18163117ed6a535.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974141/govt-says-no-power-or-gas-loadshedding-during-sehr-iftar' target='_blank'><strong>Govt says no power or gas loadshedding during Sehr, Iftar</strong></a><br><p>The power and petroleum ministers on Wednesday assured the nation that there would be no electricity and gas loadshedding during Sehr and Iftar throughout the month of Ramazan.
Addressing a joint press conference alongside Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik, Power Minister Awais Leghari said, “We have decided that there will be absolutely no loadshedding in any area — unless there is a huge fault God forbid — during the timings of Sehr and Iftar.
“Even economic loadshedding in areas with high-loss feeders will be restricted at the time of Sehr and Iftar,” he added.
Leghari noted that it was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s wish that those fasting were provided with utility services in a proper and timely manner so they “do not face any issues”.

 


Meanwhile, Malik stated that “complete arrangements” had been made to ensure the supply of gas “with maximum pressure from 3am to 10:30pm, especially during Sehr and Iftar”.
Leghari affirmed that it would be ensured that “there is no suspension of electricity during these timings across Pakistan”.
He highlighted that a special control room has been established at the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) to monitor all feeders and ensure the same.
“You have the 118 helpline; please file a complaint on it if you face any kind of issues. It will be addressed immediately,” the power minister said.
In his remarks, Malik said the decision regarding no gas loadshedding was taken after consultations with the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), so that the public could be provided with “as many facilities as possible”.

 

“Additional volumes have been arranged,” he said.
For gas-related issues, consumers can lodge a complaint on 119, the petroleum minister stated, adding that situation rooms have been established in the SNGPL and SSGC head offices.
He added that directives have also been issued to the regional offices to monitor the supply of gas, especially “on the tail ends”.
Malik contended that the gas supply in the winter this year was comparatively better than in previous winters.
“With all these efforts, the Power Division and the Petroleum Division are trying to become a source of ease during the blessed month of Ramazan,” the minister said.
After the Ramazan moon was sighted in other parts of the world last night, Pakistan is expecting to begin the holy month with the first fast on Thursday.
In a supply schedule issued days ago for Karachi and its nearby areas, the SSGC said gas would be available from 3am to 9am for Sehr and from 3:30pm to 10pm for Iftar, with the supply expected to be suspended outside these hours to manage overall demand.

 

Similarly, the SNGPL had proposed providing gas from 3am to 10:30pm daily during the upcoming holy month across Punjab.
On Tuesday, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution calling for no gas loadshedding during Sehr and Iftar.
“We have already written to the federal government,” Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said.</p><small>2026-02-18 14:10</small></div><hr>
