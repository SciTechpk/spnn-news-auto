<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081552275fe7c3d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947445/people-of-faith-divided-as-ai-enters-religion' target='_blank'><strong>People of faith divided as AI enters religion</strong></a><br><p>Artificial intelligence, the technology upending nearly every corner of society, is creeping into religion, serving up virtual Jesus and automated sermons — a change drawing mixed reviews from the faithful.
Religious chatbots and other faith-based digital tools are growing in number, offering counsel, comfort and spiritual guidance during an age of rapidly transforming socialisation and engagement.
One app, which is called Text with Jesus, has thousands of paying subscribers. It lets people ostensibly ask questions of Mary, Joseph, Jesus and nearly all 12 apostles.
The idea is to educate, said Stephane Peter, CEO of Catloaf Software, which created the app.
“This is a new way to address religious issues in an interactive way,” he told AFP.
Although the app makes clear it uses AI, virtual Moses and Jesus don’t recognise that as such when asked the specific question.
Peter said that ChatGPT’s latest version, GPT-5, on which Text With Jesus is based, follows instructions better than previous iterations. It is also better at staying in whatever character it is supposed to be and can deny more forcefully that it’s a bot.
He said many people consider the app blasphemous, but it has still received a good rating in the App Store — 4.7 out of 5.
Online ministry Catholic Answers said it got a taste of how sensitive all this can be when it launched the animated AI character “Father Justin” last year.
“A lot of people were offended that it was using a priest character,” said Christopher Costello, the ministry’s director of information technology.
Days later, Catholic Answers stripped the avatar of its title to make it simply Justin.
“We don’t want to replace humans. We just want to help,” Costello said.
No ‘heart and spirit’
Other major religions have similar apps, such as Deen Buddy for Islam, Vedas AI for Hinduism, and AI Buddha. Most bill themselves as interfaces with scripture, not incarnations of actual holiness.
Nica, a 28-year-old Filipina who belongs to the Anglican Church, said she uses ChatGPT almost daily to study scripture — even though her pastor wants her to stop.
“I’d say it’s an added layer,” said Nica, who declined to give her last name.
“I am in a Christian community, and my husband and I have spiritual mentors.
It’s just that sometimes I have random thoughts about the Bible and I want answers immediately.”
Not many will acknowledge using AI assistants in matters of religion, even though some of these apps have been downloaded millions of times.
“People who want to believe in God, maybe shouldn’t ask a chatbot. They should talk to people that believe, too,” said a woman named Emanuela as she left St Patrick’s Cathedral in New York.
Rabbi Gilah Langner said the halakhah — the collective body of religious laws derived from the Torah, the Jewish holy book — has many interpretations.
Jews need other Jews, with their insights and perspective, to connect them to the tradition of their faith, she said.
“I don’t think you really get that from AI. It’s possible it would be very nuanced, but the emotional connection is missing,” Langner told AFP.
AI can make people feel “isolated and not in an organic connection to a living tradition,” she added.
For their part, Christian communities do not reject AI outright.
Peter said he had spoken to clergy members, and they agreed that AI could be a tool to educate people.
Last year, Pope Francis named Demis Hassabis, a co-founder of AI research lab Google DeepMind, to serve in the Vatican’s scientific academy.
And as much of society experiments with artificial intelligence, so does the clergy.
In November 2023, pastor Jay Cooper of the Violet Crown City Church in Austin, Texas, had an AI assistant deliver an entire sermon. He warned parishioners in advance.
“Some people freaked out, said we are now an AI church,” said Cooper. But, he added, the service lured some people who did not usually attend church, especially video-game buffs.
Cooper said he has considered other ways of integrating AI into his church, but has not repeated the AI sermon.
“I’m glad we did it,” he said, “but it missed the heart and spirit of what we usually do.“</p><small>2025-10-08 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081554159c9a4e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947455/ecp-decides-to-hold-local-govt-polls-in-punjab-in-last-week-of-december' target='_blank'><strong>ECP decides to hold local govt polls in Punjab in last week of December</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) decided on Wednesday to hold long-delayed local government (LG) elections in Punjab in the last week of December, the process of delimitation for which would be started tomorrow and completed within two months.
The order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was issued by a four-member ECP bench.
It stated that the ECP had “decided to hold the local government elections in the province of Punjab on basis of the existing local government law i.e. the Punjab Local Government Act 2022 and Rules framed thereunder. The office (ECP) is directed to initiate the process of delimitation from tomorrow and shall further complete it within two months. Thereafter, the election programme should be announced and the election should be held in the last week of December, 2025.”
The order said that the “office is expected to follow the timelines strictly”.
Today’s order referred to another one released after the June hearing held by the ECP on the matter, which stated that the ECP had accepted the Punjab government’s request for three months’ time for the completion of various activities pertaining to the election “in the interest of justice”.
“In case of failure, the commission will issue appropriate orders regarding the conduct of local government elections in the province of Punjab,” the June order said.
Referring to it, today’s order stated that having received no response from the Punjab government after a period of three months, the ECP again fixed the matter for a hearing today and issued a notice to the local government secretary.
According to the order, the bench for today’s hearing comprised ECP Chairperson Sikandar Sultan Raja and three of its members, Nisar Ahmed Durrani, Shah Muhammad Jatoi and Babar Hassan Bharwana.

A statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that last night, security forces conducted an IBO in Orakzai district on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij.
Fitna Al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of operation, 19 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the ISPR said.
It added that during the exchange of fire, 39-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Tariq, who was leading his troops from the front, and his second-in-command, 33-year-old Major Tayyab Rahat, embraced martyrdom along with nine of their men.
The soldiers were identified as 38-year-old Naib Subedar Azam Gul, 35-year-old Naik Adil Hussain, 34-year-old Naik Gul Ameer, 31-year-old Lance Naik Sher Khan, 32-year-old Lance Naik Talish Faraz, 32-year-old Lance Naik Irshad Hussain, 28-year-old Sepoy Tufail Khan, 23-year-old Sepoy Aqib Ali and 24-year-old Sepoy Muhammad Zahid.
The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area. It further stated that security forces were “determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve”.
Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif paid tributes to the country’s security forces for killing 19 terrorists and also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the soldiers, including Lieutenant Colonel Arif and Major Rahat, according to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office.
“The sacrifices of the fearless sons of security forces will never go in vain,” he said.
“We will crush the nefarious intentions of Indian-backed terrorists. We will not allow elements that harm Pakistan’s integrity to succeed,” he added. PM Shehbaz said the government was determined to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country.
A statement issued by the presidency said President Asif Ali Zardari had paid tributes to the “courageous action of security forces in the Orakzai district”.
It added, “[The] president expressed satisfaction over the elimination of 19 terrorists of the Indian-backed khawarij. The President declared Lt. Col. Junaid Tariq shaheed, Major Tayyab Rahat and other martyrs as heroes of the nation,” the statement read.
It added that Zardari expressed heartfelt sympathy with the families of the martyrs, praying that they bear their loss with patience and courage.
The president said that the brave sons set an eternal example by sacrificing their lives while defending their country. “The sacrifices of the martyrs are a symbol of the nation’s resolve and unity.”
He reiterated the “resolve to completely eliminate Indian-backed terrorism from the soil of Pakistan”.
“The entire nation stands as a lead wall with its armed forces,” the statement quoted him as saying.
A statement issued by the PPP said party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the 11 security personnel and paid them tributes.
The statement posted on the PPP’s X account said Bilawal extended condolences to the families of the martyred and expressed solidarity with them.
“Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the martyrs,” the statement said, adding that he reaffirmed his “unwavering support for the security forces during the ongoing operation for the elimination of terrorists”.
 






National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, expressing grief over the martyrdom of the security personnel and paying tributes to them, reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate the threat of terrorism, state-run APP reported.
“The sacrifices of our armed forces and security personnel in the war against terrorism will never go in vain. Terrorist […] will never succeed in fulfilling their nefarious designs,” the APP quoted him as saying.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Two reports, issued last week by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.</p><small>2025-10-08 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08142107070f0e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947441/ghotki-journalist-tufail-rind-shot-dead-by-unknown-assailants-in-presence-of-his-children-police' target='_blank'><strong>Ghotki journalist Tufail Rind shot dead by unknown assailants in presence of his children: police</strong></a><br><p>A local journalist, Tufail Rind, was shot dead by unidentified armed men in the Mirpur Mathelo area of Sindh’s Ghotki district on Wednesday morning, according to the police.
The attack took place when he was on his way to drop his children off at school. According to a police press release, the shooting occurred on the Jerwar Road near Maso Wah, where the assailants riding a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire at his car.
“Rind died on the spot, while his children miraculously escaped unharmed,” the police said.
Witnesses added that the attackers fled the scene after the assault, spreading panic across the area. The police later transported the body to the District Headquarters Hospital of Mirpur Mathelo for medico-legal formalities.
The police statement said that upon receiving the information, Ghotki’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Anwar Khetran immediately reached the crime scene, inspected the site, and met with the victim’s family, issuing “strict orders to the concerned officers for prompt action”.
“The SSP Ghotki assured the victim’s family that all individuals involved in the murder would be arrested soon and brought to justice,” the statement added.
The police said that multiple angles are being investigated and evidence is being collected to determine the motive behind the attack.
According to a relative of the victim, Rind was associated with Mehran Newspaper and Royal News, and also served as an office-bearer of the Mirpur Mathelo Press Club. He had survived an earlier assassination attempt in which he had requested security from the local administration, but no effective measures were taken.
SSP Khetran confirmed in a statement that Rind had complained a few months ago about an incident of gunfire at his home, saying that police had made arrests at that time.
“We also arrested one person in connection with that on Oct. 4 (Saturday),” he added. “Rind was in contact with us and appreciated that the arrests were made.”
A few hours after the murder, another tragedy struck when Rind’s eight-year-old niece fainted upon hearing the news of the killing. She was rushed to Mirpur Mathelo Hospital and later referred to Sukkur due to her critical condition, but died on the way. Her body was handed over to the family after medico-legal procedures.
Suspects arrested
Ghotki’s SSP Khetran has said that two suspects have already been arrested in connection with Rind’s murder.
“The slain journalist had a dispute with members of his own community for the past four years, during which two people had previously been killed,” said SSP Khetran.
He said that individuals from both sides of the rival groups were already in jail, and that this was the third murder linked to the same dispute.
“All those involved in the murder of journalist Tufail Rind will be arrested,” the SSP added.
Sindh’s Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and sought an urgent report from Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon.
In his statement, the chief minister said, “Attacks on journalists are attacks on press freedom, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.”
Murad directed the police to conduct an impartial investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest. He also expressed condolences to the victim’s family and assured them that justice would be ensured.
Locals in Ghotki and Mirpur Mathelo described Rind as a courageous journalist who always stood for the downtrodden. His funeral was attended by a large number of citizens, journalists, and political leaders.
Condemnations pour in
Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also condemned the killing, calling it a “tragic and deplorable incident”. He said the Sindh government stood with the bereaved family, adding, “Such attacks are equivalent to assaults on freedom of expression.“
Deputy Parliamentary Leader of Sindh Assembly and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) Pakistan’s representative, Taha Ahmed Khan, strongly condemned the “brutal murder”.
In a statement, Khan said that MQM Pakistan stood in solidarity with Rind’s family as well as with the journalist community during this difficult time.
Sindh Government Spokesperson and Mayor of Sukkur, Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh, expressed sorrow and regret over the incident, calling it highly condemnable.
“Attacks on journalists are actually tantamount to attacks on freedom of expression, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Mayor Sukkur said in a statement.
Journalist, press associations demand justice
Rind’s murder sparked widespread grief and anger across the journalist community in Pakistan. Journalists across Sindh staged protests, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits and the introduction of effective laws to protect journalists. The protests included a sit-in observed in front of the SSP’s office.
 
 

The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), Karachi Press Club, Hyderabad Union of Journalists, Umerkot Press Club, Ghotki Press Club, and Mirpur Mathelo Press Club jointly condemned the killing, saying, “Another voice has been silenced — punished for speaking the truth.”
They urged the Sindh government to provide financial and legal assistance to Rind’s family and to formulate a clear security policy for journalists to prevent further bloodshed.
PFUJ’s Vice President Akbar Jafri said in a statement that the incidents of attacks, threats, kidnappings and brutal killings of journalists across the country were “clear evidence of the complete failure and indifference of the government and administration”.
He said that Rind’s murder was “proof that there is no effective policy for the protection of journalists across the country, including Sindh.”
Jafri pointed out that Rind had appealed on social media a few days ago regarding the threat to his life, but the government and administration ignored this appeal, which “resulted in the loss of another precious life”.
“The journalistic community is united and will continue to struggle for its rights and protection, because remaining silent now will be tantamount to waiting for more sacrifices,” he said.
Journalist Mazhar Abbas also posted on X, saying that the killing of journalists was “on rise again in Sindh”.
“Following Imtiaz Mir’s murder, another journalist Tufail Rind, has been killed within two weeks,” Abbas said. “Rind’s alleged killer has also shared his confessional statement’s video. This is quite alarming.”
Last month, anchorperson Imtiaz Mir was shot and wounded in Karachi’s Malir area, succumbing to his injuries few days later, according to his family and police.
 






Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists.
According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.
In August last year, unknown armed men shot dead another Ghotki journalist, Muhammad Bachal Ghuniyo, who was associated with a private Sindhi TV channel.
Another Ghotki journalist, Nasrullah Gadani, who worked for a Sindhi newspaper, was shot at and seriously wounded in an attack in May 2024. He succumbed to fatal injuries at a Karachi hospital three days later.</p><small>2025-10-08 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08122638140069a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947427/no-casualties-reported-as-fire-doused-at-factory-in-karachis-liaquatabad-rescue-service' target='_blank'><strong>No casualties reported as fire doused at factory in Karachi’s Liaquatabad: rescue service</strong></a><br><p>No casualties were reported after a fire erupted in a plastic factory in Karachi’s Liaquatabad area early on Wednesday and was extinguished after hectic efforts, according to a rescue official.
Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com, “The fire erupted in the plastic factory located in a market near Sindhi Hotel in Liaquatabad at around 7:30am.”
He said three fire tenders managed to control it, and no casualties were reported.
Liaquatabad Station House Officer Ghulam Yasin told Dawn.com that the fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit.
Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
 
 

According to city planners and engineers, 70 per cent of residential, commercial and industrial buildings in Karachi lacked an adequate fire safety system. Citing official data of the city’s fire department, Fire Protection Association President Kunwar Waseem said the city witnessed nearly 3,000 such incidents in 2024.
On September 9, four firefighters and one cameraman of a private TV channel were injured when a huge fire destroyed a three-storey garment factory in New Karachi Industrial Area and also damaged two other adjacent factories.
Later that month, two women died and nine other people were rescued in a fire that erupted in a four-storey building in the city’s Defence Housing Authority.
In August, at least six people died in a fire inside a warehouse near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex, while eight were injured in another blaze at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi earlier that month.</p><small>2025-10-08 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081156079114420.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947430/rawalpindi-atc-issues-bailable-arrest-warrant-for-aleema-khan-in-nov-26-protest-case' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi ATC issues bailable arrest warrant for Aleema Khan in Nov 26 protest case</strong></a><br><p>The Rawalpindi Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Wednesday issued a bailable arrest warrant for PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, in connection with the party’s November 26 case, dismissing an exemption plea filed by her to appear for a hearing.
More than 10,000 PTI supporters surged into the city on Nov 26 last year, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. As the demonstrators inched towards the heavily barricaded D-Chowk, the police and security troops employed intense teargas shelling to disperse them.
Aleema was to be indicted in the November 26 protest case registered at Sadiqabad Police Station during today’s hearing, but she did not appear before the court.
During the hearing, the prosecutor objected that the person applying on Aleema’s behalf was not her lawyer, and therefore was not authorised to file an application without a power of attorney.
On this basis, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah dismissed Aleema’s application for exemption and issued bailable arrest warrants for her.
The other 10 suspects in the case appeared in court, while the hearing was adjourned until October 11 (Saturday).
Early in September, the Rawalpindi police booked Aleema, party lawyer Naeem Panjutha and 40 other PTI-linked activists for alleged violence against a journalist outside Adiala Jail.
In October last year, Aleema, her sister Uzma, and other PTI supporters were arrested from Islamabad’s D-Chowk for clashing with the police and violating Section 144,  a legal provision that restricts gatherings of four or more people in an area to prevent public disorder or unrest. A few days later, they were released from the Jhelum District Jail after a judge granted them bail.</p><small>2025-10-08 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081421218877a09.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947448/mohsin-naqvi-says-afghanistans-visa-issues-for-asian-cup-qualifier-resolved' target='_blank'><strong>Mohsin Naqvi says Afghanistan’s visa issues for Asian Cup qualifier resolved</strong></a><br><p>Visa issues surrounding Afghanistan’s football team being able to play in Pakistan have been sorted out, allowing the team to travel to Islamabad for Thursday’s AFC Asian Cup qualifier at the Jinnah Stadium, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Pakistan Football Federation president Mohsen Gilani said that its Afghanistan counterpart had failed to ensure the presence of its full travelling squad at the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul for biometric verification, as most of the players were not living in the country.
The Afghanistan Football Federation was quoted by the Afghan Voice Agency as stating that it had sent the initial list of team members to the Pakistan Embassy on September 18, but “despite repeated follow-ups and official contacts, visas have not been issued to the players and officials”.
Today, Minister Naqvi took to X to announce the issue had been sorted out.
“Issued now,” he said in response to journalist Faizan Lakhani’s post saying the minister has ordered to sort out the visa issue of the Afghanistan football team.
“Thank you for highlighting it,” Naqvi added.
 






Uncertainty surrounded the qualifier due to the latter failing to secure visas for its players earlier.
Reports from Afghanistan said that all of its national team players had gathered in Dubai on Tuesday evening, and they were awaiting visa clearance.
Both Pakistan and Afghanistan are pointless after losing their opening two matches in Group ‘E’ against Syria and Myanmar.  The two sides have a double-header in this international window, with Afghanistan to host Pakistan in Al Ardiya, Kuwait, for the return game on October 14.
The winner of the group advances to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup in Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-10-08 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08124906c6bec4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947421/sc-constitutional-bench-mulls-formation-of-full-court-while-hearing-pleas-against-26th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>SC Constitutional Bench mulls formation of full court while hearing pleas against 26th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>An eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday began its deliberations on the petitioners’ request to form a full court to hear a set of pleas challenging the 26th Amendment.
The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy.
It took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
 
 

The legislation had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The CB is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. It resumed proceedings yesterday after over eight months, and unanimously allowed live-streaming of the case upon some petitioners’ request.
The pleas taken up also seek the formation of a full court to hear the matter. Hence, before proceeding further, the court will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB.
During today’s hearing, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan requested the formation of a 16-member bench to hear the pleas, as per the number of SC judges at the time of the 26th Amendment.
Several judges, including Justice Aminuddin, observed that the 26th Amendment was currently part of the Constitution. Some judges questioned whether the CB had the power to form a full court, while Justice Malik noted there was no restriction on issuing a judicial order for that.
The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow.
Requests to form a full court bench and to live stream the case dominated yesterday’s hearing, with the state lawyer expressing no objection to live stream the proceedings.
 


The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Advocate Hamid came to the rostrum and said the 26th Amendment was introduced in an “unusual” manner and passed by the parliament at night.
Hamid recalled that there were 17 judges present in the SC at the time the legislation was passed, including then-CJP Qazi Faez Isa, who later retired. Therefore, he contended, a 16-judge “full court” bench as of then should hear the pleas and pointed out that all eight judges in the current CB would be part of that bench as they were already serving as SC judges in October last year.
As per the SC’s website, there are currently a total of 24 judges in the SC, including CJP Yahya Afridi, after six new judges were appointed in February.
 
 

“This Amendment is against the very basic features of the Constitution,” he asserted, at which Justice Mandokhail said that the matter will be deliberated upon later and asked him whether the Amendment was currently a part of the Constitution.
In response to Hamid’s arguments, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “We depend on the Constitution. Lawyers also depend on the Constitution. Unless the Constitution is [further] amended, we will have to depend on the current Constitution.”
Justice Hilali also observed that whether the 26th Amendment was “right or wrong”, the court had not suspended it yet. “You consider the 26th Amendment a part of the Constitution, which is why you have challenged it.”
Here, Justice Mazhar noted that the CB was at the moment not considering the main question of the legislation’s legality, but the request for a full court and sought arguments on that.
Hamid responded that he was not detailing how the 26th Amendment was unconstitutional, but on the “effects of its powers”. He said it was for the first time after the legislation that the “authority to form benches was taken away from the chief justice”.
Noting that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) existed prior to last year’s constitutional tweaks, the LHCBA counsel said the 26th Amendment impacted the JCP’s formation as “judges became a minority” after the number of its members was increased.
 
 

“After the Amendment, the majority in the Judicial Commission went to the administrative side, which affected judicial independence,” Hamid said.
Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Hamid whether he was acknowledging the 26th Amendment or not, the lawyer replied in the negative.
At this point during the hearing, Justice Mazhar wondered whether a bench constituted after the 26th Amendment could decide a plea seeking the formation of a full court.
Justice Mandokhail, however, remarked that the Amendment was part of the Constitution for now. At Justice Afghan pointing out that Hamid had not specified in his petition that “to whom should the bench send the case”, the lawyer said the matter should be referred to the CJP.
Justice Hilali also asked whether the LHCBA counsel had made any request to the authority responsible for constituting the benches. To this, Hamid replied, “We are challenging the bench formation, which was constituted under the influence of the 26th Amendment.”
Here, Justice Aminuddin observed, “Right now, [we are] not at such a stage to consider who will hear the case. Possibly, there might be hearings for a month on the matter of who will hear the case,” he added.
“On what basis are you saying that we cannot hear the case?” the CB head questioned Hamid, remarking that it was not in the judges’ control to “go back to before the 26th Amendment”.
At this point during the hearing, Justice Malik said, “Whether a full court hears or a bench, no one is stopping any judicial order. The process continues after a judicial order.
“Where under the 26th Amendment is a full court being barred?” she asked, to which Hamid replied that the legislation did not do so.
 
 

Justice Malik observed, “When there is a request for forming a bench, we do not question the procedure. We give directions, after which the process is initiated.”
Here, Justice Aminuddin wondered under what authority the CB would constitute a full court, following which Justice Malik said there was “no restriction on forming a full court under a judicial order”.
“Where in the 26th Amendment is it written that a judicial order cannot be issued? Such is being done in ordinary cases, then why not in this case?” she countered.
Justice Afghan again raised the issue of Hamid not mentioning the said request in his petition.
Upon Justice Mazhar asking whether the CB could use Article 187 (issue and execution of SC processes) of the Constitution to issue the order for a full court, Hamid replied in the affirmative.
 
 

At one point during the hearing, Justice Mandokhail remarked that the CB was not conceptualised by the SC but by the parliament. When Hamid said the bench should “forget” Article 191A, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the apex court, Justice Aminuddin said if that was forgotten, the SC would not exist anymore.
“A full court was always formed whenever questions were raised about the Constitution,” Hamid emphasised.
At this, Justice Mandokhail wondered if a “point decided by 17 judges in the past” can be reversed, to which the lawyer replied in the negative. “Will you not be glad if the previous decision is upheld and now a smaller bench hears the case?” the judge asked.
However, Justice Afghan noted that the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 did not exist in the past. He remarked that CJPs in the past “kept using their powers to constitute full courts”, but now that authority lied with the SC Practice and Procedure Committee “as per the Constitution and the law”.
The petitions
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
As a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued.
 
 

The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-08 10:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/12/5dfb24846cc2c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1521879/why-pakistan-needs-to-deal-with-air-pollution-on-an-emergency-footing' target='_blank'><strong>Why Pakistan needs to deal with air pollution on an emergency footing</strong></a><br><p>The article was first published in December 2019 and has been replugged for DawnMedia’s upcoming air pollution conference in Lahore.

There is mounting evidence that the air quality in Pakistan is having a strong impact on our quality of life. While research has shown the impact of poor air quality on morbidity and mortality for more serious conditions, its insidious effects are not discussed enough.
The numbers paint a frightening picture.
According to the World Air Quality report, Pakistan was the second most polluted country in 2018. At the time of writing this article, Karachi and Lahore were among the 10 cities in the world to have the most polluted air, with Lahore’s AQI (Air Quality Index) at 188 and Karachi’s at 182.
An AQI of up to 50 is healthy. Beyond that, an AQI 0f 100-150 becomes unhealthy for children, and people with heart and lung disease. An AQI of above 150 is unhealthy for everyone while levels above 300 constitute a health emergency.
Data from Lahore and Peshawar showed an AQI of above 300 on multiple days in the month of November. As for Lahore alone, in November, there wasn’t a single day in the country’s cultural capital that could be called healthy.
 


Pakistan’s air pollution levels have transformed into a more dire health emergency than smoking, tuberculosis, and unsafe water and sanitation, reducing our life expectancy more than any of the three listed causes.
In this situation, children are especially vulnerable, and air pollution causes 1 in 10 deaths for children under the age of five. Air pollution worsens respiratory problems for children as well as adults, causes childhood cancer, and impacts healthy brain development. For pregnant women, being exposed to air pollution can lead to premature births.
 


In this article, we as a group of public health experts will attempt to comment on the various insidious effects that air pollution has on the public at large.
How respiratory health is impacted
Air pollutants come in all shapes and sizes (literally, ranging from coarse to ultra-fine) depending on the source of the pollutant. Studies show that air pollutants contain chemical substances that cause direct damage to the lungs’ inner lining and prevent DNA repair of an already damaged inner lining. This imbalance in damage and repair can promote abnormal cell growth, leading to lung cancer.
Moreover, research shows that the presence of air pollutants in our airways paralyses the cilia (small hair-like structure on our wind-pipes that clear any bacteria or foreign particles), causing an increase in bacterial growth, thus promoting infections like pneumonia.
Unfortunately, the very medium of this pollution has exposed us to it every day, involuntarily allowing them to enter our bodies through every breath we take. The very nature of this exposure primarily affects our lungs, the gateway to air inside our body, leading to asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease and of course lung cancer.

Recent estimations by the World Health Organisation show that air pollution was responsible for almost 10 million deaths in 2018. Overall, up to 35% of total deaths occur due to lung related diseases, caused directly or indirectly by air pollution, making it the world’s largest health risk.
In Pakistan, there are many more sources of air pollution other than motorised vehicles and industries. A vast majority of the population in Pakistan depends on solid fuel burning for basic needs like cooking, heating and light which further increases the risk of air pollution exposure within homes, and especially to children. Such exposure can reduce a person’s ability to combat diseases, especially lung-related infections like tuberculosis.
Effects on cardiovascular health
Population scientists over the years have examined outcomes of people exposed to high levels of air pollutants and have found strong independent association of exposure to ambient air pollutants with development and progression of cardiovascular disease and risk factors. These include diabetes, high blood pressure, increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and aortic dissections. Leading medical journals like the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet and Circulation have published papers linking exposure to particulate matter with higher risk of development of heart disease, premature death and poorer quality of life after a heart attack.
In the context of Pakistan, it is critical to realise the magnitude of the difference in air quality between countries where these studies were done and air quality in Pakistan.
The air pollutant that is associated with adverse cardiovascular health outcomes is termed Particulate Matter 2.5 or PM2.5 because of its size (< 2.5 µm). Unlike the larger air pollutants, PM2.5 makes its way all the way down to the lungs and gets absorbed in the blood. Hence, it has systemic and long-lasting effects. These effects include inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and activation of thrombotic pathways, all of which increase the plaque burden in the arteries of the heart contributing to the risk of heart attacks and heart failure.
By conservative estimates, every 10 µm/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with a 10% higher risk of death in vulnerable populations, including patients after a heart attack and other heart disorders. Let us explain. For example, if someone with heart disease lives in an area where average PM2.5 concentration is 15µm/m3 and then moves to an area where average concentration is 25µm/m3, his/her risk of premature death increases by10%. These estimates are based on population studies done in western countries where the concentration of PM2.5 ranges around 5-30µg/m3. In Pakistan, the average daily concentration approaches to over a 100 µg/m3 in urban areas such as Lahore and Karachi. We do not even know what the dose response curve is like for such high concentrations of PM2.5. In simpler words, the effects of exposure of PM2.5 on cardiovascular outcomes have not been extensively studied at concentrations that Pakistanis living in urban centres like Karachi and Lahore are exposed to.
However, it is well-known at concentrations below 50 µm/m3, and the higher the exposure to PM2.5, higher the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. Whether this exposure/risk relationship plateaus at even higher concentrations is not well understood. In the worst case scenario, the risk would go up incrementally and in the best case scenario, the risk may remain the same. Though even in the best case situation, the risk is very high and in any western country, this high level of PM2.5 would have been unacceptable.
For Pakistan, we know that high levels of air pollutants have toxic effects for our citizens. We also know that we do not completely understand the scope of the adverse health effects of such high concentrations of air pollutants. But we do not know the unknown population level effects of chronic exposure to these levels of pollution.
 


In the above concept diagram, we attempt to illustrate the incremental risk of death in patients with heart disease, with higher exposures to PM2.5. What this curve looks like at PM2.5 concentrations that are common in Pakistan is not known. This is indeed a crisis. The threat to public health and well-being is real and cannot be under-estimated. But finding a solution to this will be a complex process and will involve thinking along long-term policies to limit emissions as well as short-term guidelines for citizens on methods they can employ to protect themselves.
The damage to mental health
Air pollution has also been reported to have deleterious impacts on the mental health of those exposed to it. Particulate matter in the atmosphere can get absorbed into the bloodstream and interfere with the functioning of our brain and the nervous system. This can include impairment when it comes to concentration, memory problems, and difficulty in emotional regulation, eventually leading to decreased productivity of the workforce and causing the national exchequer to lose billions of rupees annually.
Mental health professionals working in Pakistan have also observed an increased rate of relapse in patients affected by mental illness with the change of weather and air quality. While some may attribute it to the cold, it is highly likely that increased air pollution during winter may be leading to increased risk of relapse in patients affected by mental health problems. While we need more data to support this proposition, there have been sufficient anecdotal accounts by mental health professionals reporting an increased rate of relapse in patients living in more polluted parts of Karachi during the winter season.
Air pollution is especially bad for children’s mental health, since not only are children more exposed to its effects (due to a higher rate of breathing and more intake of pollutants) but the developing brain is more susceptible to harmful pollutants.

This can have a long-term adverse impact on children’s ability to excel in education, form healthy relationships, and ultimately become productive members of society. Research has also shown that certain pollutants, such as lead, when inhaled by children can lead to a decrease in their IQ levels, decreased inhibition and increased violence in communities. Hence, air pollution is not just a health problem, but it can very easily turn into a much bigger societal, if not a security problem.
Pediatrics & early childhood development
In South Asia, it is estimated that approximately 12 million children are at risk because of air pollution. Previously it was thought that pollution only affects children because of respiratory compromise, but it is now clear that the respiratory component directly affects the neuro-development element because children respire more air per unit due to their surface area.
When air toxicity is at the level which Pakistan is currently experiencing, it is safe to assume that children will end up breathing in more toxic air. The toxic air that is breathed in directly compromises the neural connections that are made in the most important time of development: the first 1,000 days of life. Neural connections are affected because nano-particles can directly impede the blood-brain barrier and in turn can stimulate the brain to produce free radicals which damage the brain itself. These damages are not limited to just the structural component, but also affect brain functionality by damaging the white matter which is an important neural connection that regulates our body.
The blood-brain barrier keeps the blood from flowing into our brain — it’s like a filter mechanism that keeps excessive fluid and other substances potentially toxic for the brain from getting into it. Free radicals are ions that can cause oxidative damage to body parts, in this case the brain. So when the blood brain barrier is weakened, the brain receives more oxidative damage because of the free radicals.
Loss of function of the barrier and the radicals all contribute to inflammation. For an organ that is already sensitive and in its development stage, the stress alone can contribute to cognitive dysfunction, resulting in a decrease in IQ points (by approximately 4-6) which is a significant figure. Furthermore, the compounded effect of respiratory compromise due to pollution contributes to absenteeism, further limiting a child’s learning potential.
Thus, it can be hypothesised that the insidious effect of pollution further contributes to our morbidity and mortality, not just through physical disease but also with long-term damage that may contribute to early ADHD, Autism and probably Parkinson’s.
The way forward
Pakistan will have to deal with the issue of air pollution as a crisis and the country’s response will have to be multi-tiered and vary in temporality, since we need short-term, medium-term, and long-term changes. As medical practitioners, we’d leave the medium-term and long-term solutions to experts in that space, such as environmental engineers, energy professionals, and other industry experts. However, what we can urge them to do is to act now and act fast.
In the short-term, what we must propose is for citizens to take charge of their own health and well-being to the best of their abilities. Some simple measures that they must take up include purifying the air in places where they spend most of their time, such as homes and offices. Invest in air purifiers, there are many low-cost but effective local options available in the market now and the difference it will make to your feeling of well-being will be immediately noticeable. In addition, if your work involves significant time outside, then there can only be good that would come out of wearing a mask. An n95 mask would be ideal for this purpose.
This is what one can do to protect oneself and their loved ones. Now to people who can effect change, those who run industries, are in the energy sector, or work in the policy space, as physicians we urge you to consider the cost at which we are enabling economic growth. Members of our society, especially the ones who hold access to resources, must ponder the future we are building for ourselves and our children. As public health professionals, we can predict that if we continue on in the same direction, an apocalyptic future is not a dramatic hyperbole but a probable reality for the region.

Huang’s reported message, aimed at reassuring employees, comes after panic and confusion had ensued among tech workers on H-1B visas, a large chunk of whom are from India and China.
Akin to the wider chip and tech industry, Nvidia has a significant number of employees from overseas. Huang has repeatedly asserted that about half the AI researchers in the world are Chinese.
“As one of many immigrants at Nvidia, I know that the opportunities we’ve found in America have profoundly shaped our lives,” Huang wrote in a message to staff, cited by Business Insider.
“And the miracle of Nvidia — built by all of you, and by brilliant colleagues around the world — would not be possible without immigration,” Huang added, according to the report.
Nvidia declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Trump’s order bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made an additional $100,000 payment.
The administration has said the order does not apply to people who already hold H-1B visas or those who submitted applications before September 21.
H-1B visas allow businesses to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations.
Late in September, US lawmakers asked major US companies to explain why they are hiring thousands of foreign workers on H-1B visas while cutting other jobs.
According to the report, in his message to staff, Huang said that “legal immigration remains essential to ensuring the US continues to lead in technology and ideas,” and that the Trump administration’s “recent changes reaffirm this.”
California, home to Silicon Valley and multiple tech giants, including Nvidia, has consistently ranked first in the country since 2018 in the number of visa applications received annually, according to USCIS data.</p><small>2025-10-08 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081023426d2e308.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947419/gold-tops-4000-for-first-time-as-traders-pile-into-safe-haven' target='_blank'><strong>Gold tops $4,000 for first time as traders pile into safe haven</strong></a><br><p>Gold prices broke $4,000 for the first time on Wednesday as investors piled into the safe haven over expectations for United States interest rate cuts and worries over the US government shutdown.
In Pakistan, 24-karat gold price was recorded at Rs425,178 per tola and Rs365,421 per 10 grammes, according the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association. The prices were based on the exchange rate in the interbank market.
The global rally in the precious metal also came after concerns that a tech-fuelled rally that has sent some equity markets to record highs may have gone too far, fanning talk of an asset bubble.
Traders have been piling into gold all year, pushing it up more than 50 per cent since the turn of the year, on the back of a range of issues including global economic uncertainty, Donald Trump’s trade war and geopolitical crises.
Its allure was increased further this week by political turmoil in France, where the country’s prime minister resigned and President Emmanuel Macron’s former premier urged him to resign and call early elections.
Gold — long considered a go-to in times of uncertainty — climbed to a high of $4,006.68 on Wednesday, even as the dollar has pushed up against most of its peers in recent days. Silver was also within a few dollars of its own record high.
The closure of parts of the US government is adding to the sense of unease among investors, with key economic data, including on jobs, being postponed and muddying the waters for the Federal Reserve as it tries to decide on its rate plans.
“The rapid rise in gold prices has been supported by rising inflows into (exchange-traded funds) and central bank buying, including solid demand from China, as gold benefits from political, economic, and inflation uncertainty,” wrote Taylor Nugent at National Australia Bank.
While gold traders were busy pushing the metal ever higher, equity markets were more subdued in Asia as questions were asked about the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been invested in artificial intelligence.
The AI boom has seen some indexes and companies hit record highs, with chip titan Nvidia topping a $4 trillion valuation.
But a report that software firm Oracle’s cloud computing profit margin was much lower than expected sent shivers through trading floors, with all three main indexes on Wall Street falling into the red.
“In a market priced for perfection, any delay in cash flow — even a temporary one — feels like the bartender calling ‘last call’,” wrote Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management.
“Traders didn’t wait for clarification; they simply started easing out of their positions. The Oracle story didn’t crash the party, but it definitely sobered it.” Tech firms, which have enjoyed strong buying this year and in recent months, led selling in Asia.
Hong Kong and Taipei were among the biggest losers, while Sydney and Singapore also fell.
Tokyo was marginally higher, helped by lingering optimism that the election of business-friendly conservative Sanae Takaichi as the ruling party’s leader will see more stimulus measures and a fresh push for monetary easing.
Wellington, Manila and Jakarta also edged up.

In a post on X on Tuesday, he said the PM had invited him for a meeting after his speech in the upper House of Parliament, and during the conversation, he told the premier: “If I can criticise openly, I also have the courage to apologise if I make a mistake”. He added that he had told the PM that if he was wrong in his presumptions about the deal, “I apologise”.
In his Senate speech, Khan had referred to a photograph circulating on social media that showed PM Shehbaz, US President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was holding an open briefcase that appeared to contain minerals. The photograph was released by the White House, after a September meeting of the three in the US, and showed Field Marshal Munir pointing to the contents of the briefcase and Trump looking at them.
Khan said in his speech in the Senate on Sept 30 that in the photograph, it seemed that a deal for the trade of rare earth minerals was being proposed. “Under what agreement, which law and the Constitution? This is dictatorship. This is, sorry to say, not democracy.”
He went on to question whether parliament held any importance.
Khan also spoke of the rights of smaller provinces and accused the ruling party in the Centre, the PML-N, of working on the terms of the military establishment.
 
 

The ANP leader also termed the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) — a committee that helps with foreign investments — an “unconstitutional institution”.
“The SIFC is financially taking Pakistan towards one unit. All your decisions are being made at one place … The SIFC is making Punjab’s agriculture policy […] It is the SIFC that is dealing with rare earth minerals,”  he alleged.
Following Khan’s speech, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar mentioned in the Senate on Tuesday that PM Shehbaz had met Khan and clarified details regarding his meeting with the US president.
Subsequently, Khan posted on X that after his speech in the upper house of parliament, the premier invited him for a briefing on his visit to the US.
“At the beginning of the meeting, he apologised to me and said that all of this should have happened in parliament prior to the US visit. I accepted his apology right away and said: “‘Look at my speech. I only talked about the supremacy of parliament. I did not ridicule anyone.’”
 






According to Khan, the premier clarified that he needed to take the army chief along with him on some visits. “Due to some strategic constraints, he takes the Field Marshal along with him,” he said.
“Referring to the picture of Trump, the Field Marshal and himself, [Shehbaz] said that the gift of minerals presented to the American president was purchased by the army chief from his own pocket and had nothing to do with any mineral deal — domestic or foreign,” Khan claimed.
The ANP leader said that he replied: “When I have the courage to criticise openly, I also have the courage to apologise for my mistake. If this picture has nothing to do with the minerals of KP and Balochistan or any deal, then I apologise.”
He added that the people of KP and Balochistan had a right on the minerals in their respective provinces and they “should be included in this. We are neither against development nor betterment of the economy”.
On Monday, Dawn reported that the federal and provincial governments withdrew police and Federal Constabulary security protection to Khan and his family following his critical speech in the upper house of parliament.
Today, ANP spokesperson Engineer Ehsanullah Khan said Khan’s recent speech in the Senate was an “unconditional affirmation of parliamentary supremacy”.
“The ANP has always been a torch-bearer of the supremacy of parliament. It was also the central idea of the party president’s speech in the Senate,” his statement posted on the ANP’s X account said. It added that Khan’s statement also made it “clear that the government will ensure implementation regarding the rights of smaller provinces, as they were stated in the Constitution.”
He further stated that the ANP valued the national role of defence institutions, but was also clear that “all institutions should work within the bounds of the Constitution”.

A two-judge SHC bench headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro directed the senior zoo director and Sindh Council for Conservation of Wildlife (SCCW) secretary to appear in court on Oct 14 with a report about the health of brown bear Rano and whether the animal is classified as an endangered species.
Animal rights activist Jude Allen Pereira petitioned the SHC and submitted that he approached the court in public interest to seek declaration of recognition of animal cruelty to the female brown bear, currently confined at Karachi Zoo in violation of relevant law.
Citing the KMC, through mayor, senior zoo director and SCCW secretary as respondents, the petitioner impugned non-implementation of recommendations made by a committee, constituted by the senior zoo director, which recommended relocation of Rano to the Balkasar Bear Sanctuary in Punjab till DNA sequencing is conducted to identify its exact species.

Himalayan or Syrian? — SHC seeks report on origin of female brown bear kept in Karachi Zoo

He said that the respondents claimed Rano to be a Syrian bear while he believed it might be a Himalayan bear, which is critically endangered species.
Petitioner’s counsel Muhammad Jibran Nasir argued that the committee had also recommended further shifting of the bear to an appropriate habitat upon confirmation of its exact species.
He also submitted that continued confinement of the female bear at the Karachi Zoo was illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of the Sindh Wildlife Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management Act, 2020 and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1890 as well as against the recommendation of the committee.
After a preliminary hearing, the bench in its order said: “Issue notice to the respondents and the advocate general Sindh for 14.10.2025 on which date respondents No.2 and 3 shall appear in person with a report as to whether the bear ‘Rano’ is a Syrian or Himalayan bear as to whether or not it is classified as an endangered species or not and as to its general health.”
Mr Nasir also assured the bench that the petition would be amended within two days to make the province of Sindh as a respondent.
In the petition, the counsel maintained that Rano transferred from a breeding farm and research centre in March 2017 under an animal exchange programme has been held in solitary confinement for the past eight years within a small and barren concrete pit at the zoo.
He stated that the bear was deprived of species-specific environmental enrichment, suitable climatic conditions and necessary medical care appropriate while its physical and psychological health has visibly deteriorated as Rano exhibited documented symptoms of captivity-induced trauma, repetitive pacing, self-isolation and abnormal vocalisations indicating prolonged psychological distress and ongoing violations of applicable animal welfare standards.

Starmer’s first official trip to India, which he hopes will boost economic ties between the two nations, sees him accompanied by a 125-member delegation that includes top business leaders including British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle.
 






The two-day visit follows his July meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in London, where the pair signed the trade accord.
Starmer is due to meet Modi tomorrow, and address a fintech conference in Mumbai alongside him.
“With India set to be the third biggest economy in the world by 2028, and trade with them about to become quicker and cheaper, the opportunities waiting to be seized are unparalleled,” Starmer said in a statement.
India and its former colonial ruler are the world’s fifth- and sixth-largest economies, with bilateral trade worth around $54.8 billion and investments supporting more than 600,000 jobs across both countries.
 
 

The visit “will provide a valuable opportunity to reaffirm the shared vision of India and the United Kingdom to build a forward-looking partnership”, India’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
Under the new deal, India will slash tariffs on imports of British goods such as whisky, cosmetics and medical devices, while Britain will reduce duties on clothing, footwear and food products, including frozen prawns from India.
‘Britain not seeking visa deal with India’
However, Starmer ruled out expanding visa access for Indian professionals despite pressure from industry.
“That isn’t part of the plan,” he told reporters en route to Mumbai. “We’re here now to take advantage of the free trade agreement that we’ve already struck. We’ve got to implement it.
“Businesses are taking advantage of that. But the issue is not about visas.”
Starmer said that visas had blocked previous efforts to seal a trade deal, and that, having reached an agreement which had no visa implications, he didn’t wish to revisit the issue when he meets Modi tomorrow.
The British premier said visas would not be on the table in order to attract tech sector professionals from India, after United States President Donald Trump hiked fees on H-1B visas, though he said more broadly he wanted to have “top talent” in Britain.
 
 

Asked if he would stop issuing visas to arrivals from countries that won’t take back foreign criminals or people wanted to deport, Starmer said it was a “non-issue” with India as there is a returns agreement, but it was something he would look at more broadly.
“We are looking at whether there should be a link between visas and returns agreements,” he said.
Starmer is trying to take a more restrictive stance on both immigration amid high public concern about the issue, as his Labour Party trails the populist Reform UK party in polls.
Rights groups have urged Starmer to raise the case of Scottish Sikh blogger Jagtar Singh Johal, detained in India since 2017 over an alleged plot to kill right-wing Hindu leaders. He has not been convicted, and one of the nine charges against him was dismissed in March.</p><small>2025-10-08 06:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0723273538272ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947271/pakistan-look-to-revive-womens-world-cup-campaign-against-australia' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan look to revive Women’s World Cup campaign against Australia</strong></a><br><p>Still searching for a sense of direction in the ICC Women’s World Cup, Pakistan will take on a rampant Australian side at the R. Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday, hoping to spark a turnaround against the tournament’s most complete outfit.
Fatima Sana’s charges have endured a tough start to their campaign, slumping to heavy defeats against Bangladesh and India. Their batting has wavered, their bowling has lacked consistency, and their fielding has been short of international standard — a combination that has left them bottom of the eight-team table with little margin for error.
But ahead of their clash with the defending champions, Pakistan’s senior batter Sidra Amin struck a note of quiet defiance.
“I think tomorrow is a big game for us as a team,” she said at the pre-match press conference on Tuesday.

“We are a good batting side, but as batters, we have to spend more time on the wicket so that we can execute our plans and assess the conditions really well.”

Sidra, one of the few bright spots in Pakistan’s otherwise bleak campaign, scored a fighting half-century against India and has been a steadying presence at the top of the order. She admitted that the team’s batting collapses have often been self-inflicted.
“If we look at the bigger picture, we’ve been leaving around five to seven overs — that’s about 42 balls,” she pointed out. “If we tackle things this way, the number of dot balls and the pressure will reduce. As batters, we need to take more responsibility, stay longer on the wicket, and play the maximum number of overs.”
Pakistan’s inability to post a competitive total has been their undoing in both matches so far. They mustered only 160 against Bangladesh and folded for 180 against India, failing to bat their full quota of overs on both occasions. With middle-order batters struggling for fluency and the lower order offering little resistance, the team’s overreliance on Sidra, Fatima, and Muneeba Ali has become glaring.
Even their bowling, traditionally Pakistan’s strength, has been inconsistent. The new-ball pairing of Fatima and Diana Baig has lacked rhythm, and the spinners have struggled for control in conditions that should ideally suit them. Pakistan conceded 18 extras against Bangladesh — a reflection of their discipline woes — though Diana’s four-wicket haul against India hinted at some improvement.
“The discussions are ongoing,” Sidra said when asked about the team’s approach. “Our coach has guided us individually. He can tell us what to do, but as players, how we tackle things is what matters. Everyone knows our team is strong in bowling, and our spinners and attacking bowlers could cause problems for two or three of their batters — that might help us in this game.”
However, even familiarity with the conditions — with Pakistan playing all their matches in Colombo — may not suffice against an Australian side that has looked a cut above.
 
 

“Yes, we have an edge in that sense,” Sidra admitted. “But how the team uses that edge is very important. They’re a very well-prepared side. I heard that when they’re training for Asian conditions, they even set up indoor facilities at 35–40 degrees to simulate the heat. That’s the kind of preparation they do.”
Australia, led by Alyssa Healy, enter the contest as firm favourites. Their campaign so far has been near-flawless, marked by powerful batting displays and disciplined bowling. They remain the only team to have posted a 300-plus total in the tournament — a feat they achieved in their commanding 89-run win over New Zealand in Indore, where Ashleigh Gardner’s century proved decisive.
While some of their big names, including Healy and Beth Mooney, have yet to hit full stride, Australia’s depth has made them nearly invincible. The pace of Annabel Sutherland and the guile of Sophie Molineux have been particularly effective on subcontinental surfaces, while the side’s balance allows them to dominate in all phases of the game.
Their only setback came off the field when their previous match against Sri Lanka was washed out, denying them the chance to go top of the standings. Yet, if anything, the break has left them fresher and more focused.
All-rounder Ellyse Perry, speaking to reporters on the eve of the match, acknowledged both the challenge and respect her side have for their opponents. “Oh, yeah, [Fatima Sana] is an amazing player,” Perry said. “A real talisman, I think, for the Pakistan team. She plays with so much passion and energy — she’s incredibly talented, too. It’s always nice when we get a chance to play against her.”
On the conditions, Perry added: “We obviously got to have a bit of a look at the conditions the other night with the India-Pakistan match. Probably hasn’t changed too much to how we were thinking the other day when we were hoping to play. But we’ve had a chance to prepare pretty well.”</p><small>2025-10-08 04:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08082828e80ccae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947350/imran-bushra-six-others-have-pre-arrest-bail-extended-till-28th' target='_blank'><strong>Imran, Bushra, six others have pre-arrest bail extended till 28th</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka on Tuesday extended the pre-arrest bail of former prime minister Imran Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and six other party leaders till October 28, while issuing a show-cause notice to Adiala Jail authorities for not producing the former prime minister before the court.
During the hearing, the judge expressed displeasure over the jail administration’s failure to ensure the PTI founder’s attendance and directed that he be produced either in person or via video link at the next hearing of the case.
The court also sought a written explanation from the Adiala Jail superintendent and adjourned proceedings till Oct 28.
The court restrained the authorities from arresting the couple in the relevant cases until the next hearing.

Adiala officials get show-cause notice for not producing ex-PM before court; notices issued on plea regarding Imran’s Twitter activity

Meanwhile, Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas of the Islamabad High Court adjourned the hearing of acquittal pleas filed by Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi in the Toshakhana case related to a jewellery set.
During the proceedings, Mr Khan’s counsel Salman Safdar argued that the current case was based on similar charges and witnesses as the earlier Toshakhana case, in which his client’s conviction had already been suspended by a division bench. He contended that multiple investigations by different agencies — the Election Commission, NAB, FIA, and the Kohsar police — on the same allegations amounted to double jeopardy under Section 403 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
Mr Safdar maintained that when an individual voluntarily discloses having received gifts, a corruption case cannot be sustained.
Justice Minhas said any violation of rules or procedures must be determined through proper adjudication and directed the counsel to submit relevant verdicts.
The defence counsel urged the court to restrain the trial court from announcing its verdict in the Toshakhana case, arguing that otherwise the acquittal plea would become meaningless.
The judge said the matter would be examined and adjourned further hearing.
Speaking to reporters outside the Islamabad High Court, Aleema Khan, the sister of the PTI founder, alleged that justice was not being served and that those who had “fabricated” the cases were now themselves in trouble.
She said the PTI founder was under pressure to strike a deal but he had refused, adding that the courts and judges were also facing extraordinary pressures. She said the “truth” behind the cases had become evident.
Imran’s Twitter activity
In another development, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday issued notices to former prime minister Imran Khan and other respondents on a petition seeking the removal of allegedly controversial posts from the PTI founder’s official X (formerly Twitter) account.
The court adjourned hearing till a fortnight. The petition, filed by citizen Ghulam Murtaza Khan through Barrister Zafarullah Khan, contended that the dissemination of “provocative and malicious” content from the account of a convicted prisoner was unlawful and in violation of prison regulations.

• Malaysian varsity confers honorary degree upon Shehbaz
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Malaysia have called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, an end to the blockade, the protection of all civilians, and the unimpeded flow of humanitarian assistance to those affected.
The two sides reiterated these demands during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to Malaysia.
Also on Tuesday, the International Islamic University of Malaysia (IIUM) conferred an honorary PhD degree on PM Shehbaz, in recognition of his leadership and contributions to nation-building.
In his acceptance speech, the PM described the conferment as a “great  privilege and honour,” expressing his delight in being associated with  IIUM, an institution renowned for championing the integration of knowledge, faith and ethics.
According to a joint statement issued at the conclusion of the prime minister’s three-day official visit to Malaysia, both leaders held a meeting on Oct 6 to discuss bilateral ties and exchange views on regio­nal and international issues of mutual interest.
During his meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the two leaders discussed geopolitical issues, particularly the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and the humanitarian situation in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, which affects the Rohingya Muslim community.
Both leaders strongly condemned the ongoing genocide in Gaza and reiterated their unwavering support for the Pales­tinian people’s right to self-determination and the establishment of a sovereign, viable, contiguous and independent Pales­tinian state based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
The two countries commended the international community’s efforts to find pragmatic measures for resolving the qu­­estion of granting  Palestinian statehood. They also agreed to reconvene, at a mutually convenient time, the Joint Commission Meeting at the level of foreign ministers.
 
 

Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful and stable Afgha­nistan and a sustainable future for its people. They emphasised the importance of continued engagement with the interim Afghan authorities, particularly in combating terrorism and preventing the use of Afghan soil against other countries. They also stressed the importance of maintaining humanitarian assistance and capacity building for the Afghan population.
They condemned all forms of Islamophobia, xenophobia and incitement to violence, and reaffirmed their call on the international community to take concerted action to combat intolerance, negative stereotyping, stigmatisation, discrimination and violence against persons based on religion or belief.
Sustainable economic ties
The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to promoting balanced and sustainable economic ties through enhanced market access, business facilitation and the effective utilisation of the Malaysia-Pakistan Closer Economic Partnership Agreement.
Malaysia expressed its intention to expand palm oil exports to Pakistan and agreed to ensure a stable and sustainable supply chain while upholding environmentally responsible practices.

• Qatar questions why Israel hasn’t ceased Gaza operations
• Witkoff-led US delegation to join negotiations today
SHARM EL-SHEIKH/DOHA: On the  second anniversary of Israel’s renewed war on Gaza, Hamas has said it wants to reach a deal to end the violence based on US President Trump’s plan, but it still has a set of demands.
The statement signals that indirect talks with Israel in Egypt could be difficult and lengthy.
Trump, however, expressed optimism on Tuesday about progress toward a  Gaza deal and said a U.S. team had just left to take part in the  negotiations.
“I think there’s a possibility that we could have peace in the  Middle East” beyond just Gaza, he told reporters in the Oval Office.
 
 

Earlier, senior Hamas official Fawzi Barhoum set out Hamas’s position a day after indirect negotiations began in Sharm el-Sheikh.
Hamas sets out conditions
“The (Hamas) movements delegation participating in the current negotiations in Egypt is working to overcome all obstacles to reaching an agreement that meets the aspirations of our people in Gaza,” Barhoum said in a televised statement.
He said a deal must ensure an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip — conditions that Israel has never accepted. Israel, for its part wants Hamas to disarm, something the group rejects.
Hamas wants a permanent, comprehensive ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the immediate start of a comprehensive reconstruction process under the supervision of a Palestinian “national technocratic body”, he said.
Palestinian factions vowed to maintain armed resistance, while Netanyahu stayed silent on the talks. The US is seeking a ceasefire and prisoner deal, but Qatar says key gaps persist as Israel’s Gaza offensive and global protests continue.
In a related development, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty  said that a US delegation led by presidential envoy Steve Witkoff would  join talks aimed at a truce in Gaza and prisoner exchange on Wednesday
In a joint press conference with his German counterpart, Abdelatty said he and Johann Wadephul “had a long conversation with Steve  Witkoff, who is expected in Egypt in the coming hours”.
Gaza strikes
In the latest spate of violence, residents of Khan Younis in southern Gaza and Gaza City in the north reported new attacks by Israeli tanks, planes and boats in the early hours on Tuesday.
Israel and Hamas have endorsed the overall principles behind Trump’s plan, under which fighting would cease, prisoners go free and aid pour into Gaza. It also has backing from Arab and Western states.
Meanwhile, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman said that Israel should have ceased operations in Gaza already in line with US President Trump’s peace plan.
 
 

“Regarding the ceasefire, this question should be directed first to the Israeli occupation government. It was supposed to actually cease fire if the statements made by the prime minister there regarding adherence to the Trump plan were true,” Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha.
After Hamas agreed on Friday to discuss freeing prisoners under Trump’s plan, the US president had called on Israel to cease fire in Gaza, posting on his Truth Social platform: “Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the prisoners out safely and quickly!”.

In an interview with Bloomberg, the governor said any adjustment in the policy rate would depend on the outcome of the IMF negotiations and the economic impact of the recent floods. He added that inflation may temporarily exceed the SBP’s medium-term target range of 5 per cent to 7pc in early 2026 but is expected to remain within the range on average during the current and next fiscal years.
Analysts and independent economists have also ruled out a rate cut, citing the recent rise in inflation and the central bank’s cautious stance, which favours macroeconomic stability over short-term growth. Inflation rose to 5.6pc in September from 3pc in August, partly due to flood-related disruptions.
The SBP’s Monetary Policy Committee kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged in its last meeting, reflecting concern over inflationary pressures despite a generally stable trend since May 2025. During much of this period, inflation had remained subdued, but the central bank opted for caution.

Monetary policy decision hinges on IMF talks, inflation outlook

The World Bank, in a report released on Tuesday, projected Pakistan’s GDP growth at 2.6pc for FY26, reflecting subdued expectations amid structural challenges and ongoing macroeconomic adjustments.
Mr Ahmed told Bloomberg that the SBP had managed to build up its foreign exchange reserves by purchasing around $20bn from the interbank market over the past three years. “This was a carefully planned move. Without these purchases, our position would have been very different,” he said.
Commenting on trade, the SBP chief said Pakistani textile exporters are seeing increased interest from US buyers despite a 19pc tariff on their products. He noted that Pakistan has an opportunity to expand its exports as Indian textile goods face a 50pc tariff in the US. However, he acknowledged that high domestic production costs remain a significant barrier to fully leveraging the shift in global trade dynamics.
Exporters have raised concerns that, despite the apparent opportunity in the US market, the existing 19pc tariff — on top of a 10pc base tariff — makes it difficult for Pakistani goods to remain competitive due to rising input and energy costs. The governor said that while the window of opportunity exists, it would take time and policy support for exporters to benefit from the shifting trade environment fully.

Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Saman Riffat Imtiaz had submitted separate constitutional petitions to the apex court contesting the “unilateral exercise” of administrative powers by the IHC chief justice.
The allocation of numbers by the Registrar’s Office marks a formal step in the judicial process, paving the way for the petitions to be placed before a bench for hearing.
 
 

In his plea, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani described the petition as a “desperate measure of last resort”, stressing that while judges are not meant to become litigants, the circumstances had “compelled us to act in defence of the rule of law”.
The judges expressed concern that the chief justice had transformed his office into a “monocracy”.
The petitions urged the apex court to declare that the IHC chief justice cannot use his administrative authority to “override or undermine judicial powers” of other judges, including through selective constitution of benches, transfer of cases, or exclusion of judges from rosters.
They further sought to nullify the formation of administrative committees and adoption of the IHC Practice and Procedure Rules, arguing these were approved by an “illegally constituted” committee without full-court approval — in violation of Articles 192(1) and 202 of the Constitution.
The judges maintained that such concentration of authority contradicted the Supreme Court’s 2024 judgement, which had effectively set aside the “Master of the Roster” doctrine.
With the petitions now formally numbered by the IHC Registrar’s Office, legal observers say the development signifies a new phase in an unprecedented judicial standoff within the high court’s own ranks.

Railways Minister Ha­nif Abbasi alleged foreign involvement, stating that India was behind the repeated attacks on the Jaffar Express. He affir­med that railway operations would continue desp­ite the incident.
The train was en route from Peshawar to Quetta when the blast occurred at around 8:15am, said Shik­a­rpur Deputy Commis­sioner Shakeel Ahmed Abro while speaking to the media on the scene soon after the incident.
He said there were no fatalities, and the seven injured passengers were promptly transported to Shikarpur Civil Hospital.
The injured included Muh­ammad Shafique, son of Abdul Azziz, a railway official, Muhammad You­nis, Hawaldar Javed, constable Abdul Rahman, con­­­s­table Azhar Jameel, besides two unidentified passengers.
Four of the more seriously injured were later shifted to the military hospital for further treatment.
Later, the deputy commissioner made it clear that all seven injured were in stable condition and that arrangements were being made to safely transport all remaining passengers to their destinations. He also confirmed that repair work on the damaged track was currently underway.
Tuesday’s blast is reportedly the seventh attack on Jaffar Express so far this year, starting with the deadliest episode in March, when terrorists killed 21 passengers after hijacking the train. Since then, the train has been attacked at least six times.
Talking to Dawn, Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi blamed India for the repeated attacks on Jaffar Express. However, he declared that the train’s operation to and from Balochistan would continue despite such cowardly attacks
“The terrorists targeting Jaffar Express again and again are, in fact, proxies of India that is not ready to digest and bear its defeat it faced during operation Bunyan Al Marsoos,” he said. “These incidents are cowardly act of India that is still feeling the pain of wounds it received during the May war,” he added.
In response to a question, Mr Abbasi said this time the terrorists selected the railway track near Shikarpur (Sindh). He said such cowardly attacks could not stop Pakistan Railways to cease the operations of Jaffar Express. “The train will continue operating as per routine, as we will never afraid of such attacks,” he said, adding that the security of the track and train would be tightened further.
He praised “brave drivers, guards and other crew members who continue to perform duties in this train despite such horrible incidents. I also salute our brave passengers who continue to travel by this train, giving a message to the coward terrorists that Pakistani people are a brave and great nation that would never surrender before such proxies. I also salute our armed forces that are endeavoring to eliminate such terrorists for the protection of citizens of Pakistan”.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah condemned the incident and sought an inquiry report from the police chief. He directed the Larkana commissioner to provide best medical assistance to the injured passengers.
Later, Sindh lawmaker Imtiaz Sheikh, along with DC Abro, visited Civil Hospital to inquire after the condition of the injured passengers, including Muhammad Younis and Muhammad Shafique.

The Bank of Punjab topped the list of publicly traded banks in the region with a market capitalisation greater than $100 million, delivering a total return of 176.4 per cent during the quarter.
The Lahore-based bank, with a market cap of approximately $320m as of September 30, outperformed other regional lenders. The Bank of Khyber, based in Peshawar, ranked second with a total return of 108.2pc. Other Pakistani banks among the top 15 performers included National Bank of Pakistan, JS Bank, Askari Bank, and Habib Bank, bringing the total number of Pakistani banks in the top rankings to six.

Six banks feature in the region’s top performers list

Pakistan’s benchmark KSE-100 index also saw notable gains, advancing 11pc in July and 11.4pc in September. Investor sentiment was bolstered by the resolution of a military conflict with India in May, as well as Pakistan’s growing diplomatic ties with the US. The report cited multiple meetings between key Pakistani leaders and President Donald Trump as key factors contributing to improved market confidence.
Indonesia-based banks also performed well, with PT Allo Bank Indonesia Tbk securing third place with a return of 89.2pc. Other Indonesian lenders like PT Bank Mayapada Internasional Tbk, PT Bank Neo Commerce Tbk, and PT Bank Ganesha Tbk were also among the top 15. Three banks from Vietnam, including Vietnam Prosperity Joint Stock Commercial Bank, which had the highest market cap of $9.34bn, also made it to the list.
In contrast, banks from China and India faced challenges. Seven Chinese mid-tier banks, including Bank of Jiujiang Co. Ltd and China Everbright Bank Co. Ltd, were among the worst performers, largely due to margin pressures and weak loan demand. Indian banks, such as Aavas Financiers and Dhanlaxmi Bank, also struggled in the rankings.
The worst-performing bank in the region was PT Bank Nationalnobu Tbk of Indonesia, which recorded a total return of -31.9pc. Bangladesh’s Midland Bank, which had topped the rankings in Q2, fell to the third-worst performer in Q3, with a return of -20.9pc. South Korea’s KakaoBank also faced a decline, with a return of -20.8pc.
While the overall performance of the Asia-Pacific region was mixed, Pakistani banks, particularly those in the public sector, performed strongly, benefitting from a favourable market environment and rising investor confidence.

Addressing a press conference alongside with Dr Babar Awan and other party lawyers, Mr Raja said he had no doubt that the PPP and PML-N spat was merely “friendly firing”, because both parties were beneficiaries of the same system.
 
 

“We will not form a coalition with the PPP, but we will support it if it moves a no-confidence motion against the government. We will cast our votes in favour of the no-confidence motion because it will pave the way for the fresh elections,” he explained.
He said that Imran Khan has been in jail for two years just because he was not ready to compromise on principles.
When asked that why PTI was supporting “outsiders” as candidates for opposition leaders in both houses, Mr Raja chalked it up as a decision taken by Imran Khan, which no one in the the parliamentary party had objected to.
“We were facing the allegation that PTI is alone in the opposition. We want to take all opposition parties along. Both Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Nasir Abbas have been supporting us for three years and we have supported them,” he said.
A day earlier, the PTI nominated Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas as its candidates for the slots of Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly and Senate, respectively. On Tuesday MNA Malik Aamir Dogar claimed that most of the legislators have signed the nomination letters but those who were absent on Monday could not sign. He hoped that the letters will be signed by Thursday and will be submitted on same day.
When asked that why PTI resigned from the chairmanship of standing committees, Mr Raja said that Imran Khan was of the view that PTI will not legitimise the government.
Talking about the arrest of PTI activist Sanam Javed, he said that KP police did not arrest her. “While she was being picked by person in plainclothes, workers informed police officials about it and requested to intervene, but they said that they were helpless”, he added.
He also said that the 26th constitutional amendment was passed to control the judiciary and curb the freedom of expression.
Commenting over speculations that Imran Khan may be shifted to some other place, Babar Awan said that whenever a prisoner was shifted, first that place has to be declared as sub-jail. “We will not accept if Imran Khan would be shifted to some private place”, he added.

• WB official says removing barriers to women’s participation in job market can boost GDP per capita by 20-30pc
ISLAMABAD: The World Bank on Tuesday cut its growth forecast for Pakistan by half a per cent to 2.6 per cent for the current fiscal year due to the recent floods, which are also expected to push up inflation to 7.2 per cent.
“For FY 2025/26, real GDP growth is projected to remain around 2.6pc, as ongoing catastrophic floods have damped the forecast,” the Washington-based lending agency said in its regional economic outlook for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan (MENAAP) region.
The bank had earlier projected a 3.1pc growth rate for the country in its previous biannual outlook in April 2025. Pakistan had set 4.2pc growth target and has since been looking at 3.5pc as part of its IMF engagements.
“Early estimates suggest a drop of at least 10 per cent in agricultural output in Punjab, affecting major crops such as rice, sugarcane, cotton, wheat, and maize,” it said. “For FY 2026/27, growth is expected to accelerate to 3.4pc, supported by higher agricultural output, lower inflation and interest rates, recovering consumer and business confidence, and a rebound in private consumption and investment,” it said.
 
 

Looking ahead, Pakistan, which had historically maintained high tariffs with a complex structure, stands to benefit in terms of exports and growth from a recently approved five-year reform plan (2025–2030) to reduce its tariffs by half, the lender said.
It said the country’s inflation rate dropped to single digits in FY2024-25, as price increases for food and energy eased. However, disruption to food supply chains due to ongoing catastrophic floods is expected to push inflation up through 2027, it said and also anticipated about 1.5pc decline in its global exports.
It said the poverty rate in Pakistan dropped by 9.4 percentage points between 2011 and 2018, the year of the most recent available estimate. However, a combination of economic shocks and natural disasters since 2020 is projected to have stalled this trend of poverty reduction. Furthermore, due to its relatively high poverty rate and large population, the country accounts for a large share of MENAAP’s (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan) poor.
Regional economic outlook
Overall, the economic report pointed to an improved economic outlook for the region, with expected growth reaching 2.8pc in 2025 and 3.3pc in 2026. However, global uncertainty, trade policy shifts, and continued conflict and displacement all pose possible risks.
It said the countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will likely benefit from phasing out voluntary oil production cuts and growth in their non-oil industries while oil-importing countries are also expected to see economic improvements, thanks to private spending and investments as well as a rebound in agriculture and tourism. However, oil-exporting developing countries may see a significant slowdown because of conflict and reduced oil production.
Women’s talents and skills
The report said the countries in the region could improve more lives by tapping into the full potential of their workforce as women’s talents and skills remained significantly underutilised. The data shows that only about one in five women participates in the labour force—the lowest rate in the world—despite significant gains in education and skills.
“I urge bold action—not partial measures,” said Ousmane Dione, vice president for the World Bank’s MENAAP region. “To unlock the full potential of women in the region, we must tackle every barrier to their inclusion with comprehensive measures. A vibrant private sector that creates jobs and transforms aspirations is key to real progress.”
Drawing on analysis that considers household choices, social norms, legal rules, and the role of businesses, the report offers estimates of how much MENAAP economies stand to gain by removing the barriers that prevent women from fully participating in the workforce. No other region stands to benefit more from eliminating these constraints.
“Increasing female labour force participation can translate into immense economic gains,” said Roberta Gatti, chief economist for the region. “Removing barriers that prevent women from accessing jobs could boost GDP per capita by 20 to 30 per cent in economies like Egypt, Jordan, and Pakistan,” she said.
The report said the working-age population in MENAAP was set to grow by over 220 million people by 2050, close to a 40pc rise, the second-largest across all regions.
At the same time, the region is also rapidly approaching a demographic crisis, with declining fertility rates and an aging population.
Pakistan has one of the highest fertility rates in the region, at 3.5. However, its demographic transition is following a similar trajectory as its peers, only delayed, with the fertility rate projected to fall below replacement level within one generation. It said Pakistan was yet to achieve the female enrollment rates prevalent in the rest of the region (outside of conflict-afflicted countries).
Over the past 25 years, countries such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Algeria have made measurable strides in female labour-force participation, although rates remain among the lowest compared to their income peers. Notably, in Saudi Arabia, the participation rate increased by nearly 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2023. In Pakistan, it grew by 8 percentage points between 2000 and 2021.
In Pakistan, two-thirds of college-educated women are out of the labour force, despite having aspirations and job-application rates comparable to those of men. Importantly, marriage proposals often surge right after graduation, limiting the time available to women to search for a job.
The report noted that the United Arab Emirates (19 positive reforms), Saudi Arabia (18), Bahrain (12), Jordan (10), and Pakistan (8) were the top reformers in the region, particularly in areas such as the workplace and pay during the period since 2010.

The new system will be implemented on annual examinations, effective next year.

The FBISE has also changed its old grading system of A, B, C, D and E, replacing them with new performance indicators, besides increasing their range. The old system only had five grades, while the new system envisages 10 such gradations. 
The move follow’s last month’s decision by Inter-Board Coordination Commission (IBCC), Islamabad.
“Revised Grading system stands implemented with effect from the First Annual Examinations 2026 for Secondary School Certificate-I (SSC-I), Higher Secondary School Certificate-I (HSSC-I) level and subsequently with effect from first annual examination 2027 of SSC-II and HSSC-II level,” said a notification issued on Tuesday.
According to the notification, students who get 96pc to 100pc marks will be given an A++ grade, which will categorised as ‘extraordinary’. Similarly, those in the 91pc to 95pc range will get A+ and categorised as ‘exceptional’. Those in the 86pc to 90pc range will get A grades in the ‘outstanding’ category.
Students who secure 81pc to 85pc marks will be awarded the B++ grade, which is considered ‘excellent’; 76pc to 80pc (B+) is considered ‘very good’, while 71pc to 75pc will get a B grade, considered ‘good’.
Similarly, the 61pc to 70pc (C+) range is classified as ‘fairly good’, while students who get 51pc to 60pc will get the C grade and considered ‘above average’. Those scoring 40pc to 50pc marks will be given the D grade, which has been named as the ‘emerging’ category.
An FBISE official said during the said meeting of IBCC, all examination boards of the country had agreed for adopting revised grading system and new passing marks formula, however, it is yet to be seen, whether they will implement it or not.
