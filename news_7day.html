<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/220805317cedd73.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962475/taxation-needs-tech-not-threats' target='_blank'><strong>Taxation needs tech, not threats</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan stands at a pivotal moment in its long, uneven struggle to build a credible tax system. While the government boasts recent improvements in revenue collection, the fiscal reality tells a different story.
Revenues have risen mainly because taxes have been increased repeatedly, not because the system has been reformed or modernised. Expenditure remains bloated, patronage persists, and unproductive spending continues to climb. The result is a tax burden that is rising without a corresponding improvement in public services or state capacity.
Recent public statements by national political leaders and business bodies reflect this growing frustration. Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has argued that Pakistan’s fiscal crisis requires structural reform rather than constantly resorting to heavier taxation. The Pakistan Business Council has warned that repeated tax hikes and coercive enforcement measures are eroding the formal sector.

 

Senior officials associated with the Special Investment Facilitation Council, including Lt Gen Sarfaraz Ahmed, have publicly stressed that high corporate taxes inhibit investment and industrial growth. Yet, nearly all these debates miss the fundamental point: Pakistan’s fiscal crisis is not a revenue problem alone; it is equally a spending problem.

Instead of slimming down the state and cutting wasteful expenditure, the government has taken the politically easier route: ever-increasing taxes

The federal government has been unwilling to reduce its own footprint. Subsidies and grants to members of the national and provincial assemblies continue in various forms. Entire layers of administrative structures remain unreformed. State-owned enterprises drain billions every year.
Instead of slimming down the state and cutting wasteful expenditure, the government has taken the politically easier route: ever-increasing taxes, arbitrary enforcement measures, and pressure on the already compliant segments of the economy. This approach is neither fair nor sustainable.

 

A genuine tax reform agenda must begin with a unified national identity and tax framework. Pakistan already has the basic infrastructure: every citizen possesses a CNIC. The tax number should simply be the same. Once identity is unified, financial institutions — banks, insurers, brokers, funds — should be required to connect their reporting systems directly to this tax identity. At year-end, they should transmit interest, dividend, and profit distribution data automatically to the Federal Board of Revenue.
What was once a formidable task is now much more simple. Modern data systems can now standardise, clean, and verify millions of financial records in real time. Automated pipelines detect missing CNICs, incorrect classifications, duplicate accounts and anomalous patterns within seconds. Many Asian countries already use technology to ensure accurate third-party reporting and to reconcile millions of annual financial transactions. Pakistan has no technical barrier to doing the same.
Identity accuracy is a foundational requirement. Chequebooks, debit cards and other instruments should not be handed over counters; they must be delivered to verified addresses, with any change requiring documentation. This is not bureaucracy for its own sake; it is a frontline defence against benami accounts and untraceable transactions. Banks worldwide use automated address verification, pattern recognition and anomaly detection to catch fake or recycled addresses. Pakistan’s financial sector can adopt these tools without adding friction for legitimate users.
Once identity and financial data are integrated, Pakistan can move to pre-populated tax returns — automatically filled with salary, dividend, and interest income, as well as withholding tax data. The taxpayer’s task would be to review and confirm, eliminating the traditional ‘filing’ process, as is the case in many countries. Technology can classify income, detect omissions, anticipate likely deductions, and prepare ready-to-review drafts for millions of people. This transforms taxation from an ordeal into a routine administrative step.
Digital analytics can also deliver targeted and fair enforcement, replacing the broad, punitive campaigns that have defined Pakistan’s approach for decades. Instead of harassing the entire taxpayer base, automated systems can match lifestyle patterns, banking data, property records and consumption behaviour with declared income. The objective is fairness, not intimidation: to identify clear mismatches while leaving compliant citizens undisturbed.
Maintenance — often a weak point in Pakistan’s public sector — can also be automated. Data quality checks, continuous monitoring, and self-correcting workflows reduce the need for large administrative teams and minimise room for discretion. The system can detect when a bank fails to report a category of income or when data gaps emerge and can flag them instantly, rather than months later.
A fully digital tax regime would drive economic formalisation. When bank accounts, investment accounts, mobile wallets and property records all feed into a unified tax identity, operating outside the formal economy becomes costly. Automated systems can flag discrepancies between declared income and high-value consumption, such as luxury vehicles or overseas travel, ensuring fair contribution from those with significant financial capacity.
None of this is technologically difficult. Pakistan’s banking system is modern, its digital identity backbone is robust, and the cost of automation has fallen. What is missing is the political will to shift from a discretionary, coercive tax administration to an automatic and transparent system.
But even the most advanced digital system will fail if the state refuses to reform itself. A country cannot tax its way out of a fiscal crisis while preserving an oversized and inefficient government. Real reform requires cutting unproductive expenditure, reducing the size of government, rationalising ministries, and eliminating political grants to national and provincial assembly members. Without these steps, tax reforms will only squeeze the same limited base harder.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, December 22nd, 2025</p><small>2025-12-22 03:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962554/iwt-violation' target='_blank'><strong>IWT violation</strong></a><br><p>THE recent disruptions in the Chenab river flow show a clear pattern in which India has repeatedly manipulated its upstream position to exert pressure on Pakistan ever since New Delhi said it would suspend the decades-old water-sharing agreement following April’s Pahalgam attacks in occupied Kashmir. No one should have any doubt: New Delhi is weaponising water, violating not only the Indus Waters Treaty but also international conventions on water-sharing mechanisms between upper and lower riparians.
The abrupt drawdown and refilling of the Baglihar dam, followed by an extraordinary reduction in river flows without prior notice or data sharing, violates the procedural protocol of the treaty, which not only allocates rivers but also mandates predictability, transparency and cooperation through the Permanent Indus Commission. Bypassing this mechanism makes it difficult for Pakistan to plan as we saw this summer when India released floodwaters into the Ravi and Chenab without the timely exchange of information or warning, leading to devastation in Punjab.
The costs of the latest volatility in Chenab flows — just like the flow variations between late April and May — have been significant for farmers whose canal irrigation supplies were disrupted at a critical stage in the wheat season. Millions of acres of land across Punjab have faced reduced or zero water availability, threatening crop yields. This is how uncertainty — because of sudden releases and reductions and delayed data-sharing — changes water into a deadly weapon.

 

The recent Chenab episode also confirms that what had been Islamabad’s worst fear — that dam construction and water storage by India on Pakistani rivers would be used as a weapon — is now a reality. If Pakistan was concerned over the unilateral suspension of the IWT, which survived wars and diplomatic breakdowns between the two neighbours since 1960, it should now be alarmed because the Narendra Modi government in New Delhi does not care about bilateral treaties, or global water conventions, or global opinion.
International organisations, including the World Bank, the UN and the Permanent Court of Arbitration, have supported Pakistan’s position on India’s illegal and arbitrary suspension of the treaty. However, this has not affected the Modi administration’s stance.
The world must exert more pressure on New Delhi to refrain from mixing water with politics and to stop violating the treaty, because breaching the IWT will have serious economic and security consequences not only for the two countries but also for other international transboundary water pacts.
India already has other long-standing sources of instability and conflict with Pakistan; it should not add one more to that list by politicising the Indus, which is Pakistan’s lifeline. The question is whether an obdurate and blinkered dispensation in New Delhi is able to understand the implications.

The official Saudi Press Agency reported that CDF Field Marshal Munir was given the medal in honour of his “distinguished efforts to strengthen the strategic relationship and cooperation between the two nations”.
The report added that the ceremony took place during the Saudi minister’s reception of CDF Field Marshal Munir in Riyadh.
“Prince Khalid congratulated Field Marshal Munir on his appointment as Pakistan’s chief of defence forces, wishing him continued success in his new role,” the report added.
“During the meeting, the two sides reviewed the historical Saudi-Pakistani relations and the strategic cooperation in the defence field, discussing efforts to establish the foundations of international peace and security, as well as issues of common interest,” the publication reported.
Separately, in a post on the social media platform X, the minister said, “Upon the directive of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques [the title held by the Saudi king], I presented Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir with the King Abdulaziz Medal of Excellent Class for his distinguished efforts to enhance our cooperation and advance the Saudi-Pakistani relations.”







According to a report by the Saudi Gazette, the medal has five classes; excellent, first, second, third, and fourth. It is awarded usually to those who have rendered outstanding services to Saudi Arabia or one of its institutions.
Earlier this year, Islamabad and Riyadh had signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
In November, the Saudi armed forces chief had relayed the kingdom’s desire to elevate its defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.
On December 3, Field Marshal Munir had also expressed satisfaction with the “robust defence collaboration” underway between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-12-22 03:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/21165256a9de665.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962446/fcc-affirms-all-other-courts-including-sc-are-constitutionally-mandated-to-adhere-to-its-judgements' target='_blank'><strong>FCC affirms all other courts, including SC, are ‘constitutionally mandated’ to adhere to its judgements</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) has affirmed that all other courts in the country, including the Supreme Court, are required to “adhere” to its judgements.
The observation was made by a two-member FCC bench, comprising Justices Aamer Farooq and Rozi Khan Barrech, as it rejected a plea wherein the petitioner claimed a piece of land that was resumed from his father’s holding in the 1970s.
The order, dated December 18, read: “Article 189 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan stipulates that any decision rendered by the Supreme Court, which resolves a question of law or enunciates a principle of law, is binding upon all other courts within Pakistan, with the exception of the Federal Constitutional Court of Pakistan.
“This exception arises from the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, which establishes that decisions issued by the Federal Constitutional Court are binding on all courts in Pakistan, including the Supreme Court itself. Consequently, all courts in Pakistan are constitutionally mandated to adhere to the judgments of the Federal Constitutional Court.”
Citing Article 190 of the Constitution, the bench also observed that the provision “imposes an obligation on all executive authorities“ to act in accordance with the judgments of the FCC.
“This provision underscores the supremacy of constitutional interpretations rendered by the Federal Constitutional Court, ensuring that such interpretations are uniformly applied across all levels of the judiciary and by executive bodies,” it said.
Detailing the facts of the case under consideration, the order said the holding of Karam Ali, the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioner, had been determined to be 12691.260 Produce Index Unit (PIU) while land equivalent to 4819 PIU “was in excess and was subsequently resumed from his holding in village Karak Muhammada”.
The order added that the petitioner had filed multiple appeals against this decision, and the matter was eventually settled by the Supreme Court in 1986. The SC had rejected Karam Ali’s appeal in its decision back then.
“It is undisputed that the Supreme Court conclusively decided the matter by its order […], and the issue has attained finality. This finality cannot be disturbed or re-adjudicated by any subordinate authority after the lapse of 24 years,” the order read.
Yet, Karam Ali’s son, Riaz Hussain, “by completely concealing the earlier round of litigation”, filed a revision petition with Federal Land Commission in 2010, the order stated.
The FCC bench noted that this “revision petition was accepted by the Federal Land Commission chairperson in Islamabad in clear violation of Article 189 of the Constitution”.
“Since the matter has already been finalised by the Supreme Court, it could not be reopened for adjudication by any lower forum,” the bench observed.
It further stated: “In the present case, the failure of the chairman of the Federal Land Commission to recognise the binding nature of the Supreme Court’s decision […] constitutes a clear violation of Article 189.
“The acceptance of Karam Ali’s revision petition, without disclosing the prior litigation, not only undermines the finality of the Supreme Court’s ruling but also sets a dangerous precedent that could invite further attempts to circumvent established legal principles.”
The order said the actions of the Federal Land Commission chairperson also contravened constitutional mandates outlined in Article 190 and the principle of res judicata, which “dictates that once a matter has been conclusively adjudicated by a competent court, it should not be reopened or relitigated”.</p><small>2025-12-22 02:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22074430c0c9259.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962563/dar-speaks-with-iran-turkiye-fms-on-regional-issues' target='_blank'><strong>Dar speaks with Iran, Turkiye FMs on regional issues</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar and Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi on Sunday reviewed bilateral cooperation across various sectors and exchanged views on the regional developments.

Published in Dawn, December 22nd, 2025</p><small>2025-12-22 02:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22071416c2c2556.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962570/tax-to-gdp-ratio-to-stall-over-five-years-imf-expects' target='_blank'><strong>Tax-to-GDP ratio to stall over five years, IMF expects</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: With a 1.4 percentage-point increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio last year, mostly through additional revenue measures worth Rs2.5 trillion, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) now expects the federal tax contribution to remain stagnant over the next five years and a slight improvement coming from provinces.
The latest IMF estimates suggest Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) receipts rose from 8.9 per cent of GDP in the fiscal year 2023-24 to 10.3pc in 2024-25, but still missed the Fund’s programme target of 10.7pc.
For the current fiscal year, the IMF projects FBR revenue at 11.1pc of GDP, which would then remain flat at that level until FY30.

 

In absolute terms, FBR revenue increased from Rs9.3tr in FY24 to Rs11.74tr in FY25, with a massive shortfall. For the current year, collections are projected at Rs13.98tr, implying a shortfall of Rs328 billion under existing assumptions.
The IMF noted that tax revenue collection in FY25 fell short by Rs1.224tr relative to budget projections and by Rs524bn relative to the lender’s first review target. About Rs850bn of the shortfall relative to the budget reflected faster-than-expected inflation deceleration and lower-than-expected GDP growth in FY25.

Forecasts provincial taxes to offset stagnant federal collections

The inflation deceleration at the end of FY25 led to a revenue shortfall of Rs157bn relative to the first IMF review target. The remaining portion of about Rs380bn was broadly linked to administrative and enforcement challenges that remained unaddressed throughout FY25, chiefly because of prolonged settlement of tax court cases that delayed the recovery of significant revenue amounts.
Overall revenues, including non-tax receipts, rose sharply to 15.9pc of GDP by the end of FY25 from 12.6pc in FY24. The Fund attributed the increase mainly to stronger receipts from the petroleum levy and State Bank profits.
The IMF expects the petroleum levy to remain a key source of revenue, rising from Rs1.02tr in FY24 to more than Rs2.2tr by FY30. It projected the levy’s contribution at about 1.1pc of GDP over the medium term, rising to around 1.2pc in the current and next fiscal years before easing back.
The Fund projected direct taxes to remain unchanged at 5.5pc of GDP through FY30, while the sales tax ratio is expected to hover around its existing level of 3.5-3.6pc of GDP.
It said major contributions are projected to come from provincial taxes on the expectations of successful implementation of the agriculture income tax and sales taxes on services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to increase from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27, rise further to 1.6pc of GDP in FY28 and then stay flat until FY30.
In absolute numbers, the four provinces that collected Rs929bn in FY25 are expected to deliver Rs1.22tr during the current fiscal and further improve their collection to Rs1.77tr in FY27. They would build upon this base to collect Rs2.5tr in FY28, Rs2.8tr in FY29 and cross Rs3.1tr in FY30.
The Fund said projected FBR collections would depend on advancing reforms to raise revenues through tax policy simplification and base broadening, supporting fiscal sustainability and creating space for climate resilience, social protection, human capital development and public investment.
It noted that FBR revenues rose 26pc year-on-year in FY25 to 10.3pc of GDP, a historically high level, but overall tax revenue still fell short of the target by 0.3pc of GDP, largely due to delays in resolving court cases over disputed taxes (0.4pc of GDP) and lower-than-expected inflation. Lower-than-budgeted federal subsidies and grants, estimated at 0.2pc of GDP, helped offset the impact of the revenue shortfall.
The IMF said provinces had begun implementing new agricultural income tax (AIT) regimes, including measures to strengthen compliance and address underreporting.
“However, significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, notably fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities,” the Fund observed, adding that the provinces have also ensured that all services, except for a limited list of exemptions, are subject to GST.
It said the cross-country evidence suggests that countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc, as has been the case for Pakistan over a long time.
In this way, the Fund projected the consolidated fiscal deficit at 5.4pc of GDP in FY25, easing to 4pc this year, before declining to 3.2pc in FY27 and FY28, and then to 2.8pc in FY30.
Published in Dawn, December 22nd, 2025</p><small>2025-12-22 02:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22074007db364fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962584/three-in-race-as-pia-bid-opens-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Three in race as PIA bid opens tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Pri­vatisation Commission is all set to privatise Pak­istan International Air­lines Corporation Ltd (PIAC) on December 23 (Tuesday), as only three bidders remain in the race after the exit of Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd.
According to the programme circulated by the Privatisation Commission on Sunday, bids will be submitted between 10:45am and 11:15am, while bids will be opened at 3:30pm, a process that will be shown live on television networks, as decided by the government.
The three bidders are: a consortium comprising Lucky Cement Limited, Hub Power Holdings Lim­ited, Kohat Cement Com­pany Limited, and Metro Ventures (Private) Limi­ted; a consortium comprising Arif Habib Corporation Limited, Fatima Fertiliser Company Limited, City Schools (Private) Limited, and Lake City Holdings (Private) Limited; and Air Blue (Private) Ltd.
Chairman of the Privatisation Commission and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation, Muhammad Ali, said during a YouTube interview that Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd had decided to quit the bidding process for PIA.
Mr Ali explained that on Tuesday, after submission, the sealed bids will be placed in a transparent box, following which the board of the Privatisation Commission will meet and fix the reference price.
Thereafter, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) will meet and approve the reference price, which will be announced during the opening of the bids.
He further explained that if bids are higher than the reference price, there would be an open auction. However, if the bids are less than the reference price, priority will be given to the highest bidder.
About the next step, the adviser said that the federal cabinet will approve the transaction within days, followed by the signing of the documents which the Privatisation Commission has received from the bidders. After the signing of the documents, the commission will have 90 days to fulfill some procedures, including the transfer of properties, liabilities and leased aircraft.
Transaction structure
As per the transaction structure, the bidding will be on the basis of a 75 per cent stake in PIA. Out of the 75pc bidding amount, 92.5pc will go to PIA instead of the national exchequer, while only 7.5pc will go to the national exchequer.
He said 25pc of PIA shares will remain with the government, which will be a valuable asset. However, the successful bidder will have the option to acquire the remaining 25pc after payment or leave it with the government.
According to Mr Ali, the valuation of the remaining 25pc shares of PIA will take place after the decision on the 75pc stake. The government has given bidders the option to decide whether to pay for the remaining 25pc within 12 months with a 12pc premium.
The bidders will have to take a decision on the 75pc stake on Tuesday, whereas for acquiring the remaining 25pc , they would have to take a decision within 90 days.
He said the bidders had sought to make payment for the 75pc stake over one year; however, the government did not agree to this proposal. If the performance of PIA declines within a year, the bidder would decide against the purchase, and if performance improves, the bidder would decide in favour, which would be unfair to the government, he said.
He said the winning bidder will deposit two-thirds of the bid within 90 days, while the remaining one-third will be deposited within a year.
Mr Ali said the revival of PIA would have an impact on GDP growth and the economy as a whole.
Pakistan has the lowest contribution of the aviation industry to GDP. Compared to 18pc in the UAE and 8.5pc in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan’s aviation sector contributes only 1.3pc to GDP. However, due to the potential in PIA, this percentage would increase considerably, he said.
Of PIA’s 34-aircraft fleet, only 18 aircraft are currently in operation. However, PIA has air service agreements with 97 countries, besides landing rights in over 170 countries.

 

PIA’s current net profit is Rs11 billion, with equity of Rs30bn. He said liabilities of Rs26bn will remain with PIA, and bidders will pay these over five years.
About the employees, he said that under the proposed agreement, no employee can be fired for one year. Employees’ pensions and perks are fully protected, while the pension liabilities of retired employees, including medical benefits and discounted tickets, will be borne by the holding company.
He said that in 2011, PIA had 11,500 employees, which has now reduced to 6,500, a reduction of 5,000 employees over five years.
Mr Ali said PIA is such an asset that if not properly managed, colossal sums of money will be lost; however, if run with proper management, it could generate mammoth earnings. With a country of 250 million people, PIA has customers, destinations, routes and landing slots.
What is required, he said, is investment, the addition of aircraft and efficient management, which the government cannot provide.
The type of decision-making required at PIA can only be undertaken by the private sector, and if the airline is properly managed, PIA could return to its glory days, Mr Ali remarked.

The latest approvals come days after the United Nations said the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank — all of which are illegal under the international law — had reached its highest level since at least 2017.
The Israeli government’s decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69, according to a statement from the office of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
“The proposal by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defence Minister Israel Katz to declare and formalise 19 new settlements in Judea and Samaria has been approved by the cabinet,” the statement said, without specifying when the decision was taken.

Decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69

Smotrich is a vocal proponent of settlement expansion and a settler himself.
“On the ground, we are blocking the establishment of a Palestinian terror state,” he said in the statement.
“We will continue to develop, build, and settle the land of our ancestral heritage, with faith in the justice of our path,” he said.
UN chief condemns move
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel’s “relentless” expansion of settlements in the occupied territory.
It “continues to fuel tensions, impede access by Palestinians to their land and threaten the viability of a fully independent, democratic, contiguous and sovereign Palestinian State”, he said earlier this month.
Since the start of the war in Gaza, calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state have proliferated, with several European countries, Canada and Australia recently moving to formally recognise such a state, drawing rebukes from Israel.
Sharp increase in settlements
A UN report said the expansion of settlements was at its highest point since 2017, when the United Nations began tracking such data.

 

“These figures represent a sharp increase compared to previous years,” Guterres said, noting an average of 12,815 housing units were added annually between 2017 and 2022.
“These developments are further entrenching the unlawful Israeli occupation and violating international law and undermining the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,” the UN chief said.
Excluding east Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank, along with about three million Palestinian residents.
Smotrich’s office said the 19 newly appro­ved settlements are located in what it descr­ibed as “highly strategic” areas, adding that two of them — Ganim and Kadim in the nort­h­ern West Bank — would be re-established after being dismantled two decades ago.
Five of the 19 settlements already existed but had not previously been granted legal status under Israeli law, the statement said.
While all Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory are considered illegal under international law, some wildcat outposts are also illegal in the eyes of the Israeli government.
Many of these, however, are later legalised by Israeli authorities, fuelling fears about the possible annexation of the territory.
US President Donald Trump has warned Israel about annexing the occupied West Bank.
“Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened,” Trump said in a recent interview to Time magazine.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, and violence there has soared since the Gaza war erupted in October 2023.
Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 1,027 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank alone since the start of the fighting in Gaza, according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian health ministry figures. At least 44 Israelis have been killed in the occupied West Bank in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations during the same period, according to Israeli data.

Under the initiative, farmers will be able to apply digitally through the Zarkheze app for financing of up to Rs1 million. After verification and agronomic assessment, applications will be forwarded to the bank chosen by the farmer for processing.
The programme provides that 75 per cent of the financing will be disbursed in kind for the purchase of agricultural inputs through banks’ pre-approved agri-vendors. Farmers will also receive advisory services through the Land Information Management System (LIMS).
Officials said the product was designed not only to provide financing but also to improve productivity by ensuring access to quality inputs and advisory services.
To encourage banks to increase lending to small farmers, the government has offered 10pc first-loss coverage and an operational cost subsidy of Rs10,000 per borrower for the net increase in banks’ outstanding borrowers.
Commenting on the initiative, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said it was part of the government’s push for financial inclusion and rural development, adding that it would support national food security goals.

 

SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad said Zarkheze “is a pivotal step in improving the small farmers’ access to finance”.
He stressed that digitising the credit process would reduce hurdles for small farmers and make formal lending more accessible and timely, while also supporting the goal of promoting digital payments in the rural economy.
PBA Chairman Zafar Masud said the banking industry would continue to work closely with the Ministry of Finance and the SBP to expand outreach and streamline processes for farmers across the country.
“By leveraging advanced technology and innovative credit assessment methods, we aim to improve access to finance for smallholder, particularly landless, farmers operating within a largely undocumented sector,” he added.
The Zarkheze application is available on the Google Play Store. Farmers may also visit their nearest bank branch for assistance with digital onboarding.

The Republican politician, on a visit to Israel, is a staunch ally of US President Donald Trump.
Beginning in October, a fragile ceasefire has so far halted two years of war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip despite both sides trading accusations of truce violations.
A separate ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah also came into effect in November 2024 after more than a year of hostilities, though Israel continues to carry out strikes on Lebanese territory.
Israel has made dismantling the arsenals of both groups, allies of its arch-foe Iran, a key condition for any lasting peace.
“It’s imperative we come up with a plan quickly, put Hamas on a time clock, give them a period of time to achieve the goal of disarmament,” Graham said at a press conference during his visit. “And if you don’t, I would encourage President Trump to unleash Israel to go finish off Hamas.
“It’s a long, brutal war, but you cannot be successful anywhere in the region until you deliver on dealing Hamas out of the future of Gaza and disarming them,” Graham added, insisting that the second stage of the truce would fail if Hamas remains armed.
“Ninety days after the ceasefire, they are consolidating power in Gaza.“
Graham also called for military engagement against Hezbollah if it too does not surrender its weapons.
“If Hezbollah refuses to give up their heavy weapons, down the road we should engage in military operations working with Lebanon, Israel and the United States, where we fly with Israel … to take Hezbollah out,” Graham said.
Opposition to Turkiye
The Lebanese government has begun to disarm Hezbollah, starting in the country’s south, and insists it will complete the plan. Israel, however, has questioned the effectiveness of the Lebanese military, while Hezbollah itself has repeatedly refused to lay down its weapons.
Graham’s remarks came a day after mediators the US, Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye urged both sides in the war on Gaza to uphold the ceasefire.
The mediators are pressing for the implementation of the second phase of the truce, which would involve an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the deployment of an international stabilisation force and the establishment of an interim authority to govern the territory in place of Hamas.
The second phase of the Gaza truce also envisages the demilitarisation of the territory, including the disarmament of Hamas.
Graham backed Israel’s opposition to Turkiye being included in the stabilisation force, saying it would “rock Israel to its core”.
“There is no political support anywhere in Israel for having Turkiye being involved in the stabilising force,” he said.
Hamas, meanwhile, has called on the mediators and Washington to stop Israeli violations of the ceasefire in Gaza.
On Sunday, Israeli artillery shelling was reported in several parts of Gaza’s southern area of Khan Yunis, according to the civil defence agency, which operates under the authority of Hamas.
On Friday, six people, including two children, were killed in an Israeli bombing of a school serving as a shelter for displaced people, according to the agency.</p><small>2025-12-21 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2123180470e5f3b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962455/kp-cm-announces-preparations-for-countrywide-movement-as-ttap-issues-feb-8-strike-call' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM announces preparations for countrywide movement as TTAP issues Feb 8 strike call</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: As Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi announced preparations for a countrywide movement and that a call will soon be given, the main opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Sunday announced a nationwide wheel-jam and shutter-down strike on February 8, 2026.
The date coincides with the second anniversary of the 2024 general elections, in which the current PML-N government rose to power.
Claiming that the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before, the TTAP also decided to form a committee headed by Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, with Haleem Adil Sheikh, Zain Shah and others to constitute committees at the provincial and district level.
The TTAP announced that it will also organise conferences at all provincial headquarters and engage bar councils, civil society and the public for efforts for the restoration of the Constitution, rule of law and democracy in Pakistan.







Those who attended today’s conference included TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, PTI leaders Asad Qaiser and Salman Akram Raja, Balochistan National Party (BNP) chief Akhtar Mengal and others.
CM Afridi, who also attended the conference, told media persons that, as per the directions of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, the preparations for the countrywide movement have been started.
“We will meet every person and will tell them to wait for the second call. We will go to Rawalpindi, Lahore, KP and other parts of the country,” he said while replying to questions.
According to the declaration from the conference, as democracy was not possible without free and fair elections, an effort would be made to ensure free and fair elections.







Participants demanded the immediate appointment of a neutral chief election commissioner and next elections be held under a reconstituted Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
They also demanded an independent investigation into the February 8 elections and to identify and punish “responsible personalities”.
Participants were of the view that the judiciary was dismantled through the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments and alleged that conscientious judges, including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Athar Minallah, and Lahore High Court Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza, were forced to leave the institution, with arrangements made to sideline the remaining judges.
They further alleged that most recently, action was taken against Islamabad High Court Judge Justice Tariq Jahangiri, who was removed from his office over a fake degree. The conference claimed that these officials demanded to restore the judiciary in accordance with the original 1973 Constitution.
The conference also condemned the convictions against the PTI founder and his wife and the “inhumane treatment” of Imran’s sisters, including “their being attacked by water cannons.”
Additionally, the participants demanded the release of prisoners, including Imran, his wife Bushra Bibi and PTI leaders Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Ejaz Chaudhry, Yasmin Rashid and Sarfraz Cheema, among others.







TTAP also condemned the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), alleging that it was passed to curtail media freedom, additionally showing concerns over the economic strangulation of Dawn Media Group.
Moreover, the participants expressed complete solidarity with journalists who “lost their jobs under the system” and denounced the narcotics case against journalist Matiullah Jan. The cases registered against lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatha, were also condemned.







The opposition was also of the view that statements and reports regarding the deployment of Pakistan’s armed forces in Gaza reflected “alarming non-transparency”. They demanded that the nation be taken into confidence before any decision was made.
The conference additionally cited the World Bank, claiming that over 44 per cent of Pakistan’s population lived below the poverty line, while the International Monetary  Fund (IMF) reports indicated corruption amounting to Rs 5,300 billion. They assailed the government for failing to curb unemployment, inflation, and poverty and lacked a roadmap for relief.







The TTAP also expressed concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in Sindh and Balochistan and demanded the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other Baloch detainees.
The opposition alliance demanded the implementation of unanimous resolutions passed by the KP Assembly Jirga and the release of outstanding federal dues to the province. It also called for lifting the ban on the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement.
They said under the 18th Amendment, minerals belonged to the provinces and that entering into international mining agreements without taking provincial governments and local populations into confidence violated it.
The TTAP also demanded the immediate restoration of student unions across the country.
In view of the ongoing national crisis, the conference unanimously agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.</p><small>2025-12-21 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/212127575821d90.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962453/new-rules-for-punjab-kite-flying-law-notified-as-bill-set-to-hit-assembly-floor-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>New rules for Punjab kite flying law notified as bill set to hit assembly floor tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government has notified rules for the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025, but has yet to decide the scale of kite flying in Lahore as well as other districts across the province.
It has also yet to formally notify the announced dates of a three-day Basant festival from February 6, 2026, in Lahore and elsewhere.
With the notification of rules for the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, the Punjab Assembly is expected to take up “The Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025” for approval in its sitting on Monday.
“The Punjab government is currently holding meetings to decide the scale of the three-day Basant festival, ranging from allowing kite flying activities across Lahore, or in some specified grounds or specified rooftops, including known rooftops inside the Walled City,” a source in the Punjab home department told Dawn on Sunday.
Sources also say the Punjab government has yet to formally notify the announced basant dates in Lahore.
The Punjab government instructed all deputy commissioners in the province to register kite and string manufacturers, traders or sellers and inform the government when they would be ready to hold the Basant festival in their respective districts.
“While the Basant festival was actively celebrated in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and other districts, the respective DCs (deputy commissioners) will formally inform the Punjab government whether they will hold the Basant festival on the Punjab government’s announced dates or another,” the sources privy to developments told Dawn.
Under the leadership of the then-chief minister, Shehbaz Sharif, Punjab had banned the Basant festival in 2007 following an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused to motorcyclists by prohibited and sharp kite strings.

 

The Punjab government is now making efforts to revive the festival, on the recommendation of PML-N chief and former premier Nawaz Sharif, following meetings with stakeholders.
Kite flying is currently banned across the province and will be allowed only on specific days and designated locations across the province after the passage of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.
Under the bill, flying kites with metallic wires, nylon cord or strings coated with glass or other sharp materials is prohibited, along with the manufacturing, transport, storage and sale of kites and hazardous strings.
Violators involved in kite-flying could face three to five years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs2 million, while those manufacturing or selling banned materials may be punished with five to seven years in jail and fines up to Rs5m.
The bill empowers deputy commissioners to allow “permissible kite-flying” on specific days and at designated locations, subject to government approval and strict conditions. However, the use of sharp or metallic strings will remain banned under all circumstances.
New rules
Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules, 2025, manufacturers, traders or sellers of authorised kite flying material must apply to the DC and provide specified documents.
Kite flying associations can also register themselves with the DCs concerned through an online application by the association president or general secretary.
The DCs must verify the contents of applications and documents within 10 days of receiving them. Upon verification, the DC shall decide the application and issue a certificate of registration having a one-year validity. According to the rules, manufacturing, trading, transporting, selling or using a string coated with sharp materials is prohibited.



The notified rules also proposed an annual non-refundable registration fee structure, explaining that the government will charge Rs1,000 each to register manufacturers, traders and sellers, while they will charge Rs5,000 to register a kite flying association.
Specifications for permitted kites were also shared. A ‘patang’ shall not exceed 35 inches in width and 30 inches in length, while a ‘gudda’ cannot exceed 40 inches in width and 34 inches in length.
‘Dor’ (string) must be made of cotton with not more than nine threads and no less than 28 counts. The string must be wound in the shape of a ball, since spools are prohibited.
Last July, a 13-year-old boy was electrocuted while catching a stray kite in Kasur’s Basti Lal Shah area.
The boy rushed to catch a stray kite attached to a metal string. The metal string fell on the transmission line before he caught it.
In March last year, a motorcyclist died after a metal string, believed to be part of a stray kite, cut his throat in Faisalabad. Following the incident, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz ordered a crackdown on those involved in kite-flying.
The provincial government intensified its crackdown on kite-flying by declaring kite-making, flying, and transportation as non-bailable offences in August 2024.</p><small>2025-12-21 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2119131070b32cb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962449/politicians-and-ex-players-hail-pakistans-u-19-asia-cup-victory' target='_blank'><strong>Politicians and ex-players hail Pakistan’s U-19 Asia Cup victory</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan produced a dominant all-round performance to thrash arch-rivals India by a massive 191 runs in the final of the U-19 Asia Cup at the ICC Academy Ground on Sunday, claiming the prestigious title in emphatic fashion.
The victory marked a sweet redemption for Pakistan, who had suffered a heavy defeat to the same opponents in the group stage and had entered the final as underdogs against an unbeaten Indian side.
Praise and congratulatory messages poured in on social media as former players, politicians and other public figures celebrated the victory.
Applause continues to spur
President Asif Ali Zardari applauded the victory of Pakistan in the U-19 Asia Cup finals as “a proud moment for the nation”.
According to a statement, Zardari congratulated the team for their “impressive victory” against India in the finals, which showed young players’ “dedication and resolve”.







He appreciated the whole team, including the captain, coaches, support staff and PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also praised the “electrifying performance” by the Pakistan U-19 cricket team.







“Heartiest congratulations to our Under-19 team on winning the ACC U-19 Asia Cup 2025, defeating India in the final,” said PM. “The nation is proud of you.”
He also expressed his “deep” appreciation for the PCB Chairman Naqvi and his team for their “dedicated efforts”.
Naqvi also took to X and shared a message to appreciate the team.
“What a show! Proud to be handing over the ACC U19 Cup to our brilliant Pakistan U19 team. Fearless cricket, unmatched spirit, and a performance to remember,” he wrote.
“Special mention for Sameer—calm under pressure and outstanding on the big stage. This team makes the nation proud, and the future of Pakistan cricket shine bright.”







Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti termed Pakistan’s victory over India as “memorable”.
“You’ve made the nation proud, keep shining!” he lauded.







Jamaat-i-Islami leader Hafiz Naeemur Rehman extended felicitations to the Pakistan team.
He praised the performance by youngster Sameer Minhas, who scored 172 runs, as “unparalleled”.
“Fast bowler Ali Raza will be a future star,” Naeem wrote.







He also gave a special mention to team manager, Sarfaraz Ahmed, saying that Pakistan has “achieved another milestone under his headship”.
Former captain Wasim Akram also hailed Pakistan’s triumph in the finals as “Champions of Asia!
“Ali Raza’s fiery bowling set the tone, and Minhas’ magnificent 150 sealed the deal.







“Future stars shining bright—well played, boys!” Akram said.
Former wicket-keeper and captain Rashid Latif also congratulated Pakistan’s team.
“Sameer Minhas has performed exceptionally well throughout the tournament. Ali Raza, Subhan, and Sayyam showcased impressive bowling, particularly in the final, where they knocked out the Indian under-19 team,” Latif wrote.







He argued, “Ali Raza should have been tested in the last tri-series held in Pakistan,” but as he will be busy until the Under-19 World Cup, he added that “it’s not appropriate to give him a chance right now.“
Latif maintained that T20 has become very prevalent, and in adapting to it, “England and India are now playing every format like T20 from the start, which is harming their grassroots cricket.“
The former captain appreciated the whole team management, including Sarfaraz Ahmed, Shahid Anwar, Mansoor Amjad, and Rao Iftikhar.
“However, we should not forget Azhar Ali, who worked with this team for a considerable time,” he wrote.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On 19 December 2025, nine khwarij belonging to Indian proxy fitna al khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It added that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists in the Dera Ismail Khan district of the province.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, four khwarij were sent to hell.”
Per the statement, the second IBO was conducted in the Bannu district. “In ensuing fire exchange, five more khwarij were effectively neutralised by the security forces.”
The ISPR said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain terrorists, who had remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, law enforcement agencies, and the target killing of innocent civilians.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as a relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” it said.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.
Last week, security forces had killed 13 terrorists in two operations in Mohmand and Bannu districts of the province.</p><small>2025-12-21 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/21194420712b075.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962450/man-allegedly-guns-down-wife-three-others-in-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>Man allegedly guns down wife, three others in Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: A family dispute in the Township area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district turned violent when a man allegedly opened fire inside a house, killing his wife, two women and a 14-year-old boy, leaving another boy injured, according to a first information report (FIR).
The FIR, registered with Township police station on December 21, said the injured boy, 17, was immediately moved to Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital for medical treatment. The suspect was identified as a resident of Bizan Khel and fled the scene after the incident.
It added that a case was registered under Sections 302 (murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of one of the victim’s relatives.
The bodies were sent for a post-mortem examination, while police have launched raids to arrest the accused.
“Further investigation into the incident is underway,” Township police said in a statement.
Last week, Lahore police made a breakthrough in the kidnap case of the wife and 19-year-old daughter of a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) when the investigation found that he himself was the killer of both women.
DSP Usman Haider Gujjar was the head of the Kahna police circle (investigation) when he registered the case about two months ago, saying that his wife and daughter were missing and they had most probably been kidnapped.</p><small>2025-12-21 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/21164057812181d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962444/law-minister-tarar-stresses-need-for-national-dialogue-highlights-significance-of-political-and-economic-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Law minister Tarar stresses need for ‘national dialogue’, highlights significance of political and economic stability</strong></a><br><p>Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar stressed on Sunday the need for a national dialogue, saying Pakistan required political and economic stability as the country remains mired in political clashes between the government and the opposition.
“Politics is the name of a continuous process,“ he said, as he addressed a seminar in Lahore. “No country or nation can progress amid political and economic instability.”
The relationship between the government and the opposition has come under additional strain in recent weeks, especially after the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan as a “national security threat”, triggering a strong reaction.
Moreover, Imran, who is already facing a slew of legal cases, was once again sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment in the Toshakhana 2 case on Saturday, making his release uncertain.
The law minister stated that the country had witnessed cultures of tolerance as well as violence, emphasising that it was the duty of politicians to “balance out” these tendencies and pave a way through “dialogue”.
He emphasised that all politicians must play their role in preventing violence and extremism from paving the way into politics.
“We feel the need for a national dialogue, only for the sake of our beloved country.“
Emphasising restraint and respect for dissent, he called for “listening to opponents, embracing positive criticism, and forging a national political charter to ensure stability”.
Meanwhile, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) – the grand opposition alliance headed by Mahmood Khan Achakzai – is currently holding a two-day national conference in Islamabad.
The alliance had also called for a national dialogue in all parties’ conference in August, calling for a new charter of democracy between all political stakeholders.
“The parties participating in the TTAP and its All-Party Conference (APC) agreed that at this time there is an urgent need for a new democratic charter among all political parties and political forces,” they said.
National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had also shown his willingness to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties. However, there has been no formal initiation of the dialogue between the government and the opposition since last year.
PM’s advisor warns against ‘confrontation and violence’
Speaking at the same event, the Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said political stability can only be achieved through “restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue.”
He warned that “confrontation and violence” had repeatedly derailed Pakistan’s democratic course.
“No nation can progress through fighting, chaos and disorder,” adding that attacks on defence installations were “gravely wrong” and unacceptable.
He argued that political instability emerges when parties abandon dialogue for confrontation, stressing that the government has repeatedly offered talks.
“Tell us — who is refusing dialogue? If it is us, we will correct ourselves; if it is someone else, name them,” he said.
Rejecting claims that the general elections were selectively fair or unfair, Sanaullah recalled that even in 2018, the opposition alleged mandate theft, yet extended an offer to work together in parliament — an offer that was rebuffed with threats of imprisonment by Imran.
“If elections are disputed, political parties — not the establishment — must decide the way forward. Political stability is essential for national progress.”
Sanaullah also cited overtures made before the passage of this year’s budget, saying Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly invited the opposition for talks, including in the presence of the military leadership, proposing a ‘Charter of Pakistan’.
“Who is declining political dialogue?” he asked again, urging clarity to remove ambiguities blocking stability.
The former interior minister said, noting that while second-tier leadership within the PTI favours dialogue, fear of backlash from within the party’s ranks had stifled it.
Saad Rafique calls for Charters of Democracy and Economy
Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique called for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, warning against inter-provincial polarisation and repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote.
Rafique underscored that confrontation and chaos cannot strengthen the state, warning that repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote had eroded public trust.
Calling for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, he urged “engagement with all constitutional forces and dialogue with institutions to reduce political pressure and restore stability”.</p><small>2025-12-21 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2117541484f0818.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962431/current-levels-of-bilateral-trade-do-not-reflect-the-true-potential-of-pakistan-iraq-relations-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Current levels of bilateral trade do not reflect the true potential of Pakistan-Iraq relations: President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari met Iraqi President Dr Abdul Latif Jamal Rashid at Baghdad Palace on Sunday, a statement from the Presidency said.
The president, who is expected to meet senior Iraqi leadership during the trip, arrived in Iraq on Saturday night, where he was received by Iraq’s Culture Minister, Ahmed Fakkak Al-Badrani, upon his arrival in Baghdad.
According to the statement, President Zardari received a guard of honour upon his arrival at the palace, where he was scheduled to have lunch and a one-on-meeting with his Iraqi opposite number. The pair expressed satisfaction over growing diplomatic momentum from high-level exchanges.







“The president noted that current levels of bilateral trade do not reflect the true potential of Pakistan-Iraq economic, cultural and security relations,” the statement read.
“He highlighted opportunities for expanding trade, investment, agriculture and defence production sectors, besides information technology, construction, pharmaceuticals and related industries.”
President Zardari underscored the importance of business-to-business engagement, reciprocal business delegations and the establishment of direct banking channels to facilitate trade and commercial activity, the Presidency stated.
During the meeting, President Zardari also requested improved facilitation for Pakistani pilgrims visiting Iraq and was hopeful that the proposed memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Zaireen management would be finalised and implemented soon.
It aims to ensure orderly travel and address longstanding issues related to religious visits, the Presidency added.







“The president also expressed his firm resolve to work with [the] Iraqi government to stop [the] illegal entry and overstay of those Pakistanis who violate Iraqi law,” the statement added. “Both presidents [also] expressed their resolve to fight extremism, terrorism and narco trade and enhance bilateral cooperation.”
Additionally, President Zardari congratulated the Iraqi leadership and people on the successful conduct of the parliamentary elections and expressed his best wishes for the smooth formation of the new government.
“He reaffirmed Pakistan’s firm support for Iraq’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity and reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to Iraq’s stability, prosperity and democratic progress,” the statement read.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to further deepening bilateral cooperation across political, economic and social domains and agreed to maintain close coordination at regional and multilateral fora, including the United Nations and the OIC, on issues of mutual interest,” it added.
[The] Iraqi President appreciated Pakistan’s role in uniting [the] Islamic Ummah and the historical support to the people of Palestine.“







Separately, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Muhammad Mudassir Tipu posted on X that while en route from Islamabad to Baghdad, Zardari “conveyed a goodwill message to the Iranian leadership“ as his aircraft entered Iranian airspace.
“It reaffirmed solidarity with Iran, emphasising mutual respect and stronger relations between the two historic neighbours,” Tipu said.
He added: “ The president’s message coincides with the Iranian nation celebrating Yalda Night tomorrow — a civilisational tradition that brings hope, joy, and compassion amongst people and families. The spirit of Yalda Night defines our bilateral, social, and cultural affinities as well.”
Previously, the Foreign Office had said in a statement that President Zardari would undertake an official visit to Iraq from December 20-24.
According to the statement, he was invited for the visit by his Iraqi counterpart, Abdul Latif Jamal Rashid.
It said that during his meetings with the Iraqi leadership, President Zardari would review bilateral relations between the two countries and explore ways to further strengthen cooperation across key areas of mutual interest, including trade and investment, energy, reconstruction, manpower, technology, education and people-to-people exchanges.
The discussions would also cover regional and international developments, as well as cooperation at multilateral forums.
“The visit is expected to reinforce the traditionally warm and cordial ties between the two countries, identify new avenues of partnership, and enhance people-to-people linkages, particularly in the context of religious tourism and economic collaboration,“ it said.</p><small>2025-12-21 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2117031152bfdd5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962447/eu-welcomes-pakistans-progress-on-implementing-27-conventions-under-gsp-programme' target='_blank'><strong>EU welcomes Pakistan’s progress on implementing 27 conventions under GSP+ programme</strong></a><br><p>The European Union (EU) has welcomed Pakistan’s progress towards implementing 27 international conventions under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) framework, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.
According to the EU, GSP+ status is a special incentive awarded to developing countries to “pursue sustainable development and good governance” in exchange for cutting import duties to zero on two-thirds of the tariff lines of its exports.
Governments with this status need to implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, good governance and the environment.
According to Saturday’s statement, the FO noted that the 15th Pakistan-EU Joint Commission meeting was held in Brussels on December 17 and that cooperation between Islamabad and the bloc in several different fields was discussed.
The meeting “reviewed Pakistan’s progress on the implementation of the 27 international conventions as required under the GSP+ framework,” the statement read, adding that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar attended the meeting of the Sub-Group on Democracy, Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights on December 1.
“The EU welcomed progress made in bringing Pakistan’s application of the death penalty in line with international standards and encouraged further steps in this regard. It also recognised important first steps against torture, as well as the creation of a Commission on Minorities.”







However, the FO noted that the EU encouraged Pakistan to take further short-term steps ahead of the upcoming GSP+ Monitoring Report, which will scrutinise Pakistan’s progress.
The EU also “reiterated the need for further reforms in the medium and long term”.
“The EU and Pakistan notably exchanged views on freedom of expression and media, enforced disappearances, the independence of the judiciary, freedom of religion or belief, anti-Muslim hatred [and] the rights of persons belonging to minorities and vulnerable groups,” the statement read.
“Both sides underlined the importance of proportionality and appropriate safeguards and the need to continue dialogue on these concerns.”
Pakistan updated the EU on progress under the National Action Plan on Human Rights and the National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights, additionally outlining the actions of various national institutions in charge of promoting and protecting human rights across the country.
“The EU reiterated its commitment to supporting Pakistan’s efforts to guarantee the protection of all human rights, including women and children’s rights, minorities’ rights, labour and migrant rights, as well as fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression and opinion, including [the] growing problem of disinformation,” The FO stated.
GSP+ status was granted to Pakistan by the EU in 2014, resulting in a 108 per cent increase in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs.
In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan.
According to the EU’s GSP Convention Compliance Database, Pakistan has ratified 27 international conventions, most recently ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1976) and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1987) in 2010.
Regarding the EU’s monitoring of Pakistan, the body prioritised 13 key areas, including enforced disappearances, torture prevention, and freedom of expression and belief and minority rights.
In November, EU Ambassador to Pakistan Raimundas Karoblis said that the country needed to “do more” in terms of fulfilling its commitments under the GSP+ ahead of a review.
In an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’, the EU ambassador was asked about whether Pakistan needed to do more to fulfil the requirements of the scheme, to which he said: “Yes, we are saying that. We are saying that it should be, well, needs to be, to do more.”
He said it would be a periodic monitoring mission that would assess the implementation of all necessary United Nations conventions for the scheme’s application.</p><small>2025-12-21 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/211426295b05440.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962442/pakistan-rout-india-to-clinch-u-19-asia-cup-title-as-sameer-minhas-and-ali-raza-star' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rout India to clinch U-19 Asia Cup title as Sameer Minhas and Ali Raza star</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan produced a dominant all-round performance to thrash arch-rivals India by a massive 191 runs in the final of the U-19 Asia Cup at the ICC Academy Ground on Sunday, claiming the prestigious title in emphatic fashion.
Opener Sameer Minhas lit up the first half of the match with a record-breaking 172 — the highest individual score in a U-19 Asia Cup final — propelling Pakistan to a formidable 347 for 8 after being asked to bat first.
In reply, India’s much-vaunted batting line-up crumbled spectacularly, folding for a paltry 156 in just 26.2 overs as pacer Ali Raza ripped through the order with figures of 4 for 42.
The victory marked a sweet redemption for Pakistan, who had suffered a heavy defeat to the same opponents in the group stage and had entered the final as underdogs against an unbeaten Indian side.
Instead, it was Pakistan who delivered a clinical display, overwhelming India in every department to lift the trophy amid jubilant celebrations.
India captain Ayush Mhatre won the toss and elected to bowl, perhaps hoping to restrict Pakistan on a surface expected to assist the seamers early on.
However, the decision backfired spectacularly as Sameer launched a brutal assault from the outset. After Hamza Zahoor fell early for 18, Sameer combined with Usman Khan (35) and Ahmed Hussain (56) in substantial partnerships — 92 for the second wicket and 137 for the third — to put Pakistan in complete command.
The right-hander brought up his century off 71 balls and raced to 172 off 113 deliveries, studded with 17 fours and nine sixes, before falling to a slower ball from Deepesh Devendran in the 43rd over.
A late flurry of wickets — five falling for 45 runs in the final overs — prevented Pakistan from reaching 400, but their total remained the highest ever posted in a U-19 Asia Cup final.
Khilan Patel was the pick of India’s bowlers with 2 for 44, while Devendran claimed 3 for 83.
Chasing 348, India started explosively, racing to 21 in the first over off Ali Raza, with Vaibhav Suryavanshi smashing a six and four in an over that also included a no-ball and extras.
Suryavanshi continued the onslaught, striking three sixes and a four in his blistering 26 off 10 balls.
But the introduction of spin and disciplined pace turned the tide irreversibly.
Captain Mhatre (2) holed out to mid-off, Aaron George (16 off 9) miscued a pull, and Suryavanshi nicked behind — all falling to Raza and Mohammad Sayyam as India slipped to 49 for 3 in the fifth over.
The collapse deepened. Vihaan Malhotra (7) was bowled attempting a rash pull off Abdul Subhan,
Vedant Trivedi (9) found short midwicket, and Abhigyan Kundu (13) upper-cut to deep third. Kanishk Chouhan (9) and Khilan Patel (19) offered brief resistance, but regular strikes kept India on the back foot.
Lower down, Deepesh Devendran provided late entertainment with a quickfire 36 off 16 balls, including six fours and two sixes, but his dismissal — skying one to point off Raza — ended any lingering hopes.
Subhan (2-29) and off-spinner Huzaifa Ahsan (2-12) chipped in effectively, while Sayyam supported with 2 for 38.
India’s innings lasted a mere 26.2 overs, underscoring Pakistan’s bowling dominance and fielding sharpness after the break.
The margin of victory was the largest in a U-19 Asia Cup final, completing a comprehensive rout.
Man of the Match Sameer was hoisted onto his team-mates’ shoulders as Pakistan celebrated wildly, while India, unbeaten until the final, were left to rue a day when nothing went right.</p><small>2025-12-21 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/21150708d62c34b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962445/australia-honours-bondi-beach-attack-victims-pm-albanese-booed' target='_blank'><strong>Australia honours Bondi Beach attack victims; PM Albanese booed</strong></a><br><p>Australia honoured the victims on Sunday of a gun attack a week earlier on a seaside Hanukkah celebration, as the prime minister announced a review of the country’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
The nation marked a day of reflection to honour the 15 people killed and the dozens wounded in the attack by two gunmen at Sydney’s Bondi Beach. With security tight and flags at half-staff on government buildings, a minute of silence was held at 6:47pm (12:47pm PKT), the time the attack began.
Television and radio networks paused for a minute’s silence.
Tens of thousands, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and other leaders, attended a memorial event at Bondi Beach under a heavy police presence, including snipers on rooftops and police boats in the waters.
Albanese was booed by the crowd on arrival and later when the speaker mentioned his name during the memorial. He sat in the front row wearing a kippah, the traditional Jewish cap.
Albanese, under pressure from critics who say his centre-left government has not done enough to curb a surge in antisemitism since the start of the war in Gaza, was not scheduled to speak at the event.
“We have lost our innocence….last week took our innocence,” David Ossip, the president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, said in a speech to start the proceedings.
“Like the grass here at Bondi was stained with blood, so, too, has our nation been stained. We have landed up in a dark place. But friends, Hanukkah teaches us that light can illuminate even the bleakest of places. A single act of courage, a single flame of hope, can give us direction and point the path forward.”
Also present at the memorial was the father of Ahmed al Ahmed, hailed as the ‘Bondi Hero’ for wrestling a gun from one of the attackers.
“Ahmed has asked me to pass on the following message to us all: ‘The Lord is close to the broken-hearted. Today I stand with you, my brothers and sisters’,” Ossip said.
Authorities invited Australians to light a candle on Sunday evening, the start of the eighth and final day of the Jewish festival of lights, “as a quiet act of remembrance with family, friends or loved ones” of the victims of the attack.
Attack exposed gaps in intelligence sharing
The government said it had consistently denounced antisemitism over the last two years and passed legislation to criminalise hate speech. It expelled the Iranian ambassador after accusing Tehran of directing two antisemitic arson attacks.
Albanese said the review, to be led by a former chief of Australia’s spy agency, would probe whether federal police and intelligence agencies have the “right powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements in place to keep Australians safe”.
The attack exposed gaps in gun-license assessments and information-sharing between agencies that policymakers have said they want to plug. Albanese has announced a nationwide gun buyback, while gun safety experts say the nation’s gun laws, among the world’s toughest, are riddled with loopholes.
Authorities are investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism targeting Jews. Patrols and policing across the country have been ramped up to prevent further antisemitic violence. Authorities believe the gunmen were inspired by the militant group Islamic State.
“The ISIS-inspired atrocity last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation. Our security agencies must be in the best position to respond,” Albanese said in a statement, adding that the review would conclude by the end of April.
He has also vowed to strengthen hate laws in the wake of the attack.
The Bondi Beach attack was the most serious of a string of antisemitic incidents in Australia, which have included attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars, since Israel launched the war in October 2023, in response to an attack by Hamas.
Albanese condemned anti-immigration rallies being held in Sydney and Melbourne on Sunday.
“There are organised rallies seeking to sow division in the aftermath of last Sunday’s antisemitic terrorist attack, and they have no place in Australia,” he said in a statement. “They should not go ahead, and people should not attend them.”
Only about 50 people were at the Sydney rally by mid-afternoon, according to a Reuters witness.
On Saturday, the government of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, pledged to introduce a bill on Monday to ban the display of symbols and flags of “terrorist organisations”, including those of Islamic State, Hamas, al-Qaeda, Al Shabaab, Boko Haram and Hezbollah.
Authorities say Islamic State flags were found in the car the alleged attackers took to Bondi.
Alleged gunman Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene. His 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram, who was also shot by police and emerged from a coma on Tuesday, has been charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, according to police. He remains in custody in the hospital.</p><small>2025-12-21 11:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/21134006bd2af58.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962443/ttp-formations-infiltrating-into-pakistan-mostly-comprise-afghans-cdf-field-marshal-asim-munir' target='_blank'><strong>TTP formations infiltrating into Pakistan mostly comprise Afghans: CDF Field Marshal Asim Munir</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir has said that formations of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) infiltrating into Pakistan mostly comprised Afghans.
“In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said.
The defence forces’ chief made this statement at the National Ulema Conference held in Islamabad on December 10. However, details of the Field Marshal’s address at the conference were scant thus far and clips of his speech from the event were broadcast on television today.







Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to put an end to the use of Afghan soil by terrorists for carrying out attacks in Pakistan. Kabul, however, denies the allegation.
Turning his attention to the matter at the conference, CDF Munir questioned: “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?”
He recalled that the Afghan Taliban had been told to choose between Pakistan and the TTP.
Speaking about the four-day May conflict with India, he said in Pakistan’s retaliatory operation during the confrontation, Bunyanum Marsoos, the armed forces received “divine help”.
“We felt it,” he commented.
India launched a series of strikes in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, an act which led to the worst between the old foes in decades. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire.
The confrontation followed an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22, which resulted in the death of 26 people. While New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence, Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry questioning the credibility of India’s account of the events and saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
The Field Marshal also stated that there were 57 Islamic countries in the world, and among them, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain (a reference to Makkah and Madina)”.
He also drew parallels between Pakistan and the Islamic State established in Saudi Arabia 1,400 years ago. “Both are founded for the same reason […], were founded in the same month, the Ramazan, and their establishment involved the element of migration.”
The CDF further said that no one could order jihad in an Islamic state other than the state itself.
“No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said during the conference.
The Field Marshal also cited multiple verses from the Quran during his address.</p><small>2025-12-21 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/211328400cea536.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962440/pns-warships-commissioning-ceremony-held-in-turkiye-erdogan-stresses-need-for-enhanced-cooperation-in-defence-production' target='_blank'><strong>PNS warship’s commissioning ceremony held in Turkiye; Erdogan stresses need for enhanced cooperation in defence production</strong></a><br><p>The commissioning ceremony of a Pakistan Navy Milgem class ship, PNS Khaibar, has been held at Istanbul Naval Shipyard, where Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasised the need for enhanced mutual collaboration in the field of defence production between the two countries.
The warship is the second of four Milgem class corvettes, the contract for which was signed with ASFAT Inc, a Turkish state-owned defence contractor firm in 2018.
Under this contract, two ships were to be constructed in Turkiye and the remaining two ships in Pakistan.







“The commissioning of PNS Khaibar marks the completion of the construction of both ships in Turkiye,” the military’s media affairs wing said in a statement on Sunday.
President Erdogan was the chief guest on the occasion while Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf also attended the ceremony, it added.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement, Erdogan “termed the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Turkiye as exemplary” while addressing the ceremony.
“The president further emphasised the need for enhanced mutual collaboration in the field of defence production in the future as well,” the statement read.
It added that Admiral Ashraf also addressed the ceremony, acknowledging “the commitment of M/s ASFAT, Istanbul Naval Shipyard and the OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer) involved in the planning, design and construction of PN Milgem ships”.
He also appreciated the deepening defence partnership between Pakistan and Turkiye and highlighted that bilateral engagements between the Pakistan Navy and Turkish Naval Forces (TNF) “not only contribute immensely towards strengthening Pakistan-Turkiye defence collaboration but also reflect our enduring and deepening partnership”.
Following the ceremony, the ISPR statement said, Erdogan visited the ship, where he was presented with a guard of honour. He also interacted with the ship’s crew.
The ISPR further stated that Admiral Ashraf exchanged views on maritime security in the region and discussed avenues for future PN-TNF joint initiatives.
“Pakistan Navy Milgem ships are the most technologically advanced surface platforms. These vessels are equipped with latest command and control Systems integrated with modern weapons and advanced sensors,” it added.</p><small>2025-12-21 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/21121310a32051f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962438/nine-killed-10-injured-in-south-africa-shooting-police-hunt-for-suspects' target='_blank'><strong>Nine killed, 10 injured in South Africa shooting, police hunt for suspects</strong></a><br><p>Nine people were killed and 10 wounded in an early morning shooting in a township south-west of Johannesburg and authorities have launched a manhunt for the suspects, the South African Police Service said on Sunday.
The incident occurred just before 1am local time (4am PKT) at a licensed tavern in Johannesburg’s Bekkersdal township, the police said in a statement.
About 12 unknown suspects in a white minibus and a silver sedan opened fire at the tavern patrons and continued shooting randomly as they fled the scene, the police said, adding the motive for the shooting would be determined by investigation.
The injured have been taken to medical facilities for treatment, police added.
Bekkersdal is part of the Rand West City local municipality, whose website describes the township as being an area characterised by high levels of unemployment and poverty due to a decline in gold mining.

Low visibility due to fog was reported from Super Highway, Surjani Town, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, I.I. Chundrigarh Road, Clifton and Defence.
Updates on the Karachi airport’s website showed that multiple flights were cancelled or delayed in the morning.
Pakistan Airports Authority spokesperson Saifullah Khan confirmed in a statement that six international flights scheduled to land in Karachi had to be diverted due to fog.
The statement said that the diversion was a usual safety measure taken due to reduced visibility. It added that Pegasus Airlines, Eitehad Airways, Flyadeal and Gulf Air flights had been diverted to Muscat. Moreover, a Pakistan International Airlines flight that had departed from Madina, too, had to be divered to Muscat.
Similarly, Fly Jinnah flight arriving from Jeddah was diverted to Islamabad.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), shallow fog also engulfed the Rahim Yar Khan-Karachi Highway and Karachi-Lasbella Highway between 8am and 11am.
Air quality
Updates on air quality monitoring platform IQAir around 11:30am showed that the air quality was “very unhealthy” in the city, with an AQI reading of 282.



The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). Any IQAir AQI ranking above 150 is considered “unhealthy” and above 200 is considered “very unhealthy”.
Road accident
Police, meanwhile, reported the death of a motorcyclist in an accident, attributing it to hazy weather conditions, among other factors.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Asad Raza told Dawn that the incident occurred on Clifton Bridge due to “smog, slippery roads and speeding”.
As his motorcycle slipped, he died on the spot, the DIG said, adding that his body was first taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and later handed over to his heirs.</p><small>2025-12-21 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/21103831a56cb1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962295/tehreek-i-insaf-leaders-shouldnt-use-protective-bails-to-join-protests-phc' target='_blank'><strong>Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders shouldn’t use protective bails to join protests: PHC</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has declared that the protective bails, granted to scores of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s lawmakers and leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, were meant to facilitate their appearance before the relevant courts, so the relief shouldn’t be used for participating in protests or anti-state activities.
“This interim relief shall not, under any circumstances, be construed, interpreted, invoked or relied upon by the petitioner(s) as a shield, protection, justification, or safeguard for any purpose other than facilitating their appearance before the competent court. For abundant caution, it is further clarified that this order shall not be used, directly or indirectly, to enable, justify or facilitate the petitioner(s) participation in any protest, demonstration, anti-state activity, or any event of a similar nature,” reads a ruling by a bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Mohammad Faheem Wali in multiple cases.
It declared that any misuse, abuse or attempt to extend the scope of that order beyond the limited purpose for which it had been granted would expose the petitioner(s) to appropriate legal consequences, including, but not limited to, proceedings in accordance with the law.
The court issued these directives in a four-page detailed decision on the petition of former National Assembly speaker and current MNA Asad Qaiser and other PTI leaders.

Bench declares that relief granted only for approaching relevant courts

Qaiser had sought details of the cases registered against him by law-enforcement agencies and the grant of protective bail in those cases.
The other petitions were filed by MPAs Sohail Afridi and former chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur, MNAs Sheikh Waqas Akram, Naseem Shah, Faisal Amin Khan, Shandana Gulzar, Noorul Haq Qadri and Yousaf Ali, Senator Khurram Zeeshan and several other PTI leaders.
On the plea of Islamabad’s chief commissioner, the bench had referred all these connected petitions to the chief justice on Dec 9for constituting a larger bench for hearing.
The bench ruled that since certain crucial issues, as identified by the federal prosecutor general as well as other counsel, were involved in this matter, the office was directed to place the matter before the chief justice of this court for the formation of a larger bench.
In the detailed order, the bench directed the Islamabad chief commissioner to act as focal person between the petitioners and the law-enforcement agencies at federal level as well as within Islamabad.
It declared: “The petitioner(s) in the present case, as well as in the connected cases, shall approach the said office through an application, either directly or through an advocate, seeking information regarding their involvement in criminal cases within three days of the receipt of this order.”
“Upon receipt of such application, the worthy Chief Commissioner, Islamabad, shall procure the record of all criminal cases in which the arrest of the petitioner(s) is required from the law enforcing agencies at the federal level and within the Capital Territory of Islamabad. The said record shall be provided to the petitioner(s) at the earliest, but not later than seven days from the date of the application,” it declared.
The court added that once the records were provided to the petitioner(s), he should approach or surrender within three days before the appropriate court for bail or any other legal remedy, if available.
The high court later clubbed petitions of several other lawmakers with those of Senator Mashal Azam and MNAs Atif Khan and Shahid Khattak.
In these cases, federal prosecutor general Ghulam Sarwar Nehung had represented the chief commissioner and contended that the petitioner (Asad Qaiser) had filed repeated petitions for the same relief without disclosing the fate of the earlier adjudications.
His main concern was that the present petitioner as well as those in connected matters, obtained protective orders from the court (high court) but, pursuant to such orders, failed to approach or surrender before the appropriate forum. Consequently, he claimed, they remained on bail before arrest for a considerable period of time without joining the investigation agencies in other provinces.
He submitted that there was no uniform policy of this court regarding the grant of omnibus bail (bail in all cases orders or protective bail, and petitions filed by the same petitioner for bail before arrest or omnibus bail were placed before different benches, therefore such practice was contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in one of its cases (PLD 1986 SC 173).
Contrary to his claims, the lawyers representing the petitioners had insisted that despite directions of the court, the respondents had failed to provide details of all required FIRs.
They added that the conduct of the respondents had caused the matter to be delayed.

LAHORE: Despite being among the world’s largest producers of citrua, Pakistan is set to export only 400,000-450,000 tonnes of kinno during the 2025-26 season, well below its estimated potential of 700,000-800,000 tonnes, as growers and exporters struggle with high freight costs, border restrictions and the absence of effective government facilitation.
During the 2024-25 season, kinno exports stood at around 350,000-400,000 tonnes, with Russia, Indonesia, the UAE, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Central Asian states as major destinations. For the current season, a slight improvement is expected due to better fruit size and quality in Sargodha and adjoining areas, but structural issues continue to cap growth.
Former MPA and large kinno orchard owner Faisal Cheema said the crisis has deepened despite an excellent crop. “By the grace of God, this year’s kinno crop is outstanding in both quantity and quality, but it has become a pattern that whenever the crop is good, it goes to waste. The Afghan border issue has been hurting us for the last couple of years, while the recent goods transporters’ strike caused further damages as we failed to meet some export orders due to unavailability of reefer containers,” he said.
Market prices have collapsed sharply during the season and orchard owners, out of panic, are selling their produce at whatever price is being offered. At the start of packing for Dubai exports, large size kinno fetched Rs120-125 per kg and smaller fruit Rs90-95 per kg, rates that held until Nov 30. By Dec 10, prices fell to Rs100 per kg for large fruit and Rs70 per kg for small. Between Dec 10 and 15, factories sold large fruit at Rs85-90 per kg and small at Rs55-60 per kg. After Dec 15, the situation became alarming, with factories offering barely Rs75 per kg for large fruit and Rs35-40 per kg for small — despite near-total buyer apathy.

According to industry estimates, traders are selling kinno to factories at Rs1,400-1,500 per maund, while factories have cut packing speeds drastically, daily operations halved from ten to five pickings causing repeated topping of orchards and severe damage to trees.
Sajid Tarar, a former president of the Sargodha Chamber of Commerce and Industry, warned that border closures have brought the export chain to a standstill. “Over 100 factories did not open at all due to the Afghan border issue. Of the remaining units, most were already operating at around half capacity, and now closures are accelerating. Nearly 50 units are shut, with many more on the brink,” he said, cautioning that up to 800,000 workers could face unemployment if the crisis persists.
In a hint to the disturbing Afghan market, he said that some fruit had been going to Afghanistan through Iran, but the tensions on borders created a hostile atmosphere in Afghanistan against Pakistani products and a consignment of bananas was damaged by some people in the markets there.
Cold storages across Sargodha are reported to be 80-90 per cent full, putting kinnow worth millions of dollars at risk of spoilage. Growers fear losses of Rs8-10 billion, with ripple effects likely to hit future crops, including wheat and sugarcane, due to shrinking farm resources.
Stakeholders have urged the government to take immediate action by finding alternative international markets and routes for fruits, subsidising logistics, resolving border issue, and supporting exporters. “Saving kinno exports means saving farmers — and strengthening the national economy,” Faisal Cheema emphasised.

Visits to multiple exchange outlets across different parts of the metropolis revealed that currency dealers are facing a dearth of greenbacks in their accounts. Some have stopped selling dollars altogether, while others are rationing their supply, only allowing customers to purchase up to $100 at a time.
In addition, a small number of exchanges only have old-design dollar notes in stock. These are not of much use to travellers who wish to exchange greenbacks for the local currency of their destination.
As a result, a number of passengers have been forced to purchase exotic foreign currencies in Pakistan, leading to them getting a ‘bad deal’ in terms of the exchange rate.
One such passenger, who was travelling to Malaysia at the end of November, told Dawn that they were unable to buy dollars at the airport, which they hoped to exchange for ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Just hours before their flight, they settled for an exorbitant exchange rate in the open market: Rs74.5 for a ringgit.

Strict regulatory measures compound the situation; exchanges are only selling what they buy

According to them, they were worse off as the exchange rate should have been less than Rs70. Mid-market exchange rate (MMER) data available on Wise confirms this speculation for the given period, as it lists the MMER for a ringgit at roughly Rs68.
But the buck doesn’t stop at travellers. In fact, another group of non-speculative buyers has been hit hard by the shortage: students. Dawn spoke to a Lahore resident who was unable to buy dollars even after visiting 11 different exchange companies to support their siblings’ education expenses.

 

This shortage, some argue, can also be attributed to recent changes to SOPs surrounding the exchange of currencies. Biometric verification and the requirement of an original CNIC were among the changes previously made. But recent changes include an SBP circular dated November 14, mandating exchange companies to issue cheques to customers wishing to buy dollars for deposit into their foreign currency accounts. A more recent circular adds another layer of verification that is not easily accessible for women who wear veil: facial recognition.
Even with these new SOPs, one exchange we spoke to was willing to accept a digital CNIC, after initially hesitating to sell even a single greenback. While three other exchanges that initially hesitated became willing to sell up to $100, provided an original CNIC was available.
In contrast, only five exchanges visited by Dawn, were willing to sell dollars without hesitation, whereas seven exchanges outright refused to sell dollars. An employee highlighted the shortage and the lack of customers willing to supply greenbacks to the open market.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan Chairman Malik Bostan acknowledged the difference in demand and supply, said when a currency was not available, the exchanges were supposed to “note down customer information” and arrange it for them.
Impact of digital currencies
Despite shortage at the exchanges, dollars are still becoming more accessible than ever, through digital currencies pegged to the dollar, a type of transaction that is currently against SBP instructions for banks.
Pakistan Banks Association Secretary Mir Nejib Rahman said that “no bank can operationally engage with stablecoins or crypto rails” until SBP issues the relevant regulations and supervisory framework, which can only happen once Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) published its detailed guidelines.
Mr Bostan also noted his concerns related to illegal activity moving towards unregulated crypto rails, and cited the PVARA chairman’s references to 40 million crypto users who may have lost money as a result of the recent drop in Bitcoin’s value. Experts previously warned that this shortage indicates illegal operators entering the market, and “while smuggling has been largely controlled, hoarding is becoming increasingly likely”.
Dawn reached out to SBP for comment, but no response was received.

ISLAMABAD: As a court sentenced him to jail in the Toshakhana-II case, former prime minister Imran Khan on Saturday issued a call for a nationwide protest besides announcing his intention to challenge the verdict in the Islamabad High Court.
The PTI chief does not have access to his social media handles in jail.
“I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement. The entire nation will have to rise for its rights,” he said as per the account of the conversation between the PTI leader and his lawyer posted on X.
He said his sentence in this case did not come as a surprise, but he had asked his legal team to move the high court against the decision. “Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the last three years, the Toshakhana-II decision is also nothing new to me. This decision was given in haste by the judge without any evidence and without fulfilling the legal requirements,” he said, adding that his legal team was “not even heard”.
The PTI chief said it was inevitable for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and the legal community to “come to the front foot” for the supremacy of law and the restoration of the Constitution. He said that without justice, economic development was not possible.
‘Political revenge’
The PTI, in a statement, called the sentence “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation”.
The PTI leaders alleged that the conviction was merely an attempt to extend the incarceration of Imran Khan and provide temporary relief to a “petrified ruling clique”. They stated that the rule of law had been buried in Pakistan, with political revenge being systematically carried out through a “subservient” judiciary.

 

Addressing a press conference alongside PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja stated that the PTI founder had a meeting with his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and conveyed a message to the nation. He made his position absolutely clear, stating, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”
Salman Raja alleged that the case was based solely on promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.
Mr Raja described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was exerted on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case.
Mr Qaiser stated that the current circumstances leave no option other than resistance. He emphasised that the resistance would be peaceful, democratic, and grounded in constitutional principles. He further asserted that PTI was seeking justice for its founder and would continue its struggle until it was served.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram stated that even Imran Khan’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo” court announced the verdict. The sentence was the second for the same charge, which was a clear violation of the Constitution, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy, he said.
‘Pre-written script’
Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against him were being delivered under a “pre-written script”.
Ms Khan claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts.
“Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision. “What difference does it make whether you sentence them to 10 years or 14 years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said.
“Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned.
According to Ms Khan, the PTI founder’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in “illegal solitary confinement”.
Separately, PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgement. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former premier and his wife were those of a “kangaroo court”.
“There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Mr Ayub added.

Amid opposition from the Ministry of Parl­ia­mentary Affairs, the Senate Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges has approved an amendment to Rule 166(5) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate. Backers say the change will leave no legal room for the judiciary to interfere in parliamentary matters by relying on the rule in its present form.
The proposed amendment, spearheaded by former deputy chairman Saleem Mandviwalla and signed by around three dozen lawmakers, expands the definition of public petitions that can be taken up by Senate committees.
It states that a public petition, submitted by a citizen or a group of citizens in the prescribed form under Rule 277, may be presented on “any matter of public importance”, including grievances arising from disputes where circumstances disclose an element of public interest, systemic concern, regulatory oversight and/or the protection of rights.

Proposed rule change seeks to shield upper house committees from stay orders

It further provides that, after consideration, the committee may issue: (a) observations or recommendations for systemic or regulatory improvements; and (b) facilitative guidance for resolution of the grievance and take necessary steps for disposal of the matter in accordance with relevant law.
A proviso proposed to be added to the rule gives the Senate chairman broad discretion over whether a petition proceeds. It reads: “Provided that, notwithstanding anything contained in this rule, the Chairman Senate may, at his sole discretion, review, admit, pend, dispense with or decline to proceed with any petition, if in his opinion such action is necessary in the interest of propriety, parliamentary discipline, or to prevent frivolous, vexatious or otherwise inappropriate proceedings.”
Rule 166(5) in its current form states: “Public petitions may be presented on any matter connected with the business pending before the House or a Committee, or any matter of general public interest which is primarily the concern of the Government, provided that it is not one which falls within the cognisance of a court of law or tribunal, and it shall not directly relate to a matter pending before any court or other authority performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions.”
The ministry proposed retaining the latter portion of the original rule as a second proviso, but the committee rejected the suggestion.
During the meeting, held with Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi in the chair, Mr Mandviwalla raised concerns over what he described as judicial interference in committee proceedings. He emphasised courts had no authority to interfere in parliamentary affairs and noted that the Supreme Court had repeatedly directed that parliamentary proceedings should not be obstructed.
He recommended that the Senate should not compromise the authority of its committees and, while exercising the powers of the House as representatives of the public and as oversight bodies, must remain fully empowered to take up matters of public importance.
Mr Mehdi reiterated that parliament was the supreme institution and said its organs must be empowered to address issues affecting individuals and groups of citizens. However, he cautioned that committees must strictly refrain from taking up or discussing sub judice matters.
Senator Saadia Abbasi opposed the proposed amendment, saying every institution should operate within its constitutional domain and avoid interfering in the functions of others.
The meeting was attended by Senators Saadia Abbasi, Dost Ali Jeesar, Asad Qasim, Jan Muhammad and Palwasha Khan. Senators Mandviwalla, Shahadat Awan and Syed Masroor Ahsan also attended as movers, while Senator Bilal Khan Mandokhail attended as a special invitee.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Mandviwalla said he was confident the amendment would be passed by the House and would “put a full stop” to judicial interference in parliamentary affairs. “And if it does not stop even then, we will move the appropriate forum for action against those found responsible,” he said.
The move follows a dispute this year over stay orders issued by the Islamabad High Court and Lahore High Court against proceedings of Senate standing committees. On July 25, the Senate summoned the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle raised concerns about alleged judicial interference in parliamentary matters.
The issue was raised by Mr Mandviwalla during a sitting presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan. Mr Mandviwalla described the stay orders as “alarming” and regretted that they had been issued despite the absence of any pending court cases. “This is direct interference in the functioning and proceedings of parliamentary committees,” he said.
Legislators from both treasury and opposition benches, including PTI and JUI-F, endorsed the concerns. On Aug 18, AGP Mansoor Usman Awan made a rare appearance before the Senate and backed the judiciary, calling for keeping the door open for judicial intervention in parliamentary proceedings.
The AGP referred to Article 69 of the Constitution, under which the validity of proceedings in parliament cannot be called into question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure, but insisted that the bar was not absolute.
