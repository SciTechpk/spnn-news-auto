“I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive of the company at year end,” Buffett, 94, said at Berkshire’s annual meeting.
He said Abel hadn’t been aware of his plans prior to the announcement.
Buffett also said he had “zero” intention of selling any of his Berkshire stock.
The news was also unexpected, though Buffett said he had told his children about his decision.
During his 60-year run, Buffett managed to transform Berkshire Hathaway from a medium-sized textile company when he bought it in the 1960s into a giant conglomerate, now valued at more than $1 trillion and with liquid assets of $300 billion.
His success, coupled with his ability to explain his thinking in clear soundbites, has made him highly influential in the business and financial communities, earning him the nickname “The Oracle of Omaha”.
Trade ‘should not be a weapon’
Separately, the influential billionaire investor said that “trade should not be a weapon”, in remarks clearly targeting US President Donald Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs against countries around the world.
“There is no question that trade can be an act of war,” the renowned businessman told the annual shareholder meeting.
While he did not mention Trump by name, his meaning was unmistakable, and his comments came as analysts in the United States and abroad have expressed growing concern that tariffs could seriously slow global growth.
 
 

Two months ago, Buffett told a CBS interviewer that tariffs “are a tax on goods” — and not a relatively painless revenue-raiser, as Trump has suggested — adding, “I mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn’t pay ’em!”
Buffett urged Washington to continue trading with the rest of the world, saying, “We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best. That’s what we did originally.”
Achieving prosperity is not a zero-sum game, with one country’s successes meaning another’s losses, he said, adding that both can prosper.
“I do think that the more prosperous the rest of the world becomes, it won’t be at our expense; the more prosperous we’ll become, and the safer we’ll feel,” Buffett said.
He added that it can be dangerous for one country to offend the rest of the world while claiming superiority.
“It’s a big mistake, in my view, when you have seven and a half billion people that don’t like you very well, and you got 300 million that are crowing in some way about how well they’ve done,” Buffett said.
Compared to that dynamic, the financial markets’ recent gyrations are “really nothing”.
Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday reported first-quarter profits of $9.6bn, down 14 per cent.
That works out to $4.47 per share, also down sharply.</p><small>2025-05-03 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0323083325392a5.jpg?r=231510' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908218/zelensky-says-wont-play-putins-games-with-short-truce' target='_blank'><strong>Zelensky says won’t play Putin’s ‘games’ with short truce</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed a three-day truce ordered by Russian leader Vladimir Putin as theatrics, but said Kyiv was ready for a full ceasefire.
Moscow said the truce, set to coincide with its World War II commemorations on May 9, was aimed at testing Kyiv’s “readiness” for long-term peace, accusing Zelensky of making a “direct threat” to events on the holiday.
The Kremlin rejected an unconditional 30-day ceasefire proposed by Kyiv and Washington in March, and Putin has since offered little to end the three-year Russia invasion.
“This is more of a theatrical performance on his part. Because in two or three days, it is impossible to develop a plan for the next steps to end the war,” Zelensky said.
He was speaking to a small group of journalists on Friday, including AFP, in remarks embargoed until Saturday.
Some in Ukraine have criticised the truce as an attempt to prevent Kyiv from disrupting the World War II anniversary celebrations, with foreign leaders due in Moscow to watch a military parade on Red Square and an address by Putin.

Zelensky said Ukraine would not be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin’s exit from isolation on May 9”.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the ceasefire was aimed at testing “Kyiv’s readiness to seek ways to achieve long-term sustainable peace”.
Russian shelling killed two people in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region on Saturday, while a drone strike on the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson left one other person dead, regional officials said.
Russian authorities, meanwhile, accused Ukraine of an overnight attack on the southern port city of Novorossiysk, damaging apartment buildings and injuring five people.
‘Cannot take responsibility’
Leaders of around 20 countries, including China’s Xi Jinping, have accepted invitations to join the May 9 celebration, according to the Kremlin.
Zelensky said some countries had approached Kyiv to warn they were travelling to Russia and had requested safety.
“Our position is very simple towards all countries that have travelled or are travelling to Russia on May 9 — we cannot take responsibility for what is happening on the territory of the Russian Federation,” he said.
“They are ensuring your safety,” Zelensky said, adding that Russia “may take various steps on its part, such as arson, explosions, and so on and then blame us”.
Zelensky did not say what Ukraine would do during the truce, but Russia jumped on the comments, accusing Kyiv of making a “direct threat” to the commemorations.
“He is threatening the physical safety of veterans who will come to parades and celebrations on the holy day,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Telegram. “His statement … is, of course, a direct threat.”
Russian officials have promised grand celebrations for the occasion, during which Putin will seek to rally support for his troops fighting in Ukraine.
Russian troops have been making gruelling gains on several parts of the front, as both Moscow and Kyiv have stepped up their aerial attacks.
The United States has warned it could abandon efforts to broker a ceasefire if it does not see progress.
Washington is seeking “a complete, durable ceasefire and an end to the conflict”, rather than a “three-day moment so you can celebrate something else”, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said this week.
Bruce said it would ultimately be up to Trump to decide whether to move ahead with diplomatic efforts.
‘See things differently’
Trump has overhauled US policy towards Russia since taking office, initiating a rapprochement with the Kremlin.
This culminated in an on-camera clash between Trump and Zelensky at the White House on February 28, where both leaders had been set to sign a mineral deal granting US access to Ukrainian resources in exchange for some protection.
Ukraine has since renegotiated the deal, which would see Washington and Kyiv jointly develop and invest in Ukraine’s critical mineral resources.
Zelensky on Friday said the deal was beneficial to both sides and protected Ukraine’s interests, even though the accord offers no concrete security guarantees for Kyiv.
That followed a meeting between Trump and Zelensky at the end of April before Pope Francis’s funeral at the Vatican, the first encounter since their public clash.
“We had the best conversation out of all those that preceded it,” Zelensky said on Friday.
“I am confident that after our meeting in the Vatican, President Trump began to look at things a little differently.”</p><small>2025-05-03 18:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/03233213d4c5502.jpg?r=233509' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908219/singapore-ruling-party-wins-election-in-landslide' target='_blank'><strong>Singapore ruling party wins election in landslide</strong></a><br><p>Singapore’s ruling party has notched a resounding win in general elections, official results showed early on Sunday, giving Prime Minister Lawrence Wong the clear mandate he sought from voters.
Wong’s long-ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) crossed the threshold of 49 seats to form a majority government in the wealthy city-state’s 97-seat unicameral legislature, with sample counts earlier showing the PAP winning all but 10 seats.
“We are grateful once again for your strong mandate, and we will honour it,” a broadly smiling Wong said shortly after winning his ward, thanking supporters gathered at Yio Chu Kang stadium.
Wong was facing his first major test against a rejuvenated opposition and had urged voters to offer him a strong show of support as he navigates the trade-oriented nation through global economic uncertainties brought by US tariffs.
The PAP, which has steered the Southeast Asian country to prosperity while being criticised for suppressing dissent, was always expected to easily retain a clear majority in the legislature. However, its dominance has been increasingly challenged by a more vocal electorate over the years.
Popular after leading Singapore’s Covid task force, Wong took over last year from his predecessor Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding premier Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled the island state after its bitter break-up with Malaysia in 1965.
Wong had warned Singapore would be hit hard if US President Donald Trump went ahead with the tariffs he announced and then paused for most countries, and that it needed to stay open and competitive to counter their effects. He has also said the ructions caused could require a major restructuring of Singapore’s economy.
“The intense campaigning by PM Lawrence Wong and former PM Lee Hsien Loong in the hot seats must have helped a lot and the fear of Trump’s tariffs must have worried voters as well,” political observer and veteran former editor PN Balji told AFP.
Scandals
The overwhelming PAP majority has become a norm in Singapore’s political landscape.
But in the run-up to the latest polls, the PAP has faced a series of controversies.
Lee Hsien Loong is locked in a bitter feud with his brother Lee Hsien Yang, who vehemently supports the opposition and who has sought political asylum in Britain.
The long-running family row centres on allegations made by Lee Hsien Yang that his brother is seeking to block the demolition of a family bungalow to capitalise on Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy — something he has denied.
Last year, former transport minister S Iswaran was thrown in jail for graft and in 2023, the parliament speaker and a lawmaker resigned over an “inappropriate” affair.
At the same time, younger voters showed themselves to be increasingly receptive to alternative political voices. One voter told AFP she had been impressed by “refreshing and exciting” new candidates from across the political spectrum.
“Whether or not they get elected, I hope we see and hear more of them, and get to know them better,” said 40-year-old Shi’ai Liang.
Crowds at opposition rallies
In 2020, the country’s largest opposition group, the Workers’ Party (WP), made historic gains, winning 10 of the 93 seats at stake — a significant jump from its previously held four seats.
The WP, which has become politically slicker, has been hoping to build on that momentum with a slate of charismatic candidates, including a top lawyer.
The party pulled in massive crowds at its rallies during the campaign, just like in previous elections, but those big numbers have seldom translated into electoral wins in the past.
Campaigning on cost-of-living issues, WP candidates said more opposition MPs were needed to deprive the PAP of a political “blank cheque” to do whatever it wants.
The PAP, however, pointed to the billions of Singapore dollars it has spent in helping citizens cope with rising costs, including via cash handouts and grocery vouchers.</p><small>2025-05-03 18:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0320060573c89f7.png?r=200629' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908197/afghan-truckers-suffer-as-pakistan-and-india-hostilities-escalate' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan truckers suffer as Pakistan and India hostilities escalate</strong></a><br><p>The recent escalation in hostilities between Pakistan and India has left truckers from Afghanistan in a mess.
The central leader of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI) on Saturday said that India has not allowed Afghan trucks carrying goods to cross the Wagah border.
Whereas, he added that Pakistan has also not permitted the vehicles carrying items imported from India under the transit agreement to enter Afghanistan via Torkham and Chaman border points.
Earlier this week, Pakistan allowed 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the border, easing a weeks-long bottleneck. The moves came nearly a week after Pakistan shut off its borders for any trade with India, including to or from a third country, in response to New Delhi’s measures following a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir. India, without proof, implied cross-border links, which Pakistan denied and instead sought a neutral probe.
Islamabad decided to halt trade with New Delhi, including to and from any third country via Pakistan, during the National Security Committee meeting on April 24.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, PAJCCI leader Khan Jan Alokozay confirmed that despite Pakistan giving the permission, India has not allowed the trucks to cross the Wagah border.
“A total of 150 trucks had entered Pakistan and were supposed to proceed to Wagah but have been stranded after April 25.”
“These trucks are carrying dried fruit, fresh fruit and vegetables. First, Pakistan had stopped these vehicles, and now India is not giving permission,” Alokozay said from Kabul.
He said Pakistan has also stopped those Afghan commercial vehicles which carry imported items from India.
“Around 1,500 containers arrived at Karachi ports from India. Some of the goods were loaded, and containers have arrived at Torkham and Chaman. Pakistan has stopped those vehicles.”
He said that the items stopped were transit goods from India, and they wanted to take them to Kabul.
“They have been stopped and that causes losses to us,” he said.
“It is sad that this problem prevails and has not yet been resolved. We are making efforts to solve it.”
An Afghan official in Kabul said that, like Pakistan, the Indian External Affairs Ministry, in a letter, has asked the border authorities to facilitate the entry of Afghan trucks into India.
Despite permission from both Islamabad and New Delhi, the Afghan commercial trucks have not yet been allowed to enter India via Pakistan from the Attari-Wagah border, the official added.
Meanwhile, the Afghan embassy in Islamabad, quoting a trader, said that customs officials at Wagah and Chaman were not allowing the vehicles to enter Afghanistan, saying that they had not yet received instructions.
“They said neither India has given them a green signal nor Pakistan has conveyed them officially,” the trader was quoted as saying in an audio clip sent to his representatives.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry issued a letter dated April 30 that read, “The ministry has the honour to inform that in view of the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the government of Pakistan has decided to permit stranded Afghan trucks, carrying goods in transit to India, which entered Pakistan before 25 April 2025, to cross Wagah border for delivering the goods.”
The Afghan embassy in Islamabad had sent a note to Islamabad to allow Afghan trucks stranded in Pakistan to enter India after it closed the Wagah border and suspended all trade —  including transit — with the neighbouring country.
Pakistan permitted the Afghan trucks to cross the Wagah border to deliver the goods in India but they were not allowed to proceed further by the Indian authorities.
Under the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA), the landlocked Afghanistan can use Karachi and Gwadar ports for imports and exports.
Pakistan has been facilitating Afghan transit through its ports under the APTTA signed in 1965 and revised in 2010.
The agreement expired in 2021, and both sides have now agreed to sign a revised agreement soon.</p><small>2025-05-03 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/031610389735a6d.jpg?r=191433' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908186/now-a-trusted-ally-little-marco-gets-trumps-big-jobs' target='_blank'><strong>Now a trusted ally, ‘Little Marco’ gets Trump’s big jobs</strong></a><br><p>Top diplomat, foreign aid chief, national archivist and now national security adviser, Marco Rubio’s expanding resume underscores US President Donald Trump’s increasing trust in the former Florida senator, officials said.
Trump said on Thursday that his national security adviser Mike Waltz would move on to become UN ambassador, weeks after Waltz added a journalist from The Atlantic to a Signal chat where top officials were discussing military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.
In his place, Trump named Rubio as his top national security aide on an interim basis, the latest instance of the president turning to the man he once disparaged as Little Marco and labelled a con artist to take on crucial tasks in his administration.

Rubio will lead the council that coordinates the administrations national security actions around the world. Trump did not indicate when a permanent replacement would be named.
The reshuffle comes amid efforts to end the war in Ukraine, restore a failed ceasefire in Gaza and conduct complex nuclear talks with Iran, all while managing the diplomatic fallout from Trumps trade war with China.
A senior US official said Rubio has built trust with Trump by carrying out whatever tasks Trump hands to him. He’s done everything that Trump has asked him to do, the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.
“Why wouldn’t you trust him?”, NSC Spokesman Brian Hughes told Reuters that Rubio had implemented Trump’s America First agenda and was “well qualified” to oversee the council.
A US official told Reuters that Trump is fine with maintaining the new arrangement — Rubio serving as both secretary of state and national security adviser — indefinitely.
Earlier on Friday, Politico reported that Rubio is expected to hold the two roles for a minimum of six months.
‘He gets it solved’
Early on, Rubio was sent to Panama to put Trump’s promise to “take back” the Panama Canal in more diplomatic terms.
In March, after an Oval Office blowup with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump dispatched Rubio to Saudi Arabia, where he helped bring his effort toward peace between Ukraine and Russia back on track.

Rubio has also played a leading role in Trumps controversial crackdown on migration to the US, securing an agreement to send alleged gang members to a high-security prison in El Salvador, and revoking thousands of student visas, in many cases after the students took part in anti-Israel protests.
Above all, Rubio has vociferously argued for Trumps agenda, even when it clashed with his own previous positions.
As a US senator, Rubio championed foreign assistance around the world. Under Trump, Rubio has overseen the dismantling of Washington’s main aid agency, and proudly defended the decision to do so.
At a Rose Garden event on Thursday, Trump thanked Rubio for his unbelievable work. “When I have a problem, I call up Marco,” Trump said. “He gets it solved.”
It is not unprecedented for one official to hold multiple roles at the same time. Henry Kissinger served as both Secretary of State and national security adviser in the 1970s.
But Rubio’s current workload raises questions over how he would manage multiple briefs. In addition to the role of US top diplomat, Rubio serves as the administrator of the US Agency for International Development and the acting archivist of the United States, an office that oversees the preservation of government records.

“Either one of these jobs, done correctly, requires a super-human level of dedication, focus, and energy,” said a State Department official, who requested anonymity to speak frankly.
“Even with the best of intentions, I don’t see how you can do both jobs at once without neglecting responsibilities that cannot easily be delegated.”
Tammy Bruce, Rubio’s spokesperson at the State Department, said that Rubio has people around him to help him handle the two roles. “If anybody can do it… it will be Marco Rubio.”
Some major foreign policy issues remain concentrated in a tight circle, with Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff leading talks with Russia, the Iran nuclear negotiations, and Israel’s war in Gaza.
“The president has assembled an incredibly talented team that is fully committed to putting America and Americans first,” the State Department said in an emailed response to a request for comment.
“Secretary Rubio looks forward to serving as his interim National Security Adviser while ensuring the mission critical work at the State Department continues uninterrupted.”
Trump and Rubio once traded barbs
Rubio and Trump clashed during the hard-fought campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. They exchanged barbs on the debate stage, with Trump giving Rubio the moniker Little Marco, and calling him a con artist for missing votes in the Senate.
Rubio, who also accused Trump of being a con man, mocked Trump for supposedly having small hands. Rubio has said those comments were made in the context of a competitive primary, comparing himself to a boxer punching an opponent in the ring.
“Doesn’t mean you hate the guy, but we were in a competition for the same job,” Rubio told CNN.
After Trump took office in 2017, tensions eased as Rubio, who is Cuban American, played a key role advising on Venezuela and Cuba policy.
Rubio was a driving force behind-the-scenes in helping to craft Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, including the imposition of sanctions against the OPEC member’s vital energy sector, and in the sharp reversal of former President Barack Obama’s rapprochement with Cuba.
A senior State Department official who requested anonymity attributed Trump’s growing reliance on Rubio to a history of “working collaboratively together, building a professional and personal relationship.”
Long a staunch advocate of traditional Republican foreign policy positions including strong support for Ukraine, allegiance to NATO, and a hawkish view of China and its human rights record, Rubio has increasingly aligned himself with Trump’s “America First” message.
At the State Department, Rubio has shut down an office that worked on countering Russian and Chinese misinformation, accusing it of targeting conservatives. He has worked with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to cut aid and other programs he supported as a senator, and initiated a major overhaul that would shutter offices dealing with human rights and war crimes.
Immigration purge
Rubio used State Department powers to revoke the permission of foreign students to study in the US, including a Turkish student who wrote an op-ed criticising Israel’s war on Gaza.
In a visit to El Salvador in February, Spanish-speaker Rubio reached an agreement with President Nayib Bukele that led to hundreds of men being sent to the country on military planes, even as US courts sought to pause the deportations.

Those deported included Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The administration admitted his deportation to his native El Salvador, despite a court order, was a mistake.
At a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Rubio, seated beside Trump, said the judiciary could not force the administration to try to return Abrego Garcia.
“The conduct of our foreign policy belongs to the president of the United States and the executive branch, not some judge,” Rubio told reporters.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said PM Shehbaz held a meeting with Ambassador of the Republic of Turkiye Dr Irfan Neziroglu at the PM House.
The premier reiterated that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
The prime minister emphasised that India had failed to share any evidence and was falsely trying to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, the statement said.
“India has yet to respond to Pakistan’s offer to have a credible, transparent and neutral international investigation to ascertain the facts behind the Pahalgam incident,” he said, adding that Pakistan would cooperate fully with such an investigation and would welcome if Turkiye joined it.
The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had rendered great sacrifices in its counter-terrorism efforts, including 90,000 casualties and over $152 billion in economic losses over the years.
He further said that India’s actions would distract Pakistan from its counter-terrorism efforts.
PM Shehbaz expressed his gratitude to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his strong statement that supported Pakistan during the prevailing situation in South Asia as well as his call for peace in the region.
The prime minister noted that Turkiye’s support to Pakistan was reflective of the “historic, deep-rooted and time-tested brotherly relations” between the two countries and their peoples.
He reaffirmed the government’s focus on economic recovery and growth for which it required peace and security in its neighbourhood.
The Turkish ambassador informed the prime minister that Turkiye appreciated Pakistan’s position and expressed its solidarity with Pakistan while calling for de-escalation and urging restraint in the current crisis to maintain peace and security in South Asia.
FM Dar’s diplomatic engagements
Separately, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability while resolutely protecting its sovereignty and national interests in a telephone conversation with Greek counterpart George Gerapetritis.
FM Dar briefed him on current regional developments, categorically rejecting India’s “baseless allegations, disinformation campaign and illegal unilateral measures” that threatened regional peace and security.
“He strongly condemned India’s unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a blatant violation of its international obligations,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a press release.
Dar reiterated Pakistan’s call for an independent and transparent investigation to establish the facts.
FM Gerapetritis emphasised the importance of restraint to prevent escalation and preserve peace and stability. He welcomed Pakistan’s proposal for a neutral and transparent inquiry.
Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination on regional and global developments, particularly in multilateral forums, including their engagement as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.
FM Dar also held a telephone conversation with Swiss Federal Councillor and Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.
He briefed FM Cassis on the evolving regional security situation, “expressing grave concern over India’s recent provocative actions, including baseless allegations, inflammatory propaganda, and its unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — an outright violation of international legal obligations”, the FO said in a press release.
Dar reiterated Pakistan’s call for an independent and transparent international investigation to establish the facts and underscored Pakistan’s commitment to exercising restraint in the interest of regional peace and security, while reserving the right to protect its sovereignty and national interests.
FM Cassis appreciated Pakistan’s commitment to peace and endorsed its proposal for an investigation.
He expressed Switzerland’s readiness to offer its good offices and explore appropriate mechanisms to facilitate an impartial investigation.
The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact on the evolving situation.
 






PM Haq accuses India of maneuvering to create unrest in AJK
Meanwhile, Azad Jammu Kashmir Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said on Friday that India was hatching conspiracies to create unrest in the territory.
In his address to the All Parties Kashmir Conference hosted in the state metropolis, he warned,  “If India attacks Pakistan, we will respond with full force. India is actively plotting to destabilise AJK.”
He emphasised that Pakistan’s political leadership must demonstrate complete solidarity and stand firmly behind the armed forces against the Indian aggression.
Reaffirming his stance on the Kashmir issue, Haq said his narrative drew strength from the people of Pakistan, the armed forces and the country’s military leadership.
He said that a single action by the Indian government had brought the situation back to what it was before August 5, 2019.
“The Liberation Cell is ready to support if the political leadership from the All Parties Kashmir Conference forum wants to participate in the protest demonstration,” the AJK premier said.
“As far as the Kashmir policy is concerned, we are open for debate and ready to remove any shortcomings,” he remarked.
“We have to think about how to take forward the issue of Kashmir, for which we have lost three generations,” he said.
Highlighting the significance of national unity, Haq said, “The enemy attacks you only when he thinks that the nation is divided.”</p><small>2025-05-03 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/031215072bf4cab.png?r=125553' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908173/pakistan-envoy-to-us-calls-on-world-to-resolve-kashmir-dispute-terms-it-core-issue-of-enmity-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan envoy to US calls on world to resolve Kashmir dispute, terms it ‘core issue’ of enmity with India</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s envoy to the United States has called on the global community to resolve the Kashmir dispute, terming it the “core issue” of the recent complete breakdown of ties with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “ resolute” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
“It could be an important part of President [Donald] Trump’s legacy to attend to this situation — not with a Band-Aid solution, but by addressing the core issue: the Kashmir dispute,” Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh said in an interview with Fox News Digital published earlier today.
“This is one nuclear flashpoint,” the envoy said.
 
 

Sheikh’s statement echoes his recent call to Trump to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India. He had highlighted that as a president “standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration”, there was no “higher or flashier flashpoint” than the Kashmir issue.
Trump, in his inaugural speech as the US president, had said: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.”
A ceasefire — which has since been broken — was secured between Israel and Hamas following Trump’s election, and he has also been engaging with Ukraine and Russia to halt their war.
During his interview with Fox News, Sheikh also called on nations around the globe to help with a lasting settlement to the Kashmir issue.
He said: “Previously, when the situation has been at this level or the tensions have escalated, the international community has attended to the situation, but taken their eyes [and] attention away, even before the situation could fully defuse.
“This time, perhaps it would be […] timely in terms of the situation elsewhere on the globe, with similar instances, […] to perhaps not afford a Band-Aid solution, but to address the broader problem.”
 
 

“Any misadventure or miscalculation can lead to a nuclear interface,” the ambassador was quoted as saying. “That is certainly not desirable in such a densely populated region.”
“We want a peaceful neighbourhood,” Sheikh emphasised, adding that Pakistan did not want any instability in the region.
However, he stressed, Pakistan’s desire for peace “should not in any way be misconstrued as a sign of weakness”. “We want peace with dignity.”
Sheikh described India’s response to the Pahalgam attack as dangerously premature and inflammatory, according to the report.
The envoy reiterated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer to hold a “neutral and transparent” probe into the Pahalgam attack. He pointed out that both the investigation offer and Pakistan’s request for evidence linking it to the attack had gone “unanswered”.
“Within minutes of the attack, India began levelling accusations against Pakistan,” he said, noting that a post-investigation report was filed just 10 minutes after the incident occurred, despite the remote and rugged terrain near the scene.
The ambassador warned that the region was once again being held “hostage to the war of hysteria” by India’s government and media, who immediately “began beating war drums”.
 
 

On the allegations implied by India, which has not yet named Pakistan or any entity directly, Sheikh said the suspects were reportedly Indian nationals whose homes have already been raided.
He questioned why India is looking outside its borders rather than addressing “administrative inadequacies” in occupied Kashmir. He slammed India’s broader policies in held Kashmir, including the alleged settlement of non-residents into the region.
Speaking about India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Ambassador Sheikh said: “That is as grossly illegal as it can get. This is one treaty that has withstood wars between India and Pakistan.”
Law Minister Azam Naz­eer Tarar said yesterday that Pakistan’s final response to India’s letters on the IWT would be crafted in consultation with all relevant ministries, including foreign affairs, water resources and law.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has also said Islamabad would approach international forums, including the World Bank that brokered it, regarding the treaty’s suspension.</p><small>2025-05-03 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/031807276431312.jpg?r=181148' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908191/left-leaning-pm-triumphs-in-australian-election' target='_blank'><strong>Left-leaning PM triumphs in Australian election</strong></a><br><p>Australia’s left-leaning Prime Minister Anthony Albanese triumphed on Saturday in national elections, crushing his conservative rival in a contest swayed by economic upheaval and Donald Trump.
Albanese’s slow-but-steady leadership resonated at a time of global tumult, analysts said, with voters deserting hard-nosed opposition leader Peter Dutton in droves.
Dutton said he had called the prime minister to congratulate him on the win.
“We didn’t do well enough during this campaign. That much is obvious tonight and I accept full responsibility,” he told supporters.
Not only was Albanese’s Labour Party on track for an unexpectedly large parliamentary majority, but former police officer Dutton faced the rare humiliation of losing his seat.
Elated Labour supporters swigged craft beers emblazoned with Albanese’s face at an election party in Sydney, chanting his “Albo” nickname as results were declared on TV.
“This could be a big win for Labour,” said respected election analyst Antony Green from national broadcaster ABC.
Albanese has promised to embrace renewable energy, tackle a worsening housing crisis, and pour money into a creaking healthcare system.
Dutton wanted to slash immigration, crack down on crime and ditch a longstanding ban on nuclear power.
US President Trump cast a long shadow over the six-week election campaign, sparking keen global interest in whether his tariff-induced economic chaos would influence the result.
“In times of instability, we expect people to go back to a kind of steady incumbent,” University of Sydney politics lecturer Henry Maher told AFP.
Dutton’s policy to slash the public service rankled as similar cuts, led by Elon Musk, brought chaos in the United States.
And his flagship policy to dot the country with nuclear reactors was also widely seen as a liability.
‘Mad as a cut snake’
Hungry voters munched on barbecued “democracy sausages” after casting their ballot — a polling day rite of passage — while others in bright swimwear crammed into booths after taking an early morning plunge.
Before the first vote was even counted, speculation was already mounting over whether Dutton could survive an election loss.
Some pre-vote polls showed Dutton leaking support because of Trump, who he praised this year as a “big thinker” with “gravitas” on the global stage.
“I mean, Donald Trump is as mad as a cut snake, and we all know that,” said voter Alan Whitman, 59, before casting his ballot on Saturday.
“And we’ve got to tiptoe around that.”
Voting is compulsory, enforced with fines of Aus$20, leading to turnouts that top 90 per cent.
High prices
As Australians soured on Trump, both Dutton and Albanese took on a more pugnacious tone.
“If I needed to have a fight with Donald Trump or any other world leader, to advance our nation’s interest, I’d do it in a heartbeat,” Dutton said in April.
Albanese condemned Trump’s tariffs as an act of “economic self-harm” and “not the act of a friend”.
Economic concerns have dominated the contest for the many Australian households struggling to pay inflated prices for milk, bread, power and petrol.
“The cost of living — it’s extremely high at the moment. So, taxes as well, is also another really big thing. Petrol prices, all the basic stuff,” human resources manager Robyn Knox told AFP in Brisbane.
Small business owner Jared Bell had similar concerns.
“Our grocery shops are definitely way more expensive than they were a couple years ago,” he said.
Campaign stumbles
Albanese’s government has embraced the global push towards decarbonisation, warning of a future in which iron ore and polluting coal exports no longer prop up the economy.
The 36-day campaign was a largely staid affair, but there were a few moments of unscripted levity.
Albanese tumbled backwards off the stage at a heaving campaign rally, while Dutton drew blood when he hit an unsuspecting cameraman in the head with a stray football.</p><small>2025-05-03 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/03180537fbc601a.jpg?r=180605' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908192/china-denies-accessing-data-after-tiktok-hit-with-huge-eu-fine' target='_blank'><strong>China denies accessing data after TikTok hit with huge EU fine</strong></a><br><p>China denied it required companies to hand over data after TikTok was hit with a massive fine in the European Union for its handling of personal data.
The social media giant was told to pay 530 million euros ($600 million) on Friday for transferring user data from Europe to China and failing to guarantee it was shielded from access by Chinese authorities.
Friday’s fine was the second-largest ever imposed by the European Union, following an investigation into the lawfulness of data transfers by TikTok.
Chinese-owned TikTok said it would appeal the decision.
China’s foreign ministry on Saturday said the country “has never and will never require enterprises or individuals to collect or store data by illegal means”.
It also called on the European Union and Ireland, home to TikTok’s European headquarters, to “provide a fair, just, and non-discriminatory business environment for enterprises of all countries”.
TikTok is a division of Chinese tech company ByteDance. But since its European headquarters is in Dublin, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission is the lead regulator in Europe for the platform.
The company has faced scrutiny in many countries over national security concerns that user data could be accessed by the Chinese government and worries the platform could spread misinformation.
 
 

Several countries have banned the platform for varying periods, including Pakistan, Nepal, and France in the territory of New Caledonia.
Friday’s fine is expected to increase pressure on the social network in the United States.
The US Congress passed a law in 2024 requiring ByteDance to divest control of TikTok in the United States or be banned from the country.
US President Donald Trump has postponed twice the deadline set for the sale of the social network, which has 170 million American users. That latest deadline is set to expire on June 19.
Beijing has consistently denied it accesses data from companies operating overseas and says it abides by local laws.</p><small>2025-05-03 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/031705551c7a64e.jpg?r=170613' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908187/national-womens-t20-cricket-tournament-to-start-on-may-7-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>National Women’s T20 cricket tournament to start on May 7 in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>A total of five teams will vie for the title of the National Women’s T20 Tournament 2025 beginning on May 7 at two venues in Karachi, the National Stadium and HPC Oval Ground, the Pakistan Cricket Board said on Saturday.
Last month, Pakistan finished the ICC Women’s World Cup 2025 Qualifiers unbeaten at the top of the table with a domineering victory over Bangladesh by seven wickets in Lahore to win the tournament.
Pakistan had already booked their spot for the World Cup to be held later this year on April 17, courtesy of their bowlers, who had once again stepped up to defend a below-par score of 205 against Thailand in their penultimate encounter of the tournament.
“The five-team National Women’s T20 Tournament 2024-25 will begin on May 7 at two venues in Karachi,” the PCB said in a press release.
The PCB added that this year’s edition will feature five teams — Challengers, Conquerors, Invincibles, Stars, and Strikers. Competing in a double-league format, each team will play eight matches with a total of 22 matches slated to take place across 18 days.

The teams finishing second and third on the points table will face off in a qualifier on May 22, with the winner advancing to meet the top-ranked team in the final on May 24. The final will be played at the National Stadium.
A total of 80 cricketers will participate in the tournament, which carries a prize pool of over Rs3 million. The champions will receive Rs1.5 million, while the runners-up will take home Rs1 million, the PCB added.
The 19-member squads of each of the five teams will be trimmed to 16 at the end of the four-day pre-tournament camp, which begins on May 3 in Karachi.
Among the players featuring, five national players, who were part of Pakistan’s victorious squad at the recently concluded World Cup Qualifiers tournament, will lead their respective sides.
Pakistan skipper Fatima Sana, who was named captain of the team of the Qualiifers tournament will be leading her side, Conquerors. Opener Gull Feroza will be leading Strikers, southpaw Muneeba Ali will be leading Invincibles, off-spinner Rameen Shamim will be leading Challengers, and veteran batter Sidra Amin will be captaining the Stars side.

Last year’s tournament was held in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, with Karachi and Lahore being declared joint winners of the tournament after the final at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium was called off without a ball being bowled due to rain.</p><small>2025-05-03 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0312390067beba5.jpg?r=124000' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908171/india-bans-all-imports-from-pakistan-suspends-inbound-mail-as-tensions-grow' target='_blank'><strong>India bans all imports from Pakistan, suspends inbound mail as tensions grow</strong></a><br><p>India said on Saturday it has banned the import of goods originating from or transiting via Pakistan and suspended the exchange of inbound mail and parcels as diplomatic tensions between the two nations flared in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of April 30, said it expected an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict.
India’s Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a notification, said the ban on all imports will take effect immediately.
“This restriction is imposed in the interest of national security and public policy,” it said.
 
 

In response to India’s slew of aggressive moves against the country in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan announced retaliatory measures that have included halting all border trade, closing its airspace to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats.
However, Pakistan earlier this week allowed 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, easing a weeks-long bottleneck, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
Trade between the two nations has dwindled over the last few years.
In August 2019, Pakistan had already formally downgraded its trade relations with India to the level of Israel, with which Islamabad has no trade ties at all, in reaction to New Delhi’s decision to revoke Article 370 of its constitution that granted occupied Kashmir a special status.
In another step to cut off ties, the Indian government also announced today it was suspending the exchange of all “inbound mail and parcels” from Pakistan.
“Government of India has decided to suspend exchange of all categories of inbound mail and parcels from Pakistan through air and surface routes,” a public notice issued by its communications ministry said, according to Hindustan Times.
The notification was also shared on the official X account of India’s Communications Minister Jyotiraditya M. Scindia.
 


Mail exchanges between the two arch-rivals also saw a breakdown in 2019 following India’s revocation of occupied Kashmir’s special status, according to ANI News.
Pakistan suspended postal mail services in August 2019 and resumed them in November that year, ANI said, citing Pakistani media reports.
Parcel services, however, remained suspended as of Nov 19, 2019, the report added.
Earlier today, India said Pakistani-flagged ships would not be allowed to visit any of its ports, and Indian flagged-ships would not visit any ports in Pakistan.
“This order is issued to ensure safety of Indian assets, cargo and connected infrastructure, in public interest and for interest of Indian shipping,” the Directorate General of Shipping said in a statement.
Following last week’s tit-for-tat measures, New Delhi has taken more steps against Pakistan, including closing its airspace for Pakistani planes until May 23 and blocking social media accounts of media and leaders.
Attaullah Tarar’s social media account also blocked
Meanwhile, India continued its blocking spree as Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said today his social media account had also been blocked in the neighbouring country, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
 
 

The Indian government has already blocked access to the official YouTube channel of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) for users in India.
India has blocked dozens of accounts so far in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, including of high-profile Pakistani cricketers, actors, entertainment channels, news publications and journalists.
Attempts to access these profiles in India, it said, now return a message stating: “Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content.”
LoC visit for media
Separately, the information ministry said it was facilitating a visit for media representatives, both local and international, to the Line of Control (LoC) for Saturday and Sunday “to expose India’s baseless and fabricated propaganda regarding so-called and imaginary ‘terrorist camps’ in Pakistan”.
“India has repeatedly made unfounded and baseless claims about alleged terrorist hideouts along the LoC,” the ministry said in a press release.
“During the visit, media representatives would be taken to the exact locations falsely propagated by India as terrorist camps and would be presented with factual, on-ground realities that refute these malicious allegations,” it said.
The ministry said that Pakistan reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to peace and “categorically rejected any form of terrorism or terrorist activities anywhere in the world”.
“The nation remains resolute in defending its sovereignty, and any aggression by India will be met with a swift and befitting response,” it concluded.

“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced manoeuverability features,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.
It noted that the launch was a part of “Ex Indus” and was witnessed by the commander of the Army Strategic Forces Command (AFSC), senior officials from the Strategic Plans Division and the AFSC, as well as scientists and engineers from Pakistan’s strategic organisations.
The ISPR also released a video of the successful launch.
 


President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the services chiefs extended their congratulations to the participating troops, scientists, and engineers, the ISPR said.
“They expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of Pakistan’s Strategic Forces to ensure credible minimum deterrence and safeguard national security against any aggression,” the statement added.
The test launch comes amid heightened tensions between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi’s aggressive measures in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
 
 

Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. Pakistan witnessed shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) in AJK for a week since April 25, with the Pakistan Army responding to unprovoked Indian firing.
Analysts in Pakistan told AFP the missile launch was a warning shot.
“It clearly indicates that we have the resources to counter India. This is not a message only for India but the rest of the world that we are well-prepared,” said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a military analyst.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Thursday asserted that any “misadventure” by India would be met with a “swift, resolute and notch-up response”. The next day, the army’s top brass also warned India of a “sure and decisive” response should it attempt to impose war.
As temperatures remain high, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict, with the United States and the European Union contacting top Pakistani and Indian leaders.
In August 2024, Pakistan conducted a successful training launch of the Shaheen-II surface-to-surface ballistic missile.

Mir, the head of Jamiat Ahle Hadith Pakistan, belonged to a suburban area of Punjab’s Sialkot.
A learned person and known for his scholarship, he held a Master’s degree in English and Islamic studies alongside a Bachelor’s in economics with Urdu and psychology. He was also a faazil in Dars-e-Nizami.
Mir was elected as a PML-N senator in 2021, which was his fifth time contesting the Senate election on the party’s ticket. He had also served as a senator from March 2009 to March 2015.
“The most interesting thing is that Prof Mir had never applied for the ticket. Mian [Nawaz Sharif] sahib always called him to offer it and did it on Thursday afternoon as well,” a party spokesman had said in February 2021.
In 2017, Professor Mir had called for an accord among all mainstream political parties to block the way for military interventions.
The news of his demise sent “shockwaves” across religious and political circles, with many expressing deep sorrow and paying tribute to his services, government-run APP stated.
Political leaders expressed their grief on Mir’s death, lauding his tireless advocacy for his party and Jamiat Ahle Hadith Pakistan, as well as his scholarly contributions.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a statement, conveyed his condolences and prayed for the high ranks of the departed soul.
He termed Mir a foresighted political personality and Islamic scholar, a press release from the PM Office said. The premier said Mir’s demise had created a vacuum in the national political scene, which could hardly be filled.
“Late Mir always raised his voice against extremism and sectarianism, which was a golden chapter in his contributions to politics and religion,” the prime minister was quoted as saying.
He also extended his sympathies to the scholar’s bereaved family.
Former premier and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif said in a post on X that he was deeply saddened by Mir’s “sudden death”.
“His (Mir’s) religious, academic and parliamentary services are unforgettable,” Nawaz said, praying for his high ranks and patience for his family.

Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
“Five Khwarij were sent to hell, while two were apprehended during three separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” the ISPR said.
Khwarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists.
In the first of the three operations, an IBO was conducted by the security forces in Bajaur District on the reported presence of terrorists.
“During the conduct of operation, [our] troops effectively engaged the Khwarij … and after an intense fire exchange, three Khwarij, including high-value target (HVT) Kharji Fareed Ullah, were sent to hell,” the statement added.
Another IBO was conducted in the general area of Dossali, North Waziristan District. “In [the] ensuing fire exchange, two Khwarij were effectively neutralised by the security forces,” the ISPR said.
In the third encounter that took place in Mohmand District, “security forces successfully busted a Kharji hideout and apprehended two terrorists, including HVT Kharji Lal Ameer Ibrahim,” the statement continued.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from these men, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Late last month, security forces killed 54 terrorists attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in the country in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-05-03 09:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0313442202d0b45.png?r=134537' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908168/trump-posts-spoof-picture-dressed-as-pope' target='_blank'><strong>Trump posts spoof picture dressed as pope</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Friday posted a spoof picture of himself dressed as the pope on his Truth Social platform after joking that he would like to be the next Catholic pontiff.
The president is seen in what appears to be an AI-generated color image, with his right index finger pointed toward the sky, wearing papal regalia, including white robes, a gold crucifix pendant and the miter hat.
 


It comes after Trump joked to reporters this week that he would like to be the next pope, just days before cardinals are due to start the conclave to elect the successor of Pope Francis who died on April 21.
Asked who he would like to succeed Pope Francis, Trump said: “I’d like to be pope, that would be my number one choice.” Trump went on to say that he did not have a preference but said there was a cardinal in New York who was “very good”.
He appeared to be referring to the archbishop of New York, Timothy Dolan, a theological conservative and fiercely opposed to abortion.
Trump attended the funeral service of Pope Francis last week, his first foreign trip since returning to power.
About 20 per cent of Americans declare themselves Catholic, and exit polls indicated in November that they voted around 60pc in favour of Trump.
Pope Francis had arguably been one of the most powerful moral voices on the world stage critical of Trump.
When Trump first ran for president in 2016, Francis was unsparing on his signature promise to build a border wall to seal off Mexico.
Francis told reporters, “Anyone, whoever he is, who only wants to build walls and not bridges is not a Christian.” Cardinals will gather on May 7 in a conclave in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope</p><small>2025-05-03 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0311075235a4ed9.jpg?r=111059' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908165/6-crushed-to-death-in-temple-stampede-in-indias-goa' target='_blank'><strong>6 crushed to death in temple stampede in India’s Goa</strong></a><br><p>Six people were crushed to death at a Hindu temple in India’s coastal state of Goa, officials said on Saturday, after thousands gathered for a popular fire-walking ritual.
Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened by the tragic stampede” at Lairai Devi temple in the village of Shirgao in the early hours of Saturday morning.
“Six people died even before they could be brought to the hospital,” Sawant told reporters.
He visited the hospital and said that “all possible support” would be given to the families of those killed or injured.
Vishwajit Rane, Goa state health minister, said “approximately 80” people were injured.
“Five are critical and on ventilator support, while the remaining are being treated in the specially created emergency ward,” he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office expressed “condolences to those who lost their loved ones”.
The Lairai Zatra is a key Hindu celebration in Goa and is marked by a fire-walking ceremony.

On February 15, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Chief of the Army Staff General Asim Munir inaugurated the ambitious Cholistan project to irrigate South Punjab’s lands amid public uproar and strong reservations in Sindh.
Days after the canals controversy was put to rest by the Council of Common Interests, Bilawal on Thursday claimed that the decision to carve them out was taken during the caretaker government, under the presidency of PTI’s Alvi.
Speaking during DawnNewsTV programme Doosra Rukh on Friday night, PTI MNA Ali Muhammad said that the party would question the former president if the charges being levelled against him by the PPP chairman were proven.
“If Bilawal has any evidence to support his claim, then he should provide it. The party will issue a show-cause notice to the Alvi and question him on the matter,” he said.
Ali Muhammad said that Bilawal should not take “wild guesses”, adding, “How was the project approved under President Zardari’s presence? Why did he [Zardari] not stop it before?”
He further said that the party stands with the people of Sindh.
The PTI leader also spoke on the heightened tensions with India following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.
He said, “In matters of [potential] war, we are all one.

They were poor with the bat against Zalmi, giving them 144 to chase, before Babar and Maaz — both scoring half centuries — combined for 100 runs in 60 balls to help Zalmi bounce back from a difficult start to chase down the target with 20 balls to spare.
 


Zalmi were reduced to 40-3 in the powerplay with Kyle Mayer striking on the second ball of the innings to get Mitch Owen, Ben Dwarshuis making Saim Ayub play on to his stumps and Mohammad Haris falling victim to a spectacular catch by Naseem Shah off Riley Meredith’s bowling.
Babar and Maaz initiated their response with caution, with only 20 runs coming in the next three overs, before Maaz pulled, and smacked Mayers straight down the ground for two sixes to take his team to 76-3 at halfway stage.
Maaz punished a wayward delivery by Naseem in the 12th over to bring up his 50 partnership with Babar before pulling Dwarshuis for another six and scored two boundaries off Saad Masood’s spin in the next over to reach his half century.
After the youngster creamed Meredith through long-off for another four, Babar (53 not out off 49, four fours and a six) joined the party, lifting the pacer over the same region for his first six. He brought up his half century and the 100-run partnership with Maaz with a four off Naseem in the 16th over.
The very over saw Maaz (55 off 33, four fours and three sixes) fall, but by that point, he had virtually won Zalmi the match.
Earlier, after winning the toss, United struggled to bat on a bowling friendly surface, before Dwarshuis’ late cameo helped them to 143-9.
Dwarshuis, coming in to bat with United reeling at 107-7 at the start of the 17th over, smashed three fours and two sixes in his knock of 33 off 17 balls.
He broke United’s shackles with a splendid four over midwicket, picking a slower shorter delivery by Ahmed Daniyal before clubbing the pacer over long-on.
After seeing Imad Wasim lose his wicket on the other end, Dwarshuis cleared long-on again, this time off Alzarri Joseph’s pace before getting a lucky boundary. He was helped by Babar’s misfielding at long-off for four more as United closed their innings.
The start of it saw openers Sahibzada Farhan and Mayers — playing his first match of the season — see off immense pace and movement by Joseph and Luke Wood to reach 49-0 in the powerplay.
Zalmi missed an opportunity for an early breakthrough when Farhan, after surviving an lbw appeal on the first ball of the match, played Wood straight into the hands of Babar at mid-off, only for the Zalmi captain to drop him.
Farhan, having celebrated his reprieve by bludgeoning three fours and a six in the first six overs, however, saw Babar eventually take him in the ninth over with Ahmed striking.
Mayers followed suit three balls later to give fast bowler Mohammad Ali his first wicket before Saim got Salman Ali Agha as Haris took a brilliant catch behind to wickets with the scoreboard reading 75-3 at the end of the 11th over.
The incoming Shadab Khan had hit two fours to end Saim’s wicket-taking over, but the all-rounder holed Joseph out to Maaz at midwicket before Ali (3-26) returned to get Colin Munro and Saad.
Azam Khan was next in line to lose his wicket, with Wood bouncing him out before Dwarshuis took over.

However, there are growing complaints of Sikh pilgrims about the Indian government making it harder for them to visit the Kartarpur corridor.
Sardar Ranbir Singh and Sardar Shan Singh, who crossed the border from Indian Punjab, talking to Dawn, said they had to go through difficult processes to come to Pakistan. They said the Indian government was trying to control the number of visitors crossing the border to visit Kartarpur. They said Sikh pilgrims were given respect in Pakistan that’s why they wanted to visit this country.
Sardar Vir Singh, another pilgrim, said he had come to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib for the third time through the Kartarpur Corridor. He said he could not understand why the Indian government was afraid of sending Sikhs to Kartarpur. He said there was propaganda about Pakistan in India by a particular group that had created panic.
Sardar Lal Singh and Singhara Singh said the founder of Sikhism Baba Guru Nanak was born in Pakistan and that the Sikhs living all over the world could never say “death to Pakistan”. They requested the Sikhs around the world to come to Kartarpur to pay for religious rituals.
The Sikh pilgrims expressed their solidarity with Pakistan and said, “We will stand by Pakistan in difficult times”.
WOMAN HELD WITH DRUGS: Sialkot police arrested a woman drug dealer and seized from her ice, heroin and other drugs worth Rs3.5m besides Rs1m cash.
A team raided a house near the Dhedowali railways crossing and arrested Shama Tauqir, a resident of Street Salo Gujar of Sialkot. Police recovered 6kg heroin, 6kg ice, 7kg hashish and 8kg of opium from her. Police also recovered more than Rs1m cash from the suspect.
District Police Officer Faisal Shahzad told Dawn that Police Station Saddar SHO Muhammad Razzaq was given the special task to break the network of drug dealers. He added that the woman had contacts with drug pushers in Peshawar and she was selling drugs in the Sialkot, Sambrial, Daska and Pasrur areas through her network.
Inspector Razzaq said the woman drug dealer recovered from the drug was worth Rs3.5m. He said the police would arrest her accomplices.

Modi was inaugurating a port in Kerala on Friday, and mocking the opposition when the Indian government also blocked access to the official YouTube channel of Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for users in India, invoking concerns over national security and public order, Kolkata-based Telegraph newspaper said on Friday.
It said the move was part of a wider crackdown on Pakistani digital content, following the April 22 attack in Pahalgam that left 26 civilians dead, most of them tourists.
Users trying to access PM Shehbaz’s YouTube profile are now met with a standard message: “This content is currently unavailable in this country because of an order from the government related to national security or public order.”
This is the most high-profile block since similar action was taken against the YouTube channels of Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the paper said.
India’s ministry of information and broadcasting has invoked emergency provisions under the Information Technology Act to direct major social media platforms to geo-restrict several Pakistani accounts that were allegedly involved in spreading anti-India narratives and misinformation.
Officials say the restrictions are part of a “coordinated counter-disinformation effort” in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
A notable segment of the crackdown has been directed at high-profile Pakistani cricketers, whose social media accounts enjoy massive Indian viewership.
“The Instagram handles of current and former players including Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf have been blocked for Indian users,” according to the report.
Attempts to access these profiles in India, it said, now return a message stating: “Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content.”
The YouTube channels of Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Akhtar, and Basit Ali have also been geo-restricted, making their content inaccessible to Indian audiences.
The action, officials say, is based on concerns that these public figures were either directly sharing or amplifying content that could be used to spread anti-India sentiment, particularly in the wake of the Kashmir attack.
Former players including Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Afridi (on Instagram) continue to have visible accounts, although, according to the report, more profiles could be under review.
Earlier, the YouTube channels of Shoaib Akhtar, Syed Muzammil Shah, and Arzoo Kazmi, channels such as Duniya Merey Aagay, Ghulam Nabi Madni, HAQEEQAT TV and HAQEEQAT TV 2.0 were also blocked for Indian users.
 
 

Olympic javelin silver medallist Arshad Nadeem’s Instagram account has also been blocked in India. The tenth edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), currently underway, is not being broadcast or streamed in India. Broadcasters Sony Sports Network and FanCode suspended telecast of the tournament following the Pahalgam strike, The Telegraph said.
The restrictions go beyond politics and sport. Earlier, the Instagram profiles of leading Pakistani actresses Mahira Khan and Hania Aamir were blocked for Indian users. Other celebrities, including Ali Zafar and Fawad Khan, have also faced similar action in recent days.
Officials in the ministry said that the government would continue to monitor and act against digital assets that pose a threat to India’s sovereignty, particularly in the context of terrorism, defence and foreign affairs.
IMF programme
Separately, India has also asked global multilateral agencies, including the IMF, to review funds and loans provided to Pakistan, as New Delhi seeks “to corner the neighbouring state diplomatically”.
“We will be asking all multilateral agencies to review the loans and support to Pakistan,” Reuters quoted a government source as saying.
 
 

Pakistan secured a $7 billion bailout programme from the IMF last year and was granted a new $1.3 billion climate resilience loan in  March.
Although the IMF and India’s finance ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, an adviser to Pakistan’s finance minister said the IMF programme is  “well on track”.
“The latest review has been done well and we are completely on  track,” Khurram Schehzad told Reuters, adding that Pakistan had  very productive spring meetings with financial institutions in  Washington.
“We did about 70 meetings … interest has been very  high for investing and supporting Pakistan as the economy turns around,”  Schehzad said.

• NA speaker praises journalists for demonstrating exceptional patriotism in post-Pahalgam incident situation
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Fede­ral Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has called upon the federal and provincial governments, to respect press freedom and freedom of expression, which are fast eroding in the country.
In a joint statement issued on the eve of Press Freedom Day, being observed the world over to­­day, PFUJ Acting President Khalid Khok­h­­ar and Secretary General Ars­h­­­­ad Ans­ari condemned the recent am­­endments made by the federal and Punjab governments to stifle the freedom of expression.
They said the am­­endments to the Prevention of Elec­tr­onic Crimes Act (Peca) 2025 made by the federal government and the Def­amation Law passed by the Punjab As­­­sembly were aimed at controlling the media.
The PFUJ leadership also regretted that the Journalist Safety Act, adopted by Parliament long ago, has still not been enforced as neither the commission has been constituted nor its rules framed by the government.
 
 

They also accused the government of issuing government advertisements — a vital source of revenue for media outlets — to only those media organisations that are toeing the government line. They noted that those organisations which are taking an independent stand are being denied official advertisements.
They pointed out that English language daily Dawn was also being punished for taking independent editorial stance by stopping the official advertisement to that newspaper, which was founded by Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
‘Journalism is public service’
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has paid rich tribute to journalists, editors, photographers, and media workers across Pakistan and around the world on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day.
In a statement issued by the Bilawal House, the PPP chairman said that the World Press Freedom Day serves as a poignant reminder that journalism is not merely a profession — it is a public service, a shield against tyranny, and a lifeline for any democratic society.
 
 

“In every unjust silence, in every muffled truth, freedom itself is wou­nded,” he added.  Mr Bhutto-Zardari pointed out that the unanimously pas­sed Constitution of 1973, which guarantees the freedom of speech, expression, and the press, was a historic gift from Quaid-i-Awam Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the country’s first elected prime minister.
He lauded the PPP-led Sindh government for taking a pioneering step by passing the Sindh Protection of Journalists and Other Media Practitioners Act, 2021, and establishing the Commission for the Protection of Journalists and Other Media Practitioners under this law.
The PPP chairman saluted the courage of media professionals who risk their lives to uncover and report the truth. He said: “A society without a free press is a body without a soul. Let us honour those who speak when others stay silent. Let us protect those who write so that we may read the truth.”
In his message, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said that freedom of the press is pivotal for the promotion of democratic values. He paid rich tribute to journalists serving in Palestine, Indian-occupied Kash­m­­ir, and other war-torn regions, recogni­sing their courage and professionalism.
Highlighting the role of Pakistani media during recent Indian aggressive policies in the region, Speaker Sadiq praised the journalistic community for demonstrating exceptional professionalism and patriotism. Through fact-based reporting, the media played a key role in revealing the true face of India to the international community.
 
 

He added that the role of the journalistic community is of vital importance in promoting a positive image of the country and fostering an informed society.
He also appreciated the important role played by journalists in the Press Gallery of the parliament, who serve as a bridge between legislative proceedings and the general public.
NA Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah affirmed parliament’s unwavering belief in freedom of expression and its commitment to ensuring that journalists have timely and accurate access to information. He said the National Assembly has consistently pursued legislation aimed at the protection and welfare of journalists.

According to sources, a group of armed men obstructed the national highway, intercepting numerous vehicles. They searched several vehicles, including passenger buses and private cars, halting all types of traffic along the route.
The sources said the armed group entered the Mongochar bazaar and took control of several government buildings, including the offices of Nadra, Judicial Complex, and National Bank of Pakistan, and set them on fire. The buildings suffered significant damage due to the fire.
The armed men fled the scene before security forces arrived.
Officials said that an operation was launched in the area, and traffic on the highway was restored late in the night.
In a separate incident, a group of armed men on motorcycles attacked a Levies check post near Kot-Langove, opening fire and killing a Levies official, identified as Haq Nawaz Langove.
 
 

Levies officials also reported a powerful explosion under a bridge on the Quetta-Karachi National Highway near the Rahimabad area of Kalat district, which slightly damaged a portion of the bridge. No casualties were reported.
Meanwhile, six people, including a woman and two children, were injured in a firing at a passenger coach in the Khudkocha area of Mastung.
Mastung Assistant Commissioner Akram Harifal said the injured were shifted to Ghous Bakhsh Memorial Hospital.

The fatal incident sparked public outrage as an angry mob set the water tanker on fire.
The police said that the driver responsible for the incident managed to flee.
DIG-Traffic Pir Mohammed Shah told Dawn that at around 10:10am, a loaded water tanker, driven recklessly by an unidentified driver, struck a motorcycle. As a result, Mushtaq, 52, and his wife Rehana, 48, were critically injured.
They were shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where Rehana died during treatment. The condition of her husband was reported to be out of danger.
The DIG claimed that initial findings suggested reckless driving by the tanker driver was the main cause of the accident. However, he said, a preliminary technical assessment also indicated negligence on the part of the motorcyclist, who overtook the tanker from the left side, which is considered a blind spot for heavy vehicles.
Truck hits bike
A man was killed and another injured when a truck hit a motorcycle on National Highway on Friday, police said.
Bin Qasim SHO Tahir Qadri said that the pillion riders were hit by the truck near Ghaghar Phatak. As a result, the rider, identified as Sawab Khan, 30, died on the spot while Manzoor Khan, 25, was critically injured. The police had arrested the errant driver, Naseer Ahmed, and seized the truck, the SHO added.
Preliminary inspection revealed that the trailer had no documents such as fitness certificate or transport permit.
Meanwhile, a passenger died after a Datsun van collided with a stationary trailer on M.M. Alam Road in the Malir Cantonment area.

“All the options are [on the table], including raising it in the Security Council. We will take the decision at the appropriate time,” said Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, at a news conference at the UN headquarters on Friday. He was responding to a question from the president of the UN Correspondents Association (UNCA).
Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris of Greece made his remarks on Thursday while briefing UN reporters in New York on the Security Council’s work programme under Greece’s month-long presidency.
“We are in close contact … but this is something which might happen, I would say, sooner rather than later. We will see, we are preparing. It’s the first day of our (UNSC) presidency,” Sekeris said.

Envoy to UN says Guterres, heads of General Assembly and Security Council, OIC Group in New York have been briefed on Pakistan’s position

He noted that a formal request had not yet been submitted but emphasised the value of such a discussion.
“Of course, if a request comes for a meeting, then… I think this meeting should take place because, as we said, maybe it’s also an opportunity to have views expressed and this might help to diffuse a bit tensions. We will see.”
Pakistan’s envoy warned that the current crisis could escalate rapidly.
“In this politically motivated and highly provocative environment created by India’s irresponsible and destabilising actions in the wake of the Pahalgam attack … as we speak, there is reasonable intelligence indicating towards imminent threat of kinetic action by India against Pakistan.”
 
 

He said Islamabad had already briefed key international stakeholders: “We have briefed the UN Secretary-General, Presidents of the General Assembly and the Security Council, the OIC Group in New York, and fellow members of the Security Council. We have also shared our position and concerns with various other international partners.”
Should India initiate hostilities, he said, “Pakistan will exercise its inherent and legitimate right to self-defence, as enshrined in the UN Charter”.
At the same time, Ambassador Asim condemned terrorism in clear terms. “Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Nothing justifies targeting of innocent civilians. We are concerned over the loss of lives in the Pahalgam attack, and we extended our condolences.”
He also criticised India’s reported move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). “Holding of IWT in abeyance is unilateral and illegal. There are no such provisions in the Treaty. India’s unilateral and unlawful actions are bound to undermine regional peace and stability with catastrophic implications.”
Ambassador Sekeris acknowledged the seriousness of the situation. “I have to tell you that we are also seriously concerned with the growing bilateral tension in the atmosphere, which has been evolving between India and Pakistan.”
“We are also joining others who are calling for de-escalation and dialogue so that the situation does not spiral out of control,” he added, noting that larger member states were in contact with both sides.
On the Pahalgam incident, Sekeris said, “It’s an issue which is very pertinent. As I said before, as a position of principle, we strongly condemn any act of terrorism and this is what we did” on the “heinous terrorist attack” in Pahalgam in which innocent civilians died.
He added, “Both India and Pakistan are far larger than Greece. So the size and volume are of a different nature. We also join calls for de-escalation and dialogue so that the situation does not spiral out of control”.

“They told us we didn’t belong here,” Dar said from  his home in India-held Kashmir, where he returned out of fear. “We left everything  behind — even goods worth thousands of dollars. We’re too  scared to go back.”
Footage of the assault quickly spread online, prompting police to  arrest three men. But they were released hours later with a fine and an  apology. By then, Dar and dozens of other Kashmiri traders had already  fled.
The backlash reflects a growing pattern of harassment targeting Kashmiris across India following the attack in Pahalgam.
In Indian Punjab, Ummat Shabir, a nursing student, said  her neighbour called her a “terrorist who should be thrown out”.
“My classmate was thrown out of a  taxi after the driver found out she was Kashmiri,” she said. The two  returned to India-held Kashmir after a three-day journey, fearing for their safety.
Even in Mussoorie, where Dar and his colleague Shafi Subhan had worked peacefully for decades, the atmosphere has changed.
“After the Pulwama attack in 2019, there was tension, but no one touched us,”  said Subhan, who has sold shawls in the town for 20 years. “This time,  no one stepped in to help us. People just watched. It hurt us physically — but emotionally, a lot more”
The violence  in Pahalgam — one of the deadliest attacks on civilians in recent years —  sparked widespread anger in India. Politicians across the spectrum  called for strong retaliation and many reports have emerged of  Kashmiri vendors and students facing threats and abuse in cities like  Delhi, Jaipur, and Chandigarh.
 
 

In response to the attack, Indian security forces launched a sweeping crackdown in held Kashmir, detaining thousands, sealing off tourist sites, increasing troop presence, and demolishing homes allegedly linked to Kashmiri fighters.
Rights groups and some local leaders have criticised the government’s response, calling the demolitions a form of collective punishment.
“Don’t let innocent people become collateral damage,” occupied Kashmir  Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said. His predecessor, Mehbooba Mufti,  warned authorities to distinguish “between terrorists and civilians”.
