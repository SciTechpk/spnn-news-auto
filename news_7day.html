25 OVER ANALYSIS
The Pakistani bowlers have done well to keep the Indian batters from scoring freely on a good pitch and make regular breakthroughs. The Green Shirts will now be looking to close out the second half of the match by building on the momentum of the first half.

15 OVER ANALYSIS
The match is evenly poised at the 15th over mark. Pakistan have struck twice to remove the Indian openers after putting the pressure on by building the dots since the latter half of the powerplay. India need to build a partnership as the batting conditions look really good. Pakistan will be looking to make further inroads to restrict India to a low total.

Pakistan have opted to bowl first, with Sadiq Iqbal opening for the Green Shirts as they face India in the cricket field yet again on Sunday, this time in the Women’s World Cup 2025.
While India is hosting this year’s tournament, Pakistan will play all their matches of the 50-over World Cup in Sri Lanka under a hybrid model decided in November after India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy.
 






Fatima Sana is leading the Green Team, while Harmanpreet Kaur is captaining the Women in Blue. The game will begin at 2:30pm PKT at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.
As of 2pm (Sri Lanka time), ESPNcricinfo reported that the weather was “dry, although there are dark clouds hovering over the stadium”.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) had said “fans have free entry to all” the World Cup matches being played in Colombo.
 
 

As the rivals meet for a fourth consecutive Sunday on the cricket field, tensions from the recent men’s Asia Cup may spill into the ongoing event as well.
Ahead of all the chatter on the issue of handshakes in Asia Cup, Sana made it clear that her side’s focus was solely on cricket.
Earlier this week, a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official said there was “no assurance” that India and Pakistan players would shake hands during their fixtures.
The semi-finals are scheduled for October 29 and 30, before the final takes place on November 2.</p><small>2025-10-05 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05151008712b075.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946774/uk-police-investigating-suspected-arson-at-england-mosque-as-hate-crime' target='_blank'><strong>UK police investigating suspected arson at England mosque as hate crime</strong></a><br><p>Police said on Sunday they were investigating a suspected arson at a mosque in southern England as a “hate crime”, days after a fatal attack on a synagogue.
Officers were called to the incident at the mosque in the south coast town of Peacehaven late on Saturday.
No one was injured, but the blaze caused damage to the mosque’s front entrance and a vehicle parked outside.
According to a statement from Sussex Police, emergency services were called to the fire at the building in Phyllis Avenue at about 9.50pm UK time on Saturday (1:50am PKT, Sunday).
 






“This is a fast-moving investigation, and we are urging anyone with relevant information to report it to us. This includes anyone with CCTV, Ring Doorbell, dashcam, and mobile phone footage in the area at the time,” Sussex Police Detective Superintendent Karrie Bohanna said in the statement.
“We understand the concerns this has caused within the community, and the impact that will be felt by the Muslim community as a result.
“There is already an increased police presence at the scene, and there are also additional patrols taking place to provide reassurance at other places of worship across the county.”
Bohanna added that the Sussex Police had a “zero-tolerance approach to hate crime”, adding there was no place for hate across the county.
A volunteer working at the mosque, who chose not to be named, told the BBC that “two people tried to enter through the front door, only to find it locked.”
“They then poured a liquid at the entrance and near a car parked outside, which was set alight. It could have been murder,” the man said.
He added that two people inside the mosque managed to escape, per the report.
Member of the Scottish Parliament and ex-first minister Humza Yousaf said in a post on X that such incidents were taking place because all Muslims were blamed for the actions of a few extremists.
“We warned you. Many politicians & media outlets have put a target on every Muslim’s back by blaming all of us, and Islam, for the horrific Synagogue attack,” he said.
“Thursday’s attack was the actions of one deranged extremist. This is what happens when you blame an entire community.”
 






The fire follows Thursday’s attack on a synagogue in northern Manchester in which two people died and three others were seriously injured.
British police later they accidentally shot a victim, as well as one of the survivors, as they attempted to stop an attacker who appeared to be wearing an explosive belt.
The attacker, shot dead by officers at the scene, was not carrying a firearm, said Greater Manchester Police chief constable Steve Watson, though one of those killed suffered a gunshot wound.</p><small>2025-10-05 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0516141753686ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946763/trump-authorises-troops-to-chicago-as-judge-blocks-portland-deployment' target='_blank'><strong>Trump authorises troops to Chicago as judge blocks Portland deployment</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump authorised the deployment of troops to Chicago after a federal agent shot an allegedly armed motorist there on Saturday. At the same time, a judge blocked the Republican leader’s attempt to send the military into Portland, another Democratic-run city.
The escalating crisis across the country pits Trump’s increasingly militarised anti-crime and migration crackdown against opposition Democrats who accuse him of an authoritarian power grab.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement that “President Trump has authorised 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets” in Chicago. This comes after weeks of Republican threats to send troops to the Midwestern city over the wishes of local leaders.
“President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.”
Illinois Senator Dick Durbin called the move a “shameful chapter in our nation’s history”, adding that the “president is not intent on fighting crime. He is intent on spreading fear.”
 






Chicago and Portland are the latest flashpoints in the Trump administration’s rollout of raids, following the deployment of troops to Los Angeles and Washington.
The raids have seen groups of masked, armed men in unmarked cars and armoured vehicles target residential neighbourhoods and businesses, sparking protests.
Trump has repeatedly called Portland “war-ravaged” and riddled with violent crime, but in Saturday’s court order, US District Judge Karin Immergut wrote “the President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts.”
Although the city has seen scattered attacks on federal officers and property, the Trump administration failed to demonstrate “that those episodes of violence were part of an organised attempt to overthrow the government as a whole,” Immergut wrote in granting a temporary restraining order.
Protests in Portland did not pose a “danger of rebellion,” and “regular law enforcement forces” could handle such incidents, Immergut said.
Oregon Senator Ron Wyden applauded the order, saying the “victory supports what Oregonians already know: we don’t need or want Donald Trump to provoke violence by deploying federal troops in our state.”
 






White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller wrote on social media that the judge’s order was “legal insurrection” and accused local leaders in Oregon of conducting an “organised terrorist attack on the federal government.”
 






‘Operation Midway Blitz’
Earlier on Saturday, a federal officer in Chicago shot a motorist after law enforcement agents were “boxed in by 10 cars,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said.
“Agents were unable to move their vehicles and exited the car. One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
“Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen,” she said.
AFP could not independently verify the DHS version of the event.
The agency said the motorist “drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds,” but Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Merritt told the Sun-Times newspaper that she was found in fair condition and taken to a local hospital.
McLaughlin also accused Chicago police of “leaving the shooting scene” with officers refusing “to assist us in securing the area”.
Chicago police told local broadcaster Fox 32 that officers responded to the scene, but the department “is not involved in the incident or its investigation. Federal authorities are investigating this shooting.”
Following the shooting, protesters who had gathered, chanting “ICE go home!” were met with tear gas and pepper balls, temporarily dispersing before returning, the Sun-Times reported.
Protesters left after federal agents vacated the scene.
 


Trump’s “Operation Midway Blitz” was launched in Chicago last month, and Saturday’s shooting is not the first time federal agents have opened fire.
Department of Homeland Security officials said ICE officers shot and killed 38-year-old immigrant Silverio Villegas Gonzalez during a traffic stop on September 12, accusing him of allegedly trying to flee the scene and dragging an ICE officer with the vehicle.</p><small>2025-10-05 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0515024898076c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946775/landslides-and-floods-kill-63-in-nepal-india' target='_blank'><strong>Landslides and floods kill 63 in Nepal, India</strong></a><br><p>Landslides and floods triggered by heavy downpours in Nepal and neighbouring India have killed more than 60 people, officials said Sunday, as rescue workers raced to reach cut-off communities in remote mountainous terrain.
Torrential downpours have lashed Nepal since Friday, leaving rivers in spate and many areas in the Himalayan nation inundated.
At least 43 people have died in rain-triggered disasters and five are missing, Shanti Mahat, spokeswoman for Nepal’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, told AFP.
At least 37 were killed by landslides in the worst-affected eastern district of Illam.
“Heavy rains overnight caused the landslides,” said local district official Sunita Nepal.
“With roads blocked, some areas are difficult to reach. Rescue workers are heading there on foot.”
 


Rivers in the capital Kathmandu have also swelled, inundating settlements along their banks.
Security personnel were deployed to assist rescue efforts with helicopters and motorboats.
“There is some damage, but thanks to the authorities’ prior flood alert, we were able to move some belongings to a safe place,” said vegetable seller Rajan Khadga, 38.
Landslides have blocked several highways and disrupted flights, leaving hundreds of travellers, many returning after celebrating the Hindu festival of Dashain, stranded.
Prime Minister Sushila Karki said government agencies were “fully prepared for rescue and relief”.
“Your safety is our utmost concern. Do not hesitate to seek necessary assistance,” she said in an address, adding that the government has declared Sunday and Monday public holidays and urged people not to travel unless necessary.
Across the border in India, at least 20 people were killed in the tea-growing hill district of Darjeeling in West Bengal state after heavy overnight rain unleashed flash floods and landslides that destroyed homes and infrastructure.
“In the wake of last night’s heavy cyclone in the Darjeeling hills, over 20 people have lost their lives,” said Harsh Vardhan Shringla, a lawmaker in India’s upper house.
Footage on Indian television news showed rescue workers using cables to access cut-off regions as raging waters smashed into bridges and caved in roads.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “pained by the loss of lives”.
“The situation in Darjeeling and surrounding areas is being closely monitored in the wake of heavy rains and landslides,” he said in a statement on social media.
 






Monsoon rains, usually from June to September, bring widespread death and destruction every year across South Asia, but the number of fatal floods and landslides has increased in recent years.
Experts say climate change has worsened their schedule, frequency and intensity.
The Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development warned in June that communities faced heightened disaster risks this monsoon season.
“Rising temperatures and more extreme rain raise the risk of water-induced disasters such as floods, landslides, and debris flows,” it said.</p><small>2025-10-05 11:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05134854a270b1a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946766/taking-our-cover-to-settle-own-issues-with-pm-sharjeel-memon-accuses-punjab-govt-of-conspiring-against-centre' target='_blank'><strong>‘Taking our cover to settle own issues with PM’: Sharjeel Memon accuses Punjab govt of conspiring against Centre</strong></a><br><p>The latest accusation in the ongoing rift between the PPP and PML-N came from Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon on Sunday when he alleged that the Punjab government was taking his party’s cover to “target” the federal government.
Memon’s PPP and the PML-N, who are coalition partners in the Centre, have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government.
As the row continues between the two sides, Memon alleged while addressing a press conference in Karachi that on the face of it, the Punjab government was “indirectly targeting” the PPP, but their “actual target is the federal government”.
“They are taking our cover to settle their own issues with the prime minister or the federal government. Or they are trying to create an environment to [compel] us not to support the federal government, which would create problems for the federal government,” he claimed.
 






Clarifying that the PPP was supporting the federal government on specific issues and to keep the country’s “political system running”, he asserted that the circumstances that the Punjab government tried to create spoke of their intentions of creating a rift between the allies in the Centre.
“But we will not let this conspiracy of the Punjab government against the federal government succeed,” Memon asserted.
“I do not know why they have these jealousy factors,” he quipped, highlighting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army chief’s recent “successful” visits to Saudi Arabia and the United States. “A person thinks that ‘maybe this should have come in my share, why is it going to the prime minister’.”
The PPP leader further said that while the chief ministers of Sindh and Balochistan usually receive the premier whenever he visits the provinces, “his own Punjab administration neither receives him nor gives him any protocol”.
“If you have any issues with the prime minister, please keep them among yourselves. Do not bring the PPP into it,” Memon said.
Regardless, the Sindh minister said, the focus at the moment should be on providing relief to the flood-hit people. “Even if you had blacked out the news from some places, but if you look on the ground […] especially in southern Punjab, the condition of the people is very bad.”
 






Memon further said: “You say we are doing politics [on the issue]. We are not doing politics. We are genuinely worried for our brothers and sisters in Punjab. Instead, those people who are even putting their pictures on boxes of biscuits are doing politics.”
He recalled that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had asked the Centre to issue an appeal for international assistance and that his party had demanded that immediate flood relief be provided through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
The minister pointed out that the appeal was towards the federal government but it was the Punjab government that was reacting negatively to them, despite the Centre giving the PPP “reassurances”.
Memon assails Punjab-backed campaign to support vlogger’s anti-Sindh remarks
Memon also indirectly referred to the remarks made last month by YouTuber Rizwan Razi, whose content aired on national electronic media was decried as hate speech against the Sindhi community and led to a war of words between the coalition partners.
 
 

While a Senate committee had grilled Razi for making the derogatory remarks and the PTV had terminated his services, CM Maryam openly came out in support of the vlogger, with a social media campaign launched to express solidarity with him.
During his media briefing, Memon alleged that the Punjab government “staged another drama to divert from this entire matter (of floods), which is extremely unfortunate, damaging, and I think it was handled in a very childish manner”.
Detailing the sequence of events without naming Razi, the PPP leader said the Senate panel’s proceedings were still ongoing when a “campaign strongly in his favour” was launched from the social media accounts of the Punjab government and some of its top ministers.
 


Recalling that Maryam had “urged that the person be forgiven as he had apologised”, Memon questioned how the country’s anti-hate speech and electronic media laws would be implemented if people were to be let go in this manner.
“If you are giving these examples, then release all the people that are sitting in your  jails across Punjab,” he said.
“However, I would say that she is not at fault. Her scriptwriter is leading her onto the wrong path […] and advises her to run campaigns […] Remember a ‘Vote Ko Izzat Do’ campaign was run once, and very good respect was also given,” Memon quipped.
The PPP minister affirmed that whether it was a Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, Pashtun or from any other community, “all live like brothers and respect each other”.</p><small>2025-10-05 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0514324240f3c45.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946769/muslim-countries-that-worked-with-trump-on-gaza-plan-welcome-hamass-steps-regarding-proposal-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Muslim countries that worked with Trump on Gaza plan welcome Hamas’s ‘steps regarding proposal’: FO</strong></a><br><p>The eight Muslim countries that worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza have welcomed the “steps taken by Hamas” in this connection, the Foreign Office said on Sunday.
On Friday, Hamas said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan — which was announced on Monday after a meeting between the US president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and seek further negotiations. While the Trump administration worked with eight Muslim countries last month to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end, reservations have been expressed from that latter’s side that the plan unveiled by the White House was not the one originally agreed upon.
Nevertheless, they see Hamas’s partial agreement to the plan as an opportunity for a ceasefire in Gaza after an onslaught of around two years.
 
 

“The Foreign Ministers of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Republic of Turkiye, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Qatar and the Arab Republic of Egypt, today welcomed the steps taken by Hamas regarding US President Donald Trump’s proposal to end the war on Gaza, release all hostages, alive or deceased, and the immediate launch of negotiations on implementation mechanisms,” a FO statement said.
The foreign ministers also welcomed Trump’s call on Israel to immediately stop the bombing in Gaza and begin implementation of the prisoner-hostage exchange agreement, it added.
“They expressed appreciation for his commitment to establishing peace in the region. They also affirmed that such developments represent a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire, and to address the critical humanitarian conditions facing people in Gaza Strip,” the FO statement read.
According to the FO, the foreign ministers also welcomed the announcement by Hamas of its “readiness to hand over the administration of Gaza to a transitional Palestinian Administrative Committee of independent technocrats”.
They also emphasised the need for the immediate launch of negotiations to agree on mechanisms to implement the proposal and address all of its aspects.
“The foreign ministers reiterated their joint commitment to support efforts towards the implementation of the proposal to work for the immediate end of the war in Gaza and achieve a comprehensive agreement that ensures unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of the Palestinian people, that no measures are taken that threaten the security and safety of civilians, the release of hostages, the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank, reaching a security mechanism that guarantees the security of all sides in a manner that leads to the full Israeli withdrawal […] the rebuilding of Gaza and that […] a path [is created] for just peace on basis of the two-state solution,” the statement said.
From Gaza invasion to Trump’s plan
Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced.
Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement.
After multiple attempts to mediate a ceasefire between Palestine’s Hamas and  Israeli, a significant development came last month when Trump engaged eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, to end the onslaught in Gaza.
Merely days later, the White House revealed the US president’s 20-point plan for Gaza. Simultaneously, Trump held a meeting with the Israeli prime minister and held a press conference alongside him, announcing his agreement to the proposal.
 
 

But, some Muslim countries engaged on the matter have said that Trump’s plan was not the one they originally agreed to.
Meanwhile, US news outlet Axios reported that the deal now before Hamas was significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention.
The main stumbling block, it seems, were the last-minute edits secured by Netanyahu when he held a six-hour meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
These included the conditions and timetable for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and the proposal ties Israel’s withdrawal to the progress of disarming Hamas, and gives Israel a veto over the process.
Even if all conditions are met and three phases of withdrawal are completed, Axios reported that Israeli forces would still remain within a security perimeter “until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.
Although there was no push-back publicly, officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkiye were furious over the changes behind the scenes, Axios reported.
According to the report, the Qat­a­ris even tried to convince the Trump administration not to release the det­ailed plan on Monday due to those objections. The White House relea­s­­ed it anyway, and pushed the Arab and Muslim countries to support the plan. The eight Muslim countries then issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s announcement, but without expressing full support for it. The Qataris told the other countries that after the generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details, sources told Axios.
 
 

On Monday, Qatar and Egypt shared the 20-point plan with Hamas following which Trump gave the group “three to four days” to accept the proposal or meet “a very sad end”.
Later, he gave Hamas until 2200 GMT on Sunday (3am PKT on Monday) to accept his plan for peace in Gaza, warning that the Palestinian resistance group would face “all hell” if it did not agree to the terms.
On Friday, Hamas — which had not been included in negotiations about the proposal — said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan to end the Gaza invasion, including releasing hostages, but avoided addressing more vexing issues like disarmament and said it would seek further negotiations.
Yesterday, Trump called on Israel to stop bombing Gaza immediately and he believes Hamas was ready for peace. However, reports of bombing in Gaza continue to come.</p><small>2025-10-05 10:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05144246858ac7d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946771/pope-leo-after-trump-critique-urges-catholics-to-help-immigrants' target='_blank'><strong>Pope Leo, after Trump critique, urges Catholics to help immigrants</strong></a><br><p>Pope Leo urged the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics on Sunday to care for immigrants, pressing ahead with a message of welcome for migrants days after criticising US President Donald Trump’s hard-line anti-immigration policies.
Leo, the first US pope, told thousands of pilgrims celebrating Mass in St. Peter’s Square that immigrants should not be treated with “the coldness of indifference or the stigma of discrimination”.
The pope, who did not single out any country for its treatment of migrants, called on Catholics to “open our arms and hearts to them, welcoming them as brothers and sisters, and being for them a presence of consolation and hope.”
Pope talks of ‘new missionary age’
Leo had criticised the Trump administration’s immigration policies on September 30, questioning whether they were in line with the Catholic Church’s pro-life teachings, in comments that drew heated backlash from some prominent conservative Catholics.
On Sunday, the pope said the global Church was experiencing “a new missionary age” in which it was tasked with offering “hospitality and welcome, compassion and solidarity” to migrants fleeing violence or searching for a safe place to live.
“In the communities of ancient Christian tradition, such as those of the West, the presence of many brothers and sisters from the world’s South should be welcomed as an opportunity, through an exchange that renews the face of the Church,” he said.
Elected in May to replace the late Pope Francis, Leo has shown a much more reserved style than his predecessor, who frequently criticised the Trump administration and often spoke in surprise, off-the-cuff remarks.
Leo spoke on Sunday from a prepared text. He was addressing a weekend event during the Catholic Church’s ongoing holy year that was specially organised for migrants, which the Vatican said had attracted more than 10,000 pilgrims from some 95 countries.</p><small>2025-10-05 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05140554390a921.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946767/boy-hospitalised-in-thailand-after-attack-by-escaped-lion' target='_blank'><strong>Boy hospitalised in Thailand after attack by escaped lion</strong></a><br><p>A lion kept at a private home in Thailand got loose and attacked a young boy, leaving him in hospital, the wildlife department said Sunday.
The lion attacked the child, who was hospitalised with unspecified injuries, while he was walking on a public road Saturday night in western Kanchanaburi province, about a two-hour drive from the capital Bangkok, the department said in a statement.
Local media said the boy was on his way home from playing with other children when the big cat pounced on him.
Lion ownership is legal in Thailand, where the captive population has exploded in recent years, with nearly 500 registered in zoos, breeding farms, petting cafes and homes.
But experts have warned the trend endangers animals and humans, and likely fuels illicit trade domestically and abroad.
The lion’s owner, who the wildlife department identified only as Parinya, was charged with violating wildlife protection laws and faces up to six months in prison and a 50,000 baht ($1,500) fine if convicted.
The lion was seized by authorities, the department said, adding that a wildlife breeding centre had prepared a new home for it.
Parinya told local TV he was “shocked” when he learned of the attack, saying the female lion got loose after it was removed from its cage while it was being renovated.
“I apologise for what happened, it was an accident,” he said, adding that he will pay compensation and for the boy’s medical treatment.
In its statement, the wildlife department urged people who “keep wild animals to be aware of the potential dangers, as all animals have a ferocious instinct”.
“Any unforeseen incident that affects the life and property of others will be punished and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” it added.
Since 2022, Thai law has required owners to register and microchip lions, and inform authorities before moving them, but there are few enclosure or welfare requirements.
Last month, a zookeeper was mauled to death by several lions at a safari park on the outskirts of Bangkok, raising scrutiny of the facility, which offers lion- and tiger-feeding trips for about $40 per person.</p><small>2025-10-05 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05130439e250ba1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946764/first-of-3-supermoons-to-be-seen-on-tuesday-night-suparco' target='_blank'><strong>First of 3 supermoons to be seen on Tuesday night: Suparco</strong></a><br><p>A supermoon will be visible in the night sky late Tuesday evening (Oct 7), the first of three supermoons set to occur in 2025, according to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco).
A supermoon occurs when the moon reaches its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, causing it to appear unusually large and bright — up to 14 per cent larger and nearly 30pc brighter than a typical full moon.
According to an official statement by a Suparco spokesperson, the first supermoon will occur at 8:47pm PKT on Tuesday, rising in the east just after sunset and setting in the west just before dawn.
“This year, the October 7 supermoon will be at a distance of 224,599 miles (about 361,457 kilometres) from Earth, making it 6.6pc larger and 13pc brighter than an average full moon,” the statement said.
This supermoon will appear close to the planet Saturn, which can be spotted west of the Moon on Monday and Tuesday evening.
It added that the brightest supermoon of the year is expected to occur in November, when the moon will be 221,817 miles (about 356,980 km) away.
The phenomenon will be visible not just in Pakistan but across the globe, offering a “breathtaking sight” in the night sky. Following this, two more supermoons will be visible on November 5 and December 5.
In September, a rare blood moon — a total lunar eclipse — eluded Karachi stargazers as heavy cloud cover blocked the view.
In August of 2023, a once-in-a-decade “super blue Moon” lit up the sky, with “blue” simply referring to a full moon seen twice in the same month.</p><small>2025-10-05 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0510251864fb375.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946655/pakistan-india-meet-again-this-time-at-womens-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India meet again, this time at Women’s World Cup</strong></a><br><p>COLOMBO: It’s the fourth consecutive Sunday of a Pakistan-India cricket encounter; the only difference being that the hot and arid climate of Dubai has been replaced with the humid and rainy weather of Colombo, and of course, the gender of the players on the field.
However, the differences are starker once a person starts to peel back the surface of the women’s game in both countries.
On one hand, we have players from across the border who have opportunities like the Women’s Premier League available, where compensation reaches upwards of $400,000 for the highest-paid players.
On the other hand, barring a few players in the national side and those who make it to final rosters of a handful of cricket leagues worldwide — Pakistani domestic women cricketers’ monthly retainers were even less than the government-mandated minimum wage this year.
To say that the gulf in resources available to both teams is large would be an understatement of the century.
 






Furthermore, in yet another familiar scenario at the start of an ICC tournament, the Indian team is going into the encounter with a win against co-hosts Sri Lanka, while Pakistan have lost to Bangladesh in their opening encounter — a side they had beaten with ease in the Qualifiers in April.
However, the Pakistan skipper was at her usual jovial best at the pre-match press conference on Saturday, seemingly putting last match’s result behind her.
Ahead of all the chatter on the issue of handshakes in men’s Asia Cup encounters from last month, she made it clear that her side’s focus was solely on cricket.
“Obviously, our main goal is to play, and when we come here, our focus is only on the game … whatever comes in the spirit of the game, we try to maintain that,” Fatima said.
 






She also touched upon moments of camaraderie between the two sides, like the last World Cup encounter in New Zealand, where Indian players had playfully interacted with Bismah Maroof’s newborn baby, Fatima.
The Indian skipper, Kaur, however, could not give her take as the Indian management chose to send the bowling coach Aavishkar Salvi to the pre-match presser.
When asked about the bitterness from the men’s encounters disrupting the relationships of the players here as well, Salvi never got the chance to answer as the question was deemed too political for the presser.
Pakistan’s chances of making it to the next stage might have been further hampered by Saturday’s result in Colombo, where a rained-out fixture meant both Sri Lanka and Australia shared a point each.
 
 

This would make Fatima’s aim of finishing in the top four more difficult, as the extra point that Sri Lanka got in this match could be the difference between making the cut or not.
The square, which has remained under the covers throughout the day with rain pouring down means both sides’ pacers will be rearing to go early in the innings.
Bowlers to look out for would be Pakistan’s Diana Baig, who goes into the encounter with decent bowling rhythm, and Indian off-spinner Sneh Rana who is the second-highest wicket-taker in ODIs this year.
“Everyone knows that she’s one of our best players. She’s a good bowler and also a very good fielder. So it definitely boosts our team as well,” Fatima said of Diana’s encouraging performance in the opening encounter.
Echoing her remarks after the Bangladesh loss, Fatima said the toss or conditions would not be that important as the pitch remained the same for both sides throughout.
“The pitch doesn’t matter much; all we have to do is play good cricket after assessing the conditions.”
With rain predicted for Sunday as well, there is a glimmer of hope for the Green Shirts as a washed-out encounter or one curtailed by the downpour could tip the odds in their favour.
Their record against India across 11 One-day Internationals is an unenviable one — never once winning a tie, but across T20Is, there is still a better record to boast about.
The women’s side have beaten India on three occasions in the format — with their first win in a World Cup coming back in 2012 — nine years before the men’s side achieved that feat.
Speaking about the ODI record, the Pakistani skipper said: “Records are meant to be broken, we won’t go on past histories, but will take the match on the day and try to execute our plans.”
Fatima and co. would have to channel their best in the field to add another win to that tally — and maybe the rain clouds in the Sri Lankan capital might have a silver lining for the Women in Green.

The cryptocurrency reached $125,689, shooting above its previous August record of around $124,500.
Bitcoin has enjoyed a strong upward momentum, with investors cautious about the United States’ government shutdown.
Gains in US shares have also supported bitcoin’s rise, while investors have looked to safe haven assets while US lawmakers negotiate over funding the federal government, Bloomberg News said.
US President Donald Trump and his family have also been big promoters of cryptocurrencies and are involved in various crypto endeavours that have inflated his wealth.
 
 

Trump’s embrace of digital assets has reversed years of US government scepticism towards the crypto industry under his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, with the US House of Representatives passing three landmark cryptocurrency bills in July.
These regulatory changes have seen the value of bitcoin soar.
“With many assets including equities, gold and even collectibles like Pokemon cards hitting all-time highs, it’s no surprise Bitcoin is benefiting from the dollar debasement narrative,” Joshua Lim, co-head of markets at crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX, was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying.</p><small>2025-10-05 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05112004525f1ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946752/failed-attempt-at-restoring-lost-reputation-khawaja-asif-reacts-to-indian-military-political-leaderships-statements' target='_blank'><strong>Failed attempt at restoring lost reputation: Khawaja Asif reacts to Indian military, political leadership’s statements</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Sunday reacted to statements made by the Indian military and political leadership, terming them a “failed attempt” to restore their “lost reputation”.
While he did not specify any particular statement that he was reacting to, his remarks follow recent aggressive comments from the Indian side, mentioning terrorism and warning of action. India has long accused Pakistan of cross-border terrorism, an allegation that Islamabad has repeatedly refuted and termed baseless.
“The statements made by the Indian army and its political leadership are a failed attempt to restore its lost reputation,” Asif said on X.
 






He also referred to a four-day escalation between India and Pakistan in May, during which Islamabad says it downed at least six Indian jets.
Asif said India faced a “decisive defeat with a score of 6-0” in the escalation,  and “if they try again [to go to fight], God willing, the score will be much better than the last time”.
“The way the public opinion in India turned against the government after the worst defeat in history, and the way [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and his group have lost their reputation, it is apparent from their statements that they [are feeling] the pressure,” Asif added.
 
 

“This time, God willing, India will get buried under the rubble of its own jets,” the minister asserted.
‘Cataclysmic devastation’
Asif’s remarks come a day after the military warned that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and Pakistan would “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”.
The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) came in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in case of a fresh round of hostilities.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,” the ISPR said.
Indian media outlet NDTV reported on Friday that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion.
 
 

The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed, without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.”
In response, the ISPR said in its statement that the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”.
It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia.
The ISPR concluded its statement, saying: “Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.”
May conflict
The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
 
 

In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command, that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India.
The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army.
The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines. The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger.</p><small>2025-10-05 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0508060254a336e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946705/14-terrorists-killed-in-khuzdar-operation' target='_blank'><strong>14 terrorists killed in Khuzdar operation</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Security forces killed 14 terrorists of the Indian proxy group Fitna al-Hindustan in an operation conducted in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district on Saturday.
The state designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Security officials said the forces launched the operation on the basis of intelligence reports about the presence of the group’s militants in the mountainous area of Zehri tehsil.
According to the officials, the area was cordoned off before the action was launched. Heavy firing took place between the security forces and the terrorists, which continued for several hours.
“As many as 14 terrorists were killed in the gun battle, while 20 others were injured,” the officials said, adding that a large quantity of arms, ammunition, and other equipment was seized from their possession.
The Zehri operation, they added, was carried out days after security forces killed seven India-sponsored terrorists in an intelligence-based operation in Sherani district of Balochistan.
 
 

They said several hideouts established by the militants in the mountainous terrain were destroyed during the operation.
“Residents of the Zehri area praised the operation, acknowledging the efforts of the security forces in restoring peace and order to the region, which had been disturbed for a long time,” the officials said, adding that the terrorists had been harassing and blackmailing local residents.
Officials reaffirmed that the security forces remain fully committed to elimina­ting the remaining milita­nts of Fitna al-Hindustan.
On Oct 1, security forces had killed 13 other alleged terrorists in separate operations in Quetta and Kech districts of Makran.
The operation in Aghbarg, on the outskirts of Quetta, was conducted a day after a car suicide attack on the headquarters of Frontier Corps (North) that claimed 10 lives, including four security personnel, and left 33 others injured.
Security forces foiled the attackers’ attempt to enter the FC headquarters and killed all five terrorists.
FIR registered
Meanwhile, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Balochistan Police has registered an FIR against the terrorists involved in the car suicide attack outside the FC headquarters and has lau­nched an investigation.
Official sources said the CTD has identified two terrorists who were killed by security forces as they attempted to enter the FC headquarters.
According to CTD sources, one of the terrorists belonged to the Mazai Adha area of Qila Abdullah district, bordering Afghanistan, and was identified as Sharifullah. The other terrorist was a resident of Chagai district, but his name has not yet been established.
 
 

Sources said CTD officials, along with other investigators, have been questioning Sharifullah’s family members. “The terrorist from Mazai Adha was also wanted by security forces in Karachi for his involvement in a previous terrorist attack there,” an official said.
Investigators have also approached the family of the other terrorist from Chagai. Security officials said the CTD identified both terrorists with the help of Nadra’s fingerprint records.
“The remains of the other terrorists killed in the gun battle with security forces have been sent to the Punjab Forensic Laboratory in Lahore for analysis,” the official added.
 
 

Meanwhile, security forces have sealed the area where the FC headquarters is located. Buildings badly damaged by the powerful explosions have also been sealed, and no one is being allowed to enter to access their offices.
The offices of Daily Mashriq and the private TV channel HUM were among those badly damaged and have been sealed by security forces.
Heavy traffic congestion was reported on several key roads due to the closure of routes passing near the FC headquarters.

Those detained by Israel also include former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan.
“Through the diplomatic channels of a friendly European country, we have confirmed that former senator Mushtaq Ahmad is in the custody of the Israeli occupying forces and is safe and in good health,” the FO statement said.
It added, “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.”
 






The FO said it had previously, too, coordinated the safe return of individuals who disembarked earlier. “In this context, we express our profound gratitude to the brotherly countries that assisted in the repatriation of our citizens.”
It further stated that the government “remains committed to the protection of all its citizens abroad and anticipates the completion of this repatriation process within the coming days”.
Several pro-Palestinian activists, former senator Mushtaq and Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thun­b­erg, were captured by Isra­eli troops that intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla on Wednesday night.
 
 

Detained Pakistanis also included Mazhar Saeed Shah, Wajahat Ahmad, Dr Osama Riaz, Ismail Khan, Syed Aziz Nizami and Fahad Ishtiaq, according to an earlier statement by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
In a telephone conversation with JI chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman on Friday, PM Shehbaz had assured him that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including the ex-senator.
Flotilla’s interception and detainees ‘mistreated’
The Global Sumud Flotilla had begun its journey last month, with Mushtaq leading the Pakistani delegation on the voyage.
As the fleet moved closer to the territorial waters of Gaza, Israeli forces began intercepting it on the night of October 1, halting over 40 boats part of the flotilla by the next day.
The Israeli troops were filmed boarding and holding activists from several vessels at gunpoint. The flotilla’s organisers had equipped each boat with cameras livestreaming every minute of their voyage as a security measure against just such an occurrence.
After intercepting the flotilla, Israel said it would deport the activists to Europe, without specifying which countries they would be sent to.
The Israeli action drew condemnations from across the globe, with countries whose citizens were detained expressing concern.
According to a report by The Guardian, Thunberg told Swedish officials she was subjected to harsh treatment in Israeli custody after her removal from the Global Sumud Flotilla.
 
 

As per an email sent by the Swedish foreign ministry to people close to Thunberg, and seen by The Guardian, an official who visited the activist in prison said she claimed she was detained in a cell infested with bedbugs, with too little food and water.
At least four flotilla activists also said Thunberg was mistreated during her detention, with two members saying she was forced to hold an Israeli flag.</p><small>2025-10-05 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0512055814d0a68.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946750/pm-shehbaz-departs-for-malaysia-eyes-comprehensive-talks-on-economic-engagement' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz departs for Malaysia, eyes ‘comprehensive’ talks on economic engagement</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement as he departed for Malaysia on Sunday.
“I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.
Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.
 






Later, a post by the PM Office’s official X account confirmed the premier had departed from Lahore for the three-day official visit.
 






The Foreign Office earlier said PM Shehbaz would be accompanied by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other federal ministers and senior government officials on the trip.
Sharing details of the visit in a statement, the FO said talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”</p><small>2025-10-05 07:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0507525727444e2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946699/activists-say-israel-mistreated-greta-thunberg-137-flotilla-detainees-arrive-in-turkiye' target='_blank'><strong>Activists say Israel mistreated Greta Thunberg; 137 flotilla detainees arrive in Turkiye</strong></a><br><p>ANKARA: A total of 137 activists detained by Israel for taking part in the flotilla seeking to deliver aid to Gaza arrived in Turkiye on Saturday after being deported, with two alleging that Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg was mistreated during her detention.
Israel did not immediately comment on the latest allegation, but its foreign ministry earlier described reports that detainees had been mistreated as “complete lies”.
The 137 activists who landed at Istanbul Airport included 36 Turkish nationals, as well as citizens from the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Morocco, Italy, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Switzerland, Tunisia and Jordan.
Two of them, Hazwani Helmi, a Malaysian citizen, and Windfield Beaver, an American, said at the airport that they had witnessed Thunberg being mistreated, saying she was shoved and forced to wear an Israeli flag.
 






“It was a disaster. They treated us like animals,” said Helmi, 28, adding that detainees were not provided with clean food or water and that medication and belongings were confiscated.
Beaver, 43, said Thunberg was “treated terribly’’ and “used as propaganda”, describing how she was pushed into a room as Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir arrived.
 
 

Israel has faced international condemnation after its military intercepted all of about 40 boats in the Gaza-bound aid flotilla and detained more than 450 activists.
Its foreign ministry wrote on X that all detained activists were “safe and in good health”, adding it was keen to complete the remaining deportations “as quickly as possible”.
 






Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said 26 Italians were on board the Turkish Airlines flight, with another 15 still held in Israel and set to be expelled over the next few days.
“I have once again given instructions to the Italian embassy in Tel Aviv to ensure that the remaining compatriots are treated with respect for their rights,” Tajani wrote on X.
A first group of Italians from the flotilla — four parliamentarians — arrived in Rome on Friday.
 






“We were brutally stopped … brutally taken hostage,” said Benedetta Scuderi, one of the parliamentarians.
‘Zip-tied for five hours’
According to Adalah, an Israeli group offering legal assistance to flotilla members, some detainees were denied access to lawyers, water and medications.
They were also “forced to kneel with their hands zip-tied for at least five hours, after some participants chanted ’Free Palestine’,” Adalah said.

In fact, this suggestion is already part of the ‘peace plan’ that Trump is offering to Israel, the Palestinians and their respective allies. 
If all goes to plan and the hawkish Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, actually agrees, there is every likelihood that a peacekeeping force will replace the Israeli forces that have flattened Gaza and killed tens of thousands of men, women and children there — both Palestinian Muslims, as well as non-Muslims.
The peacekeeping force will most likely be made up of military personnel belonging to Muslim-majority countries. Therefore, it will be a Muslim force. Calling it an “Islamic army” is not only problematic but largely incorrect as well. Let me explain.

The constant interchangeable usage of the terms ‘Islamic’ and ‘Muslim’ in public discourse has resulted in an inability amongst most to understand the important difference between the two

In Pakistan, the words ‘Islamic’ and ‘Muslim’ in most cases are used interchangeably, or as if one were the synonym of the other. At least from the early 20th century, on political and social levels, the word ‘Islamic’ often carries clear ideological connotations, whereas the word ‘Muslim’ is almost entirely about cultural identity. 
So, in this context, not all Muslims are ‘Islamic’ as such. There are numerous men and women who identify with Islam due to their family background, heritage or the social environment in which they were raised. But they don’t adhere to or agree with the politics and practices associated with what is usually perceived as ‘Islamic’. 
They remain Muslim, though. However, they often view the word ‘Islamic’ as an outcome of mixing religion with politics. Some may be entirely secular and even dismissive of contemporary laws shaped by particular interpretations of the faith’s scriptures by certain governments, yet they identify themselves as Muslim and follow the basic doctrinal tenets and cultural practices of Islam.
So what is ‘Islamic’? Transmitting the Quran through art (calligraphy) is correctly understood as Islamic art. Architecture and design that are presented as visual representations of God’s infinite nature are also Islamic. A conference in which Muslim theologians discuss the dynamics of Islam’s scriptures can be termed as an ‘Islamic conference’ as well. But a conference that is framed to generate discussions about the political and economic standing of Muslim-majority countries is certainly not an ‘Islamic conference.’ It is a meeting of political representatives of Muslim-majority countries.
The confusion in this regard only deepened when political gatherings of Muslim leaders began to be labelled as ‘Islamic summits’ or when sports events involving athletes from Muslim-majority countries are labelled as ‘Islamic games.’ There is nothing ‘Islamic’ about them, unless the summits were discussing the complexities of Islamic theology or, in the latter’s case, sporting events were reshaped by putting them in the context of the sharia [Islamic teachings]. 
Returning to the case of Pakistan, the bulk of literature produced during the height of the Pakistan Movement in British India speaks about Muslim nationalism. For example, the All India Muslim League (AIML), which became India’s largest Muslim-interest party, treated the Muslims of the region as culturally distinct from India’s Hindu majority. 
Muslim nationalism even presented India’s Muslims as an overarching ethnic community within which lay different Muslim ethnic and sectarian/ sub-sectarian groups. Therefore, the Hindu majority began to be viewed by AIML as an ethnic, cultural and political ‘other’.
Muslim nationalism encapsulated the ethnically diverse Muslims of India as a cultural whole but one with different ethnic, sectarian and sub-sectarian groups. Therefore, the AIML’s purpose was to create a Muslim-majority country with Muslim nationalism at its core. Had the AIML been leading an ‘Islamic’ movement, it would have struggled to address and regulate multiple interpretations of Islamic theology held by different sets of Islamic sects and sub-sects. In fact, according to the political scientist Muhammad Waseem, the concept of Islam in different ethnic groups among India’s Muslims too differed from each other on various theological points.  
This is when ‘Islamic nationalism’ entered the picture. Though slightly older than Muslim nationalism, Islamic nationalism’s purpose was to regenerate colonised Muslim societies through a revival of a global caliphate and universalised sharia laws, but it struggled to compete with the more regional, specific and ‘modernist’ Muslim nationalism. 
However, whereas Muslim nationalism succeeded in producing a separate Muslim-majority country in South Asia, it could not come to terms with the ethnic and sectarian fissures that intensified once the country was created, and the Hindu ‘other’ became a minuscule minority in the new country. 
So, starting from 1956, but more intently from 1973 onwards, an Islamic nationalism was introduced. This allowed the entry into the Constitution of various laws and rhetoric derived from a majoritarian interpretation of Islamic theology. From then onwards, everything began being termed as ‘Islamic’ — even though the Constitution still contained a large chunk of secular laws. 
 


According to the political scientist Ahmet T. Kuru, Islamic nationalism is a complex and often contradictory idea. It combines religious identity with nationalist aspirations. It is distinct from secular nationalism, which separates national identity from religion. Muslim nationalism lies somewhere between the two. It also combines religious identity with nationalist identity but keeps theology in the private sphere, to avoid theological complications between sects and sub-sects, and to mitigate any possibility of these complications mutating to give birth to a theocracy. 
But after 1973, the Pakistani state saw Islamic nationalism as a more robust tool to manage sectarian/ sub-sectarian and ethnic complexities. The term Muslim nationalism transcended to mean Islamic nationalism and then simply vanished. The question is: did Islamic nationalism resolve the complexities? No. It made them even more complex and, indeed, it did begin to mutate and give birth to a theocracy.
So far, this tendency has been mitigated by the state to settle for a volatile variant of ‘theo-democracy’ with an ‘Islamic constitution’ or, for that matter, ‘Islamic’ everything, even when much of this is anything but. 
So, to the journalist anticipating a peacekeeping force in Gaza made up of soldiers from various Muslim countries, it is an “Islamic army.” But the truth is, it will be just a Muslim army — unless its core purpose will be evangelical in nature and jihadist in intent, which will never be the case. 
One has to be extremely careful in how one uses the words ‘Islamic’ and ‘Muslim’ in the highly divisive and dangerously polarised world that we live in today.

The incident occurred during a protest by journalists and demonstrators from Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), some of whom were reportedly fleeing from police action when officers stormed into the club.
A joint action committee has been formed that includes all key media associations and various factions of the NPC.
In its first meeting headed by the acting NPC president Ehteshamul Haq, the action committee was given the mandate to prepare a charter of demands.
The chairmanship of the committee was unanimously handed over to NPC President Azhar Jatoi, while Nayar Ali was given the responsibility of its secretary.
 
 

The committee members include President PFUJ Afzal Butt, President RIUJ Tariq Virk, President PFUJ (Dastur) Haji Nawaz Raza, President RIUJ (Dastur) Rana Kausar Ali, President PFUJ (Workers) Sadia Kamal and Javed Malik, Secretary General PFUJ (Rana Azeem Group) Shakeel Ahmed, President RIUJ (Rana Azeem Group) Tariq Usmani, President Azad Group Shakeel Qarar and Mehboobur Rehman Tanoli, President Parliamentary Reporters Association M.B. Soomro and General Secretary Naveed Akbar.
The members of the committee will forward their suggestions for preparing a charter of demands against the police action on the press club, so that no such act takes place in future.
Meanwhile, the acting president NPC said that they were discussing the situation with other press clubs and with their coordination a strategy will be devised.
“The most important point is that we do not want any such action at any press club anywhere in the country,” he added.
The leader of Azad Panel Shakeel Qarar said: “We have suggested that a notification be issued to the federal and provincial governments that in future the police or any law enforcement agency will not be allowed to enter any press club even after prior permission.”
He added that an inquiry should be conducted by an officer of interior ministry and people from the ruling and opposition parties.

• MP Iqbal Mohamed defends such marriages as culturally significant, urges genetic screening over bans
LONDON: Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) has found itself at the centre of a political and cultural row after a government-backed education programme published — and then quietly removed — online guidance describing the potential benefits of first-cousin marriage.
UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the advice “shocking” and demanded an apology, saying first-cousin marriages are “high-risk and unsafe.” MP Iqbal Mohamed, however, defended such unions as culturally significant for many families.
Speaking in the Commons, he acknowledged health risks but said many families see such unions as positive for building bonds and financial security, urging genetic screening instead of a ban.
 
 

The document, published by NHS England’s Genomics Education Programme last week, stated that consanguineous unions can bring “stronger extended family support systems and economic advantages” even as it acknowledged the increased risk of certain genetic conditions among children of related parents.
Tory MP Richard Holden, who has proposed legislation to ban cousin marriages, condemned the document, calling on the NHS to “stop taking the knee to damaging and oppressive cultural practices.” Holden also linked cousin marriage to immigration and women’s rights, saying the practice “should be ended for good.”
By Monday September 29, the guidance appeared to have been taken down from the NHS website.
New YouGov research shows that three quarters of Britons (77 per cent) say first cousin marriage should not be legal, with only 9pc thinking the law should remain as it is. Prohibiting first cousin marriage is popular across the main parties, with 76-77pc of Labour, Lib Dem and Tory voters opposed to the practice, as well as 82pc of Reform UK voters.
The study
The Genomics Education Programme which is run by Health Education England aims to improve the “genetic literacy” of healthcare professionals and the public. Its 22 September blog post titled “Should the UK Government Ban First-Cousin Marriage?”, stressed that while children of first cousins do face a higher risk of certain inherited disorders, the increase is small and should be tackled through education and voluntary screening rather than bans.
The document emphasised that first-cousin marriage remains legal in the UK under the Marriage Act 1949 and that the government has “no current plans” to change this.
It noted that while the risk of a child being born with a genetic condition rises from about 2–3pc in the general population to 4–6pc for children of first cousins, “most children of first cousins are healthy.”
The guidance also cited research from Bradford suggesting that “endogamy” (marrying within a tight-knit community) may be a more significant factor in genetic risk than cousin marriage itself.
It further warned that stigmatising the practice can deter couples from seeking help, with the British Society for Genetic Medicine instead advocating premarital genomic testing, targeted education and voluntary counselling as more effective ways to reduce risk.
In February this year, a BBC investigation showed how cousin marriage plays out on the ground. Its reporting from Bradford, which is home to one of the UK’s largest Pakistani communities found that first-cousin marriage remains “fairly common” but is slowly declining.
The Born in Bradford study, tracking over 13,000 children, found that about one in six had parents who were first cousins. Researchers found that children of first cousins were more likely to have speech and language problems (11pc versus 7pc for unrelated parents); that they were less likely to reach a government benchmark for “good development” at age five (54pc versus 64pc); and they visited primary care doctors more frequently i.e. about four times a year on average compared to three for unrelated-parent children.
Professor Sam Oddie of Bradford Teaching Hospitals told the BBC “I’ve seen fatal skin conditions, fatal brain conditions, fatal muscle conditions”.
He said such conditions were notably more common in Bradford, recalling families who lost several children to the same genetic disorder — “deeply upsetting and hard to comprehend.”
But the same BBC story underscores that many health professionals, including Prof Oddie, argue it is “an oversimplification” to blame cousin marriage alone. Endogamy, not just direct blood ties, can cluster genetic variants.
Endogamy is not unique to Pakistani communities in the UK. It is an issue too in the UK’s Jewish community and globally among the Amish and also French Canadians.
Prof Oddie said it’s simplistic to blame co­usin marriage alone, noting that shared ge­­n­­es within close communities — or endoga­­my — play a major role in inherited disorders.
BBC interviews found more young women choosing “love marriages” as education and social exposure grow, with cousin marriages among Pakistani-origin mothers in Bradford falling from 40pc to 27pc in a decade.

• India may release over 150,000 cusecs of water into Punjab rivers within 48 hours
• PDMA warns of potential flooding in some regions
• Survey of flood damage in 69 tehsils likely to be complete by 27th
LAHORE: The Punjab government on Saturday approved financial assistance of Rs20,000 per acre for compensation of crop losses, with the provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) warning of potential flooding in some regions amid rain forecast for many districts and expected release of over 150,000 cusecs from India into the Chenab, Sutlej and Ravi rivers within a day or two.
While chairing a meeting in Multan to review the condition of cotton, rice, sugarcane and other standing crops, Punjab Agriculture Secretary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo said about 2,000 teams were conducting surveys of flood-related damages, though Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had already approved financial assistance of Rs20,000 per acre to compensate for crop losses.
He said a comprehensive action plan had also been prepared to achieve wheat sowing target, noting that measures aimed at boosting cotton production had yielded encouraging results. So far, he said, 2.65 million bales equivalent of seed cotton (phutti) were picked this year as compared to 1.846m bales obtained during the same period last year according to Crop Reporting Service statistics.
 
 

Earlier, the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued an alert for rains in Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan over the next 12 to 24 hours, specifically in the upper catchment areas of Jhelum, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.
On the other hand, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia told a presser that the country was bracing for a shift in the weather, with rains expected over the next few days which may worsen the flood situation in Punjab.
Light to heavy rains are expected in various districts of Punjab from Rawalpindi to Lahore over the weekend, followed by showers on Monday in south Punjab. In the upper regions of Punjab, up to 100mm of rainfall was expected, he added.
Rising level of river waters
At Head Marala, Mr Kathia said, the Chenab River is carrying 20,000 cusecs, with an additional 100,000 cusecs expected from India in the next 48 hours. Marala’s current outflow is 23,000 cusecs. Considering that 900,000 cusecs water passed through Head Marala on Aug 26, he said it was not as big a challenge.
Besides, the Sutlej River may receive 50,000 cusecs from India, and 35,000 cusecs of water are expected to enter the Ravi River from the Thein Dam, he said.
On the other hand, Mangla Dam reported high water levels, though Jhelum may not face a massive flood situation.
Survey in 27 districts
The PDMA DG said a survey for flood damage assessment was underway in 27 districts of Punjab, with as many as 11,000 people being engaged in the exercise. A joint survey team includes officers from the Pakistan Army, district administration, and various other departments, he said, adding that a total of 2,213 teams were in the field.
With real-time monitoring through an online dashboard, survey is being conducted by the joint teams in 27 districts, he said. The exercise would be completed in 69 tehsils by Oct 27, he added.
 
 

Mr Kathia said the Bank of Punjab would establish counters in each tehsil to ensure provision of maximum facilities to flood victims. He said that flood survivors could receive Rs50,000 immediately after receiving cards.
Complaint resolution
For complaints related to the survey, he said, the PDMA in collaboration with Punjab’s IT Board had formed a platform, which would resolve complaints within seven days.
The DG recalled that there were over 350,000 flood victims in 2010, 38,196 in 2012, 359,000 in 2014 while a total of Rs14 billion was distributed among them.
Again in 2022, he said, 56,000 people affected by floods were provided a sum of Rs10 billion compensation.
He said that over the past 15 years, Rs51 billion was distributed among flood victims but the damage from the current flood was bigger than all previous floods.
Weather advisory
Meanwhile, NEOC issued the weather alert, warning that rains have been forecast for Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Islamabad, Punjab and southern part of Sindh, with the possibility of landslides in mountainous areas.
In Punjab, Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Hafizabad, Sargodha, and Khushab may receive showers, while in Sindh, rain is likely in Karachi, Jamshoro, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal, Tharparkar, and Umerkot.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, intermittent rains are expected in Chitral, Dir, Haripur, Kohat, Kohistan, Khyber, Kurram, and Mansehra. Thunderstorms with rain are also likely in Peshawar, Nowshera, Malakand, Charsadda, Swabi, Hazara, Abbottabad, Mohmand, Bannu, Buner, Waziristan, and adjoining areas.
The NDMA said the NEOC was actively coordinating with relevant departments to ensure timely updates and effective emergency response. It urged people to avoid unnecessary travel in mountainous areas due to landslide risks, stay informed via radio, TV, and the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert app, and follow instructions of local authorities.

The meeting that took place at their Jati Umra residence covered governance issues, including the ongoing acrimony with the PPP-led Sindh government over flood and canal issues.
“The premier told the PML-N president that the PPP was its coalition partner and for smooth functioning of the government bickering between the two parties should not linger on,” a source privy to the meeting between the two brothers told Dawn.
The source said PM Shehbaz wanted his elder brother to speak to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and convince her “to let go and reconcile with the PPP”. He said the premier “urged Nawaz Sharif to ask Maryam Nawaz to adopt a reconciliatory approach and end the ongoing acrimony with the PPP leadership over flood and canal issues.

Shehbaz, Dar to leave for Malaysia today

“Nawaz Sharif was also briefed on the PPP’s grievances over administrative and development-related matters, with both leaders agreeing that unity within the coalition was essential to sustain the government’s stability.”
However, in its official statement, the PML-N said the prime minister briefed the party chief on his recent foreign visits and provided a detailed update on the situation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including the outcome of successful negotiations with the protesters.
The war of words between the two coalition partners began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River (six canals issue).
Maryam Nawaz told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself, while the latter had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sessions to protest her diatribe and demanded apology from her.
However, CM Maryam declared she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst over flood and canal issues.
As the tensions escalated further, the PPP publicly repeated Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) allegations that Maryam Nawaz did not represent the people of Punjab stating that her government was a “by product of Form 47”.
PPP’s central information secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan said Maryam Nawaz, who called those raising public issues ‘the enemies of Punjab’, was herself the real problem of Punjab.
“The CM Punjab is demonstrating racist thinking to hide her failure to save the people from floodwaters,” he remarked.
PM’s Malaysia visit
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz would leave for Malaysia for a two-day visit at the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim from Oct 5 to 7, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday.
The FO said PM Shehbaz, Foreign Minister and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, federal ministers and senior government officials will depart for Malaysia on Sunday. “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” it added.
A PML-N statement said Mr Ibrahim had also extended an invitation to party chief and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif to visit Malaysia, but he said he would consider the visit at a more suitable time.

• Dozens arrested in London after protesting against ban on a pro-Palestinian group
CAIRO: Over 60 people were killed in Gaza on Saturday as Israel went ahead with its bombardment in defiance of US President Donald Trump’s demand it stop bombing in response to a declaration by Hamas that it was ready to free prisoners under his plan to end the two-year-old conflict.
According to witnesses on the ground, 11 people died in sporadic incidents, while 10 people, including children, were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli strike on a house in Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City. The attack damaged several other buildings nearby.
The Gaza health ministry said in a morning update that Israeli fire had killed at least 66 Palestinians across the enclave over the past 24 hours.
Despite the Israeli action, President Trump said “I appreciate Israel has temporarily stopped the bombing”, and he urged Hamas to move quickly on his plan “or else all bets will be off”.
“I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST. Everyone will be treated fairly!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
 
 

Hamas had drawn a welcoming resp­onse from Trump on Friday by saying it accepted certain key parts of his 20-point peace proposal, including ending the conflict, Israel’s withdrawal and the rele­ase of prisoners, both Israeli and Palestinian.
In Washington, a White House official said Trump was sending his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Egypt to finalise technical details regarding the release of Israeli prisoners and discuss a lasting “peace deal’.
Egypt’s state-affiliated television channel Al QaheraNews said Palestinian and Israeli delegations would also be present for “indirect talks” on the Trump plan.
Hamas’s response to the plan drew a chorus of optimistic statements by world leaders, who urged an end to the conflict.
Another possible boost to hopes came with a supportive statement from the Iran-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which is smaller than Hamas but seen as more hardline. The group, which also holds Israeli prisoners, endorsed Hamas’s response — a move that could help pave the way for the release of Israelis still held by both parties.
‘Immediate implementation’
Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli prisoners following Hamas’s response.
Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce “offensive activity” in Gaza. Trump has invested significant political capital in efforts to end a conflict that has left Israel increasingly isolated on the world stage.
Dozens held in London
Police arrested an unspecified number of protesters for supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group at a demonstration in London on Saturday which went ahead despite requests to call it off after a deadly attack at a synagogue in Manchester two days ago.
Two people were killed in the attack in the north-western English city on Thursday and police shot dead the suspect, a British man of Syrian descent.
Organisers refused requests by police to call off Saturday’s demonstration, which had been announced before the Manchester attack, to protest the banning of pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws.
Calling for calm on X, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “I urge anyone thinking about protesting this weekend to recognise and respect the grief of British Jews.
“This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain. It is a time to stand together.”
 






Police arrested protesters at Trafalgar Square, in central London, as they wrote slogans on placards declaring support for Palestine Action, which was proscribed in July after its members broke into an airbase and damaged military planes.
Hundreds gathered for the protest, applauding and cheering those arrested as they were carried through the crowd by police without resisting. Onlookers chanted “shame on you” at officers.
“I’m disgusted by the police actually, they shouldn’t be arresting non-violent protesters here,” said Angie Zelter. “We have a right to protest and Palestine Action is not a violent organisation, should never have been proscribed in the first place.”
The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests, during which hundreds have been arrested for defying the ban which makes it an offence to show support for Palestine Action. Police said Saturday’s protests would draw resources away from security they have tightened around synagogues and mosques following the attack in Manchester.

However, different countries have implemented various strategies to balance consumer demand, environmental concerns, and industrial priorities.
Experiences from India, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines provide practical insights. Measures such as age limits, pre-export inspections, phased implementation, fiscal incentives, and administrative controls can guide Pakistan in maintaining quality, safeguarding the environment, and balancing consumer access with industrial protection.
As per a report of the Institute of Cost and Management (ICMA), Pakistan’s average import of used cars per year stood at 34,000 units followed by 21,802 by Thailand, 532 by Vietnam and 235 units by India.
Bangladesh permits the import of used cars under specific conditions to balance consumer demand with quality control and revenue generation. As of June 2025, vehicles must be no more than four years old, imported directly from the country of origin, and accompanied by a previous registration or de-registration certificate. The importation process involves customs duties, VAT, and mandatory inspections to ensure compliance with national standards.

Neighbours curb influx of old vehicles through age caps and safety checks

Sri Lanka lifted its five-year ban on private car and motorcycle imports in February 2025, allowing personal use vehicle imports under specific conditions. Individuals are permitted to import one vehicle per year, provided they use a registered vehicle importer. This phased reopening aims to stabilise the market and manage foreign exchange reserves while meeting consumer demand.
India enforces stringent regulations on the importation of used vehicles to protect its domestic automotive industry and ensure compliance with safety and environmental standards. As of 2024, used vehicles must be under three years old, right-hand drive, and meet specific engine capacity restrictions. The import ­process involves extensive documentation, high import duties (up to 125pc for used cars), and mandatory compliance testing. Additionally, a minimum ­roadworthiness period of five years is required from the date of ­importation.
Kenya has implemented a controlled liberalisation approach to used car imports, aiming to balance affordability with environmental and safety considerations. As of July 2025, only vehicles manufactured from July 2018 onward are eligible for import, effectively enforcing a rolling seven-year age limit. This policy is designed to improve air quality, reduce reliance on older vehicles, and support local vehicle assembly. Importers must comply with pre-export inspection requirements and domestic roadworthiness certification.
South Africa restricts used car imports to protect its domestic automotive manufacturing sector. Importation is generally allowed only under specific circumstances, such as for returning nationals or immigrants with permanent residence status.
These individuals may import one vehicle per family, subject to compliance with import duties and VAT. The importation process requires obtaining a permit and adhering to documentation requirements.
Nigeria has tightened its used vehicle import regulations to reduce the influx of older, potentially polluting cars. As of May 2025, only vehicles manufactured in 2015 or later are eligible for import without facing punitive duties. Vehicles older than 10 years are either barred or subjected to heavy import penalties. The import process requires specific documentation, including a bill of lading, bill of entry, marine insurance, and evidence of VAT payment.
 
 

In the Philippines, only qualified individuals may import used vehicles, and they must secure a Certificate of Authority to Import (CAI) from the Fair-Trade Enforcement Bureau (FTEB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) before the actual importation. Imported vehicles are subject to a 40pc customs duty, 10pc VAT, and an ad valorem tax ranging from 15pc to 100pc, depending on the vehicle’s piston displacement.
In the early 1990s, commercial imports of cars were largely prohibited to protect local assemblers. This resulted in fewer cars in the market, higher prices, and limited options for buyers.
In the early 2000s, growing demand for affordable cars led the government to allow imports under special schemes such as the Gift Scheme, Baggage Scheme, and Transfer of Residence Scheme, mainly for overseas Pakistanis. While these cars were meant for personal use, many entered the local market through dealers. Consumers gained more choice and prices dropped slightly, but local carmakers protested, saying these imports hurt their sales and investment.
In 2,005, the government reduced duties, making it easier to import used cars. Consumers accessed small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars, and imports rose quickly. By 2,008, local carmakers lobbied for tighter restrictions, leading to increased duties and a lower age limit for imports. This reduced imports and strengthened local manufacturer protection.
In 2012, the maximum age of imported used cars was cut from five years to three years, sharply reducing inflows. Simultaneously, the Automotive Development Policy (ADP) encouraged investment in local assembly. Some new entrants joined, but car prices remained high and choice limited.
During 2012-2020s, ongoing push and pull consumers continued to complain about high prices, limited choice, and lower safety standards than regional peers. Industry groups warned that too many imports could reduce local investment, slow parts production, and increase pressure on foreign exchange. The government alternated between relaxing and restricting imports, creating a cycle of
policy shifts.
In September 2025, the federal government had allowed commercial imports of used cars up to five years old. Duties will be reduced gradually.
The policy aims to protect local manufacturers, offer consumers more affordable choices, and ensure imported cars meet safety and environmental standards. This is a key step toward a more balanced automotive market.
Passenger vehicles under five years old can be imported commercially until June 30, 2026. A 40pc regulatory duty applies in the first year, reducing by 10pc each year until it reaches zero by FY30.
This phased approach helps balance consumer benefits with protection for local manufacturers. All imported vehicles must meet safety and emission standards, ensuring that older, unsafe, or inefficient vehicles do not enter the market.

A two-member bench, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barech and Justice Sardar Ahmed Halimi issued the order while hearing a petition filed by Advocate Munir Ahmed Kakar on Saturday. Advocate Kakar contended in his petition that despite the passage of considerable time, the Bostan Special Economic Zone had yet to be completed and made fully operational.
During the hearing, Saadullah, Chief Finance Officer of the Industrial Estate Development and Management Company of BSEZ, informed the court that the zone has already become partially operational.
He said that three factories were currently functioning in the zone, while 12 others were under completion and would soon begin operations.

He further informed the court that upon completion, these projects would create 15,520 jobs, marking the start of a new era of industrial development in Balochistan.
He further said that all necessary facilities, including water and power supply, were being ensured. 
The BHC bench, after hearing arguments from both sides, directed the authorities concerned to expedite the remaining work and make the Bostan Special Economic Zone fully operational by Dec 15 deadline.
Officials said that a large number of industrialists were ready to set up industries in the Bostan Special Economic Zone once it became fully functional.
Appellate courts
Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barech has also taken an important administrative step to ensure the effective, timely, and transparent hearing of inheritance cases by designating two special appellate courts in Quetta.
According to an official notification, under the directive of the Chief Justice, the courts of Additional District and Sessions Judge-VIII, Quetta, and Additional District and Sessions Judge-X, Quetta, have been assigned to exclusively hear and decide inheritance-related cases.
As per the decision, all pending inheritance cases previously under other Additional District and Sessions Judges in Quetta will now be transferred to these two designated courts.

Unlike commodity exports, services exports have recorded positive growth since the beginning of FY26. In July, services exports rose by 18.27pc year-on-year.
According to data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the growth was primarily driven by telecommunication, computer, and information services in July FY26.
In August, services exports reached $671.98 million, up from $619.94m in the same month last year. However, on a month-on-month basis, services exports declined by 7.30pc.

Trade deficit widened amid rising imports in 2MFY26

In rupee terms, exports increased by 9.85pc to Rs189.662 billion in August FY26, compared to Rs172.651bn in August FY25. This indicates a steady upward trend in services exports during the current fiscal year.
During the first two months (July-August) of FY26, services exports totalled $1.396bn, showing an increase of 11.73pc from $1.250bn in the same period last year.
In FY25, Pakistan’s services exports grew by 9.23pc to $8.39bn from $7.68bn a year earlier.
The services sector has shown consistent growth since February 2024, largely due to a surge in IT and other business services exports. However, there was a 6.50pc decline in August 2024.
According to State Bank of Pakistan data, exports of telecommunications, computer, and information services rose to $691m in July—August FY26 from $584m in the same period last year, reflecting a growth of 18.32pc.
Exports of other business services increased by 16.66pc to $301m in 2MFY26, compared to $258m last year. However, transport services exports fell by 4.62pc to $124m from $130m.
Travel services exports declined sharply by 18.91pc to $90m in July–August FY26, compared to $111m in the corresponding period last year.
On the import side, services imports surged by 13.36pc to $1.108bn in August FY26, compared to $978.19m a year ago. Month-on-month, imports rose by 11.43pc.
In the first two months of FY26, services imports reached $2.104bn, up 13.43pc from $1.855bn during the same period last year.
Transport services imports declined by 7.03pc to $766m in 2MFY26, down from $824m last year. In contrast, travel services imports more than doubled, reaching $735m in 2MFY26 from $361m — a growth of 103.6pc.
As a result, the services trade deficit widened by 16.94pc to $707.23m in 2MFY26, compared to $604.79m in the same period last year.

GILGIT: The upper areas of Gilgit-Baltistan on Saturday received the first snowfall of the season, which is seen as a positive sign after years of delayed snowfall linked to climate change that has disrupted the fragile ecosystem and worried local communities.
The lower areas rec­eived scattered rain on Friday and Saturday, bringing a noticeable drop in temperature. According to locals, the areas situated above 12,000 feet, including Khunjerab Top and Babusar Top, received the first snowfall of the season. The snow-covered landscape pushed temperatures below freezing.
 
 

Tourist police said traffic at Babusar Top had been closed at night due to fears of slippery conditions. The Babusar Road, which usually remains open from June to November, is a key route for tourists and local passengers travelling between Gilgit-Baltistan and other parts of the country.
Similarly, the Khunjerab Top area also received up to three inches of snowfall, disrupting travel for vehicles moving between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass. Many areas of Gilgit, Hunza, Nagar, Diamer, Astore and Baltistan divisions received scattered rain, forcing residents to wear warm clothes and make heating arrangements at homes.
 
 

Gilgit-Baltistan experienced devastating floods this summer caused by rapid glacier melt, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), cloudbursts, and landslides. Over 50 people, including tourists, lost their lives, while infrastructure, agricultural land, forests, and private properties worth billions of rupees were destroyed.
In July, temperatures in Chilas soared to 48.5°C — the highest since July 17, 1997, when it reached 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature hit 46.1°C, the highest since 1971. Experts believe that the region, one of the most environmentally sensitive in the world, has been experiencing severe climate change impacts in recent decades. Over the past decade, snowfall in GB has been delayed until late December or even March.
Experts warn that this shift in weather patterns prevents snow from compacting into stable ice, and with the onset of heatwaves, unstable snow melts rapidly, triggering flash floods and Glof events.
Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn that climate change has severely affected the fragile ecosystem of GB, home to over 8,000 glaciers, 30,000 glacial lakes, countless mountains, and vast pastures.
He said unplanned development, rapid tourism, and construction in forested and green-belt areas are damaging the region’s environment. He stressed GB’s vulnerability to climate change and its crucial role as Pakistan’s “water tower,” feeding the Indus River, which supports 70 per cent of the country’s agriculture and 40pc of its hydropower.

According to a notification issued by the cabinet division, Mr Sadiq will perform the functions of the acting president under Article 49(2) of the Cons­titution. He will continue to discharge these responsibilities until the president and Senate chairman return to the country.
After taking charge, Mr Sadiq welcomed the successful negotiations between the government’s negotiation committee and the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee in AJK.
He described the agreement between the two sides as a positive and constructive development, stressing that the restoration of peace and normalcy in the region was a matter of great satisfaction.
Mr Sadiq said that with the successful negotiations, all baseless rumours and conspiracies against Pakis­tan had been laid to rest.
He commended both the government’s negotiation team and the committee for their responsible and result-oriented approach.
The acting president reiterated that public welfare and peace remain the government’s top priority. He urged all stakeholders to focus on unity and national development rat­her than giving attention to unfounded rumours.
“Pakistan and Kashmir are inseparable. The protection of the rights of the Kashmiri people will always remain our foremost priority,” he added.

Climate-induced illnesses have been mounting globally with poorer nations being particularly vulnerable as they bear the brunt of greenhouse gas emissions more than anyone. Among the most alarming consequences is the toll on air quality, which not only fuels respiratory and cardiovascular diseases but also jeopardises human health on a broader scale — especially threatening women’s reproductive health and fertility.
In Pakistan, the crisis looms large over women in Punjab, the country’s most populous province and hub of hazardous air pollution. Lahore, the provincial capital, has consistently ranked among the world’s most polluted cities, with its skies choking on toxic smog year after year. This season is no different; Lahore’s spiralling air quality crisis has led to hospitals overflowing with patients suffering from respiratory illnesses, asthma, eye infections, and heart conditions.
Beyond the well-known health risks, recent studies indicate the risk of women developing fertility issues due to poor air quality index (AQI). According to research published by Environmental Science and Technology, high levels of air pollution in cities have an enormous impact on fertility, as exposure to PM2.5 reduces ovarian reserves and affects pregnancy rates.
Another study conducted by the National Library of Medicine states that “epidemiological research on humans and animals supports the view that air pollutants lead to abnormalities during reproduction, which reduces reproductive capacities in susceptible populations”.
Infertility is a growing global crisis. Nearly one in six adults worldwide will face infertility at some point in their lives — accounting for 17.5 per cent of the global population, the World Health Organisation notes.
Air pollution and infertility nexus
In Pakistan’s context, fertility expert Dr Zeryab Setna says, “A woman’s ovarian reserve may be negatively impacted by air pollution.“ The cause? Cellular inflammation triggered by oxidative stress, disrupting hormones and the balance of the reproductive system. As the quality of life — spanning environment, food, and water — deteriorates, the rise in infertility rates is becoming hard to ignore. But Dr Setna remains cautious, acknowledging that, for now, a direct link between pollution and specific infertility cases remains elusive.
Yet, it’s not just women who are affected. “Men aged 30-45 are particularly vulnerable, with studies showing how air pollution can diminish sperm count, motility, and even damage DNA,” he added. The impact is clear — but the full extent remains under investigation.
 
 

Lahore-based gynaecologist Professor Dr Nudrat Sohail echoes this uncertainty. She acknowledges that the relationship between air pollution and female fertility is still debatable, with several theories emerging. “Firstly, air pollutants can mimic hormones such as androgens or estrogens, which can interfere with normal hormone function pathways. Another reason is attributed to air pollution potentially exacerbating inflammation and oxidative stress.”
Dr Sohail says that air pollution might very well affect fertility, but there is a lack of definitive research to pinpoint it as the primary cause. She stresses the urgent need for further studies to confirm or rule out the direct role of air pollutants in infertility.
Speaking to a renowned Indian newspaper, India-based senior consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Manju Gupta says, “Several air pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals, have been connected to hormonal abnormalities. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), or endocrine-disrupting chemicals, are prevalent in pollutants and can change how women produce, regulate, and discharge their reproductive hormones. This may result in irregular menstrual cycles, reduced fertility, and ovulatory dysfunction. These pollutants also have an adverse influence on egg quality, which makes pregnancy more challenging.”
Dr Gupta warns that the growing body of evidence points to a troubling connection between pollution and reproductive health.
What does medical research say?
According to Farhana Tabassum, manager of research related to the impact of climate change on women’s health at the Institute for Global Health and Development (IGHD) at Agha Khan University, Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country when it comes to climate change and its vulnerability to weather-related events intensifies the climate-induced risks impacting women’s fertility — risking maternal and babies’ health before and after delivery.
“Air pollutants could play a substantial role in driving fertility challenges for women,” she explains. The future of women’s reproductive health, Tabassum continues, looks increasingly bleak without decisive action to combat air pollution.
“Women’s exposure to hazardous pollutants like particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and other toxic gases interrupts hormonal balance and reproductive health contributing to an upsurge in infertility rates. With the inadequate healthcare and environmental degradation compounded with challenges such as malnutrition, the growing infertility crisis could become a serious public health issue, straining already overburdened healthcare systems,” she adds.
Future of pregnant women amid polluted environment
Tabassum paints a grim picture of the intersection between poor environmental conditions and maternal health, particularly in cities like Lahore. “Heat, stress, and poor air quality during pregnancy lead to adverse outcomes, including preterm births, neonatal mortality, and cardiovascular issues,” she says.
These risks, she emphasises, are not confined to urban centres but ripple across rural landscapes, where gender imbalances and resource disparities exacerbate the toll on women. “They are more exposed to air pollution during cooking, often using wood as fuel, which releases harmful smoke.”
“During crop-cutting seasons, women work in open fields, inhale dust and pollutants from agricultural activities. These environmental exposures along with the additional responsibility of household chores and caregiving, significantly increase their risk of respiratory and reproductive health issues. This heightened vulnerability demands urgent attention to improving air quality and protecting women’s health, particularly in rural areas,” she adds.
Tabassum underscores the significance of conducting joint studies to understand the ramifications of climate change on the health of women and children.
“Majority of research on this topic has been conducted in advanced countries, and our nation does not have access to such data. To evaluate the risks and effects of extreme climate change, air quality, and heat on the health of women and children, research needs to be conducted by both public and private institutions in collaboration with global organisations such as the WHO,” she states.
She further adds that the evidence could guide the development of policies aimed at improving maternal and child health in the face of climate change, “as healthy mothers and children are the foundation of a prosperous future.”
Poor air quality and women’s mental health
Mental health issues are prevalent in our society but concurrently are the most neglected ones. Most people lack awareness regarding mental health problems, often dismissing them as unworthy of treatment. However, their impacts are profound. According to several studies, compared to men, women suffer more from mental health issues due to reasons ranging from strict cultural norms to the absence of basic rights.
While the causes of poor mental health are varied, air pollution has emerged as an overlooked contributor, potentially exacerbating the pre-existing ones.
“Poor air quality becomes a contributing factor in the cause and elevation of psychological disorders. People exposed to air pollution may feel anxiety, depression, dementia, poor memory, headaches, and brain fogging impacting overall productivity,“ says clinical psychologist Rabia Usman.
“Meanwhile, children may develop neurocognitive development disorders.”
 
 

Speaking about women, she points out that increased stress levels affect women’s bodies more than men’s. “Stress triggers the release of a hormone called cortisol. When stress levels remain high, the body produces excess cortisol, disrupting insulin regulation in women. This can lead to insulin resistance, hormonal imbalances, and conditions such as PCOS and PCOD,” she elaborates.
High stress levels and risk of miscarriage
Usman associates high levels of stress in pregnant women with the risk of miscarriage. “Insulin plays a crucial role in producing healthy eggs, enabling women to conceive. When insulin does not function properly, it can hinder the generation of quality eggs, making conception difficult. Even if pregnancy occurs, the chances of miscarriage doubles.”
She further highlights that air pollution is one of the most pressing issues today. “Pregnant women must stay in clean air to safeguard the health of both the mother and the fetus. Clean air reduces the risk of complications and ensures the normal development of the baby’s brain,” she says.
Punjab government’s measures to curb air pollution
In a bid to counteract the devastating effects of climate change, the Punjab government has launched multiple strategies aimed at reclaiming breathable air and sustainable cities. From stretching the number of trees across the city to employing spare land to plant agricultural forests, Punjab is striving to rewrite its environmental narrative.
The government has imposed mandatory vehicle certifications from workshops, announcing that no unfit vehicles would be allowed on the roads. The vehicles that transport sand and soil are also under strict scrutiny and inspection.
 
 

To ensure compliance, Punjab’s Environmental Protection Department (EPD) is at the frontline, targeting industrial polluters and the country’s 20,000+ brick kilns — deemed by a UNEP report as significant culprits behind Pakistan’s air pollution crisis. However, the EPD in collaboration with the National Energy Efficient Conservation Authority (NEECA) is working with the Brick Kiln Owners Association of Pakistan on the development of new eco-friendly methods to mitigate industrial emissions.
The Punjab government has also announced its first-ever Climate Resilient Punjab Vision Action Plan 2024 to deal with environmental problems. This comprehensive blueprint charts a future of low-emission green development, green investments, and climate-conscious education. It also ventures into climate diplomacy, tackling cross-border environmental challenges. Yet, the question persists: can these promises break through the inertia of insufficient public awareness and weak implementation?
Beyond the choking smog, the stakes are rising in harrowing ways. As the world grapples with its devastating repercussions, women find themselves at heightened risk of hormonal imbalances and infertility. This isn’t just an environmental crisis; it’s a battle for survival, for our health, and for the future of generations yet to come.
