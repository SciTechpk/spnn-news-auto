“They (our government) must take up this issue with the US authorities immediately to ensure withdrawal of the illegal unilateral decision of holding the treaty in abeyance by India on April 24,” advised Jawaid Latif, a former member (water) of the Water and Power Development Authority.
“I think it is the right time to raise this issue with immediate effect,” he told Dawn.
According to him, India may withdraw its decision covertly in confidential meetings with Pakistan during mediation by the US, as it would avoid announcing this publicly for face-saving.
The 1960 treaty regulates the sharing of water from the rivers. Under the treaty, India has the right to use water from the eastern rivers Ravi, Beas and Satluj, with some discharges to Pakistan downstream. Pakistan, under the treaty, has the right to use the western rivers: Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.
 
 

When contacted, Syed Jamat Ali Shah, former Pakistan’s commissioner on Indus Waters, termed the intervention by the countries, including the US, not limited to just the ceasefire. “I think the ceasefire is the first step. And I am sure when they (Pakistan and India), under US mediation, sit together, the former will have to raise this issue,” he maintained.
Mr Shah said the government should ask the US to play its role in resolving other issues between Pakistan and India, including Kashmir.
Answering a question, the former commissioner said that if the aforementioned issues move towards resolution, Pakistan must seek a guarantee from the US so that India does not flout this in future.
Meanwhile, Reuters news agency quoted Indian government sources, saying that despite the countries reaching a ceasefire agreement on Saturday after days of deadly fighting, the water-sharing treaty remains suspended.
‘No flow disruption’
All rivers are flowing in their normal course, as there is no flow disruption, according to a senior official in the Punjab government. “There is no problem; all rivers, including the western ones Chenab, Jhelum and Indus, are flowing normally,” the official said while talking to Dawn on Saturday.
Talking about Chenab River, where inflows reduced to 3,100 cusecs on May 5 after India halted the river flow to fill up its dams and later released the water the next day, he said the inflows at Marala headworks were also normal.
 
 

About water data-sharing, he said such data is generally shared with Pakistan by India in the monsoon or flooding season. “They (India) are not sharing data with us these days, as they generally do this in the flood season or any other unusual situation under the Indus Waters Treaty. But since the Chenab river flows are normal these days, we are not worried at all,” he explained. He hoped India would share the data in the upcoming monsoon season.
Separately, a daily water report sha­red by the Water and Power Deve­lop­ment Authority said that Chenab River inflows and outflows at Marala were recorded on Saturday as 29,700 cusecs and 10,300 cusecs, respectively.
The inflows and outflows at Indus at Tarbela were recorded as 136,300 cusecs and 70,000 cusecs, respectively. In Jhelum, 52,400 cusecs of inflows and 32,000 cusecs of outflows were gauged at Mangla.
The River Kabul at Nowshera had inflows of 46,000 cusecs and outflows of 46,000 cusecs.
“The inflows and outflows of River Indus at Tarbela, Jinnah and Chashma, River Kabul at Nowshera and River Jhelum at Mangla have been reflected as mean flows of 24 hours, whereas the other flows have been gauged at 6am,” the report said.
While discussing the country’s reservoirs, the report said the current level in Tarbela Dam was 1456.40 feet with a live storage of 1.289 MAF.
The minimum operating level of the dam is 1402 feet, whereas the maximum conservation level is 1,550 feet.
The water level in Mangla Dam was recorded at 1141.20 feet with live storage of 1.377 MAF. The minimum operating level of the dam is 1050 feet, whereas the maximum conservation capacity of the dam is 1242 feet. Chashma Lake had a water level of 646.40 feet and a live storage of 0.189 MAF.
The minimum operating level of the lake is 638.15 feet, whereas the maximum conservation capacity is 649 feet.

• Ex-NSA says Pakistan has re-established deterrence, stability and balance in region
In the latest round of hostilities between India and Pakistan, a US-brokered ceasefire has sought to pause what risked spiralling into a catastrophic conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
But make no mistake: this was no negotiated compromise between equals in the conflict. Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire after securing a calculated victory by firmly denying a much stronger India the military edge and diplomatic narrative it sought to dominate.
The crisis began in the wake of the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, which India swiftly blamed on Pakistan-based militants without providing evidence. Islamabad’s call for a neutral investigation was brushed aside. Instead, New Delhi escalated — launching missile and drone strikes into Pakistani territory beginning May 7. The most intense exchanges came on the night of May 9-10, one of the tensest nights in decades, when Indian forces targeted Pakistani military installations, only to face swift and strategic retaliation from Pakistan.
Pakistan’s military response during the entire crisis was measured and decisive. Retaliating to India’s Operation Sindoor, Pakistan’s forces on May 7 took down five Indian jets, including advanced Rafales, using Chinese-supplied J-10Cs and PL-15E missiles — an undeniable blow to India’s air superiority pretensions. And then on May 10, in a rare and calculated action, Pakistan neutralised Indian S-400 missile systems using hypersonic missiles fired from JF-17 aircraft. These kills — Rafales and S-400 system — sent a message not only across the border but across the globe.
 
 

“This week’s India-Pakistan conflict has marked a turning point, with modern conventional weaponry reshaping the battlefield and expanding the scope for the conventional use of force,” Muhammad Faisal, South Asia research analyst at the University of Technology Sydney, said.
India’s ambitions to dominate the escalation ladder — long a cornerstone of its regional strategy — collapsed under the weight of these setbacks. The Rafale and S-400, icons of India’s defence modernisation, became symbols of its miscalculation. For the first time in years, Pakistan demonstrated not just parity but deterrent credibility that undermined India’s claims of military primacy.
Former national security adviser Gen Nasser Janjua said, “Pakistan has successfully re-established the deterrence, stability and balance in the region. Pakistan has also successfully buried the concept of limited war under a nuclear environment.”
Diplomatically, too, the tide turned. As the spectre of escalation loomed, the United States intervened — not out of favour to one side, but out of alarm. With India’s air force facing serious attrition and risk of deeper military degradation, Washington acted to cap the conflict.
Secretary of State Mark Rubio’s diplomacy made the leadership of both warring countries, including Army Chief Gen Asim Munir, negotiate. Crucially, the resulting agreement was not just about ceasing hostilities; it included Pakistan’s long-standing demand: that future talks take place at a neutral venue. This was not a face-saving gesture, it was rather a strategic vindication.
Simultaneously, the G7’s restrained statement of May 10, notably avoiding any blame on Pakistan and instead urging dialogue and de-escalation, marked a diplomatic win for Islamabad. India’s narrative — that it was the aggrieved party reacting to terrorism—failed to gain traction. Instead, New Delhi found itself incr­easingly portrayed as the aggressor, its unilateral actions and refusal of an independent probe into Pahalgam casting doubt on its intentions.
 
 

“India overassessed and miscalculated its newfound relevance while eyeing to become a counterweight to China and being part of the Indo-Pacific strategy. The whole conflict till May 10 exposed India’s exaggerated and inflamed strategic relevance,” Gen Janjua maintained.
Pakistan, for its part, played the moment with clarity and restraint. By upholding Article 51 of the UN Charter, it positioned its response as legitimate self-defence. It neither overreached nor sought escalation for escalation’s sake. This is what separates a state seeking resolution from one seeking hegemony.
And yet, challenges remain. The ceasefire, while welcome, is tenuous. Hours after it took effect at 16:30 hrs on Saturday, there were reports of breaches from various locations.
Trust is scarce and for good reason. India’s post-ceasefire messaging has been muddled and, at times, deliberately dismissive. Indian officials privately propagated the impression that the agreement was merely an “understanding” devoid of commitments or international mediation.
Even more concerning, Indian officials suggested to their domestic audiences that hostile measures — such as the April 23 decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty remain in force. This selective reinterpretation of the deal aims to pro­ject strength at home, but it raises serious doubts about New Delhi’s sincerity.
“India must cease its threats, stop externalising its internal security issues, and engage in meaningful dialogue with Pakistan. A backchannel between the two NSAs should be established to lay the groundwork for talks. As a first step, India must reverse its suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty to address a key Pakistani concern,” former foreign minister Jalil Abbas Jilani said.
Pakistan cannot be expected to buy into an illusion of peace while India reserves the right to provoke again. Any enduring resolution demands good faith and that means addressing root causes, above all the Kashmir dispute. India’s consistent refusal to engage meaningfully on Kashmir and its habit of painting all Kashmiri dissent as terrorism perpetuate the cycle of violence and instability.
 
 

“Pakistan hopes that India will stop its march to the follies and learn from the outcome of conflict and will come to terms for a peaceful coexistence by resolving all its disputes with Pakistan including Kashmir and Indus Waters Treaty, which was unilaterally and illegally suspended despite the World Bank being a guarantor,” Gen Janjua said and added that Delhi should stop misperceiving that it is above international law.
“Despite ceasefire and commitment to talks, Pakistan needs to remain ready for another round of military confrontation,” Mr Faisal warned.
The international community, particularly those who helped defuse the crisis, must now hold India to account. Ceasefires cannot function if they merely reset the clock until the next provocation.
Dialogue must be real, not rhetorical. And India must show that it values peace more than posturing.In the final accounting, Pakistan has walked away from this round not as a state that bent to pressure, but one that stood firm, exposed its adversary’s miscalculations, and steered the crisis toward de-escalation on its own terms. It restored deterrence, secured diplomatic recognition, and reframed the regional narrative.

The two neighbouring nations closed their airspaces multiple times since Wednesday, when India launched missiles into Pakistan, triggering a series of hostilities.
On Saturday evening, the Pakistan Airport Aut­hority (PAA) announced that the airspace has been fully restored for all types of flights and issued a fresh notice to airmen (NOTAM).
“All airports in the country are available for normal flight operations,” a spokesman for PAA said. He requested passengers to contact the airline for the latest flight schedule.
However, the normalisation of flight operations is expected to take time as passenger aircraft and other equipment were shifted to safe locations as a precaution during escalating tensions between Pakistan and India.
Officials have said the aircraft are being brought back to the operational area for routine operations.
The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has also resumed flight operations following the reopening of the airspace.
The national carrier’s flight PK750, coming from Paris to Islamabad, which was diverted and landed in Quetta early on Saturday, will return to its original destination at 9pm, said PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez Khan.
Other operations of PIA would also resume from 10pm and all grounded or delayed flights would become operational, he said.
Passengers who had returned to their homes or hotels are being contacted to return to the airport. “We apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers due to the air closures and affected flight operations, but caution was necessary given the circumstances,” the statement added.
The disruption of flight operations for days stranded hundreds of travellers in Pakistan and abroad.
Earlier, Pakistan had closed the airspace to all flights from 3:15am to 12pm and extended the closure till Sunday noon.
 
 

The action was taken after India targeted PAF bases in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and Shorkot. The military said all Air Force assets remained safe in the attack before Pakistan launched it operation in retaliation.
On Friday, India had closed 32 airports across northern and western regions, including Srinagar and Amritsar, for civilian flight operations till May 15.
As tensions escalated, several global carriers, including Air France and Germany’s Lufthansa, cancelled or rerouted flights crossing Pakistan’s airspace.
Last month, Pakistan closed its airspace for Indian airlines, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country in the wake of a deadly attack in Pahalgam.

ISLAMABAD: After demonstrating restraint in the face of blatant Indian aggression since Wednesday, Pak­istan launched strikes early Satur­day morning targeting military installations in India and India-held Kashmir.
The strikes were launched under operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos at 5:16am.
“Bunyan-um-Marsoos” translates as concrete structure or firm foundation.
 






The missiles, launched by aircraft and ground-based systems, targeted multiple strategic and military sites of India, security sources and state media reported.
According to the military’s media wing and Radio Pakistan, the targeted locations included S-400 missile system in Adampur; military intelligence’s training ce­n­tre in Rajouri and brigade hea­d­quarters in Uri; Adampur, Udha­mpur, Pathan­kot, Suratgarh, Sirsa, Bathinda and Halwara airfields; Akhnoor aviation base; artillery gun positions in Dehrangyari; Brahmos missile battery site in Nagrota; Brahmos storage site in Beas; and India’s Rabtanwali Post, Jazeera Post Complex, Kafir Mehri, Shahpar 3, and Ghadar Top across the Line of Control (LoC).
ISPR said PAF’s JF-17 Thunder hypersonic missiles destroyed the S-400 missile system in Adampur.
The strikes came hours after India fired missiles at three air bases in Rawlpindi, Chakwal and Shorkot, as well as the Rahim Yar Khan
airport.
All assets of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) remained safe in the attack, the military spokesman said.

Pakistan has targeted key Indian military installations in a “befitting response” as part of its retaliatory operation, the federal government said in a statement.
“These actions are being carried out in response to India’s initial attack, which was an assault on our homeland, people and sovereignty,” the statement said, referring to Indian missile strikes at three PAF airbases.
The retaliatory attacks targeted “more than 26” locations and damaged “equipment and personnel” at at least five airbases, according to Colonel Sophia Qureshi of India’s Army Signal Corps.
The damage was sustained at air force bases in Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur, Bhuj and Bathinda, Col Qureshi said, according to Times of India.
India’s attack India launched missiles and drones in its late-night attack, which were shot down by ground defence systems in Punjab and Sindh.
The strikes targeted Nur Khan air base, Rawalpindi; Murid air base, Chakwal; and Shorkot air base, Inter Service Public Relations (ISPR) DG Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said at a press conference.
 


Two missiles fired by India at the Shorkot airbase were shot down by the air defence system, officials said.
The debris of destroyed missiles fell near a government primary school in Pirmahal village.
No casualties were reported, while Zahoor Ahmad, 70, received minor injuries after being hit by falling debris.
A drone fired by India fell in open fields in the Ahmad Nigar village on on Chiniot-Sargodha Road.
A large number of locals gathered at the site to view the wreckage of the fallen drone.
Debris of three downed Indian drones also fell in fields in Islam Nagar village, Chak Noor Muh­ammad 11/SP and Bheela near village 13/SP during the past 36 hours.
It was collected by the police officers who took it away for further analysis.
Drones were also intercepted in Sargodha.
One of the drones fell in the area of Kirana Hills and another in open fields in Chak 48 SB village.
No casualties were reported in any of these localities.
At least four drones were also shot down in different areas of Jacobabad, Sindh, on Saturday, according to Deputy Commissioner Sameer Hussain Laghari.
The debris of scattered drones fell near the Jacobabad Institute of Medical Science and the Shah Abdul Latif Numaish (Exhibition) Ground.
Locals reported sounds of explosions as smoke filled the sky, as drones were intercepted by the ground defence systems.
According to DC Leghari, at least eight people were injured after being hit by fragments of destroyed drones. One man, who was critically injured, had been transferred to Larkana for treatment.
He added the debris had been taken into custody by the authorities.
Shelling at border
At least six people were martyred and five injured as India fired shells in Tanda and Karianwala areas of Gujrat.
The deceased included three members of a family, including a man and his two sons.
They were killed after mortar shells hit their house in Jalalpur Sobtian village of Karianwala early on Saturday morning.
The victims were identified as Nisar Ahmed, 45; Habeebur Rehman, 18; and Naeem, 12.
Mr Ahmed’s third son, Muneeb, 17, was injured and undergoing treatment at the Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital.

Civil defence officials collected the pieces of shells from the house.
The shelling also killed two people in Tanda, while two others were injured in that incident.
The deceased included Zia and Hajira, whereas Umar Mustafa and Sidra Bibi were injured.
Another teenager, Muhammad Nabeel, lost his life in the Barnala village along the border area.
Gujrat Deputy Commissioner Safdar Virk and District Police Officer Dr Mustanser Atta Bajwa reached the attack site in Jalalpur Sobtian and inspected the scene.

ISLAMABAD: Norma­lity returns to the Sub­continent after Pakistan and India agreed on Saturday to a full and immediate ceasefire after days of deadly jet fighter, missile, drone and artillery attacks — news surprisingly announced by US President Donald Trump, who congratulated them on using “common sense”.
Officials from Islam­abad and New Delhi confirmed the development mi­­n­utes after Mr Trump posted the ann­ouncement on his Truth Social net­work, as the conflict bet­ween the nuclear-armed neighbours appeared to be spiralling towards a full-blown war.
“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congra­tulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,” Mr Trump posted.
In a statement on X, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said: “Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect. Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he added.
 






Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the two countries’ military operations chiefs had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 5pm Indian time (1130 GMT), without using the word “ceasefire”. He said the two DGMOs would speak to each other again on May 12.
Mr Dar told Geo News that military channels and hotlines between India and Pakistan had been activated, and three dozen countries had actively helped to facilitate the agreement.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked US Presi­dent Donald Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping Pakistan and India achieve peace in the region. “Pakistan appreciates the US for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,” he said in a post on X.
 






The ceasefire comes after four days of attacks and counter-attacks by both sides that killed at least 60 people and saw thousands of civilians flee their homes along their border as well as in Azad and occupied Kashmir.
The fighting was touched off by an attack last month in the India-held Kashmir town of Pahalgam that killed 26 tourists, which Delhi blamed on Islamabad.
Pakistani military sources said armed forces had shot down at least 77 Israeli-made high-tech drones, while Indian officials claimed they had destroyed hundreds of Pakistani drones, many Turkish-made.
Pakistan also says it downed five Indian warplanes — including three French Rafale fighter jets — although New Delhi has not confirmed any losses.
This was the first time the two nations used drone attacks on a large scale against each other. Both countries have been developing their own drones, and they also import them.
Punitive measures in place
Despite the truce, two Indian government sources told Reuters that the punitive measures announced by India and reciprocated by Pakistan, such as trade suspension and visa cancellations, would remain in place for now.
The sources also said the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact that India suspended after the Pahalgam attack, would continue to remain in abeyance.
Meanwhile, in contradiction to Mr Misri’s statement that the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of Pakistan and India would “talk again on May 12 at 12pm (11:30am Pakistan time)”, the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting reported that “there is no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place”.
Quoting its Ministry of External Affairs, the Indian information ministry tweeted that the “stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries”.
“The Pak DGMO initiated the call this afternoon after which discussions took place and understanding reached,” it added.
Positive step
“The ceasefire is a positive step,” said Bilal Shabbir, an IT consultant in Muzaffarabad. “In war, it’s not just soldiers who die, it’s mostly civilians — and in this case, it would have been the people of Kashmir.”
Ehsan Malik, CEO of the Pakistan Business Council, said both Pakistan and India “need to lift their large populations on virtually every measure of socio-economic development. We are happy that a ceasefire will help both governments to focus on this priority”.
Shuja Nawaz, distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Centre, said the Indus treaty would figure prominently in the impending talks “after a decent interval, which allows both governments to claim credit for what they’ve achieved until now”.
However, within hours after the ceasefire, violations were reported from both sides of the Line of Control (LoC).
Blasts were heard in Srinagar and Jammu and projectiles and flashes were seen in the night sky over Jammu, similar to the events of the previous evening, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses.
Residents in the city of Barnala, in Azad Kashmir, reported hearing exchan­ges of fire along the line dividing the region, according to the New York Times.
Military spokespeople in both countries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Separately, occupied Kashmir’s chief minister Omar Abdullah posted on X: “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!”
 






There were also reports from different border regions of skirmishes. Some reports also said that drones were spotted hovering over Bahawalpur.
Dawn learnt that the drones were spotted after Isha prayers, prompting citizens to come out of their homes. However, sources said the presence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is not a matter of concern as it may happen for a few days after a truce is brokered.
When contacted the district emergency officer, Police Emergency 15, Rescue 1122 Emergency Office and other security institutions, it was told that the situation was being cleared.
Deputy Commissioner Bahawalpur Dr Farhan Farooq told this scribe, via WhatsApp message, that “all intercepted” and no damage so far, Alhamdolillah“.
Rubio lauds PMs
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later revea­led that he and Vice President JD Vance had been in direct contact with senior Pakistani and Indian officials, including Prime Ministers Shehbaz Sharif and Narendra Modi, over the past two days.
In a statement released by his office, Mr Rubio said: “Over the past 48 hours, Vice President Vance and I have engaged with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishan­kar, Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, and National Security Advisors Ajit Doval and Asim Malik.”
 






He added, “I am pleased to announce the governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.”
He also commended PMs Sharif and Modi on “their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace.”
Mr Vance, who had earlier said the conflict was “fundamentally none of our business”, also endorsed the deal by reposting Mr Trump’s statement on X.
“Great work from the president’s team, especially Secretary Rubio,” Mr Vance wrote. “And my gratitude to the leaders of India and Pakistan for their hard work and willingness to engage in this ceasefire.”
 






In a separate statement, State Department Spokes­person Tammy Bruce said that Mr Rubio spoke with Mr Dar. “Secretary Rubio reiterated that both parties must find ways to de-escalate the current situation and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation. He also offered US assistance in starting constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts,” she added.
Ms Bruce said that Mr Rubio also spoke with the Indian foreign minister and “emphasised that both sides need to identify methods to de-escalate and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation”.
Secretary Rubio “further proposed US support in facilitating productive discussions to avert future disputes”, Ms Bruce added.
PM calls for dialogue
Hours after the ceasefire was announced, PM Shehbaz on Saturday expressed hope that a process of peace dialogue would take place to resolve all contentious issues between the two nuclear states, including fair distribution of water resources and the Kashmir issue.
In his address to the nation, the prime minister said Pakistan responded positively to the option of ceasefire for international and regional peace and for the sake of millions of people in the subcontinent.
He thanked opposition parties, political forces and friendly nations, including the United States, for their constructive and effective role in de-escalating tensions.
 


“We responded positively to the option of ceasefire for the sake of international and regional peace and millions of people,” PM Shehbaz said.
The premier extended special thanks to China and President Xi Jinping, saying, “China stood by Pakistan without concern for any personal gain or loss.”
He also expressed gratitude to other world leaders, including the US President Donald Trump, Turkiye President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, and UN Secretary General António Guterres.
The prime minister congratulated the whole nation and armed forces for the victory in the standoff with India and said: “Today we got a historic victory. It is the victory of our principles.”
The premier said India played a shameful role in these days and Pakistani nation and armed forces gave a befitting response to the enemy what it deserved.
“In the pretext of Pahalgam incident, India imposed war on us and attacked our civilian population through drones and missiles. Then we decided that the issues which should have been resolved through dialogue, will be settled in battlefield,” he added.
Dar engages counterparts
Foreign Minister Dar also talked to his counterparts in China, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye and apprised them of the current situation in the region following last night’s Indian aggression and Pakis­tan’s subsequent response.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi acknowledged Pakistan’s restraint and reaffirmed that China would continue to stand firmly by Pakistan.
Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan expressed condolences over the loss of innocent lives and appreciated Pakistan’s measured response.
Turkish Foreign Minister  Hakan Fidan also lauded Pak­istan’s restrained response.

The ceasefire was announced by US President Trump in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.

Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar took to X to announce the ceasefire “with immediate effect” at 5:08pm, writing “Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
 






His counterpart, Indian Foreign Minister Subhramanyam Jaishankar wrote on X that both countries “worked out an understanding on [the] stoppage of firing and military action”.
“India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,” he added.
 






India’s Foreign Secretary Shri Vikram Misri said a ceasefire was established between the two neighbours at 5pm IST (4:30pm PKT), adding during a press briefing that the military operations chiefs of both nations agreed “that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, air and sea with effect”.
“Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding,” Misri said, adding that the Directors General of Military Operations would “talk again on 12th of May at 1200 hours (11:30am PKT)”.
PM Shehbaz thanked Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping Pakistan and India achieve peace in the region.
“Pakistan appreciates the US for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,” PM Shehbaz said in a post on X.
“We also thank Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for their valuable contributions to peace in South Asia,” the premier said, adding that the country believed the step marked a new beginning in resolving issues that have plagued the region and hindered its journey toward peace, prosperity and stability.
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Pakistan has consistently pursued dialogue and diplomacy as the “only viable path to peace”.
“War, violence and aggression are never the answer,” the Bhutto scion wrote on X. “Now that both India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire and dialogue, we welcome this as a victory for diplomacy.”
Bilawal appreciated the role of the US, Saudi Arabia and all countries “involved in achieving this historic milestone”.
“As a Pakistani, I could not be more proud of our people, our army and especially our Air Force. Pakistan Zindabad.”
 






Operations commence
At around 3:30am on Saturday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that India targeted the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) Nur Khan (Chaklala, Rawalpindi), Murid (Chakwal) and Rafiqui (Shorkot in Jhang district) air bases, adding that all PAF assets remained safe.
Addressing a press conference, he said that India was “pushing the whole region towards a dangerous war with its madness, aggression and deceit”. The DG ISPR also said that India had fired missiles at Afghanistan and used drones to conduct attacks as well.
The military spokesperson said that “the majority” of Indian missiles fired at PAF airbases were intercepted by the armed forces’ air defence systems. He noted that the few Indian missiles that were not intercepted and “sneaked in” had “not been able to cause any damage” to PAF’s flying assets, as per the initial damage assessment reports.
The DG ISPR said that the air defence systems of the armed forces were able to “successfully prevent the desired objectives of India”.
He added the missiles and drone attacks by India on Afghanistan shortly after attacks on the territory of Indian Punjab were “part of a larger sinister plan to push the region and beyond into havoc”.
Lt Gen Chaudhry said that the PAF had the electronic signatures of all Indian missiles, including “from where they were initiated and what was targeted”.
The military’s spokesperson assured the nation that the armed forces were “vigilant and thwarting all these cowardly acts of aggression by Indians”.
“These blatant acts of aggression by India actually reflect the paranoia within Indian mindset which continues to grow after failure of each of these acts and the paranoia continues to also grow once it realises that they cannot break the resolve and will of the people of Pakistan which actually strengthens and further grows with each such cowardly act.”
He further said that the “growing frustration and paranoia” of the Indians would be “further compounded”.
At 4:38am, state-run PTV News said that the Pakistani military had launched its counter-attack against Indian aggression.
 






At 5:52am, PTV News and Radio Pakistan announced that the Pakistani military had destroyed a site storing Brahmos missiles in India’s Beas region as part of the retaliatory operation called ‘Bunyan-um-Marsoos’.
In a statement, the broadcasters reported that attacks were ongoing at more places in India and that airbases in Udhampur and Pathankot were also destroyed.
 






Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan also confirmed that Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos was launched against the “enemy”.
“Long live Pakistan — May Allah protect our falcons,” the minister said in a post on X.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said that Pakistan responded with precision and strategic integrity by targeting only Indian military targets.
“In tonight’s unprovoked attack by India once again, civilian populations have been indiscriminately attacked in Pakistan,” Rehman said. “This is the clear difference.”
At 6:13am, PTV News said in a video update that a storage site of Brahmos missiles was destroyed.
 






At 6:50am IST (6:20am PKT), The Times of India reported that explosion-like sounds were heard in Punjab’s Pathankot district early on Saturday morning,
“The blasts, reported around 5am, however, have not yet been officially acknowledged by authorities. A blackout was enforced in Pathankot on Friday night, with officials urging residents to remain indoors as a precautionary measure,” it said.
PTV News said at 6:29am that Pakistani drones were active in the skies above India’s capital New Delhi. Soon after, the government said on X that Pakistan had targeted key Indian military installations in a “befitting response” as part of ‘Bunyan-um-Marsoos’.
“These actions are being carried out in response to India’s initial attack, which was an assault on our homeland, people and sovereignty,” the statement said, referring to Indian missile strikes against the three PAF bases.
PTV News further reported at 7:13am that hypersonic missiles launched by a PAF JF-17 Thunder destroyed an Indian S-400 system in Adampur. It added that the S-400 air defence system is worth approximately $1.5 billion.
PTV News also said that most Indian websites, including the BJP’s official website and the Border Security Forces (BSF), were hacked as Pakistan’s counterattack continued.
Other hacked websites included the Crime Research Investigation Agency, the Mahanagar Telecommunication Company Limited, the Bharat Earth Movers Limited, All India Naval Technical Supervisory Staff Association, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Unique Identification Authority of India.
“Data leaked sites include Indian Air Force, Maharashtra Election Commission and others,” the statement added. “In addition, more than 2,500 surveillance cameras have also been hacked.”
 






Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar spoke to Geo News around 7am and said that Pakistan was operating on the defensive and had no choice but to retaliate to India’s military actions.
“The tamasha (circus) that India has done in the past three days, we will not let India claim hegemony. The Pakistan Armed Forces and government are determined that this will not happen.
“This operation that we started today, it will all end in some way. It all depends on what India wants,” he said.
“Pakistan had no choice, so our civil military leadership made the decision following the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. No more patience. We are just giving them a response.
“We’ve exhibited a lot of patience so far. There is a threshold which we cannot go beyond, especially when it comes to hypocrisy and double standards,” he said.

Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer were due to meet He in Geneva after weeks of growing tensions that have seen duties on goods imports between the world’s two largest economies soar well beyond 100 per cent.
The trade dispute, combined with US President Donald Trump’s decision last month to impose duties on dozens of other countries, has disrupted supply chains, unsettled financial markets and stoked fears of a sharp global downturn.
 
 

US President Donald Trump said on Friday an 80pc tariff on Chinese goods “seems right,” suggesting for the first time a specific alternative to the 145pc levies imposed on Chinese imports.
The location of the talks has been kept secret, although a witness saw over a dozen police cars outside a private residence in a leafy Geneva suburb.
Mercedes vans with tinted windows were seen leaving a Geneva hotel where the Chinese delegation was staying on the banks of Lake Geneva.
Earlier, a delegation of over a dozen US officials, including Bessent and Greer, were seen smiling and wearing red ties and American flags on their lapels as they left their hotel. Bessent declined to speak to reporters.</p><small>2025-05-10 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1011291221965a4.jpg?r=112930' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910016/no-casualties-reported-as-53-magnitude-quake-hits-kp' target='_blank'><strong>No casualties reported as 5.3-magnitude quake hits KP</strong></a><br><p>A 5.3-magnitude earthquake struck various cities across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday, according to a statement by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
The PMD said the quake struck at a depth of 230 kilometres, with its epicentre located in the Hindukush region.
“No casualties or damages have been reported,” KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) spokesperson Anwar Shahzad told Dawn.com.
Parts of KP — Mardan, Swat, Swabi and Abbottabad, and their surrounding areas — felt the tremors of that quake, he added.
Last month, a 4.4-magnitude earthquake jolted Swat and adjoining areas with a depth of 185 kilometres and epicentre in Hindukush.
On April 12, a 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck near Islamabad and Rawalpindi, while tremors were also felt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from another earlier quake.
Pakistan witnessed around 20 low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.
However, experts had pointed out that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — according to geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.</p><small>2025-05-10 07:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/681eabba227bf.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909970/neutrality-or-complicity' target='_blank'><strong>Neutrality or complicity?</strong></a><br><p>“THIS has been shared thousands of times. Could it be true?” asked a senior team member of ‘Sachee Khabar’, a fact-checking initiative we had launched, coinciding, by chance, with the 2019 Pakistan-India conflict, which unleashed a torrent of disinformation online. The query concerned a viral post from an account claiming to be a ‘mainstream’ Indian news outlet, alleging that the Indian Air Force had shot down a Pakistani F-16 and captured its pilot. The claim eerily mirrored an incident from earlier that day, involving Indian Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, whose MIG-21 was shot down, leading to his capture by Pakistani forces.
The post, we later found, was deliberately crafted to exploit the emotional weight of that event, misleading audiences at a volatile moment. It gained such overwhelming traction on X that even an experienced fact-checker almost fell for it. Fortunately, we were able to debunk it, but the incident underscores how easily falsehoods can outrun facts, especially when they prey on nationalist sentiment during moments of heightened tension.
Increasingly, it feels almost like a business model adopted by much of the journalism media, particularly across the border: to thrive on disinformation, capitalise on the attention economy, and move on without considering the deeper consequences. There is little reflection on how this reckless cycle damages the conflict, entrenches hostility, and reshapes public mindsets around fear and anger. And as if the mainstream media’s jingoism wasn’t damaging enough, the same manufactured narratives have now found a megaphone in social media, where this outrage is amplified tenfold. Coupled with coordinated inauthentic activity that the ruling BJP has been repeatedly accused of orchestrating, fear-mongering is now reaching an industrial scale.
The explosion of jingoism, misinformation, and digital outrage following the Pahalgam attack has laid bare an uncomfortable truth. Social media platforms, having scaled down their fact-checking and content moderation efforts, are no longer merely failing to contain the fallout; they may actually be fuelling the escalation of the conflict. The flood of misinformation on the Indian side has been particularly striking. Fact-checkers like Alt News India found major outlets recycling old visuals and linking them falsely to the Pahalgam attack, riding the momentum generated by coordinated troll networks and profiting from the outrage rather than pushing back against it.

False claims, fabricated images and incendiary rhetoric are spreading.

Across platforms like Meta, X and YouTube, false claims, fabricated images, and incendiary rhetoric seem to be spreading without resistance. The moderation systems that once might have flagged, limited, or contextualised such content seem to be conspicuously absent. This collapse is not incidental. Over the past two years, major tech companies have steadily dismantled the fragile fact-checking and crisis-response structures they had once put in place. Meta rolled back its third-party fact-checking programmes, X hollowed out its Trust and Safety teams and shifted to a far weaker ‘Community Notes’ system, and YouTube took a hands-off approach to moderation unless pushed by direct political pressure.
The collapse of platform moderation is troubling enough on its own, but the political regulation of speech has taken an even sharper turn. In the immediate aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, the Indian government moved swiftly to block access to several Pakistani news websites and YouTube channels, including major outlets such as Dawn, Geo News, and ARY News, citing concerns over ‘provocative’ content. The action appears less about security and more about shutting out alternative perspectives, further narrowing the already shrinking spectrum of information available to Indian audiences, who are increasingly exposed to a singular, jingoistic narrative. At a time when clarity, verification, and dissenting voices are most needed, the digital space is being cordoned off with alarming speed.
This uneven enforcement of the rules further compounds the disinformation danger. Takedown requests targeting Pakistani content were actioned swiftly, while inflammatory material directed against Pakistan continued to circulate freely. This asymmetry is not new, but in moments of crisis, it becomes even harder to ignore. Platforms that claim to uphold neutrality cannot act with such selective urgency. In practice, these choices shape the information battlefield, privileging certain narratives while systematically suppressing others.
 
 

In an environment already thick with mistrust and historical grievance, the withdrawal of platform responsibility is not neutral. It is a choice with real-world consequences. Disinformation in South Asia does not remain confined to the digital space; it hardens attitudes, deepens communal tensions, and risks sparking real-world violence. In the wake of the Pahalgam attack, the unchecked spread of fake news has fed precisely the kind of destabilising anger that rational voices have struggled to contain.
It is important to be clear: the collapse of responsible journalism and platform moderation affects both countries. It is not one-sided. Pakistani social media spaces are not immune to the spread of misinformation, and the closure of access to Pakistani news outlets within India has made it even harder for alternative perspectives to reach Indian audiences. The disinformation war feeds itself, with each rumour or distortion on one side reinforcing anger and suspicion on the other. The result is a vicious cycle of outrage, distrust and ever-narrowing spaces for dialogue.
The scaling back of serious counter-disinformation efforts by tech platforms is not merely a result of budget cuts or shifting corporate priorities. It is part of a broader strategy to avoid political entanglements by retreating from responsibility altogether. Platforms increasingly hide behind a simplistic notion of ‘free speech’ while their algorithms continue to reward outrage, amplify division, and privilege the most emotionally charged content, regardless of its truthfulness. In regions like South Asia, where the stakes of disinformation are measured not just in bad opinions but in real violence, this hands-off approach is profoundly irresponsible.
If there is any hope for a different path, it lies in rebuilding serious, context-sensitive moderation infrastructures. Platforms must re-establish partnerships with independent fact-checkers who work in Urdu, Hindi, and regional languages. They must empower crisis-response teams that understand the political and cultural landscapes they operate in. And they must abandon the fantasy that ‘neutrality’ means letting dangerous falsehoods spread unchecked. In times of real-world crisis, neutrality without responsibility is complicity.

• Says ECP acted like contesting party against PTI in reserved seats case
ISLAMABAD: The ongoing rift within the Supreme Court deepened on Friday as Justice Ayesha A. Malik formally complained to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi about the non-publication of her dissenting order in the reserved seats case.
Justice Malik, along with Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, had earlier dismissed a set of review petitions filed by the PML-N, PPP and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). They stated that written reasons would be released shortly. However, while the orders were issued on Thursday, they were not uploaded to the Supreme Court’s website.
In a single-page complaint to the CJP, Justice Malik expressed concern that her dissenting order, issued at 3:11pm on Thursday, had not been uploaded until Friday morning despite repeated instructions to the Supreme Court’s IT department.
Justice Malik said she had been informed that the department was unable to do so. “This lack of compliance by the IT Department is unacceptable,” she said. “I, therefore, formally request that the order be uploaded on the Supreme Court’s website immediately without any further delay.”
She also enclosed the copy of her order and forwarded the copies of the letter to all judges of the Supreme Court along with the copy of the order by Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi to bring to their attention this dereliction of duty on the part of the IT Department, on a matter that should and was ordinarily attended to in a routine manner.
She described the delay as a failure in a routine task that had become “a matter of unexplained difficulties”.
Judgement
Meanwhile, in her dissenting judgement,  Justice Malik while rejecting the review petitions observed that the ECP and other petitioners could not reargue the case under the review jurisdiction.
What is more alarming is the fact that the ECP has failed to implement the July 12 judgement in the reserved seats case. This option is not available to the ECP, which is legally and constitutionally bound to implement the judgement and by the interpretation given to the Constitution by the Supreme Court in the reserved seats case.
Compliance with the detailed judgement is not a matter of discretion but of constitutional fidelity, Justice Malik emphasised, adding that in a democracy, judgements that seek to safeguard electoral fairness, political representation and institutional accountability must be given full effect.
“To disregard such a decision would not only undermine the authority of the Supreme Court but also erode the foundational values of democracy itself,” the judgement said. She cited the Adil Khan Bazai case in which the order observed that the ECP demonstrated a leaning in favour of a political party and the government, which totally negates its constitutional duty.
“The independence of the ECP is fundamental to the election process, which is the very foundation of democracy, and the ECP should not become subservient to political influences; rather, it must remain an impartial custodian of democracy,” Justice Malik emphasised.
She also criticised the ECP for acting like a contesting party against the Sunni Ittehad Council and PTI in the reserved seats case, observing that its role in filing the review petition reflected political motives.
Justice Malik also questioned the formation of the current 11-member Constitutional Bench, noting that five of the original 13 judges, including herself, were not reappointed to hear the review petitions.
She highlighted concerns over the implementation of Article 191A, introduced via the 26th Constitutional Amend­ment, which requires the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) to nominate judges for constitutional benches.
She noted that the amendment also restructured Article 175A, effectively giving political parties greater influence in the JCP’s composition. The independence of the judiciary must be safeguarded, and JCP members must act with fairness and transparency, she stressed.
The dissenting judgement argued that the bench hearing the review petitions should include all available members of the original majority, including its author, to maintain legitimacy and public confidence in the judicial process.
“In our opinion, the committee should have requisitioned JCP for nominations of these judges for the purposes of the review petitions because the function of this committee is not merely procedural or ministerial, rather it carries substantive constitutional weight,” the order emphasised.
“The legitimacy of a bench lies not only in the process of nomination, but equally in the manner of its constitution.”

Within five minutes of the Pahalgam attack, Indian media started pointing fingers at Pakistan alleging it had enabled the terrorist attack. Two weeks later, India attacked without providing a shred of evidence of Pakistan’s alleged involvement. The purpose of this article is to urge Indian policymakers to avoid prolonging their actions as the political, social and economic costs for their own country are substantial, and instead, examine their policy stance dispassionately.
India ranks fifth among global economies and has an impressive record of rapid economic growth, which has lifted several hundred million out of poverty. It is one of the world’s leading exporters of IT and IT-enabled services, and aspires to become a developed economy by 2047, with the size of its economy projected to range between $23-35 trillion. This requires an uninterrupted and continuously upward moving growth curve. India is also working hard to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council and is among a group of developing countries leading the movement towards a multipolar world with the expanding role of BRICS.
Given this wide range of ambitions, any attempt to disrupt regional peace through kinetic or non-kinetic actions will derail it from its chosen path. Peaceful and cordial relations with neighbouring countries, on the other hand, would enhance the prospects of attaining these ambitions.
 
 

There have been past instances, such as in the 2001-02 stand-off, when Indian policymakers made sensible decisions and withdrew from the path of prolonged confrontation. The Indian troops were mobilised in large numbers in 2001-02 along the Pakistan border and as Zahid Hussain recently noted “there was an imminent threat of a full-fledged war between the two countries, but sanity prevailed. Not only was war prevented, but a more substantive peace process between India and Pakistan was also witnessed”.
The economic costs of military adventures, along with at least six other channels, can adversely affect the trajectory of India’s path towards prosperity and influence as a regional power. Elevated risk perception, trade routes and supply chain disruptions and uncertainty about the future would activate the channels highlighted below.

Any attempt by India to disrupt regional peace will derail it from its chosen path.

Cost of military adventures: Foreign affairs forums on the economic impacts of a full-scale India-Pakistan war estimate the daily cost of mobilising operations could reach $670 million with broader economic losses potentially reaching $17.8 billion, which is equivalent to a 20 per cent GDP contraction over four weeks of conflict. According to Antonis Bhardwaj, a short-term conventional India-Pakistan war could cost between INR14.6bn and INR50bn a day in direct military expenses. A prolonged conflict, accounting for broader macroeconomic impacts could lead to economic losses exceeding $17.8bn daily.
Global capability centres: 1,800 offshore corporate offices owned by hundreds of foreign-based MNCs operate in India; they generated earnings of $65bn in 2024. During the last few years, over 150 GCCs have provided back-office, legal, accounting, engineering, design, product development, consulting and architect services, and they act as R&D centres. Many other corporations are thinking of following suit. The principals of existing and planned centres may have second thoughts if political tensions or cross-border incursions continue from time to time.
Tourism: India receives 10m tourists every year recording a growth rate of 20pc, contributing $30bn in foreign exchange earnings. The tourist industry has a high multiplier effect on local economies and is a source of significant employment in hospitality, transport, entertainment, handicraft and many other ancillary services. Empirical evidence shows that there is a drop in tourist visits even if there is a semblance of disturbance or violence or threat in the host country. Thus this 20pc annual growth in tourism may be lost.
Financial markets: External capital flows, FDI, foreign portfolio investment, external commercial borrowings, nonresident Indian deposits and workers’ remittances have contributed to the build-up of large foreign exchange reserves and financed the large excess of capital flows over and above those required to finance the current account deficit. Foreign investors own about $800bn worth of Indian stocks — roughly 16pc of India’s market cap. Foreign funds are not insensitive to the larger political and economic ecosystem. Financial markets would experience capital flight. Moody’s analytics estimates that potential foreign investment outflows of $10-15bn would take place within the first month of conflict.
Defence spending: India has allocated $78.7bn in the FY25 budget for defence. Many voices are pleading to further increase the allocations to modernise and upgrade equipment. An increased threat perception of incursions, war or skirmishes across the LOC or international borders may, in fact, result in larger budgetary allocations for defence. In a country where 800m people still receive subsidised food ration it would be unfortunate if the resources are diverted from welfare to military goods.
Foreign direct investment: India is one of the major recipients of FDI with a cumulative amount of $1.05tr. These flows have increased 20 times from FY01 to FY24 from $237m in 1990 to $71bn 2024. The RBI Bulletin has observed that India is poised to benefit from supply chain realignments, diversified FDI sources and engagement with global investors seeking resilience and scale, given its already established trade linkages. These linkages and realignments would be at risk of rupture if confidence in the economy falters as a result of worsening cross-border skirmishes.
Indus Waters Treaty: The IWT’s unilateral abeyance is hardly justifiable on moral and legal grounds. Given the growing hazards of climate change the two countries along with China and Bangladesh should negotiate an arrangement where food security, water availability and the energy needs of the lower riparian countries are ensured. A potential humanitarian crisis — for which India would be blamed — should be avoided.
Many neutral observers have opined that given Pakistan’s struggle to put the economy on track, its fight against TTP and BLA terrorism and its banning of the Lashkar-i-Taiba and other extremist groups and prosecution of their leaders, it is highly implausible that it would indulge in proxy wars.

• Worried residents of India-held Kashmir flee Uri; Omar Abdullah reports hearing heavy artillery fire in occupied Jammu
MUZAFFARABAD: Amid rising tensions between the two nuclear armed neighbours, intense exchanges continued along the Line of Control on Thursday night and into Friday, with the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) PM describing the Indian bombardment as “some of the heaviest shelling in recent times”.
Both Pakistan and India have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, and on Friday conflicting reports emerged of blackouts and intense shelling being heard in India-held Kashmir as well.
The occupied territory’s chief minister, Omar Abdullah, posted on X on Friday night, saying he could hear “intermittent sounds of blasts, probably heavy artillery”, adding that there was a blackout in held Jammu as well.
While he did not mention Pakistan or accuse it of carrying out the attacks, he called on people to stay off the streets and ignore rumours and unverified information.
On the Pakistan side, locals said the Indian aggression, which resumed after sundown on Friday, claimed the lives of six civilians — including a 40-day-old infant — and left more than 30 others injured, officials confirmed.
 
 

“This was the heaviest artillery shelling in recent times, affecting even those areas that had largely remained untou­ched in previous ceasefire violations,” said AJK Prime Minis­ter Chaudhry Anwarul Haq at a press conference in his office on Friday afternoon.
“However, the resilience shown by our people and the befitting response by our armed forces to the enemy’s aggression is truly commendable,” he added.
Earlier in the day, officials from Poonch, Muzaffarabad and Mirpur divisions shared details of the widespread damage and casualties as the shelling intensified past midnight.
In Kotehri Najam Khan village of Bagh district, 22-year-old Usama Ishrat — who had married just 10 days earlier — lost his life when an artillery shell, reportedly fired from the Uri sector, pierced the tin roof of his house at around 3:50am.
His sisters, Anoob Shahzadi, 19, and Kashaf Ishrat, 17, along with a neighbour, Basharat Hussain, 52, sustained injuries.
In the Haveli district, several people were injured by shelling between midnight and 2am on Friday.
Kotli district suffered some of the heaviest losses.
In Gora village of Khuiratta tehsil, a shell that struck a house claimed the lives of 20-year-old Samra Asif and her 40-day-old daughter Ziman Fatima.
In Balyal Bharot village, 58-year-old Raja Shahpal, and in Bandli village, 32-year-old Usman Khalid were slain after being hit by shell fragments inside their homes. Locals said Mr Khalid had returned from Libya barely a week ago for a vacation.
Apart from the casualties, numerous homes and public-sector buildings — including healthcare facilities — were also damaged in the cross-LoC shelling.
All educational institutions in the region remained closed on Friday. The prime minister said a review of school reopening and board examinations would be undertaken on Monday.
“People are not willing to leave their homes, which reflects their extraordinary courage,” the premier said. “We had to forcibly evacuate them for their own safety.”
Meanwhile, on Friday, the government announced the suspension of weekend holidays in all departments classified as essential services under the AJK Essential Services (Maintenance) Act, 2016.
According to a statement by the State Disaster Management Authority, at least 17 lives have been lost 53 people injured in AJK since Tuesday night due to missile attacks and shelling along the LoC.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the LoC, artillery fire destroyed or damaged dozens of homes in Uri, forcing many to flee to safer areas in towns like Baramulla.
Sajjad Shafi, a local lawmaker, told AFP that about 10 per cent of Uri’s  population — some 22,000 people — fled since the latest fighting  began.
On Friday, many more were fleeing in buses and trucks provided by the government or driving off in their own cars.
“How can we stay here?” Rubina Begum said outside her destroyed home.  “The government should lodge us somewhere safe”.

The move came on the same day that the Indian cricket board announced the postponement of its own Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament for at least one week.
“The last 24 hours have seen a worsening of the situation on the LoC, increased incursion of 78 drones, and the firing of surface to surface missiles from India,” the PCB said in a press release issued on Friday, adding that the decision was taken “pursuant to advice received” from PM Shehbaz Sharif.
“The PCB and its players stand resolutely in solidarity with the families of the martyrs and our security personnel defending the nation,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Secretary Devajit Saikia said they had decided to suspend the rem­ainder of the ongoing IPL 2025 with immediate effect for a week.

PSL ‘postponed’ hours after decision to shift tournament to UAE

Asked if players and support staff from abroad had been given the option  to return home in case they felt uncomfortable, Saikia told  Reuters: “That’s not our domain. It’s for the individual franchises to  decide what they want to do with their foreign recruits.”
The tenth edition of the PSL involved 37 foreign players including from England, Australia, New Zealand, the West Indies and South Africa.
Most foreign players wanted to leave Pakistan after a drone fell adjacent to Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, where Thursday’s match was cancelled.
The top-notch players included former Australian opener David Warner, former West Indian skipper Jason Holder and New Zealand’s current white-ball captain Michael Bracewell.
There were eight matches remaining in the PSL, including play-offs and the final, scheduled for May 18.
The PCB also said the safety of players was paramount.
“We, at the PCB, also have sincere regard for the mental well-being of participating players and the sentiments of our foreign players, and we respect the concerns of their families who want to see them back home.”
Earlier, a statement from PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi said that the board had decided to shift the remaining matches to the UAE so that the domestic as well as foreign cricketers could be saved from “the possible reckless targeting by India”.
However, the decision to postpone the league came hours later, on Friday.
Cricket Australia was said to be closely observing the tense situation, with more than two dozen players and coaches involved in the IPL and the PSL.
“We continue to closely monitor the situation in Pakistan and India, including obtaining regular advice and updates from the Australian Government, the PCB, BCCI and local government authorities, and maintaining communication with our players and support staff currently in the region,” CA said in a statement on Friday morning.

• India abstains from vote during Executive Board meeting
• PM Shehbaz lauds economic team, slams New Delhi’s false narrative
WASHINGTON: Despite Indian attempts to derail Pakistan’s loan programme, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday approved two major financing arrangements for the country — a $1 billion disbursement under the ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and a new Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) aimed at supporting climate-related initiatives.
The approval unlocks a total of $2.1bn for Pakistan, including the $1.4bn under the RSF programme, which spans 28 months and is designed to bolster the country’s resilience to climate-induced shocks.
In March, the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan on this new climate financing arrangement, alongside the first review of the 37-month, $7bn EFF programme that was approved in September 2024 — Pakistan’s 24th IMF-supported programme to date.
 
 

According to the IMF, this assistance is intended to help Pakistan build resilience and enable sustainable growth.
During Friday’s IMF Exe­cutive Board meeting, India abstained from the vote. Ahead of the decision, Indian officials had raised objections, alleging misuse of global funds by Pakistan — claims that Islam­abad has consistently rejected as politically motivated.
India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated on Thursday that New Delhi had instructed its representative at the IMF to raise concerns over Pakistan’s eligibility for international financing. He also called on international institutions, including the World Bank and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to reassess Pakistan’s status.
Progress in restoring stability
Following the board discussion, Deputy Managing Director Nigel Clarke said in a statement that Pakistan had made important progress in restoring macroeconomic stability despite a challenging environment.
“Since the approval of the EFF, the economy continues to recover, with inflation sharply lower and external buffers notably stronger. Risks to the outlook remain elevated, however, particularly from global economic policy uncertainty, rising geopolitical tensions, and persistent domestic vulnerabilities.”
He said the steadfast implementation of the FY2025 budget and the passage of key fiscal reforms, notably the Agricultural Income Tax, underpinned the process of rebuilding policy making credibility.
“Continuing to mobilise greater revenue from undertaxed sectors and the noncompliant will make the tax system more equitable and efficient. This, combined with federal and provincial spending discipline, will strengthen sustainability, build resilience, and reduce the public sector’s crowding out of private credit.”
According to the IMF official’s statement, the timely implementation of power tariff adjustments had helped reduce the stock and flow of circular debt. “Meanwhile, cost-side reforms are showing early signs of success but need to be accelerated to safeguard the energy sector’s viability and improve Pakistan’s competitiveness.”
He also credited the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) tight monetary policy stance as being pivotal in reducing inflation to historic lows. “Monetary policy should remain appropriately tight and data-dependent to ensure inflation is anchored within the SBP’s target range. A more flexible exchange rate will facilitate the adjustment to external and domestic shocks, aiding the rebuilding of reserves.”
He also called for prompt action to address undercapitalised financial institutions and extolled vigilance over the financial sector are necessary for financial stability.
“Accelerating structural reforms will unlock Pakistan’s competitiveness, creating conditions to attract high-impact private investment. Reform priorities include reducing trade and investment barriers, advancing SOE reforms, and decisively strengthening governance and anti-corruption institutions.
On the new RSF, Mr Clarke said it would help reduce Pakistan’s vulnerability to extreme weather events, and enhance macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability.
“The reforms under the RSF aim to build resilience to natural disasters by strengthening public investment processes, supporting efficient use of scarce water resources, strengthening coordination of natural disaster response and financing, improving the information on climate-related risks, and supporting Pakistan in meeting its international commitments.”
PM lauds economic team
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the IMF approval of the $1bn tranche for Pakistan, slamming India for what he described as failed underhanded tactics to sabotage the programme, APP reported.
In a statement issued by the PM Office, Shehbaz Sharif lauded Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal and the entire economic team for their role in securing the crucial IMF support.
India’s desperate moves to sabotage the IMF programme have failed, he said, adding that international financial institutions have rejected India’s false narrative. The prime minister emphasised that the approved IMF tranche would help stabilise the country’s economy and guide it towards long-term recovery.

• Saudi minister arrives in Islamabad with message of concern, calls for de-escalation
ISLAMABAD: South Asia — home to nearly one-fifth of the world’s population — can ill-afford the irresponsible actions like the ones being carried out by India, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said on Friday.
At the weekly press briefing, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: “It is most unfortunate that India’s reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict.”
His remarks came ahead of a meeting between Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir and PM Shehbaz Sharif and other top state functionaries. The Saudi official had travelled to Pakistan on Friday after completing an official visit to India.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Riyadh’s emissary “expressed heartfelt condolences over the loss of precious civilian lives”.
 
 

He said the kingdom was deeply concerned about the current situation in South Asia, and reiterated his country’s call for de-escalation, as well as peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes between Pakistan and India, in accordance with international law and the UN Security Council’s relevant resolutions, the PMO said.
While discussing the prevailing situation in South Asia, the PM strongly condemned India’s missile and drone strikes against Pakistan that had resulted in the martyrdom of scores of innocent civilians, including women and children, as well as damage to civilian infrastructures.
He stressed that India’s unprovoked and unjustified acts of aggression had violated Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and seriously endangered regional peace and stability.
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar received Adel Al-Jubeir at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and exchanged views on the evolving regional situation.
FO briefing
Earlier, at the weekly briefing, the FO spokesperson said that in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has “once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace.”
“India’s jingoism and war hysteria should be a source of serious concern for the world,” he added.
The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan rejected any attempt to link it to the attack in Pahalgam.
He noted that a number of countries and international organisations had called on both countries to exercise restraint over the past two weeks, and it was “highly deplorable that India did not pay heed to these calls”.
“The international community should hold India accountable for its irresponsible, unlawful and belligerent conduct,” he said.
“The assertion that Pakistan escalated the situation through the Pahalgam attack of April 22 is totally absurd. To date, India has not been able to produce any credible and verifiable evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the attack.
“To the contrary, the acts of aggression committed by its armed forces had the approval and support of its entire government,” he said. “Thus, it is India that has escalated the situation by violating Pakistan’s sovereignty and killing civilians.”
He said that “the Pakistani forces did not attack Pahalgam, but the Indian forces did attack multiple locations in Pakistan,” adding that Pakistan reserves the right to take all measures in its self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.
The spokesperson noted that on April 26, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for a “neutral and transparent” investigation into the Pahalgam attack, yet “India chose the path of belligerence and aggression.”
The FO spokesperson also said Indian claims of targeting terrorists or terrorist infrastructure “are blatantly false [and] it is a matter of record that Indian strikes resulted in the martyrdom of civilians, including women and children.”
Mr Khan said “the current Indian dispensation is bent upon weaponising water; holding in abeyance of IWT is unilateral and illegal.
“Pakistan is an agrarian economy. Millions of people are dependent on the water being regulated by the treaty. The Indian decision is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and the economy.
“For Pakistan, the Indian announcement is of no legal consequence. The treaty remains enforced and fully binding on the parties,” he said.

This came after reports suggested that the accounts had been hacked and spread false information, claiming that the port had suffered significant damage due to a strike by India, resulting in substantial losses for the facility.
“Our IT team has recovered the social media accounts in 30 minutes,” a KPT official said, adding that a media team was also invited in the evening to witness smooth cargo handling operations while no infrastructure was damaged.
KPT handled 168,082 tonnes of cargo, comprising 108,856 tonnes of import and 59,226 tonnes of export.
A total of eight ships took berths while three ships sailed out. Around nine ships carrying containers, general cargo, and ammonium nitrate will arrive in the next two days.

In its mid-year budget review report to the parliament as required under section 34(1) of the Public Finance Management Act 2019, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) said the above consolidation helped contain fiscal deficit at 1.9pc of GDP in July-December 2024 against 2.5pc last year and put primary surplus — the gap between total revenue and total expenditure minus debt servicing — at a comfortable 2.3pc of GDP against 1.4pc surplus last year.
The report said the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) consumed Rs261bn in first six months of current year compared to Rs255bn a year ago. The four provinces provided Rs775bn cash surplus in the first half compared to Rs289bn last year.
It said that due to sound macroeconomic management, effective inflation control measures, and enhanced fiscal and external account stability, the first half witnessed positive developments in key macroeconomic indicators. CPI Inflation substantially declined to 7.2pc from 28.8pc last year. This allowed a shift in monetary policy direction and the benchmark interest rate was reduced by a cumulative 1,000 basis points to 12pc by January.

PSDP releases stand at Rs261bn in 1HFY25 against Rs255bn in first six months of last year

On the external side, the current account posted a surplus of $1.2bn against the deficit of $1.4bn last year. The foreign direct investment (FDI) significantly improved, rising by 20pc, while remittances surged by an impressive 32.8pc. Foreign exchange reserves stood at $16.1bn as of December 20, 2024.
On the fiscal side, prudent fiscal management led to substantial increase in revenue collection. Net revenue receipts have improved by 47pc against corresponding period last year, with an increase of 82pc in non-tax revenue and 25.9pc in tax revenue, although significantly behind target.
Expenditures of the federal government grew by 22.2pc to Rs8.2tr as against Rs6.71tr last year, primarily due to debt servicing which consumed 65pc of total current expenditure. Expenditure on running of civil government was at 40pc of the budget estimates. Similarly, defence expenditure also remained at 42pc of the FY25 budget allocation. The government did not extend any supplementary grants during the period and unforeseen requirements were addressed through re-appropriations and technical supplementary grants.
During July-December 2024-25, non-tax revenue collection remained well above the budget target, with 74pc of the target achieved in the first half as 82pc increase was witnessed compared to corresponding period of last fiscal year, mainly because of a record Rs2.5tr profit from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) —almost 160pc higher than last year’s Rs972bn and Rs550bn in petroleum levy compared to last year Rs472bn.

This cut comes in addition to a 29-paisa per unit fuel cost adjustment for ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) and a Rs3.64 per unit reduction for K-Electric consumers for the month of May.
As a result, consumers of Discos will receive a total of Rs1.84 per unit cheaper electricity in May and then Rs1.55 per unit in June and July. Similarly, K-Electric consumers will enjoy about Rs5.19 per unit cheaper rates in May and then Rs1.55 per unit in June and July.
The regulator said it allowed Rs1.55 per unit negative adjustment on account of the quarterly tariff adjustment for the January-March quarter of the current fiscal year.
The notification said Nepra “has decided to allow negative quarterly adjustments of Rs52.6bn pertaining to the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25, in a period of three months, i.e. May 2025 to July 2025, at a uniform rate of negative Rs1.5538 per kWh, to be applicable to all consumer categories, except lifeline consumers and prepaid consumers”.
Under government policy, the same quarterly adjustments will also apply to K-Electric consumers, with the same applicability period. In case any bills for the applicable period of the said adjustment are issued before this notification, the adjustment will be applied in the subsequent month.
Separately, Nepra notified consumers of Discos of a 29-paisa per unit negative fuel cost adjustment in May bills on account of consumption in February.
Similarly, Nepra also notified Rs3.64 per unit negative fuel cost adjustment in May billing against electricity consumed in February. As demanded by K-Electric, Nepra passed on only a partial reduction in fuel cost adjustment, instead of Rs6.62 per unit cheaper fuel cost than charged to consumers in February.
In its notification, Nepra also directed distribution companies to address technical losses and constraints, particularly in light of increasing integration of distributed solar generation and misaligned time-of-use (ToU) tariff structures.
Discos have also been directed to undertake a comprehensive study within four months to thoroughly examine the impact of existing ToU tariff timings and proposed measures for aligning demand with evolving load patterns and a comprehensive assessment of the financial and technical impacts of distributed solar photovoltaic integration on distribution utility operations and infrastructure.

Chairing a meeting on the preparation of the federal budget 2025-26, the premier directed that the upcoming budget should be prepared with a focus on sustainable export-driven growth and considering the projects to promote industries and increase production
“The budget should also focus extensively on the creation of jobs, agriculture, information technology, small and medium enterprises, and the housing sector,” he added.
The prime minister said that the government and private sector must work together for development and prosperity.
Calling the public-private partnerships and youth vocational training among the government’s priorities, the premier noted that positive results were emerging from the power sector reforms, as the reduction in electricity prices for industries would help promote industry and production.
He said that automation and digitisation were being promoted to bring transparency to the government system and facilitate the business community and investors, adding that the government would continue the process of rightsizing to reduce the size of the federal government in the next fiscal year.
During the briefing, it was revealed that consultations with the private sector on budget preparation had been in process for the past three months, besides consultative sessions with stakeholders from various sectors.
The meeting was informed that the five-year trade policy framework for 2025-30 and the e-commerce 2.0 framework would be completed soon, and a plan for tariff rationalisation was also being prepared.
The delegation of businessmen and experts expressed confidence in the government’s economic policies and presented their suggestions, which the prime minister welcomed, directing the inclusion of feasible proposals in the budget.
The meeting was attended by federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muhammad Aurangzeb, Jam Kamal Khan, Shaza Fatima, Sardar Awais Ahmad Leghari, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, Special Assistant to PM Haroon Akhtar, and relevant senior government officials.</p><small>2025-05-09 15:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09185948d2228db.jpg?r=190456' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909757/thousands-rally-in-bangladesh-seeking-ban-on-former-pms-party' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands rally in Bangladesh seeking ban on former PM’s party</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of people rallied on Friday outside the residence of Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus, demanding that he ban the political party of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Yunus, 84, has led an interim government since Hasina was overthrown by student-led mass protests in August 2024 and fled into exile as crowds stormed her palace.
Friday’s rally came after the sudden departure of Abdul Hamid, a former leader of Hasina’s Awami League party, from Bangladesh early on Thursday.
A crowd, mainly made up of young people, had started gathering outside Yunus’ residence on Thursday night.
Hasnat Abdullah, the chief organiser of the newly formed National Citizen’s Party, said the demonstration would continue until their demands were met.
“Sheikh Hasina robbed the people of Bangladesh of their democratic rights.
She manipulated the system to prevent any real opposition from participating in the election,” Kamrul said.
“We saw Abdul Hamid leave the country safely. The actions of certain advisers are highly suspicious. The delay in justice appears to be part of a broader plan to bring back the fallen dictator and her party,” he added.
Hasina remains in self-imposed exile in India and has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.
According to the United Nations, up to 1,400 protesters died in July when Hasina’s government launched a brutal crackdown on the opposition, for which she and Hamid are being investigated.
At least three police officers responsible for overseeing airport arrivals and departures have been dismissed for negligence, according to officials, after Hamid’s departure.
While citizens are generally barred from assembling outside the chief adviser’s residence, the student demonstrators were allowed through. The government said on Friday it was seriously considering the demand raised by various quarters to ban the Awami League.
“The government has begun communicating with different political parties to reach a final decision on the matter. It has reviewed UN-documented evidence of atrocities committed by the Awami League and its affiliates,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-05-09 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09180548cd67464.jpg?r=180606' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909752/karachi-to-host-35th-national-games-in-december-murad-shah' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to host 35th National Games in December: Murad Shah</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah announced on Friday that Karachi would host the 35th National Games from December 6 to 13 after it was  postponed from its initial dates in May.
The games were set to be held from May 1-9 in Karachi but were postponed in April due to “unavoidable circumstances,” according to an official letter issued by the Sindh Olympic Association.
Murad held a meeting today at CM House with a high-level delegation of the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) to finalise preparations for the games.
He welcomed the opportunity to host National Games, pledging full cooperation to ensure the games are organised in accordance with international standards.
He directed all relevant departments to provide essential facilities to athletes, including training, medical care, transportation, and modern infrastructure.
CM Murad announced the construction of a new swimming pool and  acquisition of modern electronic timing and scoring systems. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was also signed between the POA, the Government of Sindh, and the Sindh Olympic Association to establish a coordinated framework for organising the games.
“This initiative will be a milestone for athlete welfare and institutional coordination,” the CM said. He emphasised the importance of nurturing young talent and promoting broader interest in sports across the province.
POA President Arif Saeed briefed the chief minister on the history of the National Games and lauded the government’s commitment to their development. He noted that the upcoming event has already sparked fresh enthusiasm among athletes nationwide.
Both the Government and the POA reaffirmed their dedication to enhancing athlete performance and making the 35th National Games a landmark event in Pakistan’s sporting history.
The POA delegation was led by its President, Arif Saeed, and included Senior Vice President Ms. Fatima Lakhani, Secretary General Khalid Mehmood, and Sindh Secretary Ahmed Ali Rajput. Also present were Principal Secretary to CM Agha Wasif and Sports Secretary Aleem Lashari. Secretary Abdul Aleem Lashari gave a detailed briefing on the ongoing preparations, logistics, and planning for the upcoming games.</p><small>2025-05-09 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0911072972b8454.jpg?r=110740' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909677/psx-gallops-to-recovery-after-day-of-historic-losses' target='_blank'><strong>PSX gallops to recovery after day of historic losses</strong></a><br><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recovered nearly 4,000 points on Friday after the index suffered its largest-ever plunge a day earlier, causing losses to the tune of Rs820 billion loss to equity investors following Indian drone attacks in major cities across the country.
The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 799.65, or 0.77 per cent, to stand at 104,326.46 from the previous close of 103,526.81 at 11:06am.
At 4:31pm, the index recovered 3647.82, or 3.52pc, to stand at 107,174.63 from the last close.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, said that after falling sharply by 6pc yesterday, the stocks had recovered.
“So far, there has been no news of any major escalation which helped restore confidence,” he said.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted, “Stocks on the PSX remained volatile today, opening higher as participants increasingly factored in that an all-out war with India is unlikely.
“Some investors have begun accumulating stocks trading at highly attractive valuations following the sharp drawdown over the past week,” he added.
“Technical analysts also noted this morning that the market had entered oversold territory,” Farooq said.
On yesterday’s decline, he stated it was primarily “driven by individuals unwinding leveraged positions and redemptions from mutual funds”.
“Such corrections and short-term volatility are a normal feature of equity markets,” he said, adding that they continued to “advise that only long-term investors participate in the market, maintaining discipline during periods of uncertainty and gradually building their portfolios over time”.
“Market attention now remains on developments in Pakistan-India tensions and the IMF board meeting scheduled for today, where Pakistan’s next tranche will be considered,” he said.
Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, noted that the primary reason behind the recovery was investor optimism regarding the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting today.
“Most likely, the Executive Board will approve the tranche today,” she said.
The Fund is set to meet today to approve the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing Extended Fund Faci­li­ty and allow an additional arrangement for the $1.3bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
Furthermore, she highlighted that the market now provided “attractive valuations” due to yesterday’s market dip.
“Lastly, fears of a major escalation have been placated due to no major development on that front,” she added.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said that the “panic triggered by yesterday’s drone attacks from the Indian side is subsiding, as the Pakistan Armed Forces demonstrated ability to intercept the threats has reassured investors”.
“The recent market correction following the onset of the escalation has presented investors with a valuable opportunity to build their portfolios at more attractive valuations,” he added.
The market capital had lost Rs1.3 trillion in value in the previous three sessions as jittery investors preferred to exit the market amid growing uncertainty about the economic outlook as geopolitical tensions turned into a military standoff after India hit three cities with missiles in the wee hours of Wednesday, martyring over 31 innocent civilians. Pakistan’s armed forces responded with the downing of five Indian fighter planes.
The market crash followed alarming geopolitical developments after ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry announced that Pakistani forces had neutralised 25 drones sent by India since last night. He also confirmed that four army personnel were injured after one drone managed to partially strike a military target, despite the majority being intercepted.

A Chinese-made Pakistani fighter plane shot down at least two Indian military aircraft on Wednesday, two US officials told Reuters, marking a potential major milestone for Beijing’s advanced fighter jet.
The aerial clash is a rare opportunity for militaries to study the performance of pilots, fighter jets and air-to-air missiles in active combat, and use that knowledge to prepare their own air forces for battle.
Experts said the live use of advanced weapons would be analysed across the world, including in China and the United States which are both preparing for a potential conflict over Taiwan or in the wider Indo-Pacific region.
 
 

One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters there was high confidence that Pakistan had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets.
Social media posts focused on the performance of China’s PL-15 air-to-air missile against the Meteor, a radar-guided air-to-air missile produced by European group MBDA. There has been no official confirmation these weapons were used.
“Air warfare communities in China, the US, and a number of European countries will be extremely interested to try and get as much ground truth as they can on tactics, techniques, procedures, what kit was used, what worked and what didn’t,” said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
“You have arguably China’s most capable weapon against the West’s most capable weapon, if indeed it was being carried; we don’t know that,” Barrie said. The French and Americans would likely be hoping for similar intelligence from India, Barrie said.
“The PL-15 is a big problem. It is something that the US military pays a lot of attention to,” a defense industry executive said.
Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation declined comment and the MBDA consortium could not immediately be reached for comment on a French public holiday.
Scant details
Western analysts and industry sources said crucial details remained unclear including whether the Meteor was carried and the type and amount of training the pilots had received. Arms firms would also be anxious to separate technical performance from operational factors, analysts said.
“There will be audits of what works and what doesn’t work, but I think the other overlay is the proverbial fog of war,” said Byron Callan, a Washington-based defense expert and managing partner of Capital Alpha Partners.
US arms companies are getting constant feedback about how their products are working in the war in Ukraine, he said.
“So I absolutely expect the same to be the case with India’s European suppliers, and Pakistan and China are probably sharing the same feedback. If the PL-15 is working as advertised or better than expected, the Chinese would like to hear that.”
A defense industry source from a Western country operating the Meteor said an online picture of a seeker appeared to feature the component of a missile that had missed its target.
There are conflicting reports on whether Pakistan has the domestic version of the PL-15 from the PLAAF, China’s air force, or the lower-range export version publicly unveiled in 2021.
Barrie, who has written extensively on the missile, said he believed that Pakistan most likely has the export version.
A Western industry source dismissed claims that the rocket-powered PL-15 had longer range than the air-breathing Meteor but acknowledged that its capability “may be greater than was thought.” The Meteor’s range has not been officially published. “At the moment it’s not possible to judge anything. We know so little,” the industry source said.
The PL-15’s range and performance have been a focus of Western interest for years. Its emergence was seen as one of many signals that China had moved well beyond reliance on Soviet-era derivative technology.
The United States is developing the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile via Lockheed Martin partly in response to the PL-15 and its beyond-visual-range performance — part of a broader reset of Western priorities toward China.
European nations are exploring a mid-life upgrade for Meteor, which specialist publication Janes says could involve propulsion and guidance, but analysts say progress has been slow.
US President Donald Trump in March awarded Boeing the contract to build the US Air Force’s most sophisticated fighter jet yet, which would likely include stealth, advanced sensors and cutting-edge engines.</p><small>2025-05-09 09:15</small></div><hr>
