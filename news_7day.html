<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/170809172ff2067.jpg?r=081718' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911472/analysis-fragile-truce-a-pause-or-a-path-to-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Analysis: Fragile truce — a pause or a path to peace?</strong></a><br><p>IT’s been a week since Pakistan and India stepped back from the brink, agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire that gave both countries a much-needed sigh of relief after their most dangerous military standoff in over two decades, but instead of hope settling in, the moment feels fragile, weighed down by tough talk from Indian leaders, Pakistan’s call for deeper dialogue, and the complicated tangle of global politics that makes peace feel more like a pause than a turning point.
On the surface, the May 10 ceasefire has begun to bear fruit. Military forces on both sides have initiated a phased drawdown and returned each other’s soldier that they had taken captive during these tense days. Meanwhile, the military operations chiefs held constructive calls on May 12 and 14, and another is scheduled for May 18. These talks aim to finalise confidence-building measures and a structured mechanism for de-escalation.
Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan noted, “We urge India to adhere faithfully to ceasefire implementation. Directors General of Military Operations of Pakistan and India have maintained periodic contact since 10 May 2025. Both sides have agreed on a structured mechanism for phased de-escalation.”
Even media management — a frequent accelerant of tensions — has been handled with rare discipline by the two sides [after the ceasefire]. DGMOs agreed to shield their discussions from media leaks, a significant step in avoiding narrative-driven escalations, a source privy to the talks disclosed.

For Pakistan, stability means addressing root causes, not simply freezing the conflict, but the tone from New Delhi remains intentionally severe

Yet, despite this progress, the tone from New Delhi remains intentionally severe. Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to the ceasefire as a “temporary pause” and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reinforced that assertion saying, “Operation Sindoor is not over yet … Pakistan is on probation.”
 
 

This hardline rhetoric is aimed squarely at domestic audiences. With elections looming in key states and a national discourse deeply shaped by hyper-nationalism, Indian leadership appears more focused on optics than outcomes.
Shuja Nawaz, distinguished fellow, South Asia Centre, Atla­ntic Council (Washington DC), observed, “Both sides appear to be playing to the domestic gallery publicly. They need to set an agenda under strict timelines. The agenda should meet both their needs. Endless rhetoric is not needed at this [stage]. [There must be] A clear vision from the top: PM Modi in India and PM Sharif and army chief Asim Munir in Pakistan.”
Islamabad, meanwhile, views the ceasefire as a gateway to a more comprehensive peace process, with Pakistani officials willing to discuss terrorism, but insisting that Kashmir, India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, and long-standing grievances must also be on the table.
“Our focus is on stabilising the situation, consolidate the ceasefire and move towards de-escalation,” FO Khan said during the weekly briefing. For Pakistan, stability means addressing root causes, not simply freezing the conflict.
This asymmetry of intent is a critical fault line. While India wants a narrow, security-centric dialogue, Pakistan demands a political one with regional scope.
US played a central role in brokering the ceasefire, with President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio leading high-level backchannel efforts. Pakistan’s Army Chief General Asim Munir and civilian leadership coordinated closely, while Saudi Arabia provided discreet diplomatic muscle.
Resistance from India
India, however, has bristled at Trump’s repeated claims of facilitating the deal, though its dependence on US trade ties has tempered its reaction. This diplomatic tightrope reveals how global politics continue to shape South Asia’s trajectory.
 
 

One of the biggest hurdles now is establishing a venue and mediator for follow-up talks. Rubio’s assertion that there is an agreement on holding talks at a neutral setting is facing resistance from India, which publicly rejects third-party involvement.
The upcoming May 18 DGMOs call is critical. It must reinforce protocols, finalise redeployments, and reduce the risk of frontline miscalculations. Any failure here could unravel the gains of the past week.
There is no shortage of risk — and opportunity. The May 10 ceasefire stopped the immediate bleeding. But unless both sides move beyond performative rhetoric, align on a realistic dialogue framework, and manage domestic constraints, they risk slipping back into familiar patterns of confrontation.

“After settling disputes like Kashmir and water distribution, we can talk on trade and counter-terrorism as Pakistan is the worst affected country by terrorism which lost 90,000 lives and over $150 billion economic losses,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing a ceremony here on Friday.
The ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanks­giving Day), was held at Pakistan Monument and attended by PM Shehbaz, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) Gen Sahir Mirza, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asif Munir, Air Chief Marshal Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar, Naval Chief Admiral Naveed Ashraf, federal cabinet members, diplomats, the families of martyrs, sports personalities and showbiz celebrities, as the nation celebrated Pakistan’s victory in the recent clash with India.
Addressing the ceremony, PM Shehbaz said, “We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression. We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.”
 







India asked to sit for talks on Kashmir issue, water distribution, joint fight against terrorism

He said a war between the two nuclear powers (Pakistan, India) could endanger the lives of over 1.6 billion people living in the Subcontinent. “If there would be nuclear tussles who will live to tell what happened,” he said.
While reminding the world that Pakistan’s civil and armed forces had been on the front line in the ongoing fight against terrorists for a long time, he said, “If our armed forces had not engaged them (terrorists), they would have been roaming around in many other countries.”
He also unveiled details of his late-night meeting with the armed forces heads on May 9 when India attacked three of Pakistan’s airbases. “After Indian attacks, our Army Chief Gen Syed Asim Munir sought permission to retaliate. His voice was full of commitment, courage and patriotism. Later, you saw that how Indian airbases in Pathankot, Udhampur and many other places were hit,” he added.
The next morning Gen Asim Munir called him to apprise him that Pakistan has given a befitting response to India and that India is seeking ceasefire, PM Shehbaz said, adding that Gen Asim Munir asked him if Pakistan military should accept India’s demand for ceasefire.
 
 

The PM also said he was later informed through evidences that Pakistan had downed six Indian aircraft, including three latest Rafale jets.
“Action of our Air Force with indigenous technology and Chinese planes and gadgets gave such a blow to India that the whole world was stunned how Pakistan achieved such technology silently. Our action demoralised enemies and boosted the confidence of our friends,” he added.
Celebrating the victory, Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day) began with a 31-gun salute after Fajr in the federal capital and a 21-gun salute in the provincial capitals, followed by hoisting of the national flag at PM House, holding of rallies and ceremonies in all major cities.
 






On the occasion, the PM in his message highlighted that India while acting cowardly attacked Pakistan on the night between May 6 and May 7, resulting in the martyrdom of innocent citizens.
“We were forced to respond for the sake of these innocent citizens,” he said, adding that the world saw that within a few hours an enemy that was many times bigger came to its knees and the planes that India boasted of turned into ashes and became sign of a bitter lesson of history.
“Our Shaheens hammered the enemy and gave it a befitting reply,” he said. The brave and professional armed forces of Pakistan effectively and fully responded in the language of the enemy and wrote a golden chapter in the military history and foiled the designs of the enemy.
Later PM Shehbaz, accompanied by Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and Chief of the Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir, visited Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Rawalpindi to inquire after the health of troops and civilians injured in the Battle of Truth against India.
The PM also visited the residence of martyr Squadron Leader Usman Yousaf, offered condolences to his family, and paid tribute to the martyr’s services for the country and his sacrifice while defending the homeland.
He praised the armed forces for their exceptional bravery, determination, and sense of duty during the battle.

“We cannot comment on whether the doctor was targeted on a religious basis or for some other reason as it would be premature to say,” Sargodha District Police Officer Sohaib Ashraf told Dawn.com.
He said one person was involved in the murder and the police were already gathering information after launching an investigation.
The first information report of the incident was filed at Shahid Shaheed Police Station by a relative of Dr Mahmood under Pakistan Penal Code Section 302 (murder).
It said the deceased was a practitioner at Sargodha’s Fatima Hospital and a renowned individual of the city. The complainant said he reached the hospital with the deceased around 2:35pm.
The FIR stated that an individual wearing a uniform of the  ‘Saaf Suthra Punjab’ initiative approached the deceased and took out a pistol while saying: “I won’t spare you today Mahmood,” and shot the doctor two times in the back.
It added that the culprit soon fled, with the relative following after him to catch him but the former turned his weapon on the latter as well. The FIR said that another person arrived on a motorcycle and two soon fled away.
A press release by Ahmadi community spokesperson Amir Mahmood said the gastroenterologist had been receiving threats for a while from extremist elements, which had forced him to change the location of his job.
“He was a very charitable person and had no enmity with anyone,” Mahmood said about the deceased, saying Dr Mahmood was a well-known Ahmadi and was receiving threats because of his faith.
“The spokesperson said that this was the third Ahmadi to be targeted in the past month. The sudden increase in the continuous target killing of Ahmadis due to differences in faith is indicating a systematic wave. This is increasing the sense of insecurity among Ahmadis. This requires immediate attention and effective measures from the law enforcement agencies,” the statement said.
The spokesperson alleged that extremist elements were active against Ahmadis in Sargodha for some time now, as in other areas with baseless cases being registered and hate speeches being made to prevent the community from performing religious rituals.
“The continuous increase in hate incidents against Ahmadis is condemnable. The higher authorities should take notice of these incidents and bring the perpetrators to justice according to the law.”
Two suspects were arrested last month for the alleged murder of an Ahmadi man and injuring another in Punjab’s Kasur district.
Earlier in April, a 46-year-old businessman was lynched when a few hundred supporters of a religiopolitical party stormed a place of worship belonging to the Ahmadi community in Karachi’s Saddar area to prevent it from observing religious rituals, according to officials.
In March, the Human Rights Com­­mission of Pakistan said it had observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on the homes of families belonging to religious minorities, as well as their places of worship.
The report, titled Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24, said over 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy, as of October last year. It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadi community.</p><small>2025-05-17 03:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/162129299f6672c.jpg?r=213223' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911376/we-won-the-war-but-seek-peace-pm-shehbaz-invites-india-to-live-as-peaceful-neighbour' target='_blank'><strong>We won the war but seek peace: PM Shehbaz invites India to live as ‘peaceful neighbour’</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said Pakistan won the war but sought peace and invited India to live as a “peaceful neighbour”, as the country celebrated Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’s success with a ceremony.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan began after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched air strikes on Pakistan, causing civilian casualties. Both sides exchanged missiles over the following week, which stretched tensions. An American intervention led to a ceasefire. On Monday, the directors general of military operations held the first round of talks after the ceasefire.
Today’s ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day), was held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad and attended by PM Shehbaz, armed forces chiefs, and other civil and military leaders. It began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, opening speeches, a flypast, and national songs.

Beginning his speech, PM Shehbaz praised the martyrs, their families, his cabinet members, service chiefs, and the nation for successfully responding to the Indian aggression.
“We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression, he said. “We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.”

PM Shehbaz said he had had a meeting with the services chiefs on the night between May 9 and 10, in which it was decided that since the enemy had crossed “the last limit” and rejected Pakistan’s offer of an international investigation, a “measured response” must be given.
He detailed that around 2:30am that night, the army chief had told him on a secure telephone call that India had launched its ballistic missiles on Pakistan.
“He told me, ‘Mr prime minister, grant us permission to strike the enemy with such force that they never forget it’.”
The premier added that later that night after Pakistan retaliated, the army chief had told him: “We have given a befitting response and now we are being requested for a ceasefire. So, what do you think?”
PM Shehbaz said that he had responded: “What could be greater than landing a blow that leaves the enemy’s head spinning and desperate for a ceasefire? Go ahead and accept the offer.”
“This is a brief account of a long story from that day,” he said.
He informed the audience that the technology used by the Pakistan Air Force had stunned the enemy and sent the trust and confidence of allies soaring. “This is a historic development that God brought about within a matter of hours,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that the military’s prowess was being talked about from the United States to Japan.
The premier said no major power can now block Pakistan’s path, with the entire nation united from Peshawar to Karachi, standing behind and supporting the army. He also reiterated his gratitude to allied nations for their efforts in achieving the ceasefire.
He went on to say that the conflict solved nothing, only bringing more poverty, unemployment and other problems to both sides.
“The lesson is that we have to sit down at the table like peaceful neighbours and settle our outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. Without resolving these issues, I don’t think we will have peace in this part of the world on a long-term basis.
“If we want permanent peace then we need permanent solutions of Jammu and Kashmir and water distribution. Then once we resolve these issues, the sky’s the limit. We can talk of trade, exchange of business communities and cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism,” the prime minister emphasised.
 


Earlier in the day, Youm-i-Tashakur began with special prayers in mosques, followed by a 31-gun salute in the federal capital and a 21-gun salute at provincial capitals, according to Radio Pakistan.
The main ceremony of the day was also held at the Pakistan Monument. PM Shehbaz was the chief guest, while the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the army chief were also present there.
 
 

In a statement, PM Shehbaz said that the brave and professional armed forces have written a “golden chapter” in military history by giving an effective and forceful response to the enemy and foiling the enemy’s intentions, state media  Pakistan Television reported. He added that innocent Pakistani citizens were martyred in this cowardly attack.
“In response to the enemy’s aggression, our falcons struck such effective blows that the enemy’s military bases, weapons depots and air bases were turned into ruins,” the premier continued.
He also praised the leadership of Chief of Army Staff General (COAS) Syed Asim Munir and paid tributes to Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu and his falcons as well as the security of the maritime borders of the Pakistan Navy under the leadership of Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.
A video posted by the government on X showed the premier hoisting the national flag at the PM’s House.
 






In Sindh, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah hoisted the national flag in Karachi, according to APP. The ceremony was attended by various provincial ministers, advisers, special assistants, chief secretary and other officials.
Speaking to the media, CM Murad said that seven individuals from Sindh were martyred during the conflict with India, including six personnel of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in Bholari and one civilian from Ghotki. He announced compensation of Rs10 million each for the families of the martyrs and Rs1 million for the injured.

• Insists govt remains committed to ceasefire
• Indian defence minister signals aggressive stance, calls strikes a ‘trailer’
• Jaishankar reiterates any talks will be strictly bilateral
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday rejected India’s claim that recent military strikes had established a “new norm” in their tense bilateral relations, insisting that respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity remains the only acceptable standard in inter-state ties.
The remarks by Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan came amid a fragile ceasefire agreed upon on May 10, following India’s Operation Sindoor (vermilion, a traditional symbol of marriage worn by Hindu women) and Pakistani response codenamed Operation Bunyanum Marsoos (Iron Wall).
Pakistan condemned the strikes as a violation of its sovereignty.
“While India propagates the notion of establishing a ‘new normal’ in bilateral relations, our restrained response has reaffirmed that the only acceptable norm is respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Mr Khan said at the weekly media briefing.
“Pakistan’s effective counterstrikes have reinforced the credibility of its deterrence and dispelled any illusions of India’s conventional superiority or its ambitions to impose hegemony in the region,” he added.
The ceasefire, brokered with US mediation, has held though tenuously.
 
 

Mr Khan underscored Pakistan’s commitment, saying, “Pakistan, as a responsible state, remains committed to the ceasefire and to taking necessary steps towards de-escalation and regional stability.”
He warned, “Given India’s belligerent posture, we call upon our international partners to ensure that India honours its commitments and refrains from further aggression. Should India resume hostilities, Pakistan will have no choice but to respond.”
On Friday, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh described the strikes against Pakistan as “just a trailer, will show full picture if need be,” signalling India’s readiness to escalate, according to Indian media.
Tensions were further complicated by China’s announcement to rename 27 places in Arunachal Pradesh, a region India claims as its own. India’s External Affairs Ministry called the move “vain and preposterous,” asserting, “Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India.”
The Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman expressed support for Beijing, saying, “We have noted this development regarding China’s renaming of some areas within Arunachal Pradesh. Pakistan reiterates its consistent support for China on issues of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
 
 

Mr Singh, in his statements, also urged the International Monetary Fund to reconsider $1 billion in aid to Pakistan, alleging it could fund terrorism. “India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” he said at Bhuj Air Base.
Mr Khan dismissed Mr Singh’s statement, stating, “India trying to politicise an institution like the IMF speaks about its desperation and frustration”.
He also criticised India’s suspension of the Indus Wat­ers Treaty, a 1960 agr­eement governing shared rivers. “Holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance is unilateral and illegal,” Mr Khan said. “It is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and its economy”.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has proposed talks at a neutral venue, but Mr Khan called media discussions on timing and modalities “premature”.
“Professional diplomats are optimists; we are optimistic people. The government remains optimistic,” the spokesman maintai­ned.
India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Friday insisted talks would be “strictly bilateral”, signalling resistance to third-party mediation.

Moved through senior counsel Hamid Khan, the application has requested the court to postpone the next hearing of the review petitions, scheduled to be resumed by the 11-judge constitutional bench on May 19, until the apex court determined challenges to the 26th Amendment.
The apex court was requested to fix, hear and decide the petitions against the 26th Amendment, which were admitted for hearing on Jan 27, before the review petitions in the reserved case.
The application, which was filed under Order 36 Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules 1980, argued that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), which constituted the constitutional bench, was virtually under the executive’s control.

SIC asks bench to postpone May 19 hearing of reserved seats review petitions

“It is apparent from the formation of the constitutional benches for last several months that the senior most judges of the Supreme Court have not been included in CB, thus the independence of the judiciary stands compromised,” the SIC said.
 
 

The party reminded the court that the question of right to a fair trial under Article 10-A of the Constitution had been specifically raised in the challenges to the 26th Amendment.
At the same time, the SIC also regretted that the review petitions filed against the July 2024 judgement remained pending contrary to the normal practice of the Supreme Court to fix the matter within three months of the judgement. There was a strong apprehension that the delay was deliberate on part of the then Chief Justice of Pakistan (Qazi Faez Isa) who perhaps was allegedly waiting for the 26th Amendment to the Cons­titution, the party alleged.
The SIC further stated that underneath the constitutional mantle tailored with the fabric of 26th Amendment, there was an authoritarian regime hell-bent to destroy the judiciary’s independence, for its political objectives.
The review petitions were transferred to the constitutional bench under Article 191A(5), inserted through the controversial 26th Amend­ment, which was in conflict with Article 10A (fair trial) of the Constitution and thus void, the party claimed.
 
 

The SIC regretted that the only parallel in the constitutional history of the subcontinent of such a blatant manipulation of the judicial system through an amendment is to be found in the form of 42nd Amendment to the Indian Constitution, under which an unelected prime minister, Indira Gandhi, having lost the elections clung to power through bogus amendment. However, the Supreme Court of India rose to the occasion and struck it down in the 1980 Minerva Mills case, it added.
The application pleaded that Article 191A(5), under which the difference between an appeal and a review plea has diminished, and also the jurisdiction of the bench to undo its July 2024 ruling in the reserved seats has been taken away was patently against the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.
The SIC alleged that Article 191A was a “fraud upon the electorate” since the provisions was added specifically to undo judgements given by the SC to the dislike of the government that cobbled a majority to pass the 26th Amend­ment to perpetuate their rule without a mandate of the electorate.
The application pleaded that since the 26th Amendment was passed by parliament that “lacked legitimacy and moral authority”, there was a patent conflict between the provisions of Articles 188 and 191A(5) of the Constitution.

The contempt proceedings, initiated against the deputy registrar and others, have now become the centre of a significant legal and institutional controversy.
Interestingly, amicus curiae and senior advocate Faisal Siddiqui suggested to the court that contempt proceedings could be initiated against all concerned, including the judge, stating that even the judiciary was not above accountability.
The contempt proceedings were initiated against court officials after the acting chief justice consolidated identical petitions related to PTI founder Imran Khan’s visitation and fixed them before a three-member larger bench.
 
 

Advocate Siddiqui pointed out that there are precedents in both Pakis­tani and Indian jurisprudence where a judge issued contempt of court notices to another bench.
When Justice Ejaz Ishaq Khan asked whether a judge could move the Supreme Judicial Council for being obstructed in the administration of justice, Mr Siddiqui replied that invoking the contempt law was also an appropriate course of action.
Upon resuming the hearing, Justice Khan was informed that a two-member division bench had suspended the contempt proceedings.
“You are telling this court that it has been stopped from conducting contempt proceedings? This is a serious overstepping of authority,” Justice Khan remarked, questioning both the legality and the basis of the division bench’s intervention.
He reiterated the legal principle that an intra-court appeal (ICA) against an interim order is not admissible. “Didn’t the division bench also know that an ICA against an interim order is not admissible?” he asked. “This order goes against the authority of my senior colleague.”
Justice Khan warned that such judicial overreach could damage public trust in the courts. “If I accept this overstepping of authority, why will litigants have faith in my court? Why would anyone implement the orders issued by this court tomorrow?” he asked.
He also questioned the conduct of court officials, particularly regarding the lack of communication with his bench about the ICA. “Were you forced to file an appeal, or did you act on your own? Are you making a joke of the Islamabad High Court?” he asked the deputy and additional registrars.
Despite the institutional tension, Justice Khan made it clear that he would proceed with the case. “I will proceed with this contempt of court action and write the decision. I will write whether the Chief Justice has the authority to withdraw the contempt case from a judge,” he asserted.
The courtroom witnessed moments of intense reflection and resolve. “Let me make one thing clear — even if I have to sit alone and pretend that people are sitting in front of me, I will still write the order,” the judge declared, underscoring his commitment to judicial independence.
In his written reply, Additional Registrar Aijaz Ahmed stated that appeals against interim orders in contempt of court cases are maintainable if such orders suffer from legal defects or jurisdictional flaws.
The decision, outlined in Paragraph 10 of the judgement dated Feb 6, 2025, overturns a previous precedent and aligns with a ruling of the Lahore High Court, signalling a significant shift in the interpretation of contempt laws.
The reply further clarified that interim orders can be challenged if they are “inherently without jurisdiction, void, or coram non judice” (decided by an unauthorised forum).
The court criticised its earlier reliance on Indian contempt law, emphasising that Pakistan’s statute uses broader language — allowing appeals against any contempt-related orders, not just final or punitive ones.
Advocate Faisal Siddiqui said the situation was creating the impression of a dispute among IHC judges.
Justice Khan responded candidly: “There is a dispute among the judges, why should I pretend otherwise?”
He concluded by stating that he would issue a befitting judgement and adjourned the hearing until June 12.

• MNA flags delay in ADB-funded bridges on Kalam Road
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Friday passed nine bills, including a money bill that had been blocked by the opposition a day earlier. Only one bill — aimed at amending the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951 [The Pakistan Citizenship (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024] (Section 4) — was deferred.
Meanwhile, two new bills were introduced by suspending the rules and were also passed. These were related to child marriages and trade organisations.
Later, the proceedings of the lower house of parliament were adjourned until Monday.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb moved a bill to amend the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 [The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2024], commonly referred to as the ‘money bill’, which had been blocked by the opposition on Thursday. The treasury benches later managed to get the bill passed by a majority vote.
 
 

The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2024 is already in effect, having originally been introduced last year in the form of an ordinance. However, since the ordinance is about to lapse after completing its constitutional period, it was mandatory for the government to have it passed by the assembly to continue its enforcement.
According to the statement of objects and reasons, the bill is aimed at removing certain difficulties faced by taxpayers in implementing higher tax rates on income from federal government securities. It also seeks to rationalise the standard tax rate on the overall business income of banking companies.
The government had faced an embarrassing situation in the National Assembly on Thursday when the opposition cleverly blocked the passage of the important money bill mid-process by walking out and pointing out a lack of quorum. As the number of treasury members was below the required strength, Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah, who was presiding over the session, adjourned the proceedings.
Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui moved a bill to further amend the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Act, 1975 [The Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024], which was subsequently passed.
Another bill, introduced by Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi to amend the Extradition Act, 1972 [The Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 2025], was also passed.
A separate bill to amend the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951 [The Pakistan Citizenship (Amen­d­ment) Bill, 2024], also moved by Mr Naqvi, was passed as well.
The interior minister also tabled a bill to amend the Naturalisation Act, 1926 [The Naturalisation (Amendment) Bill, 2024], which the house passed.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved a bill to amend the Civil Servants Act, 1973 [The Civil Servants (Amendment) Bill, 2025], which was also passed.
Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan introduced and succeeded in passing a bill to amend the Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015 [The Anti-Dumping Duties (Amendment) Bill, 2025].
Two new bills introduced
Two new bills not included in Friday’s agenda were also introduced in the National Assembly. One, moved by MNA Sharmila Faruqui, aims to curb child marriages within the territorial limits of Islamabad. The second, tabled by MNA Ali Musa Gilani, pertains to trade organisations.
Later, MNA Amjad Ali Khan drew the attention of Minister for Communications Aleem Khan to an urgent matter regarding the non-construction of 12 bridges on Kalam Road (N-95) under an Asian Development Bank-funded project initiated in 2013.
He also highlighted the non-rehabilitation of a six-kilometre stretch of road that was washed away by floods. Despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s announced rehabilitation packages, no progress has been made, causing grave concern among the public.

Amid growing public anger in India about Turkiye’s stance on Pakistan in the India-Pakistan conflict, the Indian government on Thursday revoked Celebi’s security clearance in the “interest of national security”.
Celebi Airport Services India, in a May 16 filing seen by Reuters, asked the Delhi High Court to set aside that decision, arguing it would impact 3,791 jobs and investor confidence, and was issued without any warning to the company.
“Mere rhetoric of national security without elaborating upon in what manner is an entity a threat to national security is unsustainable in law,” the company said in the filing, which is not public.
The order “fails to disclose any specific or substantive reason except for a vague and general reference to ‘national security’… [it] provides no reasons or justification”, it added.
India’s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case is likely to be heard on Monday.
In its filing, Celebi said that while its shareholders were registered in Turkiye, “majority end control” of the group is held by companies that do not have Turkish incorporation or origin.
In revoking Celebi’s clearance on Thursday, India’s junior aviation minister Murlidhar Mohol said on X the government had received requests from across India to ban Celebi.
“Recognising the seriousness of the issue and the call to protect national interests, we have taken cognizance of these requests,” he said.
 






The Shiv Sena party, a key ally in Modi’s government, had held protests against Celebi in Mumbai this week, demanding that the city’s airport sever ties with it.
Celebi in its filing said it was providing ground handling services at airports in New Delhi, Kerala, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Goa.
It had undergone background checks and security verifications by various national security and intelligence agencies in India before starting work, it added.
Delhi Airport late on Thursday said on X it had “officially ended its association with Celebi” for ground handling and cargo operations.
 






Reuters reported on Friday that Air India was lobbying Indian officials to halt rival IndiGo’s leasing tie-up with Turkish Airlines, citing business impact as well as security concerns sparked by Istanbul’s support for Pakistan.</p><small>2025-05-16 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/16223604faef686.png?r=224937' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911433/assailant-who-stabbed-author-salman-rushdie-sentenced-to-25-years' target='_blank'><strong>Assailant who stabbed author Salman Rushdie sentenced to 25 years</strong></a><br><p>The man who stabbed and partially blinded novelist Salman Rushdie onstage at a Western New York arts institute in 2022 was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Friday for an attack that also wounded a second man, the district attorney said.
Rushdie, 77, has faced death threats since the 1988 publication of his novel The Satanic Verses, which Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran’s supreme leader, denounced as blasphemous, leading to a call for Rushdie’s death.
Hadi Matar, 27, a US citizen from Fairview, New Jersey, was found guilty of attacking the author in the Chautauqua County Court in Mayville, New York, in February. He faced a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison on the attempted murder charge.
Video that captured the assault shows Matar rushing the Chautauqua Institution’s stage as Rushdie was being introduced to the audience for a talk about keeping writers safe from harm. Some of the video was shown to the jury during the seven days of testimony.
“He’s traumatised. He has nightmares about what he experienced,” Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said after the sentencing hearing, referring to what Rushdie suffered.
“Obviously, this is a major setback for an individual that was starting to emerge in his very later years of life into society after going into hiding after the fatwa.”
Also hurt in the attack was Henry Reese, co-founder of Pittsburgh’s City of Asylum, a nonprofit that helps exiled writers. He was conducting the talk with Rushdie that morning.
Schmidt said Matar was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the second-degree attempted murder charge stemming from the attack against Rushdie and seven years for a second-degree assault charge for the stabbing of Reese. The sentences will run concurrently.
Rushdie, an atheist born into a Muslim Kashmiri family in India, was stabbed with a knife multiple times in the head, neck, torso and left hand. The attack blinded his right eye and damaged his liver and intestines, requiring emergency surgery and months of recovery.
Matar did not testify at his trial. His defence lawyers told jurors that the prosecutors had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the necessary criminal intent to kill needed for a conviction of attempted murder, and argued that he should have been charged with assault.
Matar’s attorney Nathaniel Barone said his client will file an appeal.
“I know if he had the opportunity, he would not be sitting where he’s sitting today. And if he could change things, he would,” Barone said.
Matar also faces federal charges brought by prosecutors in the US attorney’s office in Western New York, accusing him of attempting to murder Rushdie as an act of terrorism.
Prosecutors accuse him of providing material support to Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, which the US has designated as a terrorist organisation.
Matar is due to face those charges at a separate trial in Buffalo.</p><small>2025-05-16 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/16174430777e7ba.jpg?r=175830' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911420/ukraine-calls-on-allies-to-keep-pressure-on-russia-after-talks-yield-no-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine calls on allies to keep pressure on Russia after talks yield no ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Ukraine rallied support from its Western allies on Friday after Kyiv and Moscow failed to agree to a ceasefire at their first direct talks in more than three years, with Russia presenting conditions that a Ukrainian source described as “non-starters”.
Under pressure from US President Donald Trump to end the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War Two, delegates from the warring countries met for the first time since March 2022, the month after Russia invaded its neighbour.
The talks in an Istanbul palace lasted well under two hours. Russia expressed satisfaction with the meeting and said it was ready to continue contacts. Both countries said they had agreed to trade 1,000 prisoners of war each in what would be the biggest such exchange yet.
But Kyiv, which wants the West to impose tighter sanctions unless Moscow accepts a proposal from Trump for a 30-day ceasefire, immediately began rallying its allies for tougher action.
As soon as the talks ended, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy held a phone call with Trump and the leaders of France, Germany and Poland, his spokesperson said.
Zelenskiy said robust sanctions should follow if Russia rejected a ceasefire.
Russia’s demands were “detached from reality and go far beyond anything that was previously discussed”, a source in the Ukrainian delegation told Reuters.
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Moscow had issued ultimatums for Ukraine to withdraw from parts of its own territory in order to obtain a ceasefire “and other non-starters and non-constructive conditions”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the Russian position was “clearly unacceptable” and that European leaders, Ukraine and the US were “closely aligning” their responses.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was working on a new package of sanctions against Moscow.
Russia’s lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, told reporters that his team had “taken note” of the Ukrainians’ request for direct talks between Zelenskiy and President Vladimir Putin. Putin, after proposing the direct talks, had spurned a challenge from the Ukrainian leader to meet him personally in Istanbul.
“We have agreed that each side will present its vision of a possible future ceasefire and spell it out in detail. After such a vision has been presented, we believe it would be appropriate, as also agreed, to continue our negotiations,” Medinsky said.
Russia wants more talks before ceasefire
The sides mostly repeated their known positions. The Ukrainians wanted an immediate ceasefire and talks to ensue, while the Russians demanded more peace talks before agreeing on a ceasefire.
“If you want serious negotiations, you need to have guns silent,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi told reporters.
Expectations for a major breakthrough, already low, were dented further on Thursday when Trump, winding up a Middle East tour, said there would be no movement without a meeting between himself and Putin.
Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s top priority was “a full, unconditional and honest ceasefire … to stop the killing and create a solid basis for diplomacy”.
Russia says it wants to end the war by diplomatic means and is ready to discuss a ceasefire. But it has raised a list of questions and concerns, saying Ukraine could use a pause to rest its forces, mobilise extra troops and acquire more Western weapons.
Ukraine and its allies accuse Putin of stalling and say he is not serious about wanting peace.
Calm atmosphere
The negotiating teams sat opposite one another on either side of a U-shaped table, with the Russians dressed in suits while half of the Ukrainians wore military fatigues.
A Turkish official said afterwards that the atmosphere had been calm during the talks. No concrete timetable or location had been agreed for the next round of talks, the official said, with both sides needing to debrief their leaders first.
The Ukrainian source said the Ukrainians spoke in their own language, through an interpreter, although Russian is widely spoken and understood in Ukraine.
A Ukrainian and a European source said Russia had rejected a Ukrainian request for US representatives to be in the room.
Two sources familiar with the talks said Medinsky had said Russia was ready to keep fighting for as long as necessary, drawing a historical parallel with the wars of Tsar Peter the Great against Sweden that lasted 21 years in the early 1700s.
“We do not want war, but we are ready to fight for a year, two, three — as long as you want,” one of the sources quoted him as saying.
Grinding advance
Russia said today it had captured another village in its slow, grinding advance in eastern Ukraine. Minutes before the start of the Istanbul meeting, Ukrainian media reported an air alert and explosions in the city of Dnipro.
Russia says it sees the talks as a continuation of the negotiations that took place in the early weeks of the war in 2022, also in Istanbul.
But the terms under discussion then, when Ukraine was still reeling from Russia’s initial invasion, would be deeply disadvantageous to Kyiv if they were repeated now. They included a demand by Moscow for large cuts to the size of Ukraine’s military.
Zelenskiy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak said Russian attempts to align the new talks with the unsuccessful earlier negotiations would fail.
With Russian forces now in control of close to a fifth of Ukraine, Putin has held fast to his longstanding demands for Kyiv to cede territory, abandon its Nato membership ambitions and become a neutral country.
Ukraine rejects these terms as tantamount to capitulation and is seeking guarantees of its future security from world powers, especially the US.</p><small>2025-05-16 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/16184106a1e3369.jpg?r=184116' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911421/un-projects-pakistans-economy-to-grow-by-23pc-in-2025-amid-continuing-fiscal-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>UN projects Pakistan’s economy to grow by 2.3pc in 2025 amid continuing fiscal reforms</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is expected to experience “moderate growth, stabilising after a period of economic contraction”, with its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) projected to expand by 2.3 per cent in 2025, according to a major United Nations report.
The report, titled ‘The UN World Economic Situation and Prospects 2025’ and released a day ago, noted that declining inflation has allowed most of the South Asian region’s central banks to commence or continue monetary easing in 2025. Meanwhile, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are expected to continue fiscal consolidation and economic reforms under International Monetary Fund programmes.
Dr Aneel Salman, chair of Economic Security at Islamabad Policy Research Institute, told Dawn.com that the UN’s revised growth forecast for Pakistan reflected a “fragile yet stabilising recovery” after a prolonged period of economic distress.
“Inflation has come down sharply, reaching 0.3pc in April 2025, offering some relief to households and opening the door for improved consumer and business confidence. However, growth remains modest, limited by deep-rooted structural problems, narrow fiscal space and a heavy external debt burden that restricts economic flexibility. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme has restored some macroeconomic discipline, but the price has been steep, with fiscal tightening weighing down short-term growth.
“Globally, economic slowdown, weaker trade and the after-effects of tariff pressures continue to impact Pakistan’s exports and investment climate. The risks from regional tensions also remain real,” he said.
Salman added that despite the above, there was room for “cautious optimism”.
Elaborating, he said: “Pakistan’s economy is resilient, and I believe it can do better than the UN’s projections. What is needed now is a shift in focus from mere stabilisation to real economic renewal, driven by productivity, energy sector reform, and the digital economy. The road ahead is difficult, but the outcome is still in our hands.”
The UN report said that the near-term outlook for South Asia was expected to remain robust, with growth projected at 5.7pc in 2025 and 6pc in 2026, “driven by strong performance in India as well as economic recovery in a few other economies”, including Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
 
 

The report said the global economy was at a precarious juncture, marked by heightened trade tensions and elevated policy uncertainty. The recent surge in tariffs — driving the effective US tariff rate up steeply — threatens to raise production costs, disrupt global supply chains and amplify financial turbulence.
Uncertainty over trade and economic policies, combined with a volatile geopolitical landscape, is prompting businesses to delay or scale back critical investment decisions. These developments are compounding existing challenges, including high debt levels and sluggish productivity growth, further undermining global growth prospects.
Global GDP growth is now forecast at just 2.4pc in 2025, down from 2.9pc in 2024 and 0.4 percentage points below the January 2025 projection.
Slower global growth, elevated inflationary pressures and weakening global trade, including a projected halving of trade growth from 3.3pc in 2024 to 1.6pc in 2025, jeopardise progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals.
The slowdown is broad-based, affecting both developed and developing economies. Growth in the US is projected to decelerate significantly, from 2.8pc in 2024 to 1.6pc in 2025, with higher tariffs and policy uncertainty expected to weigh on private investment and consumption. In the European Union, GDP growth is forecast at 1pc in 2025, unchanged from 2024, amid weaker net exports and higher trade barriers.
China’s growth is expected to slow to 4.6pc this year, reflecting subdued consumer sentiment, disruptions in export-oriented manufacturing and ongoing property sector challenges. Several other major developing economies, including Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, are also facing growth downgrades due to weakening trade, slowing investment and falling commodity prices. India, whose 2025 growth forecast has been revised downward to 6.3pc, remains one of the fastest-growing large economies.
“The tariff shock risks hitting vulnerable developing countries hard, slowing growth, slashing export revenues, and compounding debt challenges, especially as these economies are already struggling to make the investments needed for long-term, sustainable development,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Li Junhua.
While global headline inflation eased from 5.7pc in 2023 to 4pc in 2024, price pressures remain stubbornly high in many economies. By early 2025, inflation exceeded pre-pandemic averages in two-thirds of countries, with over 20 developing economies facing double-digit rates.
Food inflation, averaging above 6pc, continues to hit low-income households hardest, particularly in Africa, South Asia and Western Asia. Higher trade barriers and climate shocks are further amplifying inflation risks, underscoring the need for coordinated policies combining credible monetary frameworks, targeted fiscal support and long-term strategies to stabilise prices and shield the most vulnerable.
In many countries, monetary policy challenges have intensified in an uncertain economic environment. Central banks are grappling with difficult trade-offs between managing inflationary pressures exacerbated by tariff-induced price shocks and supporting slowing economies. At the same time, limited fiscal space, especially in developing economies, constrains governments’ ability to effectively mitigate the economic slowdown.
Deteriorating global prospects and geopolitical fragmentation undermine development progress
For many developing countries, this bleak economic outlook undermines prospects for creating jobs, reducing poverty, and addressing inequality. For least developed countries where growth is expected to slow from 4.5pc in 2024 to 4.1pc in 2025, declining export revenues, tightening financial conditions and reduced official development assistance flows threaten to further erode fiscal space and heighten the risk of debt distress.
Escalating trade frictions are further straining the multilateral trading system, leaving small and vulnerable economies increasingly marginalised in a fragmented global landscape.
Strengthening multilateral cooperation is essential to address these challenges. Revitalising the rules-based trading system and providing targeted support to vulnerable countries will be critical to fostering sustainable and inclusive development.
The Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, taking place in Sevilla, Spain, from June 30-July 3, will be a crucial platform to address issues such as strengthening multilateral cooperation, debt sustainability and more to drive concrete actions on financing for sustainable development for all, the report added.</p><small>2025-05-16 16:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1620563125f8004.webp?r=205731' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911424/rawalpindi-man-sentenced-to-death-by-hanging-for-raping-woman' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi man sentenced to death by hanging for raping woman</strong></a><br><p>A sessions court in Rawalpindi sentenced a man to death on Friday for raping a woman.
Additional Sessions Judge Afshan Ijaz Sufi announced the verdict today, sentencing the convict to be hanged to death under Section 17 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation & Trial) Act, 2021.
The judge also imposed a fine of Rs200,000 and ordered him to pay Rs500,000 in compensatory damages to the victim. In case of failing to pay, the convict will be sentenced to six months’ additional imprisonment.
The first information report of the case was lodged at the Saddar Beroni police station on July 20, 2024, under Pakistan Penal Code Section 376iii (punishment for rape of a minor) on the complaint of the victim’s mother.
The mother said she worked as a housemaid and had left her 21/22-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son at home when the culprit had entered around noon and raped the former. The woman said her children had raised a hue and cry with her son alerting someone who called her up and informed her about the incident.
The woman had urged the police for the strictest of punishment to be meted out to the culprit.
In February, a Rawalpindi additional sessions judge had convicted a man of raping his niece, sentenced him to life imprisonment and awarded a Rs500,000 fine.
Rape laws in Pakistan have seen significant reforms, particularly with the Anti-Rape Ordinance 2020, which introduced special courts for expedited trials, mandated medico-legal examinations within six hours, and established a national sex offender registry.
However, systemic challenges persist, as over 80 per cent of suspected sex offenders are acquitted due to deficient investigations, weak prosecutions, and societal prejudices.</p><small>2025-05-16 15:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/16152352f3e4958.jpg?r=170835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911413/india-should-adhere-to-ceasefire-pakistan-will-respond-if-hostilities-resume-fo' target='_blank'><strong>India should adhere to ceasefire, Pakistan will respond if hostilities resume: FO</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan on Friday urged India to maintain the ceasefire agreed with Pakistan, warning that the country would respond if the neighbour resumed aggression.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
The nation observed Youm-i-Tashakur across the country today to honour the armed forces and the people for the victory in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos — a part of Marka-i-Haq — against India.
During his weekly press conference today, the spokesperson said: “The recent announcement of a Pakistan-India ceasefire is a positive development. We urge India to faithfully adhere to its implementation.”
He said Pakistan appreciated the role of friendly countries in facilitating the ceasefire and reiterated support for US President Donald Trump’s announcement on engaging with Pakistan and India to seek a resolution to the Kashmir dispute.
The spokesperson said the ceasefire was achieved by the role of several countries. “India’s portrayal of Pakistan as acting out of despair and frustration of Pakistan is baseless,” he added.
 


He informed that the military operations chiefs of both countries had maintained periodic contact since May 10 and both had agreed on a “structured mechanism for phased de-escalation”.
The spokesperson said that Pakistan had also returned a constable of the Indian Border Security Force on Wednesday as a gesture of “goodwill” in return for a sepoy of the Pakistan Rangers.
He said that at a time when the internal community was promoting regional peace and stability, “India’s rhetoric reflects a persistent tendency to distort facts, justify aggression and cast unwarranted aspersions on Pakistan’s nuclear assets.”
In contrast, the spokesperson said that “Pakistan is a responsible state and remains committed to the ceasefire and taking necessary steps towards de-escalation and regional stability.”
He requested Pakistan’s international partners to ensure India honoured its commitments and refrained from further aggression due to its “belligerent posture”. “Should India resume hostilities, Pakistan will have no choice but to respond,” he warned.
The spokesperson said Pakistan always believed in dialogue and the restoration of peace and wanted a solution to all issues, including occupied Kashmir, through negotiations.
FM Dar appreciates UK role in de-escalation
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and discussed regional developments, including the ceasefire.
Dar appreciated the UK’s constructive role in de-escalation.
The two also reviewed bilateral ties and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening relations and enhancing economic and trade cooperation.
 






Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had a meeting with United States Acting Ambassador to Pakistan Natalie Baker that focused on key issues of mutual interest, bilateral relations, and expanding cooperation between the two countries, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Both sides exchanged views on the post-ceasefire situation between Pakistan and India with Naqvi expressing gratitude to Trump and the American ambassador for their pivotal role in bringing about the ceasefire.
“The credit for the ceasefire between two nuclear powers goes to President Donald Trump,” he said.
He emphasised that President Trump had rendered a great service to humanity by helping avert a catastrophic conflict in the region.
The interior minister also appreciated the US president’s positive remarks regarding Pakistan’s leadership.
“We welcome President Trump’s encouraging thoughts about Pakistan’s leadership,” Naqvi stated.
Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening ties with the US, Naqvi said, “We want to further enhance mutual cooperation with the US across various sectors”.
In response, Baker said the US valued its strong relationship with Pakistan.
“We have excellent ties with Pakistan and look forward to continuing cooperation in multiple fields,” she said.

Delhi suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, shortly after 26 civilians in India-held Kashmir were killed in what India called an act of terror.
Pakistan has denied involvement in the incident, but accord remains “in abeyance” by India despite the two nuclear-armed neighbours agreeing a ceasefire last week following the worst fighting between them in decades.
After the April 22 attack, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered officials to expedite planning and execution of projects on the Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers, three bodies of water in the Indus system that are designated primarily for Pakistan’s use, six people told Reuters.
One of the key plans under discussion involves doubling to 120km the length of the Ranbir canal on the Chenab, which runs through India to Pakistan’s agricultural powerhouse of Punjab, two of the people said. The canal was built in the 19th century, long before the treaty was signed.
India is permitted to draw a limited amount of water from the Chenab for irrigation, but an expanded canal — which experts said could take years to construct — would allow it to divert 150 cubic meters of water per second, up from about 40 cubic meters currently, the four people said, citing official discussions and documents they had seen.
Details of the Indian government’s deliberations on expanding Ranbir have not previously been reported. The discussions started last month and continue even after the ceasefire, one of the people said.
The Indian ministries responsible for water and foreign affairs, as well as Modi’s office, did not respond to Reuters’ questions. Indian hydropower giant NHPC, which operates many projects in the Indus system, also did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Modi said in a fiery speech this week that “water and blood cannot flow together,” though he didn’t refer to the treaty. Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters on Tuesday that India “will keep the treaty in abeyance until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”.
 
 

The water and foreign ministries of Pakistan did not respond to requests for comment.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told lawmakers this week that the government had written to India arguing that suspending the treaty was unlawful and that Islamabad regarded it as remaining in force.
Islamabad said after India suspended the treaty in April that it considered “any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan” to be an “act of war.”
About 80 per cent of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects serving the country of some 250 million.
Any efforts by Delhi to build dams, canals or other infrastructure that would withhold or divert significant amount of flow from the Indus system to India “would take years to realise,” said water security expert David Michel of the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
But Pakistan has had a preview of the kind of pressure it could face from India: Water at a key receiving point in Pakistan briefly fell by as much as 90pc in early May after India started maintenance work on some Indus projects.
WB president says ‘no provision’ in IWT for suspension
Last week, World Bank President Ajay Banga said that there is no provision in the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) for suspension, in an interview with Indian broadcaster CNBC-TV18.
Speaking in New Delhi, he had said, “There is no provision in the treaty to allow it to be suspended, the way it (IWT) was drawn up, it either needs to be gone or it needs to be replaced by another one. That requires the two countries to want to agree.
“The treaty is not suspended, it’s technically called something in abeyance, is how the Indian government worded it.”
Article XII of the IWT makes it clear that it can only be modified by mutual agreement.
Success threatened
The Indus system runs through some of the world’s most geopolitically tense areas, originating near Lake Mansarovar in Tibet and snaking through India’s north and Pakistan’s east and southeast, before emptying into the Arabian Sea.
The treaty is widely seen as one of the world’s most successful water-sharing accords, having survived several major wars and longstanding tensions between India and Pakistan.
It restricts India largely to setting up low-impact hydropower projects on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan. Delhi has freedom to utilise the waters of three other rivers - the Sutlej, Beas and Ravi tributaries — as it sees fit.
Alongside the plans to expand Ranbir canal, India is also considering projects that would likely reduce the flow of water into Pakistan from rivers allocated to that country, according to two government documents seen by Reuters and interviews with five people familiar with the matter.
One document, an undated note prepared by a government company for officials considering irrigation plans, suggests that water from the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum “potentially be distributed into rivers” in three northern Indian states.
One of the people said the document, the details of which have not been previously reported, was created for discussions with power ministry officials after the April 22 attack.
Delhi has also created a list of hydropower projects in occupied Jammu and Kashmir territory that it hopes will expand capacity to 12,000 megawatts, up from the current 3,360 MW.
The list, created by the power ministry and seen by Reuters, was not dated.
A person familiar with the document said it was created before the Kashmir incident but is actively being discussed by government officials. The prospective projects also include dams that can store large volumes of water, in what would be a first for India in the Indus river system, according to two people familiar with the matter.
India has identified at least five possible storage projects, four of which are on tributaries of the Chenab and Jhelum, according to the power ministry document.
International relations expert Happymon Jacob at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University said that India’s new focus on the IWT reflected an attempt to pressure Pakistan over Kashmir.
“With the latest conflict, Delhi may refuse to discuss Kashmir with Pakistan in any format,” he said.
“Delhi has not only progressively narrowed the scope of bilateral talks but has also curtailed the agenda, focusing only on specific issues like the IWT.”
Pakistan has said that it is preparing legal action in several international forums, including the World Bank, which facilitated the treaty, as well as the Permanent Court of Arbitration or the International Court of Justice in the Hague.
 
 

“Water should not be weaponised,” Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told Reuters on Monday. “We don’t even want to consider any scenario which … does not take into account the reinstatement of this treaty.”
Michel, the US-based expert, said that concern over the treaty’s suspension was not limited to Islamabad.
“As geopolitical competition across the region deepens, more than a few Indian observers fear that Delhi’s use of water against Islamabad risks licensing Beijing to adopt the same strategy against India,” he said.</p><small>2025-05-16 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1613182539668ab.jpg?r=143344' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911386/uaes-flydubai-starts-operations-for-peshawar-airport' target='_blank'><strong>UAE’s flydubai starts operations for Peshawar airport</strong></a><br><p>UAE-based low-cost airline flydubai has started flights to Peshawar’s Bacha Khan International Airport, the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) said in a statement today.

Papua New Guinea was certified as polio-free in 2000, but immunisation rates among children are low — less than 50 per cent, according to the World Health Organisation.
The virus was detected in wastewater and environmental samples in the Pacific nation’s capital, Port Moresby, and second largest city Lae, the WHO said.
In subsequent testing, two children in Lae were found to have the poliovirus type 2 strain, according to the WHO representative in Papua New Guinea, Sevil Huseynova.
The confirmation of community transmission in the children “constitutes a polio outbreak”, Huseynova said in briefing notes provided to AFP on Friday.
The health agency “expresses deep concern over the confirmed outbreak”, she said. Genetic testing showed the polio strain detected in Papua New Guinea was linked to one circulating in Indonesia.
“Polio is a highly infectious disease, and in communities with low polio immunisation rates, the virus quickly spreads from one person to another,” Huseynova said.
Papua New Guinea Health Minister Elias Kapavore said the situation was “serious but manageable”.
“We’ve dealt with this before and know what works,” he told reporters on Thursday. “Vaccination is safe and effective, and we’re acting quickly to keep children protected,” he said.
Poliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious and potentially fatal. It can cause deformities and paralysis, and mainly affects children under five years old.</p><small>2025-05-16 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/16111812a988918.jpg?r=111947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911373/two-climbers-from-india-and-philippines-die-on-everest' target='_blank'><strong>Two climbers, from India and Philippines, die on Everest</strong></a><br><p>An Indian climber and another from the Philippines became the first mountaineers to die on Mount Everest in the current March-May climbing season of the world’s highest peak, hiking officials said on Friday.
Subrata Ghosh, 45, from India, died on Thursday below the Hillary Step while returning after reaching the 8,849-metre (29,032 feet) peak.
“He refused to descend from below the Hillary Step,” said Bodhraj Bhandari of Nepal’s Snowy Horizon Treks and Expedition organising company.
No other details were available.
The Hillary Step is located in the ‘death zone’, an area between 8,000-metre (26,250 ft) high South Col and the summit where the level of natural oxygen is inadequate for survival.
“Efforts are underway to bring his body down to the base camp. The cause of his death will be known only after post mortem,” Bhandari said.
Philipp II Santiago, 45, from the Philippines, died late on Wednesday at the South Col while he was on his way up, said Himal Gautam, a tourism department official.
Santiago was tired when he reached the fourth high camp and died while resting in his tent, Gautam added.
Santiago and Ghose were both members of an international expedition organised by Bhandari.
Nepal has issued 459 permits to climb Everest during the current season that ends in May. Nearly 100 climbers and their guides have already reached the summit this week.
Mountain climbing, trekking and tourism is a source of income and employment for Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world.
At least 345 people have died on Everest in more than 100 years since summiting expeditions were known to have started, according to the Himalayan data base and hiking officials.</p><small>2025-05-16 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/160950304cbb3e6.jpg?r=095152' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911304/protests-in-gilgit-baltistan-after-arrest-of-acc-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>Protests in Gilgit-Baltistan after arrest of ACC leaders</strong></a><br><p>GILGIT: Protests broke out across Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Thursday after police arrested five leaders of the Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Action Committee (ACC), including its chairman, Ehsan Ali Advocate, ahead of a planned Grand Jirga on May 26.
Demonstrations were held in Hunza, Gilgit and Skardu, where protesters condemned the arrests and demanded the immediate release of the detained leaders. The ACC said the arrests were aimed at sabotaging the jirga, which was to address issues surrounding the ownership of natural resources in the region.
According to officials, police arrested the activists — Ehsan Ali Advocate, Engineer Mahboob Wali, Masoodul Rehman, Asghar Shah and Waheed Hassan — from various places in Gilgit on Wednesday evening. A GB anti-terrorism court on Thursday granted police 14-day physical remand of the accused, who were taken to the Airport Police Station.
Authorities have refused to share the First Infor­mation Report (FIR), but a police source told Dawn that the arrests were made under anti-terrorism laws for alleged anti-state activities and hate speech during the recent Pakistan-India border tensions. An FIR has reportedly been registered against 16 ACC leaders.
In Aliabad, Hunza, demonstrators gathered along the Karakoram Highway. Protesters accused the GB government of targeting political dissent under false pretenses.

An IHC division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfaraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif directed the case be fixed for hearing next week following a request by senior lawyer Sardar Latif Khosa.
The courtroom witnessed the presence of a high-profile legal team of the PTI, including Salman Akram Raja, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, Niazullah Khan Niazi and Shoaib Shaheen, as well as PTI leaders Aleema Khan, Asad Qaiser, Shandana Gulzar, Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry and Nadia Khattak.
An accountability court in Islamabad had sentenced the former prime minister and Bushra Bibi to 14 and seven years in prison, respectively, on Jan 17 this year.

Directs case be fixed for hearing next week

In their appeal against the conviction, the former prime minister’s legal team highlighted significant procedural irregularities, withholding of key evidence, and political victimisation.
The defence pointed to a November 2021 judgement from the UK Court of Appeal which, they argued, clearly established that the disputed £190 million was not proceeds of crime.
 
 

The funds, part of a settlement between the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and property tycoon Malik Riaz Hussain, were to be transferred to the Supreme Court under a legally binding arrangement.
The appeal criticised NAB for failing to produce witnesses from the NCA or present credible documentation to establish the wrongdoing.
The defence also challenged the authenticity of a “confidentiality deed” presented by NAB, describing it as unverified and unsupported by forensic validation. Lawyers argued that the deed was procedural in nature and not indicative of any criminal activity.
Mr Khan’s petition said there was no evidence of personal financial gain and that the funds in question were deposited into the Al-Qadir University Trust — a legally registered entity for educational purposes.
“The prosecution’s own evidence confirms that no donations or monetary benefits were received personally by Mr Khan or his wife,” the appeal stated.
Furthermore, the petition accused NAB of a politically motivated investigation, highlighting the selective targeting of the PTI founder while omitting six other implicated individuals.
Bushra Bibi, who is serving a seven-year sentence in the same case, filed a separate appeal saying that the case against her lacked credible evidence and it was rooted in a political vendetta.
Her legal team referenced the testimony of the Chief Financial Officer (PW-5) of Al-Qadir Trust, who reportedly confirmed that neither she nor her husband gained any financial advantage from the Trust.
Later, talking to journalists outside the courtroom, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar confirmed that Barrister Gohar Ali Khan recently held a meeting with the party’s founder. The development comes amid growing speculation about possible negotiations between PTI and the government.
Barrister Zafar acknowledged there has been media buzz regarding the PTI founder’s openness to dialogue. However, he clarified that Barrister Gohar has neither confirmed nor denied reports of potential talks, stressing that any communication with the PTI founder remains confidential.
“The matter has not yet been discussed in our core committee,” Mr Zafar said. “Imran Khan, the founder of PTI, has consistently maintained that the current government is not legitimate. Any decisions or directions regarding negotiations will be made only after clear instructions are received from both Barrister Gohar and the party founder.”
Mr Zafar reiterated that PTI remains united for Pakistan and it is open to dialogue, but any formal talks will depend entirely on the directives of the party’s top leadership.
“If the PTI founder instructs us to engage in talks, then we will move forward accordingly,” he said.
Aleema Khan, the sister of Imran Khan, on the other hand, strongly rejected reports suggesting her brother has agreed to initiate talks with the government. Speaking to the media outside the Islamabad High Court, she said such claims were baseless and fabricated.
“I don’t understand where this news came from,” she said, referring to the alleged backchannel negotiations.

• PTI facing blackout in coverage by official media
ISLAMABAD: The government faced an embarrassing situation in the National Assembly on Thursday when the opposition cleverly blocked the passage of an important money bill in the middle of the process.
It was after facing a 67-32 vote defeat on the motion tabled by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to present the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024 for its passage that opposition members belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) realised that their absence could prevent the government from maintaining quorum for which the presence of 84 members is required in the 336-member house.
As soon as Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah declared the result of the headcount on the motion, the PTI members strategically walked out, leaving behind their colleague Aamir Dogar to point out lack of quorum at a time when the chair had already got approval of two clauses of the three-clause bill through a voice vote.
 
 

The deputy speaker desperately ordered a headcount and then suspended the proceedings till completion of the quorum. The government, however, not only failed to complete the quorum — for which it required the presence of 17 more members — but also could not hold the members already present in the house and thus the number dropped to even less than 67.
When the proceedings resumed after half an hour, the chair found no other option but to announce the adjournment of the sitting till Friday morning (today) without completing the agenda, which included the passage of five bills.
The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024 is already in the field as the government had introduced it last year in the form of an ordinance.
However, since the ordinance is about to lapse after completing its constitutional period, it has now become mandatory for the government to get it passed from the assembly for continuation of its enforcement. The bill, according to the Statement of Objects and Reasons, is aimed at removing some difficulties faced by taxpayers in the implementation of higher tax rates on income from federal government securities as well as rationalising standard tax rate on whole of the business income of banking companies.
Media blackout
The state-run media, as well as the official social media platforms of the National Assembly, continued the policy of censoring the proceedings of the house with opposition members facing a complete blackout.
Earlier, the National Assembly’s proceedings were not broadcast live on its official social media platforms when the house held a discussion on the Pakistan-India conflict, following the Pahalgam attack.
On May 6, when Leader of Opposition Omar Ayub Khan raised the issue of his speech being censored, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq asserted his authority, saying he had the right to expunge anything deemed “against national interest”.
The proceedings were not live-streamed on the NA’s official YouTube and Facebook channels, while PTV aired speeches from the treasury benches only.
At that time, a senior National Assembly Secretariat official had stated that the live-streaming of parliamentary proceedings had been stopped on social media in view of the sensitivity of the situation between Pakistan and India, adding that the live-stream would resume soon.
Though censorship of “objectionable parts” of opposition lawmakers’ speeches has become something of a norm, a complete blackout of proceedings during debate on an important issue was quite unprecedented.
After completion of the debate on India-Pakistan conflict, the live-streaming of the NA proceedings began on its official YouTube and Facebook channels, but now with complete blackout of the opposition members even during the question hour.
There was no word from the government on the issue. However, a senior official of the NA Secretariat told Dawn that the blackout of opposition members was being done on the directives of Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.

The government incre­ased the Inland Freight Equalisation Margin (IFEM) on both petrol and diesel to clear about Rs34 billion loss to the oil industry owing to a tax loophole in the Finance Bill 2024-25.
In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Fina­nce said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had reviewed and adjusted prices for petroleum products in view of the fluctuations in the international market.
The ex-depot price of high-speed diesel was reduced by Rs2 per litre to Rs254.64 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs256.64.
Most of the transport sector runs on high-speed diesel. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
The ex-depot price of petrol was kept unchanged at Rs252.63 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct effect on middle- and lower-income households.
At present, the government charges about Rs96 per litre tax on both petrol and high-speed diesel.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government charges Rs78 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on petrol, diesel and high-octane products that normally impact the masses.
The government also charges about Rs17 per litre customs duty on petrol and high-speed diesel, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Over the last two months, the government has disallowed about Rs18 per litre of potential reduction in petroleum prices to discourage a rise in petroleum consumption. This was done through an increase in the petroleum levy through a special presidential ordinance, to divert funds for higher subsidies on electricity rates and the construction of highways and motorways in Balochistan and Sindh.
At the request of the Petroleum Division, IFEM has now been increased by Rs1.87 per litre to address losses faced by refineries and oil marketing companies (OMCs). The financial impact, estimated at Rs34bn for FY25, stems from the reclassification of petroleum products as “exempt” under the new Finance Act, rendering input sales tax non-refundable for refineries and OMCs.
The Petroleum Division proposed that the Rs34bn shortfall be recovered through IFEM over a 12-month period, with the adjustment automatically ending in the 13th month.
Petrol and HSD remain the government’s top revenue generators, accounting for monthly sales of 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.

• India says water treaty to remain suspended until end to ‘cross-border terrorism’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday urged the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to investigate the ‘nuclear black market’ in India and repeated incidents of theft and illicit trafficking of radioactive material, as it rejected a call by India’s defence minister for the nuclear watchdog to monitor Islamabad’s nuclear programme.
Pointing to multiple incidents of radioactive material theft in India and other security lapses, the Foreign Office said, “Pakistan urges a thorough investigation of these incidents and calls upon India to ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities and arsenal.”
“If anything, the IAEA and the international community should be worried about the repeated theft and illicit trafficking incidents involving nuclear and radioactive material in India,” the statement added.
The Foreign Office was responding to comments made by Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during a speech to Indian soldiers in Srinagar, in which he said, “I believe that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons should be taken under the supervision of the IAEA.”
Mr Singh’s remarks came days after the two nuclear-armed neighbours paused their worst military confrontation in nearly three decades following the Pahalgam attack, a militant assault that New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based groups. Tensions spiked as cross-border exchanges escalated, prompting global concern over a potential nuclear flashpoint.
In a separate statement days after the ceasefire, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.”
In its response, the Foreign Office said Mr Singh’s comments “reveal his profound insecurity and frustration regarding Pakistan’s effective defence and deterrence against Indian aggression through conventional means,” adding that “Pakistan’s conventional capabilities are adequate to deter India, without the self-imposed ‘nuclear blackmail’ that New Delhi suffers.”
The Foreign Office also criticised Mr Singh’s remarks as “ignorant of the mandate and responsibilities” of the IAEA, a Vienna-based UN agency tasked with verifying that nuclear programmes remain peaceful. India’s civilian nuclear facilities are subject to IAEA safeguards under a 2008 agreement, but its strategic programme is not.
Citing recent incidents, the Foreign Office recalled that five individuals were reportedly caught in the Indian city of Dehradun last year with a radioactive device allegedly stolen from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. In another case, a gang was found in possession of Californium — a highly radioactive element valued at over $100 million. Three separate incidents of Californium theft were also reported in 2021.
“These recurring incidents call into question the measures taken by New Delhi for the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive material. These incidents also suggest the existence of a black market for sensitive, dual-use materials inside India,” the Foreign Office said.
While tensions have de-escalated for now, the heated rhetoric and the Indus Waters Treaty suspension have pushed South Asia’s nuclear-armed rivals into another prolonged diplomatic standoff.
Water treaty tensions
In a further sign of deteriorating ties, India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar announced on Thursday that the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty would remain in effect “until cross-border terrorism by Pakistan is credibly and irrevocably stopped”.
 
 

India had announced the treaty’s suspension immediately after the Pahalgam attack on April 22.
Pakistan had then condemned the Indian move, stating: “Pakistan vehemently rejects the Indian announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. The treaty is a binding international agreement brokered by the World Bank and contains no provision for unilateral suspension.”
Water is a “vital national interest of Pakistan, a lifeline for its 240 million people and its availability will be safeguarded at all costs”, the Foreign Office warned at the time.
“Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty, and the usurpation of the rights of lower riparian will be considered an act of war and responded with full force across the complete spectrum of national power,” it added.

• Dar says ultimately ‘political dialogue’ will take place to address all issues; reiterates opposition to Indian move to end Kashmir’s autonomy
• Senate resolution condemns India for unprovoked strikes against Pakistan
• Trump claims hostilities between nuclear neighbours ‘settled’, asks both to focus on trade
ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan and India extended the nascent ceasefire till May 18, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday informed the Senate that Pakistan sought a “composite dialogue” with New Delhi to put all contentious matters to rest.
According to the foreign minister, the ceasefire was extended through military-to-military communication, but a political dialogue will ultimately have to take place to resolve the problems between the two neighbours. “We have told the world that we will hold a composite dialogue,” he informed the Senate.
The FM said Pakistan had never accepted the unilateral revocation of occupied Kashmir’s special status by India in 2019, while also warning that any attempt to block Pakistan’s water through the unlawful suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty would be treated as an act of war.
He said there was no clause in the treaty under which it could be held in abeyance. “It could neither be amended nor terminated unilaterally,” he said, alluding to the Indian move to hold the treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam shooting. The deputy prime minister said India used the Pahalgam incident as a pretext to sabotage the Indus Waters Treaty.
The FM also clarified that Pakistan had not sought the ceasefire in conversations with world leaders during the heightened tensions with India. In fact, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during a telephonic conversation, conveyed that India was willing to halt hostilities, he added.
 
 

The FM also referred to subsequent calls from friendly countries and said Pakistan’s position that it desired peace with dignity and honour was explained to all. “We told our friends that we would not initiate an attack, but we would certainly respond if provoked,” he said, adding that Pakistan’s response was measured, decisive, and in line with international law.
The foreign minister pointed out that the recent conflict began after the Pahalgam incident, which India instantly blamed on Pakistan in the absence of any evidence. “We offered a transparent and neutral investigation into the Pahalgam attack, but India refused,” he regretted.
‘No longer diplomatically irrelevant’
Speaking about the recent conflict, he said Pakistan was “no longer diplomatically irrelevant”. “Pakistan is no longer diplomatically irrelevant; we have proven our strategic and diplomatic significance.”
As she opened the debate on the recent escalation, PPP leader Sena­tor Sherry Rehman said that Pakis­tan established its clear dominance in the tactical field as compared to India’s far more expensive force. “This war was deliberately thrust on us,” she said, adding that Pak­istan demonstrated to the world it was a responsible nuclear power.
Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Shibli Faraz said it was the right time to push the country tow­a­rds normalisation and political stability. “We have seen the performance of the nation when it is united,” he said, urging the government to pursue Pakistan’s foreign policy aggressively. He said that the recent escalation internationali­sed the Kashmir issue once again.
Resolution against India
The house also unanimously adopted a resolution strongly condemning the unprovoked Indian attacks on innocent civilians, including women, children and mosques, while praising the befitting response by the armed forces. The resolution urged the government to proactively engage the international community for the peaceful, just and lasting resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
It stressed the importance of strict adherence to the Indus tre­aty and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering resolve to protect its rightful share of water as a fundamental component of national sec­u­rity, international agreements, eco­nomic stability, and sovereignty.
It reminded India that any violations of the Indus treaty constituted a serious breach of international humanitarian law, and amounted not only to a war crime, but also a crime against humanity, with grave, regional, and global repercussions.
Separately, US President Donald Trump urged the two countries to focus on trade instead of war. He told US troops at a base in Qatar during a Gulf tour that Pakistan and India were happy with that, reported Reuters.
‘Maintain ceasefire’
The State Department on Thursday said the United States had urged India and Pakistan to maintain the current ceasefire.
Asked at a Washington press briefing about the reported extension, State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Piggott said: “What we are happy to see is the ceasefire. That’s where our focus remains — and on the direct talks we want to see.”
Piggott credited both Indian and Pakistani leadership for agreeing to the truce. “The President (Trump) has been clear in praising both prime ministers for choosing the path of peace,” he said.
“For the past couple of days, we’ve been saying that we want to encourage and see direct talks between the parties. We have been clear on that,” Piggott emphasised.
