“This was a non-energised/non-operational pole site near Sea Rock Apartments at Seaview, where the theft of a distribution box was reported to local police on November 6,” South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.
Later, the DIG confirmed, “The distribution box has been recovered from a nearby plot.”
He asserted that the police were “developing a strategy in coordination with Sindh Safe City Authority to prevent such incidents in future”.
Quoting a staff member from a nearby hotel earlier today, the South police chief said, “A vehicle with a crane was witnessed working on the pole hours before the theft was reported.
“Since then, a few switches and the battery are missing,” the DIG added.
The officer said the distribution box was installed at an “extreme height”, adding that it would not have been possible for one person to steal it. He noted that the cameras were also not functional.

DIG Raza observed that the locality was a “completely blacked out area” and there were neither street lights nor any CCTVs installed by private restaurants.
“Only a single camera installed at Sea Rock Apartments is available, which offers a limited coverage of the parking area,” he said, adding that the police had written letters to the Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to install street lights in the area to no avail.
According to DIG Raza, there was no alarm system installed at the “non-operational” pole, which made it difficult to ascertain when the distribution box was removed. Further investigation of the matter was under way, he said.
 
 

The first phase of the Karachi Safe City Project, aimed at enhancing public safety and security, was launched on May 31, 2024. Under that phase, 891 surveillance cameras had been deployed across Karachi.
Last month, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah approved the expansion of the project to more high-risk commercial and residential areas of Karachi, including the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) and the districts of South, East, and Malir.</p><small>2025-11-13 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13143534eb52e99.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954855/field-marshal-munir-facilitated-process-leading-to-sri-lankan-cricket-team-staying-in-pakistan-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir facilitated process leading to Sri Lankan cricket team staying in Pakistan: Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday said Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir facilitated the talks with Sri Lanka, resulting in the latter’s cricket team deciding to stay in Pakistan for the ongoing matches.
Sri Lanka’s cricket board said late last night that its team’s ongoing tour of Pakistan will proceed, averting a crisis-like situation after reports about some players returning home in the wake of Tuesday’s deadly suicide bombing in Islamabad.
“Our field marshal himself spoke to their defence minister, secretary and convinced them and assured them fully of [providing] security,” Naqvi, also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief, said while speaking on the Senate floor.
 


He recalled that the Sri Lankan team yesterday “decided to return after the bomb blast occurred”.
“Our interaction with them began […] their board, players and everyone decided with great bravery to stay here,” the PCB chairman added.
“They had many concerns, but we tried to allay all of those,” Naqvi said, highlighting that Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake spoke with his country’s team to convince them.
Naqvi then revealed that Field Marshal Munir had played a role in the visiting team deciding to continue their matches.
“And now, the Pakistan Army, Rangers and Islamabad police together are managing their security, and we are providing them the same kind of protocol and security as they are our state guests,” the interior minister said.
The PCB chairman noted that the Zimbabwe team has arrived in Pakistan, and the rest of the matches will be held in Rawalpindi.
 
 

The suicide blast in Islamabad on Tuesday, which killed 12 people and left 36 injured, occurred just hours before the first One-Day International (ODI) match between the Green Shirts and the Lions was set to begin in Rawalpindi.
Subsequently, there were reports of some Sri Lankan players heading back, which were initially dismissed by the team’s manager. However, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) later acknowledged that several members of its team had requested to return home, citing safety concerns.
“Following this development, SLC immediately engaged with the players and assured them that all such concerns are being duly addressed in close coordination with the Pakistan Cricket Board and the relevant authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of every member of the touring party,” the board said in a statement.
The SLC further said it would immediately send replacements to ensure uninterrupted games if any player or member of the touring party decides to return to Sri Lanka.
In the wake of these developments, the PCB has rescheduled the two remaining ODIs for November 14 and 16 — postponing both by a day each.
It has also shifted a T20I tri-nation tournament, featuring Zimbabwe too, from Lahore to Rawalpindi. The matches are scheduled from November 18 to 29.
 






A day after the blast, Naqvi, the Islamabad chief commissioner, and the Islamabad police chief had met Sri Lankan envoy retired Rear Admiral Fred Seneviratne.
They assured him that comprehensive security measures were in place for the players, who are state guests. According to the PCB, the Sri Lankan high commissioner had expressed satisfaction at security arrangements for his national team.</p><small>2025-11-13 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/131250459a68cb6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954848/interior-minister-tells-uk-crime-agency-chief-terrorist-incidents-linked-to-neighbouring-countries' target='_blank'><strong>Interior minister tells UK crime agency chief terrorist incidents linked to ‘neighbouring countries’</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Thursday that terrorist incidents in Pakistan were linked to “neighbouring countries”.
He made the remarks while meeting with the director general of the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA), Graeme Biggar, according to a handout issued by the interior ministry.
“Links of all terrorist incidents come from neighbouring countries,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. He said that, adding that there was no other example in the world for Pakistan’s determination against terrorism.
He said that modern forensics and training could further enhance the capabilities of law enforcement agencies, adding that effective measures were being taken to stop illegal immigration.
The statement further said that Naqvi and the NCA official held detailed discussions on enhancing cooperation in the areas of countererrorism, narcotics, human trafficking, forensics, immigration and police training.
The participants of the meeting agreed to enhance mutual cooperation in training courses for officers of various agencies, including the Anti-Narcotics Force and National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency. They also agreed to have effective coordination in combating online harassment of children, the statement said.
Five memoranda of understanding (MoUs) on cooperation in extradition and other areas between Britain and Pakistan are to be finalised soon, the ministry said.
Meanwhile, the NCA chief condemned the suicide attack in Islamabad on Tuesday and expressed grief over the lives lost in the incident.
“We are cooperating with the government of Pakistan in various fields,” he said, while appreciating Pakistan’s efforts in combatting the drug trade.
British High Commissioner Jane Marriott, the national coordinator of the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), the director general of the NCCIA, the additional home secretary, the Islamabad chief commissioner and the inspector general of the Islamabad police were also present on the occasion.
The meeting comes after a suicide blast occurred outside a district court in Islamabad’s G-11, the first such incident in the federal capital in nearly three years, and an attack on the Cadet College in Wana that was successfully thwarted.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accused Afghanistan and India of being involved in recent terrorist activity, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies.
“It is no more a secret that an external hand is visible [in attacks in Pakistan]”, PM Shehbaz said during his address to the National Assembly following the passage of the controversial 27th Cons­ti­tutional Amendment.
PM Shehbaz said the notion that Pakistan’s enemies were not involved in the attacks was “akin to calling day as night and vice versa.” He issued a stern warning directly to those responsible.
“I want to say something with great satisfaction and force to these terrorist elements and enemies of Pakistan that we are fully aware of your actions and we have given you a befitting response before and will do so again as well,” he said.</p><small>2025-11-13 10:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/131327477e51435.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954815/senate-approves-contentious-27th-amendment-as-opposition-decries-destruction-of-constitution' target='_blank'><strong>Senate approves contentious 27th Amendment as opposition decries ‘destruction of Constitution’</strong></a><br><p>The Senate approved the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment bill on Thursday after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting  Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar again tabled the bill in the upper house of Parliament today.
Elaborating on the changes and the bill’s salient features, he said the incumbent chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) would continue to hold this post until he held the office. Following his retirement, he said, the senior one among the top-most judges of the Supreme Court and the planned Federal Constitutional Court would have the title of the CJP.
He added that according to the proposed amendment, the CJP would administer the oath to the president, chief election commissioner and auditor general for Pakistan.
Detailing changes to Article 6 of the Constitution, which deals with the subject of treason, he said the provision would now read: “Any court in Pakistan, be it the Federal Constitutional Court that will now, God willing, be established, the Supreme Court or high courts, cannot validate the abrogation of [of the Constitution].”
This was akin to blocking martial laws and upholding democracy, he argued.
The matter of defection
Immediately after Tarar tabled the bill, PTI Senator Ali Zafar highlighted that the house would be voting for the second time on the constitutional amendment. The amendment, he said, would need the support of a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which meant at least 64 votes.
He recalled that during the first instance of voting, PTI’s Saifullah Abro and another senator from the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) had voted in favour of the amendment and against the party line.
After casting his vote, Abro had announced his resignation on the floor of the house.
Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani was asked about it while he was speaking to the media earlier today. In his response, Gilani said after formally receiving Abro’s resignation in writing, he would call him and maybe, “I am able to convince him”.
Later, PTI’s Zafar pointed out to him in the Senate that the defection by Abro led to the application of Article 63-A, which stipulated that Abro stood disqualified. Moreover, he said, Abro had also announced his resignation.
In light of these developments, he requested that the votes of the defecting senator not be counted.
“Otherwise, we will have to challenge this entire process,” he said.
Speaking after him, JUI-F’s Kamran Murtaza complained that “a member of ours was won over”.
“He voted in favour of the amendment, and it could not have been a choice he made out of his own good conscience,” he said, adding that “we have spent our  time with the ruling PML-N in a respectful manner”.
“But we were also disgraced,” he rued. “I think it was unfair.”
Murtaza said he wanted to put forward his party leader’s message that “our grievance to the PML-N should be conveyed that we did not like what happened. But life goes on, and what happened will remain in our memory”.
He further stated that the defecting senator from the JUI-F, Ahmed Khan, had been expelled from the party, his resignation as a senator had been sought, and the party had also sought the invocation of Article 63-A.
Considering this, Khan had no right to still vote against the party line and betray the party’s trust, Murtaza added.
“And what I am saying right now, take it as our notice pertaining to Article 63-A.  We will be voting against the amendment, and if anyone [from the JUI-F] does not, Article 63-A would apply to them as well. This is the message from Maulana, our party leader, and the decision of our parliamentary leader,” he said.
However, Tarar contended that if a member voted against the party line on no-confidence motions, budget or money bills and constitutional amendments, the party head could send a reference against them to the presiding officer. The presiding officer in the NA would be the speaker and the Senate chairperson in the upper house of Parliament, he added.
“Correct me if I am wrong. We shouldn’t distort the provisions of the Constitution for political point scoring,” he remarked.
Addressing Gilani, Tarar said he had two days to examine the reference and forward it to the chief election commissioner, that was if he had received the reference in writing. Moreover, he continued, the party head was also required to call the relevant member for a hearing before sending a reference against them.
The law minister further said the matter is eventually referred to the Election Commission of Pakistan, where a hearing is held. “And if a de-seating order is issued against anyone, they had a right to appeal in the Supreme Court,” he said, adding that until this process formally culminated, a member would not be disqualified.
As far as the issue of resignation was concerned, he stressed that the relevant member had to submit their resignation in writing to the Senate chairperson, who would then give a ruling on it.
For his part, Gilani said he had not received any resignation in writing and so, “their resignation has not yet been accepted or received”.
Ruckus in NA
Yesterday, a revised draft of the 27th Amendment bill was passed by the NA during a session attended by political bigwigs and marred by noisy protests and a walkout by opposition lawmakers.
The bill had 59 clauses and eight were changed in the final draft tabled before the lower house of Parliament. The draft was slightly different from the one initially passed by the Senate on Monday. The fresh changes are mostly related to the chief justice of Pakistan.
 
 

At the outset, the NA proceedings moved forward smoothly, and several MNAs, including opposition alliance leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, spoke on the floor of the house. The situation began turning chaotic when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, his brother and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari arrived in the hall. At this point, PTI lawmakers started chanting slogans targeting the PML-N leaders and against the constitutional amendment.
During the protest, PML-N MNAs made a shield in front of the PM and Nawaz Sharif to prevent the PTI members from approaching the premier and the party chief. Similarly, the security guards of the Parliament House also came closer to the PM for his security. The protest also disrupted the law minister’s and the PPP chief’s speeches, and the opposition members tore up the copies of the bill and flung them towards the PM’s chair.
Interestingly, PTI firebrand leader Sher Afzal Marwat did not join the protest and remained seated even after the opposition MNAs walked out of the house in protest. Later, he went directly to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to meet him and listened to the PM’s speech. As the premier spoke in the house, PTI MNA Iqbal Khan Afridi again entered the house with a banner in his hands, which carried the portrait of PTI founder Imran Khan. He went to the speaker’s dais and kept displaying the banner to the PM throughout his speech.
When the law minister started reading clauses of the bill, the opposition members gathered in front of the speaker’s dais to continue with their noisy protest. The bill, however, was passed with the required majority.
During the session, PPP’s Bilawal had vowed that the party would never support the rollback of the 18th Amendment — a change that is said to have been proposed in the bill’s initial draft — and of any laws that would go against the basic rights of the people. He said his party decided to support the changes in Article 243 (command of armed forces) in the “context that Pakistan is going through a situation of war”.
“On the one hand, we defeated India. On the other hand, India hosted the Afghan foreign minister, and what is happening on our second border after that, the spilling of blood of our citizens is in front of you,” he said. The PPP leader said terrorism was once again on the rise, but Pakistan had managed to defeat the menace before and would do so again.
“In the 27th Amendment, we are about to fulfill the unfulfilled promises of the Charter of Democracy. We are about to establish constitutional courts, and in Article 243 — after defeating India, the prime minister decided to make the army chief the field marshal — not only are we providing constitutional protection to that rank of field marshal, but also bringing some changes to the defence institutions,” he said.
For his part, PM Shehbaz thanked President Asif Ali Zardari, Nawaz, Bilawal and other allies. He said the amendment had become part of the Constitution after the consultation process, adding that the Charter of Democracy had always envisioned a constitutional court, and now that “dream” was fulfilled.
“I also want to thank Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi for supporting us within the ambit of the Constitution,” he added.
Opposition to the bill
The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) as well as changes to the military leadership structure.
After its approval by the NA yesterday, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan assailed the development, stating that in rushing the amendments, “you have sunk the ship of democracy and judicial independence”.
Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pak­­istan has ann­o­unced a nationwide protest movement aga­i­nst the proposed am­­end­ment, urging the people to take a stand agai­nst the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution.
 
 

Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the proposed amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
Contentious bill
The government’s plan to make a 27th Amendment to the Constitution is taking shape roughly a year after it managed to get the 26th Constitutional Amendment approved.
The 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
In the following months, even though the 26th Amendment remained mired in controversy and continued to face challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The speculation about whether the government intended to further tweak the Constitution was put to rest when Bilawal announced on social media platform X on November 3 that a PM Shehbaz-led delegation had sought his party’s support for the amendment.
Subsequently, PM Shehbaz also held consultations with other ruling allies to secure support for the controversial amendment.
The bill was then tabled in the Senate on Nov 8, just hours after it was approved by the federal cabinet in a meeting chaired by PM Shehbaz via a video link from Baku. It was subsequently referred to the parliamentary standing committees on law and justice, which approved it the very next day with some minor changes to the initial draft.
The law minister tabled it in the Senate for voting on Nov 10. The contentious bill was approved by the upper house of Parliament after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The PML-N led coalition government had managed to secure a two-thirds majority to get the bill passed with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines.
On November 12, the bill was passed by the National Assembly after the introduction of some changes, mostly related to the chief justice of Pakistan.
In the house of 336 members, 224 votes were required to meet the mandatory two-thirds majority for the passage of the bill. The ruling lawmakers cast 234 votes in its favour, while four votes were polled against the bill by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) members. The JUI-F has 10 MNAs, but only four attended the sitting. The PTI members, meanwhile, boycotted the process by staging a walkout.</p><small>2025-11-13 09:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13141915c1e82cf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954850/7-suspected-facilitators-of-islamabad-court-blast-arrested-by-rawalpindi-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>7 suspected facilitators of Islamabad court blast arrested by Rawalpindi CTD</strong></a><br><p>Rawalpindi’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Thursday arrested seven suspects who allegedly facilitated the suicide bomb blast at Islamabad’s judicial complex on November 11, killing 12 people and injuring 36.
According to a police source, the “suspected facilitators have been arrested from Rawalpindi’s Fauji Colony (Pirwadhai area) and Dhoke Kashmirian. Moreover, a raid was also conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”
Yesterday, investigators had detained a bike rider of an online ride-hailing platform who had dropped off the bom­ber outside at the location.
A police official had said the bomber paid the fare to the bike rider against the ride, adding that he was traced and identified through the CCTV footage.
 
 

After his location was traced, the police picked him up and shifted him to an installation where he was being kept under protective custody.
The incident had occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the 6th Margalla Dialogue, while a cricket match between the Green Shirts and Sri Lanka was also being held in Rawalpindi.
The blast had occurred the same day a bomb attack targeted a security forces’ convoy in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district, injuring at least 14 personnel.
A day before that, the Cadet College in South Waziristan’s Wana had come under attack. While all students and teachers were reported to have been safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed, the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals.
‘State of war’
In the wake of the Islamabad and Wana attacks, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif yesterday accused Afghanistan and India of involvement in recent terrorism, and vowed a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies.
Hours after the blast, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had termed the incident a “wake-up call” and said Pakistan was “in a state of war”.
“Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan Army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan, today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts is a wake-up call,” he had said, voicing lack of hope for successful counter-terrorism negotiations with Kabul.
 
 

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had said, “We are linking this blast today with a lot of things and, in the coming hours or days, we will be very clear about it.”
“We are not taking this blast as just another one,” he added, noting that its timing and the federal capital being targeted “has a lot of messages”.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had said that the suicide bomber was “not a Pakistani national”.
Elaborating on the matter in an interview, Chaudhry said: “The suicide attacker in the Islamabad blast was not a Pakistani. I am confirming this to you. He did not know Pakistan’s language nor did he know of the country’s currency.”</p><small>2025-11-13 09:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1312470616e428d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954665/lutf-ata-hai-dr-arfa-sayeda-zehras-living-legacy' target='_blank'><strong>‘Lutf ata hai’: Dr Arfa Sayeda Zehra’s living legacy</strong></a><br><p> 


Dr Arfa Sayeda Zehra had the rare ability to distill an entire philosophy into a single sentence. I came across one of her interviews yesterday where she observed, “Aj ki nasal Urdu parh nahi paati, likh nahi paati, magar sunti hai to lutf leti hai” [Today’s generation cannot read or write Urdu, but they take pleasure in listening to it].
The command she held over the language was such that within that simple reflection lies a diagnosis not only of linguistic decay, but of an entire behavioural condition; one that captures what it means to live in a society where expression has been displaced by efficiency, where our mother tongues have been diluted by foreign dialects.
The language of ambition vs the language of affection
We, her students, are the generation she describes, “urdu parh nahi paati, urdu likh nahi paati magar urdu sunti hai tou lutf leti hai. Fluent in fragments, emotionally literate yet linguistically estranged. We can speak Urdu, even admire its cadence, but we cannot stay loyal to it long enough to read or write it.
We once took pride in perfecting our English accents and filling pages with borrowed eloquence. Yet with our own language, our connection has regressed to speech only. The very language that once shaped our imagination has been reduced to aural pleasure, consumed through dramas and reels, rather than inhabited through script and story.
Crediting to recent debates, we’re now familiar that this detachment is not accidental; it is patterned. It reflects a kind of postcolonial conditioning, where English remains the language of aspiration, and Urdu, the language of affection. One represents employability, the other emotion. Our inherited education system too rewards grammar, not gentleness; articulation, not awareness. The hierarchy of language has quietly become the hierarchy of value.
Yet Dr Zehra’s words remind us that “rozgaar zindagi ke liye hota hai, zindagi rozgaar ke liye nahi,” (Work is meant to sustain life, life is not meant to serve work) while diagnosing a deeper sociological transformation: the gradual replacement of meaning with monetisation.
Somewhere between our resumes and our timelines, we internalised a single rule: if something cannot be capitalised, it should not be prioritised. Reading for pleasure, writing for reflection, or creating for joy have all fallen outside our cognitive frame of “productiveness.”
“Learned helplessness”
Behaviourally, this is what psychologists might describe as instrumental narrowing — the process by which individuals, under chronic economic and social pressure, begin to value only goal-directed activities. Over time, we lose the capacity for autotelic pursuits, those done for their own sake. It’s not that we reject art or literature; we simply forget how to approach them without turning them into transactions. Her legacy calls for this ‘ehsaas’ and ‘fikr’ to reach those entrapped in their 9-5s or other monetary pursuits.
However, the roots of this narrowing are structural. The economic compression of Pakistan’s lower and middle classes has (and rightly so) imposed a survivalist logic on everyday life. When the mental bandwidth is consumed by bills, instability, or scarcity, attention shifts from exploration to endurance. People do not pursue what makes them happy because happiness feels like a resource they can no longer afford.
Layered on this is psychological withdrawal — what American psychologist Martin Seligman termed learned helplessness. After repeated experiences of constraint, be they economic, political, or social, individuals stop believing their actions can meaningfully alter outcomes. A person who feels unseen by the system gradually stops trying to express, create, or contribute. It is a quiet surrender that manifests as disinterest, or even cynicism, toward anything not linked to survival.
And then, of course, there is systemic neglect — the near-total absence of public infrastructure for creative and collective life. We have built cities that optimise for consumption, not connection. Libraries close before restaurants do. Cultural centres give way to parking lots.
For a society to produce art, it must first make space for leisure, both physical and psychological. This is why even leisure has been reframed through productivity. You’re reading a book? It had better be self-help. You’re drawing? Try monetising it. You’re collecting something? Sell it.
The narrowing of life
This is not just economic rationalisation; it’s a cognitive one, a narrowing of what counts as valuable effort. When every act must justify itself through output, imagination becomes inefficient.
Dr Zehra’s observation captures the full circle of this loss. We have become a generation trained to optimise, not to wonder; to function, not to feel.
The tragedy is not merely linguistic, that we can no longer write Urdu, but psychological: that we have lost the reflex to dwell in what is unmeasurable, unprofitable, and yet deeply human. To which she then questions: “humara taaleemi nizaam is baat ki gawahi nahi desakta ke hum hasaas aur zahin shehri paida karnay ke liye tayyar hain” (Our education system cannot claim that it is prepared to nurture sensitive and intelligent citizens).
Perhaps it is because our education system conditions students to capitalise every act, to survive their way through the rough conditions of the market, to endure the relentless races and competitive spaces. And perhaps that is what many deem to be the very purpose of education: to equip one for survival. Yet we cannot help but ask, is this truly what education was meant to produce?
Because as Dr Zehra reminds us, our system does not cultivate sensitive and intelligent citizens. She asserts that it is not yet prepared to create such individuals. And even when such citizens are born, perhaps as they navigate their way through this system, those very capacities — sensitivity and intellect — begin to fade.</p><small>2025-11-13 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13075244a0787e5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954722/crisis-averted-as-sri-lanka-team-stay-put-pcb-revises-tour-schedule' target='_blank'><strong>Crisis averted as Sri Lanka team stay put, PCB revises tour schedule</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Sri Lanka tour of Pakistan will proceed, the visiting team’s cricket board said late Wednesday night, as a crisis-like situation was ave­r­ted with the team’s manager eventually dismissing reports about some players returning home in the wake of the suicide bombing in the federal capital.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) rescheduled the remaining ODIs and shifted the T20I tri-nation tournament, also featuring Zimbabwe, to Rawalpindi from Lahore.
The PCB moved the second and third ODIs to Nov 14 and 16 at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. The entire T20I Tri-Nation Tournament will now also be held in Rawalpindi, starting from Nov 18 and the final on Nov 29.
 






According to the PCB, the decision was made in consultation with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and Zimbabwe Cricket following mutual discussions to accommodate operational and match requirements.
The PCB hoped that the tri-nation series would serve as an important preparation platform ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup 2026, the PCB said. Updated fixtures for both the ODI series and the T20 tournament “will be shared shortly” on the board’s official platforms, it said. Tickets purchased for the earlier dates will remain valid for the rescheduled fixtures.
Earlier, sources said some Sri Lankan players raised safety concerns and asked to return following Tuesday’s suicide blast in Islamabad’s G-11 sector.
Speaking to Dawn, Sri Lankan Team Manager Mahinda Halangode dismissed reports that some players were returning home. “None are returning,” he said when asked about speculation that a few members of the squad had requested to leave the tour.
The visiting players were directed by SLC to continue, as Pakistan has made foolproof security arrangements.
Earlier on Wednesday, Interior Minister and PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi met Sri Lankan High Commissioner Rear Admiral (retd) Fred Siriweera and stressed that the visitors are state guests and that comprehensive security measures are in place.
 






PCB COO Sumair Ahmed, Islamabad’s chief commissioner and police inspector general and team managers from both sides attended the briefing on arrangements. The high commissioner expressed condolences over the attack and expressed satisfaction with the security plan, the PCB said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the SLC said in a statement that several members of the national team had requested to return home, citing safety concerns.
“Following this development, SLC immediately engaged with the players and assured them that all such concerns are being duly addressed in close coordination with the Pakistan Cricket Board and the relevant authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of every member of the touring party,” it said.
“In this context, SLC has instructed all players, support staff and team management to continue with the tour as scheduled,” it added.
However, should any player or member of the touring party decide to return to Sri Lanka despite the directive issued by SLC to continue with the tour, Sri Lanka Cricket would immediately send replacements to ensure that the tour continues without interruption.
“If any player, players or member of the support staff return despite SLC’s directives, a formal review will be conducted to assess their actions, and an appropriate decision will be made upon the conclusion of the review,” SLC said.
The PCB subsequently also announced the revised schedule for the tri-nation tournament.
Tri-nation series schedule (all matches at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium):

November 18: Pakistan v Zimbabwe
November 20: Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe
November 22: Pakistan v Sri Lanka
November 23: Pakistan v Zimbabwe
November 25: Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe
November 27: Pakistan v Sri Lanka
November 29: Final

Vantara, a 3,500-acre zoo in Gujarat state run by the philanthropic arm of a conglomerate led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani and his family, has faced allegations of improper imports of certain animals, triggering higher scrutiny from authorities in Germany and the European Union, Reuters has reported.
Indian investigators tasked by the country’s Supreme Court to examine the allegations by non-profit and wildlife groups cleared the sanctuary of any wrongdoing in September, and Vantara has said it complies with all regulations.
However, after visiting the facility in September, the Secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) issued a report last week asking India to review its procedures.
The report cited discrepancies between exporter and importer trade data and flagged insufficient checks on the origin of some animals.

In a submission to CITES dated November 10, India said any restrictive or punitive measure at this stage would lack legal foundation and risk unsettling the CITES framework, calling the measure “premature and disproportionate”.
The wildlife body’s request “would constitute a de facto suspension or moratorium on lawful” imports, the government said.
The Indian submission, posted on the CITES website ahead of its convention meeting this month, is first being reported by Reuters. It signals new wrangling over Vantara’s imports.
Tighter scrutiny in place, India says
CITES is a global treaty that regulates trade in endangered plants and animals, or products derived from them, with the aim of ensuring their survival.

While CITES acknowledged last week that Vantara operates facilities of exceptionally high standards, it recommended that India halt new import permits for endangered species until safeguards are tightened.
The body warned that without stricter checks, animals sourced from the wild could be misrepresented as captive-bred.
India countered that it “has strengthened inspection and reporting mechanisms for all recognised zoos and rescue facilities”, including Vantara. The government also instructed the Central Zoo Authority to ensure enhanced due diligence for all future acquisitions.
CITES and Vantara did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Indian government’s submission on Wednesday.
Animals from the world over
Vantara says it is home to some 2,000 species.
That includes imported exotic species from South Africa, Venezuela, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, including snakes, tortoises, tigers, cheetahs, giraffes and chimpanzees.

The shipments were recorded with a declared value of $9 million, which Vantara has said reflected freight and insurance charges, not any payments for wildlife.
The CITES report last week noted that “a number of animals come from established commercial breeding facilities, which would normally sell the animals they breed”.
India has mounted a defence, saying in response that the Supreme Court panel’s findings showed imports were carried out in compliance with regulations.</p><small>2025-11-13 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/131105585f9e6cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954842/pta-commences-licencing-of-vpn-service-providers-under-cvas-regime' target='_blank'><strong>PTA commences licencing of VPN service providers under CVAS regime</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) on Thursday commenced the licencing of Virtual Private Network (VPN) service providers under the reinstated Class Value Added Services (CVAS-Data) regime.
In December last year, the PTA had devised a new strategy to register VPNs after its previous efforts to ensure compliance, such as warning to ban unregistered VPNs, failed to yield the desired results. It said it had resumed granting Class Licence for Data services to service providers in Pakistan.
In a press release issued today, the telecom regulator said licensing under the CVAS-Data regime “aims to streamline the provision of secure and lawful VPN services in Pakistan while ensuring compliance with national regulations and data security standards”.
The PTA said it has granted class licences to several companies, including Alpha 3 Cubic Pvt Ltd (Steer Lucid), Zettabyte Pvt Ltd (Crest VPN), Nexilium Tech SMC-Pvt Ltd (Kestrel VPN), UKI Conic Solutions SMC-Pvt Ltd (QuiXure VPN), and Vision Tech 360 Pvt Ltd (Kryptonyme VPN).
A class licence allows multiple users to operate under a general set of conditions without needing individual approval.
 






“These licensees are authorised to offer VPN services to individuals and organisations for legitimate and lawful purposes,” the telecom regulator said.
Users can now “conveniently obtain VPN services directly from these licenced providers without the need to approach PTA for separate VPN registration of their IP addresses or mobile numbers”.
“This measure is aimed at promoting regulatory facilitation, user convenience, and enhanced cybersecurity across Pakistan’s digital ecosystem,” the PTA said.
VPNs are widely used around the world to access content that may be inaccessible or blocked for internet users in their home country. In the case of Pakistanis, VPNs are used to access X, among other restricted websites.
The telecom regulator had initially decided to ban VPNs in November last year over the lack of legal grounds, but later withdrew the decision.
In February, the PTA issued licences to two companies for providing VPN services in an attempt to monitor traffic bypassing local censorship.
The licensed companies will only provide VPN services to commercial clients — IT comp­anies, banks, foreign missions, etc — making the use of VPN by individual users unlawful.</p><small>2025-11-13 06:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13104109d863aa0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954841/lotte-chemical-sells-75pc-stake-in-pakistani-subsidiary-for-69-million' target='_blank'><strong>Lotte Chemical sells 75pc stake in Pakistani subsidiary for $69 million</strong></a><br><p>South Korea’s Lotte Chemical said on Thursday it has sold about 75 per cent stake in its Pakistani subsidiary to Dubai-based PTA Global Holding for $68.94 million (98 billion won).
The South Korean company is trying to restructure its portfolio under a government-led programme aimed at aiding loss-making petrochemicals in the country due to poor demand and abundant supply.
Lotte Chemical Pakistan produces 500,000 tons of high-purity terephthalic acid (PTA), used in polyester fibers, industrial yarns, and PET bottles, annually at its plant in Karachi.
Adnan Afridi has been appointed the firm’s chief executive officer following the stake sale, Lotte Chemical Pakistan said in a statement late on Wednesday.
“The acquisition marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in the company’s journey — one defined by innovation, operational excellence, and strategic growth, positioning Lotte Chemical Pakistan as a key industrial growth agent for PET and PSF customers in Pakistan,” the statement said.
The statement also quoted Afridi as saying that the immediate focus was on “operational excellence and sustainable profitability”.
“We are optimising plant efficiency, improving reliability, and integrating advanced energy-saving technologies that will significantly reduce our production costs. This is not just about growth — it’s about setting a new standard of performance for the chemical sector in Pakistan,“ he said.
He said that improving operational efficiencies and energy-related initiatives would make the company more competitive and a key growth partner for Pakistan’s polyester and packaging industries.
Afridi said the company plans aggressive growth “through mergers and acquisitions to enable diversification and scale”.</p><small>2025-11-13 05:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/131017589c6ec5b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954772/can-peace-jirgas-help-stem-the-tide-of-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Can peace jirgas help stem the tide of terrorism?</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has seen a series of jirgas from both the government and opposition sides over the last few months to discuss the precarious law and order situation in the province. However, little has changed on the ground in the face of spiraling terrorism.
In contrast to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Peace Jirga, which was convened by the provincial government at the provincial assembly on Wednesday and attended by all political parties, the previous such gatherings were marred by the bad blood between the government and opposition, resulting in the boycott of each other’s events.
In December last year when the Kurram tribal district was in the throes of a violent conflict, provincial Governor Faisal Karim Kundi convened a jirga. The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) boycotted the moot, which took place at the Governor’s House on December 5, accusing the Pakistan Peoples Party of working with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led federal government to get it banned. It even got a resolution about it passed by the Balochistan Assembly.
The PTI insisted that unlike the PPP, it had a mandate from residents to rule KP and was performing its duties well.

Analysts insist such gatherings can build pressure but achieve nothing beyond that

Over the next months, as the law and order situation deteriorated, both the government and opposition again sprang into action and announced jirgas and multi-party conferences, yet both stopped short of showing a united front on the existential security issue.
In July this year, the then KP chief minister, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, convened a multi-party conference.
However, major political parties, including Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Awami National Party and PPP boycotted the gathering, calling it an eyewash.
The JUI-F arranged its own tribal jirga on July 13 to discuss peace in the region. It also held a similar event in Swat the same month.
Also, the Awami National Party organised the Qaumi Aman Jirga on July 28.
In August, the KP government started holding regional level jirgas to discuss peace in the merged tribal districts.
According to an official, at least four such jirgas with elders from Bajaur, Kurram and North and South Waziristan took place at the Chief Minister’s House.
In the aftermath of these gatherings, the official said that the then chief minister, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, had planned to hold a grand jirga of tribal elders with the army chief.
However, Mr Gandapur lost the mantle of the province’s chief executive before he could have realised that.
Mohammad Sohail Afridi, after taking over as the chief minister, decided to hold another peace jirga, which, unlike the previous ones, was at least a well-attended one as no party boycotted it.
Though little has changed on the ground due to these jirgas, analysts view them as a tool that can help build pressure and, to some extent, allows people to vent.
Veteran nationalist politician Afrasiab Khattak told Dawn that the jirgas were taking place due to the fact that the government system was not working and people were forced to discuss law and order outside of government forums.
He said that jirgas could help build pressure but could do nothing beyond that.
“The Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West turned into a hot war for this region. Now again, a similar tussle between the United States and China could also result in a hot war for this region,” he said.
Mr Khattak said the state was more focused on international agendas than the local situation.
He added that the PTI, which ruled KP, was more interested in getting its detained founder, Imran Khan, released and was least bothered about what was happening in the province.
The nationalist politician said that he attended a jirga at the Governor’s House last year and found out that even the PML-N leaders were not ready to support the federal government’s stand regarding military operation.
“How a strategy of [military operations] could succeed when it lacks public support,“ he said, adding that the people of KP have grown tired of such operations and are not ready to support them.
Mr Khattak underscored the importance of engagement between KP and federal governments on security issues and dissension among both sides would result in further increasing terrorism.
Dr Faizullah Jan, a journalism professor at the University of Peshawar, noted that the provincial government was shifting its responsibilities to jirgas.
“Upon seeing its rhetoric go nowhere, the PTI is now trying to shift responsibilities. In the presence of parliament, there is no justification for holding jirgas as they lack any constitutional or legal authority,” he said.
Dr Jan questioned what mechanism a jirga had at its disposal to implement its decisions.
“Jirga has neither police nor army to implement its decisions,” he said.
The academic, however, said that the jirgas provided an outlet to alternate views or played a cathartic role by allowing people to vent their frustrations.

The Republican-controlled chamber passed the package by a vote of 222-209, with Trump’s support largely keeping his party together in the face of vehement opposition from House Democrats, who are angry that a long standoff launched by their Senate colleagues failed to secure a deal to extend federal health insurance subsidies.
Trump’s signature on the bill, which cleared the Senate earlier in the week, will bring federal workers idled by the 43-day shutdown back to their jobs starting as early as Thursday, although just how quickly full government services and operations will resume is unclear.

It would extend funding through January 30, leaving the federal government on a path to keep adding about $1.8 trillion a year to its $38tr in debt.
“I feel like I just lived a Seinfeld episode. We just spent 40 days and I still don’t know what the plotline was,” said Republican Representative David Schweikert of Arizona, likening Congress’ handling of the shutdown to the misadventures in a popular 1990s US sitcom.
“I really thought this would be like 48 hours: people will have their piece, they’ll get a moment to have a temper tantrum, and we’ll get back to work.”
He added: “What’s happened now when rage is policy?”
No promises on healthcare
The vote came eight days after Democrats won several high-profile elections that many in the party thought strengthened their odds of winning an extension of health insurance subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of the year.
While the deal sets up a December vote on those subsidies in the Senate, Speaker Mike Johnson has made no such promise in the House. Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill, who last week was elected as New Jersey’s next governor, spoke against the funding bill in her last speech on the US House floor before she resigns from Congress next week, encouraging her colleagues to stand up to Trump’s administration.
“To my colleagues: Do not let this body become a ceremonial red stamp from an administration that takes food away from children and rips away healthcare,” Sherrill said.
“To the country: Stand strong. As we say in the Navy, don’t give up the ship.”
No clear winner from shutdown
Despite the recriminations, neither party appears to have won a clear victory. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found that 50 per cent of Americans blamed Republicans for the shutdown, while 47pc blamed Democrats.
The vote came on the Republican-controlled House’s first day in session since mid-September, a long recess intended to put pressure on Democrats.
The chamber’s return also set the clock ticking on a vote to release all unclassified records related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, something Johnson and Trump have resisted up to now.
Johnson on Wednesday swore in Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won a September special election to fill the Arizona seat of her late father, Raul Grijalva. She provided the final signature needed for a petition to force a House vote on the issue, hours after House Democrats released a new batch of Epstein documents.
That means that, after performing its constitutionally mandated duty of keeping the government funded, the House could once again be consumed by a probe into Trump’s former friend whose life and 2019 death in prison have spawned countless conspiracy theories.
The funding package would allow eight Republican senators to seek hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages for alleged privacy violations stemming from the federal investigation of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by Trump’s supporters.
It retroactively makes it illegal in most cases to obtain a senator’s phone data without disclosure and allows those whose records were obtained to sue the Justice Department for $500,000 in damages, along with attorneys’ fees and other costs.</p><small>2025-11-13 05:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/691540e12e186.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954784/living-with-dysfunction' target='_blank'><strong>Living with dysfunction</strong></a><br><p>BY now, it should be abundantly clear that the authorities in Pakistan are not going to do anything to address the core dysfunctions that have dragged its economy down over the decades. They would prefer to learn to live with these dysfunctions. And one of the ways to do this is to increase the coercive powers of the state.
For decades, an agenda for change and reform has been advanced to help Pakistan’s state and economy adapt to a changing world. The agenda involved broadening the base of taxation and of exports, unlocking the productivity potential of the economy, strengthening the regulatory environment, documenting the economy and its transactions, reducing the role of speculation and manipulation in the stock market, improving judicial outcomes and access to justice as well as the legal framework for business, and so on. It was the long, hard road of reform that was supposed to safeguard the next generation of livelihoods and secure the prosperity of the common citizenry in a changing world.
Some of this was done in fits and starts. For example, the private power policy was supposed to be a stop-gap arrangement to help bring in power generation capacity quickly in the middle of a power crisis in the early 1990s. It was meant to be followed up with a series of other reforms that would unbundle the vast power bureaucracy, and slowly bring in market forces to determine the price of electricity, as well as the returns that private investors in power generation would enjoy. The state was meant to withdraw from its overarching role as the sole arbiter of prices, returns, capacity, demand and everything else in the power sector.
 
 

But all that happened was the induction of private power producers, enjoying lavish returns secured by sovereign guarantee. And there it stopped. Net result was that the power sector was burdened with the costs of private power producers and the inefficiency of government. And we have not moved beyond since then, despite more than three decades having passed since the private power policy was introduced. The result is we are left with a power sector that is better at producing circular debt than it is at producing and distributing electricity.

The same labour and capital inputs today will generate lesser output, produce fewer jobs and lift fewer people out of poverty.

The same failures have hit all other areas — from taxation to savings and investment. The result is, we are left with a state and an economy that is better at producing debt, both domestic and external, than it is at producing jobs or goods and services. We have research that tells us that, over the decades, Pakistan’s economy has been losing productivity, meaning it is producing less and less incremental output per input of labour. Now the World Bank is telling us that for each incremental quantum of output the economy generates, it produces fewer jobs and lifts fewer people out of poverty over the longer term.
This means the economy has been sliding down what economists call diminishing returns, a situation where every successive input gives you less and less output in return. The same labour and capital inputs today will generate lesser output, produce fewer jobs and lift fewer people out of poverty than it would have a decade or two ago. And this trend is set to continue into the future barring any major course correction.
And that course correction is not going to come.
 
 

So where does that leave us? It brings us to a situation where the state is learning to live with its dysfunctions rather than working to resolve them. It is preparing to face the future and the challenges it will bring with all its might, but without adapting itself to the requirements of a changing world. By now, it is not even possible to build a case for why a country like Pakistan should undertake a disruptive course correction in the name of improving its ability to participate in a global market, because this very global market is being torn down, chopped up and walled off by the very people who built it: the advanced industrial democracies of the West.
What are these future challenges? First is the geopolitical drift in the region after the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan. Second is the need to secure livelihoods and provide jobs to a growing army of youth in Pakistan. Stop here for a moment and consider the impact.
The first challenge produces a massive requirement for resources to pay for the arms that will inevitably be required to meet the rising arc of terror from Afghanistan in the west and growing belligerence from India in the east. The second challenge also produces a massive requirement for resources, since the only way to produce jobs and livelihoods that we are left with following decades of growth without reform, is through fiscal and monetary inducements.
The first challenge will trump all else, because in Pakistan there is no debate between guns and butter. The guns always win. That means the future will be domestically turbulent, unless an external patron is willing to underwrite the massive creation of livelihoods for another generation of Pakistanis (which may well happen, but is not yet a given).
It is to face this future that the state is centralising itself, retreating into its fortress, marshalling all its powers under the same head, growing its claim on the resources that are otherwise shared and, importantly, ramping up immunity for its leadership from any consequences for their actions. In the mix of repression and consent through which all states procure their legitimacy, the role of repression is about to increase. For decades an effort was made to try and persuade successive governments in Pakistan of the necessity to reform. Now we can lay that effort to rest. The rulers have decided to live with the country’s dysfunctions, that are primarily economic but also legal and political. They will navigate their future accordingly.

As consumers, we go to a store, look for a product, find competing products, and make a quick subjective judgement about the quality, and buy the one our budget allows. While the price of a product always matters in our decision, the quality too figures if competing goods are available. Sometimes we do not buy a high-quality product because it is too expensive, and are content with low-quality but affordable substitutes. What if a better-quality product is available at the same price as that of a low-quality good? We simply ditch the low-quality product. Frequently, we compare the quality of a product to that of competing domestic and imported goods. In this way, we compare the quality of goods which foreign countries have exported to our domestic market.
Meanwhile, we need to be abroad and buy (or review) something made in our country to assess its quality. It is always thrilling to find something ‘made in Pakistan’ in big stores abroad. I was thrilled to find Himalayan salt, in Northfield, Minnesota, in a Target outlet, over 11,000 kilometres away from Pakistan’s Khewra salt mines. Target is a big store chain in the US known for selling quality products at reasonable prices. The pink Himalayan salt was neatly packaged in a disposable but good quality small bottle with a built-in grinder for seasoning. The bottle clearly displayed “product of Pakistan” but qualified it immediately with “packaged in France”.
Our Himalayan salt is recognised all over the world as the best kind. However, our salt-packaging abilities, ie, value addition, even after 78 years of independence, appear primitive. The small bottle contained only a few grams of pink salt granules, not worth a lot. But its packaging, with a little grinding attachment that smoothly crushed the salt to allow it to be sprinkled evenly over food is what mattered most with regard to the quality of this product. This small salt bottle, bought in a country far from the Khewra mines, contained our sad 78-year story of manufacturing and export: our manufacturing, despite making progress, had failed to add sufficient value and quality to our natural bounties, crops and (crudely) manufactured products.
According to a report on the website of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan, “The miners in Khewra still use the same old traditional way — drilling/ blasting followed by excavation by hand. Perhaps this is the reason that despite having the second largest salt mines of the world and having salt [reserves] of 10 billion tons (6.68bn tons alone hidden in the jagged rocks of Salt Range in Khewra), Pakistan is still listed as 17th in salt production in the world. It contributes hardly one per cent [to] the total global salt production”.
 
 

I was able to find few other products from our country in Northfield and areas around the twin cities of Minneapolis-St Paul. In Dollar General (a store chain), I only found a pack of grey towels used for washing cars. There was hardly anything remarkable about this product, except that it had made its way to the Midwest, showing that Pakistan is still competitive in its export supply to the US in this category. I could not find bath towels made in Pakistan at stores like Macy’s, JC Penny, Target, Home Goods or Marshalls, let alone high-end stores like Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, or Bloomingdales. All these had many varieties of garments from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Vietnam and other countries. There was one exception: I found jeans from our country at Macy’s, which is known for selling quality products. The jeans from other countries, however, seemed better but were more expensive, ie, higher value addition.

The fault lies in our economic policies, which have been destroying our export competitiveness.

While these examples can easily be dismissed on grounds of not being based on a scientific survey, they nevertheless contain some seeds of truth. I was a visitor to the US for a few months, but the Pakistani diaspora residing there for many years would have a better idea about our quality of exports. Here’s what an analytical report (Knowledge Brief, March 2023) by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics says: “Pakistan’s low export values are due to low-quality products and lack of innovation in exported products which leads to the lack of value addition”.
While winter jackets may be too sophisticated for our garment manufacturers to produce and export, it is difficult to understand why simple shirts and trousers do not find their way to stores abroad. Surely, this is not due to the lack of access for our products abroad. The fault lies in our economic policies, which have been destroying our manufacturing and export competitiveness for the last few decades, as highlighted by the PIDE brief.
As opposed to our abundant pink Himalayan salt — hardly meant to be presented on a platter — rare earth minerals were recently offered (going by a widely circulated photograph) in a wooden tray, and looking like exotic gourmet bakery products, to American President Donald Trump, who fixed his gaze on this rarity while listening attentively to our field marshal. The first batch of these expensive minerals was also exported recently to the US as a precursor to a joint venture for exploration and the mining of rare earth elements. Is this a harbinger of good tidings on the export and economic front?
Or does the modest, though abundant, salt, which contains the story of our exports, point to a future with hardships it has already witnessed? The mining and export of critical elements carry potential for development. The path to development through extraction and export of minerals, however, is no less complex than other paths, and it is certainly not a royal road to prosperity. Our economic authorities, currently fixated on keeping the rupee overvalued, will have to tackle the additional intensity of the Dutch disease caused by export earnings from minerals in future. If not managed wisely, our manufactured exports may risk declining further in quality. If rare earth minerals and gold and diamonds were the quick way to economic prosperity, a few countries in Africa would have been dominating the world by now.

The ministry while receiving complaints regarding delays in in­­­ter-provincial movement of whe­­at seed and wheat flour, held two review meetings with provincial agricultural departments, price control and commodity ma­­nage­ment department of Punjab and the national seeds development and regulatory authority, and it was agreed that all provinces wou­­ld follow and enforce SOPs for inter-provincial seed movement using verified convoy notes.
To streamline monitoring, the ministry has issued directives for immediate deployment of representatives from the Federal Seed Organisation (FSO), the Federal Seed Certification and Registra­tion Department (FSC&RD), and relevant provincial departments at key exit and entry points to oversee verification and on-site issue resolution.

Punjab govt told to expedite seed dispatches to Balochistan, Sindh to meet critical sowing timelines

The Punjab government was specifically instructed to expedite seed dispatches to Balochistan and Sindh to meet critical sowing timelines and avoid production losses.
From Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reports indicated a major bottleneck at Ramak check post, where around 100 seed trucks enroute from Punjab were stranded. Similar delays were also observed at other checkpoints along the inter-provincial borders, affecting timely delivery of certified wheat seed to farmers.
The Punjab government was specifically asked to coordinate for immediate clearance of over 100 stranded seed trucks at Ramak and adjacent checkpoints.
Taking immediate measures, the ministry directed KP food and agriculture departments to coordinate directly with their counterparts in Punjab to ensure instant clearance of all seed consignments upon verification of convoy notes. The Punjab government agreed to facilitate and exp­edite seed dispatches to meet Ba­­lochistan’s sowing requirements within the stipulated timeline.
Additionally, joint inspections to check hoarding and fake seed by FSC&RD and provincial teams continued, while flour movement nationwide was to be facilitated to ensure smooth supply and prevent artificial inflation of wheat and flour prices, the ministry statement said.
The Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department and National Seed Authority (NSA) cautioned that some fake seed consignments were being transported under the guise of wheat seed and flour shipments. The ministry took serious notice of this and instructed strict screening of all consignments to prevent counterfeit seed circulation.
It was decided to deploy focal persons at all key check posts to resolve verification issues on the spot. To facilitate uninterrupted transport, all trucks with valid documentation were to be cleared within 1 to 2 hours, while the consignments without the convoy notes to be returned to their origin for correction.
Each province was directed to submit daily data on wheat seed and flour movement to the federal ministry for centralised monitoring, while the ministry committed to issuing weekly progress reports and holding coordination meetings every week to track implementation.
Officials from Punjab, Baloch­istan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa acknowledged that despite significant progress, delays were still occurring at several inter-provincial check posts. These bottlenecks were primarily related to verification processes and incomplete documentation of seed consignments.
In Sindh, the seed requirement was estimated at 3.7 million metric tons, but only 19,800 metric tons had been moved by October 29. This disparity between demand and actual seed inflow was noted with concern, and Sindh authorities were asked to work closely with the seed providers and federal government agencies to close the gap.
The secretary of agriculture, Balochistan, reported a shortfall in certified seed supply against the province’s target of 500,000 hectares, requiring 50,000 bags per day. As of October 29, only 12,000 to13,000 bags were being received daily. This slow inflow risked delaying the sowing schedule in several districts and was flagged as a priority concern.

The petitioner, Hassan Latif, contended through his counsel that changes were being introduced through the 27th Amendment that contradicted the preamble of the Constitution and attempted to curtail the powers of the Supreme Court.
He argued that by reducing judicial authority, the amendment endangered judicial independence and undermined the constitutional framework, as it was being passed without consultation with the provinces.
He said the amendment sought to restructure the apex judiciary of Pakistan by creating a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
He added that the Supreme Court’s original, appellate, and advisory jurisdictions were being transferring to the FCC.
He further contended that the proposed amendment had been passed by the Senate, tabled in the National Assembly and was yet to be assented by the president.
Therefore, the petitioner asked the court to annul the 27th Amendment and declare the transfer of constitutional cases to another court as void.
On Tuesday, former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Jawwad S. Khawaja challenged the 27th Amendment, seeking a directive that the SC retain exclusive jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness and constitutionality of the amendment.
Filed through Advocate Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, the petitioner urged the apex court to strike down or suspend any provisions in any Act of Parliament, including the 27th Amendment, that reduce or abolish the constitutional jurisdiction of the SC, or that purport to vest such jurisdiction in any other court or body.
The petition also asked the apex court to set aside the provisions of the 27th Amendment related to the transfer of high court judges and requested that the matter be treated as one of “urgency” until a final decision on the plea was reached.
The former CJP explained that he had filed the petition to save the SC that he claimed was on the verge of being abolished as a constitutional court.
He argued that he had “no personal interest” in this case, adding the relief sought was for the benefit of all citizens of Pakistan.

“Pakistan supports the Arab position that the resolution must reaffirm the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination, prevent further annexation, and ensure that Gaza and the West Bank remain a single entity within an independent Palestinian state,” a diplomatic source said.
Pakistan’s move came after China and Russia, both permanent veto-wielding members of the 15-member Council, broke the “silence period”, a procedural pause for reviewing the revised US draft.
They questioned the absence of a clear mandate for the proposed two-year International Stabilisation Force (ISF) and demanded that it operate under direct UN Security Council oversight. They also sought more details about the proposed Board of Peace (BOP).

Insists any such resolution must affirm ‘political horizon’ for Palestinian self-determination, statehood

“They want the Security Council to supervise the ISF and set its limits,” a UN official familiar with the discussions said. “China and Russia’s message was that no peacekeeping or stabilisation force should function outside the UN framework.”
 
 

The first draft of the US resolution, known as Revision 1, incorporates the full “20-point” Trump peace plan and envisions a Board of Peace (BOP), which President Donald Trump is expected to head, to oversee reconstruction and disarmament.
However, the proposal faces widespread resistance. The United Arab Emirates has cited unresolved legal concerns, Jordan has declined to send troops, and Azerbaijan has linked its involvement to a verified ceasefire. At Israel’s insistence, Turkey has been excluded.
Even among nations open to participating, such as Indonesia and Pakistan, there is unease. One diplomat said these states “do not want to be seen as a joint B-team of the Israeli military focused solely on disarming Hamas”.
Israel has also expressed frustration, saying its role has been reduced to logistics and aid coordination rather than full involvement in planning the force.
The World Bank, however, has endorsed the US draft. In a letter to Washington, Bank President Ajay Banga confirmed support for the BOP’s two-year mandate and a readiness to manage reconstruction funds for Gaza, with rebuilding costs estimated at about $70 billion.
Concerns also persist within Washington. Documents obtained by Politico from a US-sponsored symposium in southern Israel last month showed that officials and experts raised doubts about the feasibility of deploying the force, citing challenges in securing troop commitments and ensuring regional buy-in.
A US defence official told Politico the materials “reflect the administration’s close-held concerns” about the plan’s viability.
But State Department spokesperson Eddie Vasquez dismissed the worries, saying, “Everyone wants to be part of President Trump’s historic Middle East peace effort.”
Diplomats in New York said Washin­gton will now prepare a second revised draft before tabling the resolution for a vote, which is likely to happen next week.
“The US remains determined,” one diplomat noted. “But the divisions in the Council — and the deeper political questions — mean this will take longer than Washington expected.”
All the countries participating in this debate shared their positions while offering written comments on the US draft.

Relations between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban are at their lowest point in the four years since the group came to power.
Border crossings bet­ween the two countries have remained closed since October 11 and trade has been at a standstill following ground fighting and Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600-kilometre frontier that killed dozens on both sides in the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.
“For us [it will have no impact], instead, I think it will be a relief for us because the amount of goods that are booked for Karachi Port from Afghanistan, ultimately, all end up in Pakistani markets,” said Asif while speaking on Geo News.
The defence minister added that the goods imported from across the border had no consumption in Afghanistan and ended up disrupting Pakistan’s local markets. The minister also added, “When their trade traffic reduces here, then terrorism that penetrates Pakistan in the guise of trade and other forms will also reduce, and border management will improve for us.
“I think this is a blessing in disguise for us that they’re seeking alternate routes and Pakistan will only benefit from this, not lose out in any way.”
‘Find alternate routes’
Earlier today, Afghanistan’s Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, asked Afghan traders to find alternative routes instead of Pakistan while speaking at a gathering of merchants, industrialists, and officials from the Ministry of Finance in Kabul.
“The Pakistani route has not only harmed our traders but has also caused difficulties for the markets and the people,” the Taliban deputy prime minister claimed.
“I urge all traders to quickly complete the search for alternative routes for exports and imports so that Afghanistan’s exports and imports are not affected,” Mullah Baradar said.
He cited the closure of borders by Pakistan as the reason for the decision and sought guarantees that borders would not be shut in the future. The Taliban official said roads would remain closed until Pakistan provided “credible guarantees”.
“If Pakistan wants the routes to be opened, it will do so with firm and credible guarantees that they will not be closed again under any circumstances or conditions,” he said.
“Even before this, when it was time for Pakistani goods to be produced, the routes were open, but when it was the season for our fresh fruits, Pakistan used to close the routes under various pretexts, even causing the fruits to spoil,” Baradar claimed.
“We are telling you clearly that if traders export or import goods from Pakistan after this, the Islamic Emirate will not be responsible for their problems and their voices will not be heard.”
Mullah Baradar added that those who import medicines from Pakistan should start importing from other countries as soon as possible.
“If someone has made purchases and contracts in Pakistan, they are given three months to clear all their accounts there and close them,” he said.
He also asked the country’s finance ministry not to allow anyone to import medicines from Pakistan.
The Taliban official added that Pakistan had closed trade routes many times and they were still closed. “It has gained political interests through trade and humanitarian issues and has harmed traders and industrialists of both countries. We have taken these decisions based on these reasons.“
The Taliban government decided to restrict trade with Pakistan after the third round of talks in Turkiye ended inconclusively. Officials from both countries have blamed each other for the “failure” of the talks, and the possibility of a resumption remains unclear.
What do Pakistani traders say?
Engineer Manzoor Elahi, former senior vice president of the Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Pakistan would suffer more if Afghanistan stopped trade with the country as Iran and India provided Afghanistan with cheaper medicines.
“Uzbekistan and Russia export them (Afghanistan) sugar. They do not need us, but we need them. Our industries would be affected,” Elahi told Dawn.
“Iran and Turkey have captured our market in Afghanistan. They now import items from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Russia and Ukraine. They do not need us, but we need the Afghan market,” he said.
He added that Pakistan would not only lose the Afghan market but would also lose the Central Asian market.
“We export several items to Central Asia, and currently, between 500 and 1,000 containers of kinnows go to Afghanistan and Central Asian states daily. Fruit, bananas, and fresh fruit will be badly affected. Around $100-200 million worth of daily markets will be affected in Central Asia,” the business leader said.
Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, vice-president of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI), said around 8,000 trucks have been stranded on both sides since border crossings were closed last month.
Sarhadi told Dawn that traders do not object to Pakistan’s security concerns but appeal to the government to allow stranded trucks to cross the border on humanitarian grounds.
Head of the Afghan chapter of the PAJCCI, Khan Jan Alokozai, said Afghan traders still want to do business via Pakistan as it is the shortest route.
However, he told Dawn that Mullah Baradar’s concerns about the border closure were genuine and should be addressed.
“Pakistan is important for Afghanistan and Afghanistan is important for Pakistan, but if borders are closed, then we would be forced to find alternate routes,” Alokozai said.
He said Pakistan would lose the Central Asian market if the current situation remains the same, adding that Pakistan exports 300,000-500,000 tonnes of potatoes to Central Asia via Afghanistan during the season.
The month-long closure of the Torkham border crossing has caused a cumulative loss of over $45m and another Rs16.5 billion in terms of exports and imports, respectively, through Pakistan’s trade with Afghanistan.
Sources among official and trading circles had told Dawn that Pakistan had already lost over 65 per cent of the Afghan market to Iran, some Central Asian States, Turkiye and even India due to hostile and aggressive trade policies dictated by security issues since the installation of the Taliban regime in Kabul in August 2021.
They said that while major Pakistan and Afghan exporters had lifted their capital from the export-import business between the two neighbouring countries due to the repeated border closure and a hostile environment for traders and investors, the month-long closure of all border points had seriously dented the confidence of the remaining “bunch” of small traders.
The sources said that while the uncertain situation had also dealt a severe blow to the burgeoning local manufacturing industry in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the border closure had seriously impacted the manufacture of hundreds of daily items in Punjab and Sindh, which were exported to Afghanistan under the head of miscellaneous items daily before the closure of the border.
They said that Afghanistan was currently importing cement, garments, shoes and slippers, a variety of edibles, including different vegetables, fresh fruits, fish, chicken and other poultry items, animal feed and confectionery items.
The sources said that the prolonged border closure had negatively impacted the potato and banana exports, while the kinnow export was also in doldrums if immediate steps were not taken to ease border tensions.</p><small>2025-11-13 03:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/130754059dca912.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954796/pakistan-may-get-12bn-from-imf-on-dec-9' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan may get $1.2bn from IMF on Dec 9</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has scheduled a meeting of its executive board on Dec 8 to approve immediate disbursement of $1.2 billion to Pakistan under two concurrent programmes.
Pakistan and the IMF reached a Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) on the second review of the $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the first review of the $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Fund (RSF) on Oct 14. Under the SLA, Pakistan will receive $1bn in disbursements under the EFF and $200m under the RSF. The $1.2bn disbursement is expected to land in Pakistan’s account on Dec 9, bringing total disbursements under the two arrangements to about $3.3bn.
The executive board would hold two separate meetings on Dec 8 to approve SLAs with Pakistan and Som­­alia, according to the IMF’s executive board calendar.
Before the board meeting, Pakistan is expected to publish much-delayed Governance & Corruption Diagnostic (GCD) Assessment Report prepared by a technical mission of the IMF, which is one of the key structural benchmarks (SB) under the EFF.

Islamabad to publish governance and corruption report before executive board meets next month

The benchmark deadline was end-July, which was later reset to end-August, and then again to end-October, but remains unmet so far, owing mainly to technical and factual disagreements between the Pakistan authorities and the IMF’s expert team. Having addressed those points, Pakistan had assured the fund that it would publish the report before the board meeting, an official said, adding that it was a very comprehensive exercise conducted by the technical and legal teams of the IMF in consultation with other global organisations like the OECD and FATF.
 
 

The official said there had been a series of back-and-forth exchanges of draft papers and discussions with various Pakistani authorities, including the anti-corruption watchdogs, the superior judiciary, and investigation agencies, as well as the ministries of finance and law, to ensure the “best outcome” of the international expertise, which covers more than 100 rules.
The two sides are believed to have discussed reducing the time lag between the publication of the GCD Assessment Report and the resultant governance action plan based on its recommendations for reform measures to address critical governance vulnerabilities.
An IMF scoping mission had visited Pakistan early this year and had meetings at the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Law and Justice Division, Auditor General of Pakistan, parliamentarians, national accountability bureau, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the State Bank of Pakistan and produced a comprehensive report identifying gaps and weaknesses in public finance management, tax system, and AGPR’s efforts to identify loopholes.
Under the existing governance mechanism, the majority of government officers have not been disclosing the assets of themselves and their family members to the tax authorities or the Establishment Division, and there was an insufficient institutional mechanism for accountability. On top of that, many institutions, including regulatory bodies, enjoyed exemptions from such scrutiny and disclosure requirements. No wonder there have been widespread reports of corruption across the bureaucratic and political landscape, and Pakistan has ranked high on various international corruption perception indexes.
The IMF has been pressing for data-based red flags, due diligence, safeguard mechanisms, and guidelines against corruption and misuse of public offices, which have resulted in sub-optimal decision-making and compromised the country’s business and growth potential. The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) had also identified a series of weaknesses and made recommendations to address them.
The fund had acknowledged Pakistan’s performance on financial and macroeconomic sectors under the EFF, entrenching macroeconomic stability and rebuilding market confidence. “The recovery remains on track, with the FY25 current account recording a surplus — the first in 14 years, the fiscal primary balance surpassing the programme target, inflation remaining contained, external buffers strengthening, and financial conditions improving as sovereign spreads have narrowed significantly”, the IMF had announced on reaching SLA.
It had, however, highlighted that flood-related losses that affected nearly 7 million people, caused over 1,000 deaths, and severely damaged housing, public infrastructure, and agricultural land weighed on the outlook, particularly of the agriculture sector, bringing down the projected FY26 GDP to about 3.25-3.5pc. “The floods underscore Pakistan’s high vulnerability to natural disasters and substantial climate-related risks, and the continuing need to build climate resilience”, it said, adding the authorities’ commitments under EFF and RSF were strong to maintain sound and prudent macroeconomic policies while advancing ongoing structural reforms.

• Reminds Afghan Taliban of responsibility to stop act of terrorism from soil of Afghanistan
• Dar affirms Pakistan’s commitment to dialogue
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday accused Afghanistan and India of involvement in recent terrorism, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies following a suicide blast in the capital and an attempted attack that he said was reminiscent of the 2014 APS massacre.
“It is no more a secret that an external hand is visible [in attacks in Pakistan]”, PM Shehbaz said during his address to the National Assembly following the passage of the controversial 27th Cons­ti­tutional Amendment.
He also condemned what he called a “dastardly” attempt by terrorists to carry out an incident in Wana, South Waziristan.
“It could have been a worst attack than APS [Army Public School carnage], if it would have not been averted by the armed forces,” PM said, revealing that one of the terrorists killed by security forces in the operation has been identified as an Afghan national.
“These khawarij, in which unfortunately Afghans were also involved, were all sent to hell and all cadets, students and teachers were safely rescued,” the prime minister said.
Referring to a previous statement where he blamed the “Fitna al-Khawarij” and said “footprints of Afgha­nistan are also seen” alongside Indian involvement, the prime minister pointed out that though India denied the claims, the evidence suggests otherwise.
“I don’t need to say a lot. The terrorists who abducted a train in Balochistan, the Jaffer Express, we brought its evidence before the whole world how TTP and BLA were active from Afghanistan and were in contact with terrorists there and also with their supporters in India,” he stated.
 
 

“We presented these facts before the whole world and no one challenged or rebutted them,” he added.
PM Shehbaz said the notion that Pakistan’s enemies were not involved in the attacks was “akin to calling day as night and vice versa.” He issued a stern warning directly to those responsible.
“I want to say something with great satisfaction and force to these terrorist elements and enemies of Pakistan that we are fully aware of your actions and we have given you a befitting response before and will do so again as well,” he said.
The prime minister also detailed Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts with Afghanistan’s Taliban government, particularly regarding negotiations held in Turkiye.
He said Pakistan has had only one demand for the past two years that the Afghan Taliban rein in terrorist outfits operating from their soil and waging attacks in Pakistan.
While renewing an offer for dialogue, PM Shehbaz urged the Afghan Taliban regime to stop making “false promises” and to decisively tackle the militant groups. He pointedly referenced the timing of a recent cross-border attack with the diplomatic activities of the Taliban government.
“When Pakistan was recently attacked from Afghan side, Afghan’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi was in Delhi,” he said. “We gave shelter to Afghan refugees for 40 years and did not treat them as strangers. But today after 40 years of our hospitality, they [Afghan] gave us this reward.”
In a wide-ranging address, the premier also touched on other matters, including military’s performance in the May conflict against India and subsequent diplomatic outreach, which he said had rendered India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi “helpless”.
He credited this performance for raising the country’s reputation and prestige in the international community, linking it to the national support for giving the rank of field marshal to the army chief.
Later, talking to reporters in a corridor of the parliament house, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif confirmed the identity of the bomber in Tuesday’s attack. “We have recognised the suicide bomber. He was Afghani,” he said, adding that the incident claimed 12 lives and left several others in critical condition.
Terrorism has no  religion, race: Dar
At a separate event in Islamabad, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar echoed the government’s strong stance against terrorism, stating that it “recognises no religion, race, or boundary”.
Speaking at the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference (ISC), Mr Dar condemned the recent attacks in Wana and Islamabad, which he said claimed 15 lives, and expressed heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. He emphasised that such acts cannot weaken the country’s resolve and instead “reinforce the nation’s commitment to dialogue, understanding, and partnership as the only sustainable paths to peace and security”.
Mr Dar said Pakistan’s foreign policy is firmly guided by the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereign equality, peaceful settlement of disputes, non-interference, and friendly relations among nations.
Highlighting the global context, Mr Dar noted that the world is experiencing profound transformations, with geopolitical rivalries, economic disparities, climate crises and growing inequalities challenging global peace.
“Diplomacy, whether in the chamber or the chancery, must always serve the people,” Mr Dar said. “People-centred diplomacy ensures that the dividends of peace reach citizens, that development is inclusive, and that international cooperation translates into tangible human progress.”
The foreign minister emphasised that parliamentary diplomacy complements traditional diplomatic efforts by bringing the perspectives of elected representatives into international discourse. “Parliamentarians, who are closest to the people, play a critical role in fostering dialogue, sharing experiences, and promoting governance, human rights, and democracy,” he said.
The foreign minister concluded by praising the leadership of Senate chairman and ISC founding chairman, Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani.
He noted that under Gilani’s guidance, the Senate consistently advocates for multilateralism and parliamentary diplomacy, serving as a platform to advance global peace, security, and prosperity.

In a 73-page judgement, the judge asserted that a “judicial nod cannot be ruled out” for appointments to judicial bodies within the Islamabad Capital Territory. 
The federal government, he emphasized, cannot use its administrative powers to appoint officials to judicial posts “without effective and meaningful consultation with the Islamabad High Court”. 
The ruling came in response to a petition by lawyer Ammar Sehri, who asked the court to enforce a 2010 law ensuring all courts and tribunals in the capital operate under the high court’s supervision, as mandated by the Constitution. 
Invoking legal theory and history, Justice Sattar warned against unchecked executive power and the rise of “autocratic legalism,” a system where legal frameworks are manipulated to consolidate power behind a veneer of legality. 
“The preservation of legal form without substantive legality transforms law into an instrument of arbitrary authority,” he wrote. “The erosion of judicial independence does not always occur through open defiance of law but through its selective invocation.” 
The judge observed that despite a constitutional mandate to separate the judiciary from the executive branch, “the executive continues to undermine judicial independence by retaining control over appointments and administration of special courts and tribunals”. 
The judgement cited the government’s practice of appointing judges to fiscal and special tribunals, such as the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and the Customs Appellate Tribunal, without proper judicial consultation.  
Justice Sattar ruled that such mechanisms, which allow bureaucrats to exercise judicial powers, violate the constitutional separation of powers. 
“Appointments to courts and tribunals discharging judicial functions cannot be left to the executive’s discretion,” he ruled. “The Islamabad High Court must have a decisive and supervisory role in the process.” 
Justice Sattar added that tribunals performing judicial work “must be manned, supervised, and controlled by the judiciary alone”. 
Addressing Islamabad High Court Act’s Section 6, the judge noted that all local tribunals fall under the IHC’s supervision.  
He lamented that more than a decade after the law passed, many local courts are still staffed by judges borrowed from provincial judiciaries, a practice he said undermines the independence of Islamabad’s own judiciary. 
The court rejected the government’s argument that appointments to some tribunals were purely administrative matters, holding that they were “judicial offices” requiring adherence to constitutional principles.  
Justice Sattar ruled that even when a law grants appointment power to the prime minister or the federal government, it must be exercised only after “effective, meaningful and purposive consultation” with the high court’s chief justice. 
Bypassing this consultation risks “transforming the rule of law into an instrument of executive dominance,” Sattar wrote. 
“No democracy can survive if the power to appoint, remove, or discipline judges is wielded by the very executive they are meant to hold accountable,” he said. 
The judgement concluded with a stark warning. 
“Autocratic legalism thrives when legality is stripped of its moral core,” Justice Sattar wrote. “The judiciary’s role is not to defend the government’s convenience but to defend the Constitution’s conscience.”

Twelve people were killed and 36 were injured in a suicide blast on Tuesday outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area. The incident occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the first one-day international (ODI) match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Rawalpindi. A clearance operation was also carried out in Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan against terrorists hiding inside the educational institute.
Statements from the leadership had linked the attacks to Afghanistan and India.
Elaborating on the matter in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Chaudhry said: “The suicide attacker in the Islamabad blast was not a Pakistani. I am confirming this to you. He did not know Pakistan’s language nor did he know of the country’s currency.”
He said he was revealing the information as per the initial investigation, but could not say more so as not to impact it. “We have all the evidence regarding these two events, based on which we have named Afghanistan and India,” Chaudhry added.
The state minister said the assailant had rented vehicles to enter Islamabad, adding that, according to what was found from people who had dealt with him, he did not know the local currency or language.
“I am confirming that the suicide bomber was not a Pakistani,” he reiterated.
A day ago, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after the incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
When asked during an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ if Pakistan would respond after the attacks, Asif had said: “God willing”, adding that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan “could not be ruled out” and could definitely happen.
The defence minister added that Pakistan was “compelled” to act after the attacks.
The defence minister had said that there should be no more illusions that the Afghan Taliban were sympathisers of Pakistan or were sincere in wanting peace. “Let’s not fool ourselves … there were three rounds of talks,” he had said.
He elaborated that there was no unified government in Kabul, but rather it was composed of various groups and factions with different interests and agendas.
“Some are linked with India and some have their strings being pulled from elsewhere, so both of these incidents, I think, are a prelude to a coming aggression that could happen from the Afghan side, actually, it will be Indian aggression that is being waged in our country through the route of Afghanistan.”</p><small>2025-11-12 19:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1222281724e8917.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954689/mobile-internet-suspended-in-balochistan-till-november-16' target='_blank'><strong>Mobile internet suspended in Balochistan till November 16</strong></a><br><p>The Balochistan government on Wednesday suspended mobile internet services in all 36 districts of the province from November 10-16, while travel along the Loralai section of National Highway N-70 has been suspended for all transport services until November 14.
The provincial home department stated a security alert had been issued and that these services would remain suspended due to the prevailing situation.
“The Internet service will remain suspended in the rural areas of the entire province,” officials said, adding that Quetta district will remain exempt from this restriction.
However, people were complaining that many parts of Quetta were not receiving signals, and people faced difficulties accessing internet services.
The provincial government also temporarily suspended the movement of all transport services, including taxis and private vehicles, on the Loralai section of National Highway N-70 until November 14, 2025, citing security concerns and law and order considerations.
However, the ban will not apply to local or intra-city traffic, allowing residents to travel for daily needs within their areas.
The home department has instructed all district administrations, police and relevant authorities to ensure the immediate implementation of the decision and make alternative arrangements for the public’s convenience.
Citizens were advised to verify the official travel advisory before planning any journey on the Loralai route to avoid inconvenience.
 






Meanwhile, all educational institutions remained closed in the Cantonment area of Quetta on Wednesday, with officials stating that schools and colleges in the area will remain closed from November 12-16 due to security concerns. However, some government schools in Quetta remained open.
Internet services were also suspended in Quetta for 24 hours on October 31, due to security concerns.
In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks.
According to a report published in January, Pakistan was leading the world in terms of financial losses suffered as a result of outages and shutdowns of internet and social media apps last year.
Pakistan topped the charts with a cumulative financial impact of $1.62 billion. This was higher than the cost in countries like Sudan and Myanmar, which are ravaged by civil wars.

The bill was passed by a two-way voting process — voting by division and clause-by-clause voting. Presented in the house for voting by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the bill will now be referred back to the Senate for the new amendments to be debated upon again and then will be passed by the upper house.
National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said the bill received 234 votes in favour and four against.
 



Major amendments:

Addition of Federal Constitutional Court to the list of courts that cannot ratify the act of high treason
Incumbent chief justice will continue to be known as the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) during his term
CJP now means the senior-most judge among the chief justices of the Supreme Court and Federal Constitutional Court


Speaking on the occasion, PM Shehbaz said the house exhibited solidarity and national unity was promoted. He thanked the lawmakers on his behalf and that of the nation.
The prime minister also paid tribute to deceased PML-N senator Irfan Siddiqui, hailing him as the “teacher of teachers”, and lauded his loyalty to Nawaz.
The premier also condemned the “dastardly” attempt by terrorists to carry out an incident in Wana, saying the event made one think of the Army Public School massacre. “These khawarij, in which unfortunately Afghans were also involved, were all sent to hell and all cadets, students and teachers were safely rescued. I want to congratulate the nation on this and want to thank the army and law enforcement agencies who exhibited professionalism and saved the nation’s youth,” he added.

PM Shehbaz also addressed the suicide blast in Islamabad and said it was no hidden matter now that the hand of terrorists was plain to see in such incidents.
Referring to his statement yesterday in which he had blamed Indian involvement, the Fitna al-Khawarij and said “footprints of Afghanistan are also seen”, the prime minister said India had subsequently issued remarks rubbishing the allegations.
“I don’t need to say a lot. The terrorists who abducted a train in Balochistan, the Jaffer Express, we brought its evidence before the whole world how TTP and BLA were active from Afghanistan and were in contact with terrorists there and also with their supporters in India.
“We presented these facts before the whole world and no one challenged or rebutted them.”
Thus, the prime minister said the notion that Pakistan’s terrorist enemies were not involved in the attacks was akin to calling “day as night and vice versa”.
“I want to say something with great satisfaction and force to these terrorist elements and enemies of Pakistan, that we are fully aware of your actions and we have given you a befitting response before and will do so again as well.”
Referring to the negotiations with Afghanistan in Turkiye, he said Pakistan had only one demand in the talks and for the past two years, that the Afghan Taliban rein in terrorist outfits operating from their soil and waging attacks here.
The premier said Pakistan wanted peace and for Afghanistan to become an equal partner in the endeavour because “we believe what is good for Pakistan is good for them and vice versa, but this cannot happen that they make false promises and then don’t clamp down [on terrorists].”
Referring to the Afghan foreign minister’s visit to India and his engagements there, PM Shehbaz said: “We are perfectly understanding these messages but I still want to take advantage of the opportunity and say: come, sit with a sincere heart and clamp down on terrorists, give a commitment so there is peace in the whole region and it becomes a centre of prosperity and development.”
Coming to the 27th Amendment, the prime minister thanked President Asif Ali Zardari, Nawaz, Bilawal and other allies. He said the amendment had become part of the Constitution after the consultation process, adding that the Charter of Democracy had always envisioned a constitutional court, and now that “dream” was fulfilled.
Referring to Pakistan’s military performance in the May conflict against India and subsequent diplomatic outreach, PM Shehbaz said the series of moves had rendered India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi “helpless”, adding that the Indian premier was still helpless.
“Regarding this, we fully need to promote national unity and solidarity and I think the constitutional court that has come into being is the peak of the Charter of Democracy. I also want to thank Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi for supporting us within the ambit of the Constitution.”
Shehbaz also pointed out that the Supreme Court’s chief justice would continue to head the Supreme Judicial Council, Judicial Commission of Pakistan, Law and Justice Commission and other important constitutional institutions.
The prime minister again credited Pakistan’s military performance in May for raising the country’s reputation and prestige in the wider international community. He said that was the reason why the whole nation supported the decision of the government and its allies to give the rank of field marshal to the army chief.
PM Shehbaz further said that there was no difference in thinking between him and Bilawal, saying the provinces would be strong if the Centre was strong and vice versa. He said rolling back the 18th Amendment or the National Finance Commission award unilaterally was out of the question until there was complete consultation on the matter.
However, the premier said here: “I am with that which strengthens Pakistan and the federation and against that which weakens them.”
He further said: “That thing which weakens the federation, no matter how good it is on its own, is not good for Pakistan.”
‘Sunk the ship of democracy’
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan assailed the passing of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill, stating that in rushing the amendments, “you have sunk the ship of democracy and judicial independence”.
“They introduced another amendment that we’re only seeing for the first time,” Gohar said.
“In Article 260, there are definitions for everything. There is a definition for the chief justice in Article 260(A), but they added a subclause AB.”
He read the bill’s amendment to Clause 56, which states: “After the definition of the Chief Justice, as amended aforesaid, the following new definition shall be inserted, namely: ‘Chief Justice of Pakistan’ means the senior amongst the Chief Justice of the Federal Constitutional Court and the Chief Justice of Supreme Court.”
Gohar said that this means that, as per Article 176, CJP Yahya Afridi will remain in his office so long as he holds the post.
“He took his oath on October 26, 2024, and it is a position with a tenure of three years,” the PTI chairman explained, adding that the CJP’s tenure would expire on October 26, 2027.
“The subclause AB in Article 260 states that the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court will become the CJP upon the vacation of the position.”
“They are playing musical chairs with the Supreme Court: there will be one CJP for three years, then there will be another one for another three years,” Gohar claimed.
“If you wanted to appoint a CJP, you could have just appointed someone from the Supreme Court. You could do it ceremonially, so that the chief justice of the Supreme Court shall also be known as the chief justice of Pakistan.”
“By rushing these amendments, you have sunk the ship of democracy and judicial independence and given nothing to the people,” he added.
“However, I am hopeful that we will be able to reverse this whenever we get a majority in parliament and free judges. Decisions are made in the House, but not for personal gain.”
Political bigwigs attend session, opposition stage protest
As soon as PM Shehbaz, Nawaz, and Bilawal entered the house, PTI members tore up copies of the bill and threw them towards the PM’ chair. PML-N parliamentarians immediately created a human shield around the premier and Nawaz to protect them, so that no PTI member could come close to them.

Moreover, as soon as Tarar, who had tabled the bill during yesterday’s NA session, began today’s speech, opposition members gathered near the speaker’s dais to register their protest. After that, they staged a walkout from the assembly.

The law minister said that consultation with the legal fraternity showed that there was confusion about the continuity of the chief justice of Pakistan’s position. “To remove this confusion, I will introduce an appropriate amendment in which it will be clarified that the current CJP … will remain the CJP,” he added.
 
 

He also mentioned Article 6 of the Constitution, saying that, as per the 18th Amendment, neither the Supreme Court nor any high court could ratify the abrogation of the Constitution.
Now, the law minister said, the constitutional court was also added to the list to remove any confusion.
The PML-N-led coalition government had succeeded in manoeuvring the passage of the bill through the Senate amid the opposition’s protest on Monday.
It now needs the NA’s approval, which means the support of a two-thirds majority in the 336-member house, followed by the president’s assent.
The ruling coalition commands the required number, with the PML-N holding 125 seats, PPP 74, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan 22, Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and the Pakistan Muslim League-Zia and Balochistan Awami Party and National Peoples Party one seat each. Meanwhile, the opposition has 103 seats.
PPP supports Article 243 changes ‘in context of war situation’
Bilawal addressed the assembly after getting up from his seat to meet PM Shehbaz and Nawaz.
However, the Bhutto scion’s speech was marred by opposition benches and PTI’s sloganeering in favour of party founder Imran Khan. They also carried the incarcerated ex-premier’s photos to the assembly. PTI stalwarts repeatedly disrupted Bilawal’s speech and tore up copies of the bill to express their disapproval.
Unaffected by the commotion, the PPP chief began his address by condemning yesterday’s terrorist attacks in the country.
“I want to remind the elected representatives in this house, whether in opposition or treasury benches, that we can have political and ideological differences, but as far as this country’s security and enemies, and combatting these terrorists [is concerned], not only this house but the entire country should unite in facing them.”
He said terrorism was once again on the rise in the country, but added that Pakistan had managed to defeat the menace before and would do so again.
The PPP chairman said his party decided to support the changes in Article 243 in the “context that Pakistan is going through a situation of war”.
 
 

“On the one hand, we defeated India. On the other hand, India hosted the Afghan foreign minister, and what is happening on our second border after that, the blood spilling of our citizens is in front of you.”
“In the 27th Amendment, we are about to fulfil the unfulfilled promises of the Charter of Democracy. We are about to establish constitutional courts, and in Article 243 — after defeating India, the prime minister decided to make the army chief the field marshal — not only are we providing constitutional protection to that rank of field marshal, but also bringing some changes to the defence institutions.”
The PPP chief said his party had decided to give constitutional cover to the field marshal after the way he and the military received praise after the May conflict against India.
He added that when a government brought a constitutional amendment, it meant that it had consulted with the defence institutions for changes relevant to them, as well as considered the legal aspects with the courts, judges, and lawyers for changes to the judicial structure.
 


Bilawal said that in his opinion, any legislature’s real strength was not in the majority by which it could pass an amendment, but in the consensus that was present, pointing to the consensus that was present at the time of the 1973 Constitution and the 18th Amendment.
“The constitutional amendment we are bringing today, we have the majority, but we could not form that consensus,” he acknowledged.
On the 26th Amendment, Bilawal said the PPP had strove to ensure that legislative activity took place with consensus, adding that the party had done the same at the time of the 18th Amendment and the 1973 Constitution.
He said that both the PTI and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) were on board with the decision to form the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, claiming that the PTI’s other protestations were also catered to.
Speaking of the Charter of Democracy, Bilawal stressed, “We must move forward towards a truth and reconciliation. We must acknowledge that this Pakistan is as much mine as it is of Shehbaz Sharif, of Mahmood Khan Achakzai, and of Imran Khan.”
Noting that political differences ought to be there, he said: “Unless we open such doors that decrease political polarisation, unless we are able to speak to each other and make decisions while having differences […] unless politicians take their fate into their hands […], this house and this country would not function as they should.”
The PPP leader urged the opposition not to leave the political and parliamentary grounds, and called for consistent communication between parties to break the existing deadlock.
‘Don’t empower separatists’: Bilawal says no to any 18th Amendment rollback
During his address, the PPP chairman reminded the ruling allies of other promises made in the Charter of Democracy, calling for their implementation in full.

Mentioning the initial proposals of making changes in the NFC award, which then did not make it to the draft bill due to the PPP’s outright rejection, Bilawal reiterated that his party would not back any reversal of those provincial rights as long as he was its chairman.
Bilawal said he was willing to discuss the matter of “provincial protections” with the government, adding that the province’s tax collection for certain devolved taxes had been better than the Centre’s.
However, he added, “We can talk [with the government] but when we do, the PPP would not discuss what powers and resources the Centre can take from provinces. We will talk about what more resources provinces can take from the Centre to give better performance.”
 
 

The PPP chairman asserted that the 18th Amendment had “buried the politics of separation” by devolving certain ministries to the provinces. “I beg the Centre not to take such steps that will empower separatists, your enemies and opponents.”
At the same time, Bilawal appreciated the government for accepting his party’s demand that the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) include judges from all provinces.
He added that even those against the Amendment must acknowledge this “huge success”, recalling that the bench that sentenced his grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to death did not have equal representation.
The Bhutto scion said the PPP, the PML-N and other ruling parties “suffered from the suo motu powers” following the tenure of ex-chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry.
 
 

“We saw how courts said suo motu, suo motu and disrespected prime ministers, ministers, governments and embarrassed elected representatives […] After this constitutional amendment, there will be no suo motu,” Bilawal said, adding that only cases filed by a citizen will be heard.
Information minister castigates opposition
Earlier, referring to opposition members’ speeches before his, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said it seemed the others could not recall any events preceding 2022, when Imran, whose party is now in the opposition, was removed as the prime minister.
He took an exception to the opposition protest movement against the 27th Amendment under the slogan of Aise dastoor ko subh-e-be-nur ko main nahi manta main nahi janta (This constitution, this morning bereft of light, I refuse to accept, I refuse to acknowledge).
They read this but fail to say “Iss khule jhoot ko zehen ki loot ko main nahi manta main nahi janta”. (This blatant lie, this stealth of intellect, I refuse to accept, I refuse to acknowledge).
“When they read this couplet of Habib Jalib, they do it selectively. When they talk about fascism, they talk about what they deem fascist,” he said.
He alleged that the PTI had been accepting of “fascism” in the past, saying that in contrast, they had a problem today when Parliament — the highest institution of the country — was on its way to pass a constitutional amendment through a legal strategy, political process and consultation.
“This selective morality, selective justice, double standards —  what exactly is their politics other than this?” Attaullah said, asking why the PTI did not chant such slogans when former NA deputy speaker Qasim Khan Suri made the unconstitutional move of dismissing the no-confidence motion against Imran in 2022.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“This is their selective memory,” the PML-N leader added. He noted that many politicians were once part of the PML-N, including PTI’s Shahid Khattak, and said a person “who cared more about his own self than national interests sowed the seeds of hatred”.
“Will he apologise now? […] Will he apologise today for violating the Constitution? It was violated in this very assembly, in this chair. They talk about an apology, so I would like to hand them the list of their sins,” Attaullah said.
The minister questioned whether PTI’s Shehryar Khan Afridi gave any suggestions for “improving” any clause in the proposed 27th Amendment.
“Their selective memory and thinking do not go back any further than 2020,” Attaullah said, referring to the PTI. “They should apologise for what they did in 2017 and the way they came into power through the back door.”
The PML-N leader also criticised the PTI for consistently bringing up the Form-47 controversy following the 2024 general elections.
He taunted the opposition party for having different factions: “There is one faction which brings laptops inside the assembly, but it is Zain Qureshi who suffers, and these people who are sitting here turn on their YouTube camera and preach to people.”
Attaullah quipped that some leaders would be part of the government cabinets but would “flee on the first flight they can find when things get even slightly difficult”. “It is a policy of their party to play good cop, bad cop. They will sit here and talk about the political process while someone out there in different countries will attack state institutions.”
He regretted that “most of Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s speech today was all about Kabul”.
“It is a new trend now to say something that will become a headline in India or Kabul,” he decried.
He then accused the PTI of “polluting the minds of political workers and inciting them to commit crime for political interests”, and later “ditching them” — a reference to the May 9, 2023, protests and their consequences for the party.
Continuing his criticism, he said the PTI had not given any recommendation for the proposed amendment and boycotted parliamentary committee meetings.
“They refuse to become a part of the process.”
He said the PTI had not learned anything in the past four years. “If they had, they would have held talks on the 27th Amendment and become a part of the political process.
“Had they done some research […] we would have had a productive discussion here in the house. We would have sent out a message to the world that Pakistan’s Parliament had held a very fruitful debate on the matter.”
Speaking of Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces, he mentioned the improved perception of Pakistanis worldwide.
Referring to Achakzai’s speech again, he said the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan would not be tolerated.
He argued that the primary purpose of the 27th Amendment was to improve governance, defence and the delivery of justice. The minister also maintained that the amendment was not being passed in haste and all issues included in it were being discussed for years under the Charter of Democracy.
However, speaking before him, PTI’s Sheh­r­yar Khan Afridi had alleged that the government was “protecting themselves in their haste”.
Referring to a proposed change under the amendment to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings, he said that had President Zardari refused this relief, his respect and honour would have increased. “But today, his actions have resulted in not just the funeral of his honour, but also the PPP’s.”
He termed the 27th Amendment “a simple mockery of the people of Pakistan” and called for the government to learn from past instances. He said the 27th Amendment was a “scar on the face of democracy. The 27th Amendment will humiliate us globally at all levels”.
PPP’s Nafisa Shah defends her party’s role
PPP’s Nafisa Shah also addressed the house, defending her party’s role in the proposed legislation.
Responding to the opposition’s criticism, she said the PPP’s role in the 26th or 27th Constitutional Amendments would have to be viewed taking into consideration the clauses that had not been included in those bills.
“I want to make a list of those. Some of them are a work in progress, but some of them are those that the PPP had already crushed,” Shah continued. “And for that, you will have to acknowledge and laud the PPP’s role”.
She then went on to say that some of the provisions that had not been included in the amendment bill were those regarding the federal structure and resources.
Shah then held up a paper, apparently the draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill, and said: “Article 163-A is not mentioned in here. Why is it so, and why is it important? It is important because whether it is the 18th Amendment [or the] NFC (National Finance Commission) award, 163-A is a very important provision.”
 


She said the proposed changes pertaining to this subject had not been included in the bill because the PPP refused to accept them. The provincial autonomy has to remain intact, she emphasised.
“So, 163-A, which is limiting the provincial share in the NFC, has not been tabled,” she asserted, adding, “I think you have to credit the PPP for that.”
Shah further stated that changes had also been recommended to “enhance executive powers, executive magistracy”. The PPP, she said, had also raised objections to this proposal and did not let it become a part of the bill.
Likewise, the PPP had also ensured the exclusion of amendments pertaining to dual nationality in the bill.
Moving on to the appointment of the chief election commissioner (CEC), she called for the opposition to engage on this matter.
“There is an ongoing debate on this, and all political parties should sit together on this,” she emphasised, adding that the provision relating to the CEC’s, too, had not been tabled.
On the proposed amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which deals with the command of armed forces, she said the suggested changes were about the “command structure”.
“The reform of this command structure just has to be viewed in the perspective of [us] winning a war, winning a difficult war,” Shah said, adding that the other war that the country was engaged in could not be pinned down.
Referring to yesterday’s bomb blast in Islamabad, she said, “This asymmetric war is not just on wars. It is neither [being fought] in the east or the west. Neither it is being fought on our frontiers with Afghanistan nor on the eastern border.
“This is going on internally. And to face these proxy wars, asymmetric wars, we not just need national unity, but also we need to support our armed forces.”
On the basis of these ground realities, Bilawal took the stance to “support this change in command”, she explained.
Shah then went on to address the “most contentious” issue of judicial structure under the proposed amendment. She highlighted two key matters in this regard: the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court and the transfer of judges.
“We have a historical baggage, having faced the consequences of such judicial judgements that are quoted in jurispudence world over because they are strange concoctions. This is the doctrine of necessity,” she said, adding: “It was a concept that had been buried in jurisprudence. In fact, it had been buried in the annals of history.”
But then, she continued, “some judge — I think you will better remember his name, justice Munir I think — he brought it out of nowhere. And this dictum means that which is illegal by law is law by necessity”.
This dictum was used to dismiss elected parliaments, constituent assemblies
and several prime ministers, she added.
In view of this, late prime minister Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz maintained in their wisdom that “we do not want a judiciary that rationalises unconstitutional rule, that dismisses elected prime ministers, dismisses parliaments”.
It was in this perspective that the establishment of an FCC was suggested, and therefore, “we are talking about a constitutional court here”.
On the transfer of judges, she said the PPP endorsed the relevant proposed changes to the extent that transfers should not be used to “arm twist the judges”.
Earlier in her speech, she admitted that many provisions of the proposed 27th Amendment “are something that really need a lot of discussion, that may be a little bit controversial”. But, she continued citing PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, “the circumstances that we are in, you cannot let go off whatever space you are getting — be it a mile or an inch — if you have to move toward civilian supremacy”.
“We have to take whatever space we get. Boycott is not an option,” she asserted.
She added that the PPP had “always engaged positively with the Constitution, with the parliament”.
Speaker urges opposition to hold dialogue
The NA proceedings began today with Sadiq giving the floor to Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai. At this point, the live feed from the NA on its YouTube channel was disrupted.
A recording of his speech was later uploaded to the NA’s YouTube channel, with parts of the speech seemingly edited out and expunged.
When the live feed was restored, Sadiq appeared on the screen, thanking Achakzai. He said PM Shehbaz had repeatedly invited the opposition in the house to hold talks.
“As the speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, I am ready to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition. We will find ways out when you hold talks,” he continued.
Addressing the NA, Achakzai termed the proposed amendments “undemocratic and of the wrong kind”.
He noted that even those were included in advancing those who had “given huge sacrifices”, recalling that ex-premiers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto had to spend years abroad in exile for “wanting rule of the people”.
“You stole the mandate, respected Speaker. I am sorry [but] you have stolen the mandate,” the opposition alliance leader thundered.
 


Achakzai alleged that one of the PML-N MNAs was losing by 6,000 votes last year, and therefore “refused a [seat] saying his people did not vote for him”. Without taking the person’s name, he described him as “respected” and “one of the closest” to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The opposition leader went on to cite two more such alleged cases, but his full comments were unclear as the video uploaded by the NA was censored.
 
 

The PkMAP leader said, “Whether Imran Khan is a good person or a bad person … why did you let him become the prime minister? Why did you keep all institutes of the country in front of him? And then obstructed his path from the courts to the streets.”
Achakzai recalled the revocation of the PTI’s electoral symbol last year and appreciated the youth for voting “on 200 symbols” to foil those “dramas staged while colluding with undemocratic forces”.
The stream was then briefly disrupted again, and when it resumed, Sadiq was saying if “you want to find an excuse not to hold negotiations, then it is our bad luck. Accept my offer, hold talks. You will get results through talks.”
Following that, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan asserted that “we never gave up on dialogue”.
“When our mandate was stolen, [Imran] Khan sahib had nominated Shibli sahib, Omar sahib and Ali Amin Gandapur to hold dialogue. People then started saying that we wanted to talk to the establishment and not politicians.
“So I visited Khan sahib, and we announced outside Adiala Jail that Achakzai sahib had the complete mandate if he wanted to engage the party and make any suggestions from his platform. Achakzai sahib is present here [today]. Efforts were made, but nothing transpired,” Gohar said, with the live stream being disrupted again at this point.
When it resumed, the PTI chairman was reiterating his party’s request to let Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi meet PTI founder Imran Khan in jail.
Responding to him, the speaker said: “Gohar sahib, when your offer was made, you did not even come to me personally. The prime minister showed grace and formed a high-powered committee of the allies.”
The committee held three meetings, but they were not boycotted by this side, Sadiq said, pointing towards the treasury benches. The meetings were boycotted from this side, he added, pointing towards the opposition benches.
‘If bill is tabled today, it will surely be passed’
Speaking to the media outside Parliament earlier today, the information minister said if the amendment bill was tabled in the NA for voting today, it would surely be passed.
He also expressed his wish for the opposition to have “engaged in a fruitful clause-by-clause discussion” on the bill.
 






Creating an uproar without even going through the bill and spinning a narrative would not result in any gain, he said.
Upon being asked whether Nawaz would be visiting Parliament today, he said: “We will also have him meet you”.
Opposition to the bill
The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) as well as changes to the military leadership structure.
 
 

Taking exception to the proposed tweaks, opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pak­­istan has ann­o­unced a nationwide protest movement aga­i­nst the proposed am­­end­ment, urging the people to take a stand agai­nst the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution.
While debating it in the NA yesterday, Barrister Gohar accused the government of attempting to “create another elite class” by means of the bill. He made these remarks particularly in reference to a proposal in the bill to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests, except for the period during which he holds public office following the end of their tenure.
Gohar also warned that “with the passing of the [27th] Amendment, democracy here will only exist in name,” adding that his party “will not accept” it.
Sardar Latif Khosa from his party accused the PPP of “playing naughtily” with the Constitution at the behest of the ruling PML-N.
Similarly, PTI leader Amir Dogar warned the 27th Amendment would paralyse the judiciary, adding that none of its clauses served the public interest.
On the other hand, PML-N’s Barrister Daniyal Chaudhry defended during yesterday’s NA session the planned establishment of the FCC, saying the move was aimed at preventing extra-judicial decisions and reducing the Supreme Court’s (SC) workload.
Speaking on the occasion, PPP leader Shazia Marri asserted that President Zardari did not seek immunity as he had already endured eight years of imprisonment without conviction. She said the PPP would never compromise on the 18th Ame­n­dment or the rights of the people.
Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal of the MQM-P referred to Article 140-A, which relates to local governments, and said his party’s proposed amendments to the article “are not dead yet” and would be discussed as part of a 28th amendment.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif endorsed the MQM’s call for strengthening local governments to address people’s issues at the grassroots level.
 
 

Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the proposed amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
Passage of the bill so far
The government’s plan to make a 27th Amendment to the Constitution is taking shape roughly a year after it managed to get the 26th Constitutional Amendment approved.
The 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
In the following months, even though the 26th Amendment remained mired in controversy and continued to face challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The speculation about whether the government intended to further tweak the Constitution was put to rest when Bilawal announced on social media platform X on November 3 that a PM Shehbaz-led delegation had sought his party’s support for the amendment.
Subsequently, PM Shehbaz had also held consultations with other ruling allies to secure support for the controversial amendment.
The bill was then tabled in the Senate on Nov 8, just hours after it was approved by the federal cabinet in a meeting chaired by PM Shehbaz via a video link from Baku. It was subsequently referred to the Senate and NA standing committees on law and justice, which approved it the very next day with some minor changes to the initial draft.
The law minister tabled it in the Senate for voting on Nov 10. The contentious bill was approved by the upper house of Parliament after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The PML-N led coalition government had managed to secure a two-thirds majority to get the bill passed with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines.</p><small>2025-11-12 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/12162645b9bc53d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954673/india-says-delhi-blast-was-terror-incident-death-toll-rises-to-12' target='_blank'><strong>India says Delhi blast was ‘terror incident’, death toll rises to 12</strong></a><br><p>India’s government confirmed on Wednesday that it was treating a car blast that killed 12 people and wounded at least 20 others in Delhi as a “terror incident” and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice as swiftly as possible.
In a resolution adopted late on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet said: “The country has witnessed a heinous terror incident, perpetrated by anti-national forces, through a car explosion.“
“The Cabinet directs that the investigation into the incident be pursued with the utmost urgency and professionalism so that the perpetrators, their collaborators, and their sponsors are identified and brought to justice without delay.”
Meanwhile, India’s anti-terrorism agency spearheaded the third day of investigations into the car blast.
Police are yet to give exact details of what caused the intense explosion near the historic Red Fort in the crowded Old Delhi quarter of the city, one of India’s most well-known landmarks, and the site of the annual prime minister’s Independence Day speech. The blast was the first such explosion in the heavily guarded city of more than 30 million people since 2011.
“Twelve people have died and more than 30 are injured,” Ritu Saxena, the chief medical officer of Delhi’s LNJP hospital, told AFP.
India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) is leading the probe into the explosion, which came hours after police said they had arrested a gang and seized explosive materials and assault rifles.
Home Minister Amit Shah, after chairing security talks following Monday’s blast, said he had instructed officials “to hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”.
Indian police claimed the men were linked with groups Jaish-i-Mohammad and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind. India lists both groups as terrorist organisations.
Police are also investigating if there is a link between this week’s car blast in Delhi and the earlier arrest of a group of seven men from occupied Kashmir with arms and bomb-making material, according to three sources familiar with the probe.
Indian authorities are investigating the blast under a stringent anti-terrorism law and have said that all angles are being probed. They have not named anyone or made any arrests in connection with the explosion.
Two doctors arrested
Hours before the blast in Delhi, police in Indian occupied Kashmir said they had arrested seven men, including two doctors, in connection with a separate anti-terror probe and searches in the region and in the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh that border Delhi.
Police found two pistols, two assault rifles and 2,900 kilogrammes of bomb-making material during the raids, a police statement said.
“The investigation has revealed a white collar terror ecosystem, involving radicalised professionals and students in contact with foreign handlers, operating from Pakistan and other countries,” it alleged, claiming that the men were linked to groups Jaish-i-Mohammad and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.
The Foreign Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Senior Indian leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have vowed to punish those behind the Delhi blast, with Modi saying no “conspirator” would be spared.
In April, 26 men were killed in an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without any evidence, blamed on Pakistan, a charge denied by Islamabad. The crisis led to the worst military conflict between the nuclear-armed rivals in decades before they agreed to a ceasefire after four days.
Raids in occupied Kashmir
The connection between the Delhi car driver and the seven men arrested is being investigated, the three sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media on the sensitive issue.
Investigations were focused on whether the driver was a doctor and a colleague of one of the two arrested, one of the sources said.
Spokespersons for the Delhi Police and the NIA did not respond to requests for comment.
Following the Delhi blast, police in occupied Kashmir carried out raids at hundreds of locations in the region and about 500 people were detained, a police source told Reuters. Most were let off after questioning, the source said.</p><small>2025-11-12 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/12204624cd87c67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954686/house-democrats-release-epstein-papers-saying-trump-knew-about-the-girls' target='_blank'><strong>House Democrats release Epstein papers saying Trump ‘knew about the girls’</strong></a><br><p>Democrats released emails on Wednesday in which convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein suggested that United States President Donald Trump was aware of the financier’s sexual abuse and definitely “knew about the girls”.
Trump has denied any involvement in or knowledge of the sex-trafficking activities of his former friend, who died by suicide in federal prison in 2019 as he was awaiting trial.
But Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said the emails “raise serious questions about Donald Trump and his knowledge of Epstein’s horrific crimes”.
The furore around the disgraced financier is still roiling Trump’s administration four months after his Justice Department effectively closed the case, announcing there was no more information to share.
Democrats in the House — keen to capitalise on the simmering controversy — have been trying to force a vote that would compel publication of the full Epstein case files.
The newly released emails were written to longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking after Epstein’s death, and author Michael Wolff.
In them, Epstein asserts Trump spent significant time with a woman whom Oversight Democrats describe as a victim of Epstein’s sex trafficking.
In one email to Wolff shared by Democrats and dated January 31, 2019, Epstein allegedly wrote: “Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever… of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.”
In another message from April 2011, Epstein told Maxwell: “I want you to realise that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump.”
He added that an unnamed victim “spent hours at my house with him … he has never once been mentioned”.
Maxwell replied: “I have been thinking about that.”
Democrats on the House Oversight Committee obtained the emails after subpoenaing Epstein’s estate earlier this year.
Trump has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein or Maxwell.
The White House issued a response accusing Democrats of pushing a “fake narrative” after the emails were released.
“The Democrats selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.
The release came on the day that House Speaker Mike Johnson is scheduled to swear in Democratic Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva to succeed her late father in Congress.
Grijalva is expected to provide the final signature needed for a petition to force a House vote to release all unclassified records related to Epstein, something Johnson and Trump have resisted up to now.
The top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Representative Robert Garcia, called on the Justice Department to fully release the Epstein files to the public.
“The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover. These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the president,” he said in a statement.
Conspiracy theories
In a July 7 memo, the Justice Department said the Epstein “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed to have been reviewing did not in fact exist, and reaffirmed that he died by suicide in his prison cell.
It sparked a furious backlash from Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) support base, who have for years been told by their leaders that a “deep state” cover-up was protecting figures in the Democratic Party whom they accused of being Epstein’s clients.
 
 

Trump’s MAGA lieutenants, including two allies who have since been hired to run the Federal Bureau of Investigation, made careers of fanning the conspiracy theories, including that Epstein’s suicide was actually a murder ordered by his powerful clients.
Prominent online influencers and media figures in the movement — as well as ordinary voters — have spoken of feeling betrayed after Trump began publicly castigating them for wanting answers.
Trump’s ties to Epstein are extensive. The pair were pictured partying together during a 15-year friendship before they reportedly fell out in 2004 over a property deal, and when Trump subsequently denounced his former ally.
Epstein admitted to two state felony prostitution charges in 2008 as part of a plea deal — arranged by a prosecutor who would go on to serve in Trump’s cabinet — that was widely criticised as being too lenient.</p><small>2025-11-12 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/12195711a24b6a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954682/3-final-year-medical-university-students-drown-at-manora-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>3 final-year medical university students drown at Manora in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Three final year students from Karachi’s Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) drowned during a picnic at Manora, while three others who survived were moved to a medical facility for treatment, a statement by the university said on Wednesday.
According to the statement, a batch of 150 university students was on a picnic at Hawkesbay beach, while 15 students from the same batch had planned a separate picnic at Manora.
The beach trip is part of a “long-standing tradition” where final-year students spend a week celebrating.
“It has been reported that the venue (a hut) was booked by the father of one of the students, where the group went to enjoy their outing,” said the statement.
It added that the college administration had arranged for 150 students to travel to Hawkesbay with security guards and all necessary safety measures.
“However, the college administration and the principal of Dow Medical College were not informed about the separate Manora picnic organised by the 15 students,” the statement clarified.
It noted that the students who went to Hawkesbay beach returned safely to the college, while the tragic incident occurred at Manora.
“In the afternoon, a powerful wave swept one student into the sea; as others rushed to rescue him, the mishap occurred,” the statement said, adding that their bodies have been moved to the mortuary of Karachi’s Civil Hospital.
The statement added that three other students who survived the ordeal were shifted to a medical facility for treatment.
However, DIG South Syed Asad Raza said that five students drowned, out of which two were rescued and none are missing.
The university administration has “issued special instructions to ensure the best medical care for the injured students”.
Earlier, a man drowned while saving his two minor sons in Hub Canal on Sunday.</p><small>2025-11-12 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1220200299dfe3b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954685/fake-security-alert-for-karachi-circulating-on-whatsapp-sindh-govt' target='_blank'><strong>Fake security alert for Karachi circulating on WhatsApp: Sindh govt</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government on Wednesday issued a statement dismissing a false security alert circulating through WhatsApp, which claimed that a high-level security alert had been imposed in Karachi from November 12-30.
A day prior, 12 people were killed and 36 were injured in a suicide blast outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area, according to officials. Security was tightened in the federal capital and in other major areas like Lahore.
The fake warning doing the rounds stated: “Based on verified intelligence reports received from federal and provincial law enforcement agencies, the Government of Sindh has declared a high-level security alert in the Karachi Metropolitan Area, effective from 12:01am on November 12, 2025, until 11:59pm on November 30, 2025.”
The alert listed several public places such as shopping centres and schools that were declared “high-risk locations” and to be avoided by the public, including Dolmen Mall, Empress Market, Jinnah International Airport and all schools, colleges, academies and tuition centres.
It also provided security measures that malls and markets, educational institutions and the general public should employ, ranging from walkthrough gate and metal detector searches to reporting suspicious, unattended vehicles.
“Failure to comply with these instructions will result in strict legal action under the Sindh Security of Vulnerable Establishments Act 2024 and the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997,” the notice read, bearing the name of Sindh Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Syed Kaleem Imam.
Later today, the Sindh Home Department issued a statement clarifying that the alert was fake and refuted that it issued any such notification under the reference number HD/Sec/Clarification-11/2025.
“No official correspondence bearing the aforementioned reference number or title has been released by this department or by any law enforcement agency operating under its administrative control,” the home department stated.
“It is further clarified that all genuine security advisories, alerts, and notifications are issued exclusively through official channels of the home department or through duly authorised law enforcement agencies,” it added. “Any document or message circulated outside these channels should be considered unauthentic and misleading.”
The press release urged the general public and the media to refrain from “sharing or relying upon unverified information” on social media and to verify official communications through government sources.
Yesterday, the imposition of Section 144 across the province was extended for another month, a notification from the Sindh Home Department stated.
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
The department imposed Section 144 across the province for a period of one month on October 12 to maintain law and order in the interest of “public and peace”.
According to the notification the ban on all public gatherings and demonstrations was extended for another month, effective from November 12 (Wednesday).</p><small>2025-11-12 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/12121708d477390.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954660/fo-takes-note-of-pca-clarifications-on-indus-waters-treaty-decision' target='_blank'><strong>FO takes note of PCA clarifications on Indus Waters Treaty decision</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) issued a statement on Wednesday in response to clarifications issued by the Court of Arbitration on the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying that Pakistan had taken note of the decision and calling the clarifications “helpful”.
The Hague’s Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had issued its Award on Issues of General Interpretation of the IWT on August 8. On September 19, Pakistan initiated an arbitration against India under the provisions of the IWT, which India suspended unilaterally following a four-day conflict between the two countries in May.
The PCA on Saturday issued clarifications on its decisions surrounding the treaty in response to the request, which concerned the interpretation and application of the IWT to certain design elements of run-of-river hydroelectric plants (HEPs).
The FO statement added that Pakistan had also taken note of the procedural order issued in parallel with the decision.
In response to a Procedural Order also issued in light of the decision, in which the court invited both parties to report on the status of Neutral Expert Proceedings, the FO said, “The Neutral Expert proceedings were initiated on India’s request with their next phase scheduled to take place in Vienna from 17-21 November 2025. While India has decided to halt its participation, Pakistan continues to fully participate in the Neutral Expert proceedings in good faith.”
It added that in this regard, the Neutral Expert had ruled that India’s non-participation could not operate as a bar to the proceedings going forward.
According to a press release issued by the PCA, the requested clarifications included those in relation to Article III, which concerns the Western rivers, and paragraph 8 of Annexure D, which concerns new run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India may construct on these rivers.
“The award also addressed a related question on the legal effect of decisions issued by dispute resolution bodies under the Treaty (namely, courts of
arbitration and neutral experts),” the press release said.
The court found Pakistan’s request for clarification to be “timely” and provided clarifications as to the meaning and scope of several aspects of its decisions, as well as its reasoning behind them. According to the statement, it also found that its clarifications would have the same binding effect as the original award.
The court clarified that its decisions on paragraph 8(a) of Annexure D to the treaty were “not limited to freeboard but, rather, extend to all components of run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India may construct on the Western rivers”. It also stated that the decisions “further prohibit any design that would allow … the works themselves to be capable of raising artificially the water level in the operating pool above the Full Pondage Level specified in the design”, whether from the outset or via later modifications.
The body further clarified that its references to “designing an Annexure D, Part 3 HEP” and the “design” of an Annexure D referenced mandatory design criteria, to be applied at the outset — i.e. at the time of planning. It added that these criteria were distinct from post-commissioning operational constraints on a HEP and could not be satisfied “simply by an acknowledgement of or commitment to operational restraint”.
However, it declined Pakistan’s request to clarify that a crest-gated spillway with gates extending above Full Pondage Level was prohibited under paragraphs 8a and 8e of the annexure, as well as that the design of an Annexure D, Part 3 HEP must always include an ungated spillway. It stated these clarifications to be outside the scope of its award.
The Court of Arbitration further clarified that its reference in paragraph 742 to the list of data and information that India is required to convey to
Pakistan is an indicative list and is not comprehensive.
It additionally clarified its finding that pondage required for firm power would be calculated “based on, among other things, a realistic, well-founded, and defensible projection of the proposed Annexure D, Part 3 HEP’s installed capacity and anticipated load, reflecting the fluctuations in the discharge of the turbines arising from variations in the daily and weekly loads of the plant, as set forth in Paragraph 2(c) of Annexure D”.
Once again, it declined the request for clarification as to how the treaty regulated the basis upon which India must determine the installed capacity and anticipated load of a proposed Annexure D, Part 3 HEP, and, once
determined how these elements were to be taken into account to calculate maximum pondage.
As well as terming this to be outside the scope of the award, it recalled its conclusion that “Pakistan or India may seek to pursue the matter through the Treaty’s dispute resolution procedures, including a further phase of these proceedings”. It confirmed that it was open to conducting a further phase of
These proceedings upon request from either party.
The court also issued Procedural Order No. 16, as part of which it confirmed that it would continue to conduct these proceedings “in a phased manner, bearing in mind the status of, and developments concerning, the proceedings taking place before the Neutral Expert”.
It invited each party to provide written submissions on the status of these proceedings and its views as to any further phases of the proceedings with respect to any matters that were not resolved in the award.</p><small>2025-11-12 10:00</small></div><hr>
