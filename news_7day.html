The home department issued a letter about imposing an immediate ban on the use of rough papers or newspapers containing verses of the Holy Quran for packaging or preserving commodities. 
The order, enacted under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898, aims at preventing potential disturbances to the public peace and tranquility. 
The directive, signed by the home secretary, cites concerns over the misuse of religious texts in everyday trade practices, which could offend religious sentiments. The ban will remain in effect for 90 days across the entire province, starting from May 12. 
The authorities were directed to ensure widespread dissemination of the order through official channels, including the gazette, newspapers and broadcast media. The Punjab Police, divisional commissioners, and deputy commissioners have also been directed to enforce the prohibition strictly.

• Insists ceasefire after face-off between nuclear powers should be celebrated
ISLAMABAD: Amid India’s dangerous war rhetoric, Pakistani lawmakers on Tuesday cautioned that New Delhi could again resort to military misadventure out of political desperation, warning of the grave consequences such an escalation could bring between two nuclear-armed neighbours.
Addressing the National Assembly dur­­­ing a discussion on recent tensions with India, several members lambasted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him a “certified terrorist” and warning that he could go to any extent for political gains as his politics thrived on corpses.
Former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar said that India’s crushing defeat at the hands of Pakistan was nothing to celebrate. “We must all be unapologetic as a country that celebrates a ceasefire. Why not celebrate the ceasefire? Yes, we absolutely will,” she said.
Ms Khar warned that India had continuously crossed red lines, underestim­ating Pakistan’s capability and misreading its restraint as weakness. She said this miscalculation could have led to catastrophic consequences, insisting that Pakistan had proven its defensive and strategic capabilities under pressure.
 


Highlighting the dangers of setting new precedents in international conflict resolution, she challenged India’s narrative of “self-defence” following the Pahal­­gam attack to justify cross-border strikes.
“What are we supposed to do if a terrorism incident takes place in Pakistan?” she asked, questioning whether Pakistan would be equally justified in launching strikes in response to proven Indian involvement in incidents like the Jaffar Express attack. She criticised India for “weaponising terrorism” and flouting international law. “Have you all stepped outside the UN Charter and parameters of international law?” she asked. “Are we no longer signatories to Article 25, which obliges all nations to uphold UN Security Council resolutions?”
She criticised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unilateral declarations regarding held Kashmir, asking whether the world was expected to “pay homage” and bow down to such claims. Citing US President Donald Trump’s acknowledgement of Kashmir as a disputed territory, Ms Khar argued that the Indian narrative had begun to unravel.
“The illusion of India’s conventional warfare supremacy has been broken — not by Pakistan, but by Modi’s own extremist policies,” she remarked.
 
 

She noted that the belief that India could serve as a regional security provider has been undermined by its inability to secure its own borders during confrontations with Pakistan. “Pakistan proved its capabilities through both defensive and calibrated offensive responses,” she asserted.
Ms Khar noted that Pakistan’s military professionalism and operational competence had been underestimated.
“What we all proved was that we don’t just buy high-tech toys; we train ourselves better to use them,” she stressed.
She argued that India’s attempts to detach itself diplomatically from Pakistan — a strategy pursued over the last 15 years — had failed. “By provoking Pakistan into conflict, they re-hyphenated themselves with us in the eyes of the world,” she said. She said that if India was serious in dealing with the problem of terrorism, it must not run away from the dialogue table.
Two bills passed
The House also passed two private me­­mbers’ bills — the International Exa­m­­­ination Board Bill, 2024, and the Ghur­­ki Institute of Science and Technology Bill, 2024 — with majority support. Both bills had previously been reviewed and clea­red by the relevant standing committees.

• Imposes up to Rs100m fine on sale of smuggled petrol
ISLAMABAD: The government has introduced a landmark bill in the National Assembly aimed at digitally tracking petroleum products from import and production to retail sales in a bid to curb smuggling and adulteration, which cause massive revenue losses estimated at Rs300-500 billion annually besides affecting environment and vehicle engines.
The Petroleum (Amend­ment) Act, 2025 — moved by Pet­roleum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik on Monday — seeks to amend the 1934 Petroleum Act. The draft law envisages new clauses for information technology-based tracking of petroleum products to curb smuggling and to initiate strict actions against illegal transportation and decantation of petroleum products, along with actions to be taken against illegal petrol pumps.
All local refineries and major oil marketing companies have been demanding — both individually and from their collective forums — that the government take stringent measures at borders and at domestic locations of production and sale to control smuggling of petroleum products, including LPG, as it negatively affected their businesses and caused substantial revenue losses to the government.
 
 

A 2020 inquiry ordered by the then-prime minister estimated that over Rs250bn worth of petroleum products were being smuggled annually, mostly from Iran. In April 2024, a joint intelligence report revealed that nearly 10 million litres of Iranian petrol and diesel were entering Pakistan daily via land and sea, causing a revenue loss exceeding Rs227bn.
This report entailed complete identities, addresses and contact numbers of 100 black sheep in around a dozen law enforcement agencies, owners and operators of 533 illegal petrol stations across the country, and 105 smugglers of Iranian oil. The report also contained precise information about informal border crossings and routes for trafficking smuggled items throughout Pakistan.
Officials and sources in the oil industry suggest these rep­orts were just the tip of the iceberg and did not cover the business and operations of the adulteration of petroleum products.
The new clauses also empo­wer the government to enable confiscation of petroleum products, equipment, machinery, tra­n­sportation and storage faci­lities by deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and designated officers under the Customs Act, 1969, before and after conviction to provide for stringent administrative action against illegal activities.
For swift legal proceedings, trial powers for offences under the act will be vested in sessions courts, while administrative enforcement will rest with deputy and assistant commissioners.
Another clause provides a right of appeal in the high court, and yet another binds the Department of Explosives or other respective regulatory authorities to revise, extend, or allow new licences in a given timeframe.
One clause outlines a framework for digital tracking and monitoring of petroleum products using real-time data and coordinated action between government agencies. This includes tracking storage points, petrol stations and transport vehicles using IT-enabled systems.
Under the draft law, any individual found importing, transporting, storing, producing or selling petroleum products illegally would face a fine of Rs1m, rising to Rs5m for repeat offences. Facilities found operating without a valid licence would be sealed, and their machinery, tanks and stock confiscated. The owner would be subject to a Rs10 million fine. Those with expired or cancelled licences would be granted a six-month grace period for renewal. Failure to do so would result in confiscation and a Rs1m fine.
The Department of Explosives will renew the licences within a month upon receiving the required documents and the fee. The owner of a premises or facility involved in the storage or sale of smuggled petroleum products will be liable to closure and all machinery, equipment, mat­er­ials, storage tanks and petroleum products being employed or sold will be confiscated along with a fine of Rs100m. The licence of such facility will also be cancelled. Any means of transportation involved in transporting smuggled petroleum products will also be confiscated.

The drivers were transporting LPG imported from Iran on May 9 when armed men intercepted their trucks in the Ahmedwal area on the Quetta-Taftan highway. The assailants burst the trucks’ tires and abducted the four men at gunpoint before security forces arrived at the scene, according to authorities.
Local residents informed the administration about the bodies, prompting Levies and other law-enforcement agencies to rush to the site. The bodies were taken to the district hospital in Noshki.
Hospital officials confirmed all four men died from multiple bullet injuries after being shot from a close range.
The deceased were identified as Moin and Huzaifa, residents of Pakpattan, and brothers Imran Ali and Irfan Ali, residents of Rahimyar Khan. 
Their bodies were sent to respective hometowns after legal formalities were completed.
An investigation has been launched, officials said. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the killings.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind strongly condemned the killings. “Those behind such heinous acts — enemies of peace — will not be spared,” Mr Rind said in a statement, describing the incident as “barbaric and deeply tragic.” 
“The provincial government is utilising all available resources to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice.”
Mr Rind extended condolences to the victims’ families and assured them that justice would be served. He noted the victims were from Punjab and said the incident “appeared to be an attempt by terrorist elements to disrupt interprovincial harmony”.
“The Balochistan government is committed to conducting a transparent and thorough investigation. Those responsible will soon be apprehended and dealt with an iron hand,” Mr Rind affirmed. He reiterated the government’s determination to uphold law and order, asserting that “such cowardly acts would not shake the state’s resolve”.

It was a quiet comment, dropped not with alarm but with the composure of someone watching an era slip gently away.
But there is little quiet about what it truly signals: not procedural modesty, not democratic maturity, but a cold and deliberate retreat. A judiciary once imagined as the final sentinel of rights now appears content to fold its robes, clasp its hands, and wait.
Let us not forget what Article 184(3) was designed to do. It was not built to serve the powerful. It was not sculpted for the whims of the bench. It existed so that the voiceless — the disappeared, the dispossessed, the disenfranchised — could be heard even when they lacked the strength to shout. When no one else would act, the court could. That was the moral architecture behind suo motu.
 
 

And yes, it needed fixing. Suo motu was used erratically, sometimes politically, and too often without restraint. But the answer was never abandonment. The answer was reform. Regulate the criteria. Make reasons for taking cognisance. Institute appellate oversight. But do not quietly watch as the most important judicial power in our constitutional order is procedurally euthanised.
This institutional deadening did not happen overnight. It was slow, bureaucratised, wrapped in the velvet glove of reform. Earlier, the Supreme Court Practice and Procedural Act, 2023 clipped the chief justice’s powers, constituted a three-member committee consisting of the chief justice and the two most senior judges, and granted the right to appeal. Last year, the 26th Constitutional Amendment, touted as a step towards balance, simply codified hesitation.
Therefore, within the judiciary, clarity is no longer a virtue. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar has remarked that since suo motu is a constitutional provision, it must now be exercised through the constitutional bench.
 
 

Even though the 26th Amendment explicitly states that the constitutional bench shall exercise original jurisdiction, a hypothetical risk still remains embedded in the constitutional design. It fails to address whether the same procedure — introduced through earlier amendment — will continue to apply.
Will it now be exercised solely on the authority of the head of the constitutional bench? And more importantly, if the procedure is so clear, why did Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan feel compelled to make his remark? The 26th Amendment, in its eagerness to limit discretion, has instead created a jurisdictional paradox — a court that may have the power, but not the means, to act.

When no one else would act, the court could.

But before this sleepwalking becomes doctrine, let us remember the path we strayed from.
In ‘Darshan Masih vs the state’, the court broke new ground by recognising that the Constitution demanded action even in the absence of formal petitioners. It was a time when the court, flawed as it may have been, stood tall.
 
 

Today, the jurisprudential tide has turned inward. We are told that restraint is a virtue. That neutrality is nobility. But when power consolidates, when dissenters vanish, and when laws twist into weapons, neutrality becomes complicity.
Elsewhere in South Asia, the story unfolds differently. In India, Articles 32 and 226 empower the courts to issue writs without formal procedure. In Bangladesh, where the constitution doesn’t explicitly allow suo motu, the judiciary carved its own path through what it called constitutional transplantation, inspired by India’s Public Interest Litigation regime.
In both countries, courts embraced a moral reading of their role, recognising that justice must not be held hostage by procedural orthodoxy. And yes, the path has been uneven, sometimes misused, but never muted. Pakistan, meanwhile, codifies caution.
This is not to romanticise judicial activism. But it is to say: rights cannot wait for consensus.
And even on a more theoretical level, suo motu has always been used to keep the executive in check. So, if judicial activism is exercised within reasonably guarded metrics, there is no trade-off between rights and democracy. In fact, on the contrary, it may add to the beauty of it.
 
 

What Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan has said, and what the court now risks endorsing, is not just legal regression. It is a human one. It tells those who have no voice that even the court — their last recourse — has put up a sign that reads: ‘come back later’.
But history does not wait. It watches. And one day, it will ask why the court, in its ceremonial wisdom, let go of the one power that allowed it to stand between the citizen and the leviathan. Not to decide outcomes. Not to dictate policy. But to ensure that when the Constitution cried out, someone was still listening.
Let us not count this silence as wisdom. Let us name it for what it is: abdication.

Both India and Pakistan have stepped back from the brink after a US-brokered ceasefire. The fighting may have stopped, yet tentativeness surrounds the fragile ceasefire.
There is no indication yet that India is willing to enter into meaningful negotiations with Pakistan over the major sources of tension. The outcome of four days of the most intense military confrontation between the two countries in decades has not been what the right-wing ultra-nationalist Indian government desired when it launched simultaneous missile attacks in many Pakistani cities. The unwarranted aggression was immediately responded to by Pakistan with a ferocity that India had not bargained for.
 
 

India lost the advantage within hours of launching attacks when Pakistan shot down five of its most advanced fighter planes in what was an epic air battle with little precedent in modern air warfare. India went up the escalatory ladder by targeting Pakistani air and military bases. Missiles and drones rained over Pakistani cities. Pakistani forces also responded to that Indian action with greater intensity.
The four days of confrontation brought the pro­s­pect of a full-scale war between the two nuclear-armed nations precariously closer than at any time before, causing serious concern in Washing­ton and other capitals. Although President Donald Trump’s administration was engaged with the leadership of both countries from the beginning, diplomatic efforts gained momentum as the confrontation took a more serious turn.

It was once again external intervention that helped stop the conflict between the two countries.

It was once again external intervention that helped stop the conflict between the two countries. President Trump claimed that US intervention had prevented a nuclear war between the two nations, though India continues to deny yielding to any outside pressure. Trump has not only offered US diplomatic mediation to bring down tensions between the two countries but has also tied peace to economic engagement. His linking of trade with truce may have also compelled both sides to de-escalate.
 
 

It was perhaps for the first time that trade has been leveraged by an American administration in peace diplomacy. While the worst may be over, peace remains elusive in what is described as one of the world’s most combustible regions. India still does not seem willing to back down from its decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty that Pakistan described as a declaration of war.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has continued with his war cry reiterating his hard-line position both on blocking water flows and bilateral engagement with Pakistan on the Kashmir dispute that he thinks has been resolved after his government’s unilateral decision in 2019 to strip the occupied region of its semi-autonomous status and annex it. He declared that any negotiations would be limited to Pakistan’s part of Kashmir.
What seems to have infuriated the Indian prime minister most is that the latest confrontation has brought the Kashmir issue back into international focus.
President Trump’s remarks that he was willing to mediate on Kashmir and other issues between the two countries seem to have further riled him, which was evident in his latest public address delivered a day after the ceasefire agreement. The Modi government has maintained India’s long-standing position of not accepting international mediation on what New Delhi has described as a bilateral matter.
 
 

Modi’s move to authorise his military commanders to take cross-border military action in the event of a militant attack in the disputed territory was most perturbing. According to some analysts, the decision indicated further scaling down of the threshold for military action. It seems that the Modi government has not learnt any lesson from the latest and the 2019 military incursions against Pakistan.
India’s doctrine of keeping the conflict below the nuclear threshold has been countered on both occasions by Pakistan’s response, which demonstrated the conventional capability to thwart Indian military adventurism. The downing of Indian fighter planes has been seen as Pakistan’s edge in modern high-tech air warfare. In 2019, too, Pakistani forces shot down an Indian fighter plane and captured its pilot.
But analysts say that what happened in the latest round of conflict has exposed India’s claim of conventional superiority. The Modi government took a two-pronged approach when it decided to go for kinetic action against Pakistan following the Pahalgam terrorist attack that had left more than two dozen dead. While broadening the spectrum of military operations by extending it to Pakistan’s mainland, New Delhi also tried to isolate Islamabad internationally.
 
 

Unlike 2019, it could not get support from Washington and its other Western allies for its military action. Trump’s decision to stay neutral in the conflict was the biggest diplomatic setback for the Modi government, particularly as India is considered a strategic ally of Washington. It disrupted India’s entire strategy of ‘punishing’ Pakistan.
Meanwhile, China’s diplomatic backing and its military cooperation gave a huge boost to Pakistan’s confidence in confronting military power. The Pakistan Air Force with advanced Chinese missiles executed a sensor-fusion kill. This has been a strong geopolitical message for India.
However, while Pakistan has reason to celebrate its forces’ successful defence against aggression, it is not time to declare victory. Rather, it is time for reflection. The conflict has also exposed some of our own vulnerabilities. In the midst of the confrontation, our major worry was whether the IMF would approve the next tranche of its loan. With a weak economy, successfully defending one’s sovereignty is difficult.
The ceasefire now in place has provided the country with some space to focus on the economy. Similarly, it is essential to restore political stability in the country. A politically divided nation and the conflict within make the country extremely vulnerable. There are many more lessons to learn as we walk back from the brink.

The Wire said that Indian opposition parties asked whether the ceasefire was a result of US mediation, marking a clear departure from India’s longstanding policy of ‘no third-party mediation’.
Opposition parties have demanded to know why Modi remained silent on Trump’s claims, whether India has changed its longtime policy of no third-party mediation and if the US president’s claims of trade being used to end the conflict is true.
In a statement, Congress MP Jai­r­am Ramesh said Modi’s “much-delayed address to the nation was upstaged by President Trump’s revelations”.
“The prime minister was completely silent on them. Has India agreed to US mediation? Has India agreed to a ‘neutral site’ for a dialogue with Pakistan? The prime minister should immediately have a meeting with leaders of all political parties — something he has studiously avoided in the last 20 days,” he said.
Mr Ramesh said the coming months would ‘demand both painstaking diplomacy and a collective resolve’. “One-liners and dialogue-baazi are poor substitutes,” he said, “.
Congress MP Randeep Singh Surjewala earlier also sought to know if the ceasefire with Pakistan was on the basis of mediation by the US.
“Isn’t the Modi government aware that the US president, Mr Donald Trump has issued a statement expressing mediation to solve the Kashmir issue? Is the Modi government going to allow a third-party mediation in Kashmir in absolute derogation of India’s stated policy? If not, why has PM Modi not controverted the same?”
Special session of parliament
Also, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary M.A. Baby reiterated the opposition’s call for a special session of parliament and said the ceasefire announcement by Trump before any Indian official could declare it “has raised serious concerns”.
“It is an avowedly accepted policy of our country that we settle our disputes bilaterally, without allowing any third-party intervention. Therefore, this situation requires clear and authoritative clarification from the highest levels,” he wrote.
Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj Kumar Jha demanded that Modi government make a statement for the US about not undermining India’s stated policy as well as denying Trump’s claim about the mention of trade being stopped.
“The kind of language he [Trump] chose, hits us Indians. I would request the prime minister that you have the country’s mandate, you should give a stern message to the US.”
All India Majlis-i-Ittehadul Musli­meen MP Asaduddin Owaisi said, “We have always been opposed to third party intervention since Simla (1972). Why have we now accepted it? I hope the Kashmir issue will not be internationalised, as it is our internal matter. Why are we agreeing to talk on neutral territory? What will be the agenda of these talks?” He also asked if Indian government’s goal was to get a Trump-brokered ceasefire.

According to Sardar Waheed Khan, Director General of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), the financial assistance was being provided under the AJK Ceasefire Line Incidents Relief (Amendment) Act 2019 to civilians affected by cross-border hostilities.
The compensation included Rs1 million for each martyr, Rs800,000 for those permanently disabled, Rs300,000 for the seriously injured, and Rs50,000 for individuals with minor injuries, he said.
In addition, affected properties and livestock were covered under the package, which provided Rs100,000 for the complete destruction of a house, Rs60,000 for partially damaged houses, Rs50,000 for fully damaged shops, Rs30,000 for partially damaged shops, Rs100,000 for damaged vehicles, Rs50,000 for small vehicles, Rs50,000 for shelters, and Rs100,000 for the loss of cattle such as cows or buffaloes.
 
 

Mr Khan said Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq visited many affected areas to meet victims and assess the scale of damage.
Acting on the prime minister’s directions, compensation cheques of Rs1 million were delivered to the families of martyrs by the divisional and district administrations concerned, accompanied by elected representatives who visited each household.
He added that medical compensation for the injured had also commenced following the submission of medical reports, with the remaining payments expected to be completed within the next couple of days.
To evaluate property damage, Mr Khan said the AJK Board of Revenue had formed assessment committees at the sub-divisional level.
Each committee comprised the assistant commissioner, deputy superintendent of police, civil medical officer, a project manager from the local government and rural development department or assistant engineer from the physical planning and housing department, a representative of the local army unit, and the area tehsildar.
These committees were tasked with submitting their reports to the respective deputy commissioners within two weeks, following which compensation would be disbursed in line with official procedures.
Mr Khan also revealed that the federal government had announced its intention to extend compensation to civilian martyrs, injured persons, and those whose homes had been damaged.
A formal notification in this regard was expected soon from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), he said.
 
 

Responding to a question by Dawn, Mr Khan confirmed that the LoC had remained calm for more than 36 hours.
Of the border residents who had relocated on their own to safer areas, he said most of them had since returned. However, those evacuated under official arrangements were yet to be repatriated.
“We will wait another day or two before moving them back to their homes in the most vulnerable locations,” he said.
Tourists welcome in Neelum Valley
Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner Neelum, Nadeem Ahmed Janjua, told Dawn that the temporary ban on the entry of tourists into the valley — imposed in the interest of public safety — had been lifted in view of the improving situation.
“Visitors are now welcome to explore and enjoy the serenity of Neelum Valley without fear,” he said.
However, he advised both tourists and locals to avoid touching any suspicious device or object and to immediately alert the nearest police station as a national duty.

• FO says will closely monitor Indian actions, take necessary measures to preserve rights under Indus treaty
• Security forces jam, seize ‘Indian surveillance drone’ in Lahore
ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Tuesday said it rem­ai­ned committed to the current ceasefire understanding with India, but any fut­ure aggression will be met with full resolve, as the Foreign Office lambasted a provocative spe­ech delivered by the Indian prime minister on May 12.
A statement issued by the Foreign Office said that Pakistan rejected “the provocative and infla­mmatory assertions” made by the Indian premier, and the remarks were “a dangerous escalation rooted in misinformation, political opportunism, and a blatant disregard for international law”.
In his speech, PM Modi had accused Pakistan of retaliating with strikes on Indian military and civilian targets, claiming that India’s air defence systems repelled the attacks and inflicted significant losses on Pakistan. He also said Pakistan requested a ceasefire through military channels on May 10 after its ‘failed’ retaliation. India accepted the ceasefire conditionally, PM Modi said, warning that future Indian responses would depend on Pakistan’s behaviour.
Pakistan dismissed this portrayal as “yet another blatant lie” and said that the ceasefire was achieved “as a result of the facilitation of several friendly countries” and any claim to the contrary was “misinformation and propaganda”.
 
 

In light of the ceasefire, the two sides are hammering out its operational details. The first post-ceasefire contact between the heads of military operations from the two countries resulted in an understanding that the two sides would uphold the truce and reduce troop deployment along the international border. Another round is expected soon.
The FO said the Pahal­gam incident was used as a pretext to attack Pakis­tan, “justify military adv­e­n­turism, serve domestic political objectives… and reinforce a manufactured narrative of a perpetual external threat”.
“After the unlawful and unprovoked Indian aggression…India recklessly provoked the situation further by targeting Pakistan’s military bases, risking an uncontrollable escalatory spiral,” the statement said, adding that the Indian actions brought the entire region to the brink of disaster. Pakistan accused India of “justifying the cold-blooded murder of innocent civilians… as the ‘new normal’ for the region”.
According to the statement, Pakistan will monitor Indian actions in the coming days and it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty. “Make no mistake, we will closely monitor India’s actions and behaviour in this regard in the coming days. We also urge the international community to do the same,” it said.
In response to India’s allegations of terrorism sponsorship, Pakistan said, “We are a victim of terrorism, being directly sponsored by India. … Our contributions and sacrifices in the global fight against terrorism are well known.”
The statement also condemned India’s unilateral actions, citing New Delhi’s violation of the Indus Waters Treaty. “Pakistan will take all necessary measures to preserve its rights under the treaty,” it said.
While alluding to the unilateral suspension of Indus Waters Treaty, the Indian premier had said, “India’s stand is very clear… Terror and talks cannot go together… Terror and trade cannot go together…. Water and blood cannot flow together.”
PM Modi, in his speech, declared that India would not tolerate “nuclear blackmail or state-sponsored terrorism,” announcing a new policy that rules out dialogue with Pakistan outside the context of terrorism and Azad Kashmir.
 
 

The Foreign Office countered, saying, “Peace is the true strength. The world is not served by theatrical militarism and grandstanding but by mature leadership, regional cooperation, and respect for international norms.”
The statement reaffirmed Islamabad’s support for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.
“Pakistan is a sovereign nation with resilient institutions, a committed populace, and a globally recognized role in maintaining peace and security,” the Foreign Office said. “Our commitment to peace must never be mistaken for weakness. Any future aggression will also be met with full resolve.”
Indian Ministry of External Affairs, in its reaction to FO statement, said, “The terrorist infrastructure sites that India destroyed were responsible not only for the deaths of Indians but of many other innocents around the world. There is now a new normal. The sooner Pakistan gets used to it, the better.”
Meanwhile, an Indian drone was spotted in Lahore by the security forces, who brought it down near the Lahore airport by using the GPS jamming technology.  Sources in the law enforcement agencies said it was an “Indian surveillance drone” which was launched by the neighbouring country after the ceasefire agreement.

The military confrontations between the two nations last week provided just a small glimpse into the destruction that can be unleashed on both sides of the border in the event of an all-out war. The American president, who brokered a ceasefire between the two, has remarked that his administration helped prevent a nuclear exchange.
 
 

If hostilities had reached that point, the leaderships of India and Pakistan would have failed their most fundamental duty: to prevent catastrophe. As nuclear nations, both countries have a duty to wield their powers with utmost responsibility and immense restraint. It is in the strategic interest of both nations to avoid all-out war, and ceasefires are not concessions but necessary steps to prevent irreparable damage.
The Indian government’s decision to escalate hostilities by striking mainland Pakistan was dangerously provocative and must be seen as a grave miscalculation. Matters were not helped by the gleeful cheerleading for the ensuing violence by the media on both sides of the border. The pressure to attack and counter-attack kept growing, till, it seems, both countries were ready to launch full-scale hostilities against each other. In retrospect, the region narrowly avoided calamity: we are now being told we were on the brink of a nuclear war. Citizens of both countries need to understand what that would have entailed.
 
 

Should nuclear weapons ever be used, the consequences would be catastrophic beyond imagination. For all those who survive, the fallout will guarantee a life of unimaginable misery. Within hours, a region with millennia of shared history, culture and civilisation would be reduced to rubble. Major cities on both sides would be annihilated. The bombs would spare no one: men and women, young and old.
Over the following week, tens of millions more will die from their injuries or radiation sickness. Disease and starvation on a cataclysmic scale will follow as the subcontinent’s health and food supply infrastructure collapses. The effects will not be confined to this region alone: the bombs and the ensuing fires will release dangerous and radioactive pollutants in the air, which will circulate around the world, triggering a ‘nuclear winter’ and decimating agricultural output. Billions more would be at risk of famine.
The issues between the two countries seem manageable in comparison. Perhaps it is wiser and simpler to work on them than to risk the end of the world. International diplomacy may have halted escalation in this instance, but durable peace can only come from the political will and wisdom of leaders in both India and Pakistan. That responsibility cannot be outsourced.

IHC Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas issued the order on Mr Hasan’s petition challenging the government’s move to place him on the  PCL. The judgement highlighted loopholes in the current mechanism of adding citizens to travel restriction lists like the Provisional National Immigration List (PNIL) and Passport Control List (PCL) and Exit Control List (ECL).
The court found the decision to restrict Mr Hasan’s movement was made without the requisite approval from the cabinet, as mandated by the Supreme Court.
The decision was made solely by the Immigration & Passports director general, allegedly based on an FIA report. The court noted such unilateral decisions without the cabinet’s involvement or judicial scrutiny were a “recipe for abuse, especially in politically sensitive cases”.
Under the law, the “government” means the cabinet, not individual officials or departments. “This oversight rendered the restriction legally void.”
Mr Hasan’s name was placed on the no-fly list “without giving him a notice or opportunity to be heard”, violating the principles of justice and due process.
The government justified its action, saying an FIR was pending against Mr Hasan under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016. However, the court ruled that the criminal case does not warrant inclusion on the no-fly list, particularly when the accused is on bail and cooperating with the legal process.
In an identical judgement, IHC’s Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro also directed the removal of PTI leader Imran Khan’s sister’s name from the PCL and the PNIL.
Ms Khan had approached the court to challenge the inclusion of her name in the travel ban lists.
The court allowed Ms Khan to seek permission to travel abroad by approaching the relevant trial court handling the cases registered against her.

Speaking at the Saudi-US investment forum in Riyadh, President Trump highlighted his role in brokering the weekend ceasefire between the two South Asian rivals and urged them to build on this breakthrough.
“I said, ‘fellas, come on, let’s make a deal. Let’s do some trading. Let’s not trade nuclear missiles, let’s trade the things that you make so beautifully’,” Trump said, without clarifying which Indian or Pakistani leaders he had spoken to or when.
“They’re actually getting along. Maybe we can even get them together, Marco, where they go out and have a nice dinner together,” he said while addressing his Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who accompanied him to Saudi Arabia.

Development comes hours after Trump urges both nations to ‘go out to dinner’ together to resolve their disputes

In Washington, the State Department’s Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Piggott told reporters that the United States was now focused on encouraging direct engagement between the two countries.
“We welcome the ceasefire reached between India and Pakistan this weekend and we commend both prime ministers for choosing the path of peace,” said Piggott. “We also want to encourage direct communication between the parties.”
 
 

When asked whether Pakistan had given any commitments on ‘stopping terrorist activities’ that India accuses it of indulging in, Piggott declined to comment, but reiterated Washington’s support for dialogue.
Islamabad categorically rejects such allegations as unfounded and blames India for using them as an excuse to justify its aggression against Pakistan.
“We have been clear on that. We continue to encourage that direct communication,” Piggott said. “The president has been clear on that and the president has also been in praising both prime ministers for choosing the path for peace and wisdom.”
Responding to a question about the US reaction to India’s refusal to accept a US role in the peace process, Piggott said: “I am not going to speculate on that. What I can say is that we encourage direct communication.”
Asked if the US had sent a team to Pakistan following media reports about radiation leaks from some secure nuclear facilities in Pakistan, Piggott replied, “I have nothing to preview on that this time.”
When pressed on whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attitude was disappointing for Washington, the spokesperson avoided criticism. “What we are happy to see is a ceasefire. That’s what we are happy to see. That’s where our focus remains. We want to see the ceasefire maintained and we want to encourage direct communication,” he said.
“Our focus is the ceasefire. Our focus is on encouraging direct communication. That’s where our focus is going to remain. The president has spoken on this.”
Piggott was also asked whether President Trump would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if he helped resolve the Kashmir dispute.
“The president is a peacemaker. He values peace. He is also a dealmaker. And he has shown that again, and again, and again,” Piggott responded. “When it comes to solving conflicts, the president wants to solve the conflicts where he can. Stands ready to help.”

• Israeli strike kills another journalist
CAIRO: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military would enter the besieged enclave “with full force” in the coming days, vowing not to stop the war.
A statement from the office of Israeli PM Netanyahu on Tuesday said, “In the very coming days, we are going in with full force to complete the operation.”
“Completing the operation means defeating Hamas. It means destroying Hamas,” Netanyahu said during a meeting with injured reserve soldiers in his office late Monday.
“There will be no situation where we stop the war. A temporary ceasefire might happen, but we are going all the way,” he added.
Israel resumed major operations across Gaza on March 18 amid a deadlock over how to proceed with a January 19 ceasefire that had largely halted the war with Hamas.
Earlier this month, Israel’s government approved plans to expand its Gaza offensive, with officials talking of retaining a long-term presence there.
During the meeting with soldiers, Netanyahu said Israel was working to find countries that may be willing to take in Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.
“We’ve set up an administration that will allow them (Gaza residents) to leave but… we need countries willing to take them in. That’s what we’re working on right now,” he said.
Journalist killed
An Israeli airstrike on the Gaza Strip on Tuesday killed a well-known Palestinian journalist who it accused of working with Hamas and was recovering in hospital from an earlier strike, the territory’s health ministry said.
Israel accused the journalist, Hassan Aslih, who has hundreds of thousands of followers on social media platforms, of taking part in the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas.
It said Aslih had documented and uploaded footage of “looting, arson and murder” during the incursion into Israel.
Ahmed Siyyam, a Gaza civil emergency service member, told Reuters the attack hit the third floor of a Nasser Hospital building in the southern city of Khan Younis. Dozens of patients and injured were also being treated at the hospital.
Two patients, including Aslih, were killed and several others were wounded, the health ministry said.
Israel’s military said in a statement it struck Hamas members operating from within a “command and control centre” located at the hospital. It didn’t name them.
Reuters footage showed heavy damage to one of the hospital buildings, including the medical equipment and beds inside.
According to the International Federation of Journalists, at least 160 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since October 2023.
Officials in Gaza put the number at 215, and accuse Israel of deliberately targeting journalists. Israel denies targeting journalists and says it tries to avoid harm to civilians.
Aslih headed the Alam24 news outlet and worked as a freelance photojournalist. He was wounded last month in a deadly strike on a tent in the Nasser hospital compound.
Some 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken prisoner in the October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel’s response has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and destroyed much of the enclave. A blockade on aid supplies since March 2 has left the population at critical risk of famine, according to a UN-backed monitor.
A senior World Health Organisation official warned on Tuesday that hunger and malnutrition could have a lasting impact on “an entire generation”.

The deputy prime minister, in an interview with CNN, said Pakistan had no choice but to launch strikes in self-defence following cross-border stri­kes by India on May 7.
Terming India’s strikes “war and a wishful attempt to establish its hegemony in Kashmir,” Mr Dar said Pakistan was “very sure that our conventional capa­city and capabilities are str­ong enough” to beat Ind­ian ground and air forces.
Deputy PM Dar said there was no direct contact between Indian and Pakistani officials before US intervention, contradicting a previous assertion made by India that Pakistan’s director general of military operations contacted his counterpart with an offer for talks.
When asked how the cea­sefire deal was rea­ched, the foreign minister said Pakistan’s “counter-escalation” brought world powers into the picture.
 
 

After Pakistan’s strikes on May 10, Mr Dar said, “[C]ertain capitals, particularly the  US, realised it could be a really filthy next move.”
He claimed to have received a call from Mr Rubio, who had talked to India’s external affairs minister, S. Jaishankar.
“[Mr Rubio] said India is ready to stop it now … Would you be willing? I said of course …  if India does not restart [escalations] we would not do it.”
“[The Indians] had seen what happened in the sky. They could see how serious the damage was,” he said while talking about possible reasons for India’s agreement for ceasfire.
Negotiations
Mr Dar said Pakistan was looking forward to establishing a path for long-term peace and security that would provide dignity for both sides.
Calling Kashmir the root cause of this regional instability, Mr Dar called for granting the self-determination right to the Kashmir people. He reiterated that Pakistan was not behind last month’s attack in Pahalgam, saying, “We condemn terrorism in all forms and all manifestations”.
On negotiations with India to resolve longstanding issues, Mr Dar said talks between the countries were yet to begin. “We still hope sense will prevail,” he said, adding it was in the “interest of everybody” not to delay or to leave such issues “beyond a certain reasonable time”.
He warned the cease­fire could be threatened if the water issue was not resolved. “Failure to resolve the water issue will amount to an act of war.”
Separately, Information Minister  Attaullah Tarar told Sky News that India had not yet stopped the flow of water to Pakistan after New Delhi unilaterally held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance after the Pahalgam attack .
He said India lacked the capacity to stop the water from flowing in three western rivers given to Pakistan as part of the treaty.
“At present, the flow of water was continuing as usual,” the minister said in the interview aired on Tuesday.
Strategic success
He remarked that the ceasefire between Pakistan and India was a result of the diplomatic efforts of various countries.
He said the ceasefire was not a weakness of Pakistan but a “strategic success”. “India was not in a position to bear further tension.”
Mr Tarar welcomed President Trump’s desire to resolve the Kashmir dispute, calling it a “good sign”. He said India accused Pakistan of being invovled in the Pahalgam attack without evidence. However, India “failed miserably” in linking the attack to Pakistan.
The attack, which took place in the presence of “around 700,000 Indian troops” in occupied Kashmir, was a “security and intelligence failure”, he added.
Mr Tarar reiterated Pakistan’s sacrifices in the war against terrorism, saying operations against terrorists were still ongoing on the western borders.
The minister denied any “safe havens” for terrorist groups inside Pakistan.

The diplomatic tit-for-tat began with India declaring a Pakistani official posted at its High Commission in New Delhi persona non grata, accusing him of engaging in activities “not in keeping with his official status”. The official was ordered to leave the country within 24 hours, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a brief statement.
India’s move followed the arrest of two individuals in Indian Punjab on Sunday, who were allegedly involved in leaking sensitive military information to a purported Pakistani handler. According to Punjab Police, one of the suspects had been passing details about Indian Army movements,  reportedly under the direction of an official linked to the Pakistani mission in Delhi.
The chargé d’affaires of the Pakistan High Commission was summoned and handed a formal demarche regarding the expulsion. Later the same evening, Pakistan responded in kind by expelling an Indian High Commission official,  identified as Shankar Reddy Chintala. The Foreign Office stated that the official had been “found involved in espionage in violation of his privileged status”.
In its statement, the Foreign Office said the  Indian diplomat had been declared persona non grata and was instructed —  along with his family — to leave Pakistan within 24 hours. The Indian  chargé d’affaires was summoned and handed a demarche expressing  Pakistan’s strong protest against what it called “undesirable  activities”.
The FO also reminded the Indian mission to ensure  that its staff adheres to diplomatic norms and does not engage in  conduct incompatible with their diplomatic status. The expulsions mark a  sharp deterioration in already fraught relations, coming on the heels of  military clashes and accusations of ceasefire violations and  cross-border strikes.

The Saudis escorted Air Force One into the kingdom with fighter jets before bringing out long-stretching guards of honour and sending flag-waving cavalry to accompany Trump’s motorcade to the palace.
Under imposing chandeliers, Trump welcomed a promise by Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, for $600 billion in investment and quipped that it should be $1 trillion.
 


“We have the biggest business leaders in the world here today, and they’re going to walk away with a lot of cheques,” Trump told the prince.
For “the United States, it’s probably two million jobs that we’re talking about”, Trump said.
The White House said that Saudi Arabia would buy nearly $142bn in weapons in what it described as the largest-ever weapons deal, although Trump in his first term trumpeted a larger, longer-term figure.
The White House said that Saudi company DataVolt will invest $20bn in artificial intelligence-related sites in the United States, while tech firms including Google will invest in both countries — welcome news for Saudi Arabia, which has long faced restrictions in US advanced technology.
With cameras rolling, a lengthy procession of Saudi royalty and business figures waited their turn to shake hands with Trump and the crown prince, including Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and a close adviser to Trump, who made a rare appearance in a suit.

The US leader will head later in the week to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, fellow oil-rich Arab monarchies with long-standing ties to the United States — and to Trump.
In choosing the Gulf for his first major tour, the 78-year-old billionaire is again bypassing traditional presidential stops among Western allies, some of which have been unnerved by his norms-shattering diplomacy.
Eight years ago, Trump also chose Saudi Arabia for his first overseas trip, when he posed with a glowing orb and participated in a sword dance.
 


Saudis seek image change
Trump’s embrace of the Saudis contrasts with a more hesitant initial approach by former president Joe Biden, who had vowed to punish the crown prince after US intelligence found that he ordered the murder of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.
Trump reminisced with the 39-year-old crown prince over their first meeting, saying he was “so impressed with this young guy who was very wise beyond his years”.
Since Khashoggi’s gruesome killing, Saudi Arabia has worked aggressively to change its image, from easing restrictions on women to diversifying from oil to new areas such as artificial intelligence.
The country has also increasingly exercised diplomatic clout, serving as a venue for the United States to pursue talks with Ukraine and Russia.
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have also sought outsized international roles, with the Qataris serving as a mediator along with the United States and Egypt in the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Jon Alterman, senior vice president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said that for Trump, the Gulf “is his happy place”.
The leaders will “flatter him and not criticise him. And they’ll treat his family members as past and future business partners”, he said.
Israel and Trump at odds over Iran nuclear strategy
Israel is threatening military action against Iran while US President Donald Trump pursues diplomacy, exposing a growing rift between the long-time allies over how to confront the Islamic Republic’s advancing nuclear programme.
As a fourth round of indirect talks between Iran and the US kicked off in Muscat on Sunday, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar emphasised that his country would not allow Tehran, under any circumstances, to develop its nuclear programme.
“The most dangerous regime must not be allowed to obtain the world’s most dangerous weapon,” said Saar.
Like Western countries, Israel suspects its arch foe Iran of wanting to acquire nuclear weapons.
Tehran denies these allegations, defending its right to civilian nuclear energy.
“If military operations are necessary […] so be it,” said Israeli President Isaac Herzog in an interview published this week by the German newspaper Die Welt, while also stating that he wanted to give “dialogue a chance”.
In 2015, Iran and several major powers signed an agreement regulating Tehran’s nuclear development, including uranium enrichment, in exchange for the gradual lifting of sanctions that had been imposed on the country since the mid-2000s.
Military option
However, in 2018, the United States, during Trump’s first term, withdrew from the agreement, rendering the deal largely ineffective.
Since then, Iran has resumed much of its nuclear activities.
The country is now enriching uranium up to 60 per cent, well above the 3.67pc limit set by the agreement, but still below the 90pc threshold required for making nuclear weapons, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since his return to the White House, Trump has initiated new negotiations, which Israel opposes.
Israeli officials have also expressed irritation at another agreement made behind their backs between Washington and Houthi rebels in Yemen.
“Israel insists that the [nuclear] agreement be much more comprehensive [than the one in 2015] and that Iran not be allowed to domestically enrich uranium,” geopolitical analyst Michael Horowitz told AFP.
According to him, Israeli authorities now believe that “Tehran can quickly develop a weapon if it chooses to.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who applauded Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, has emphasised that Israel is prepared to use all means necessary to stop the Islamic Republic from developing its nuclear capacity.
“The deal that truly works is the one that eliminates Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons,” he said in late April, urging for the complete “dismantling” of the nuclear programme.
‘Awkward position’
“There are currently many voices in Israel suggesting that there is a window of opportunity to use military force if necessary,” said Raz Zimmt, director of Iran studies at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv.
According to him, the idea of strikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure is motivated by two factors.
The first being the perception that Iran has been weakened after Israel targeted its defence systems in October 2024.
Secondly, the fact that Hezbollah is also diminished after its conflict with Israel in 2024, and thus “incapable of retaliating” to defend Tehran, its major ally.
Experts interviewed by AFP say that if Israel were to strike Iranian nuclear sites, the United States would likely be expected — at the very least — to be ready to defend Israel in the event of Iranian retaliation.
“A strike with the support or even participation of Washington can be much more effective,” said Horowitz.
“Trump’s positions are putting Israel in an awkward position: he (Netanyahu) doesn’t want to be at odds with the new administration, but he is beginning to understand that Trump wants a deal at all costs.”
Zimmt says, however, that “it is highly unlikely that Netanyahu would oppose Trump” if the latter signed an agreement with Iran.</p><small>2025-05-13 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/131931409acab9d.png?r=194916' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789/in-rare-interview-imrans-sons-call-attention-to-their-fathers-incarceration' target='_blank'><strong>In rare interview, Imran’s sons call attention to their father’s incarceration</strong></a><br><p>In a rare public appearance, former prime minister Imran Khan’s sons — Suleman Khan (28) and Qasim Khan (26) — called attention to their father’s incarceration.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.
 
 

This is the first time the two have publicly talked about their father’s incarceration. They were allowed by a court in November 2023 to contact him every week, but these talks, according to them, have not always been facilitated.
In an interview with X influencer Mario Nawfal on why they chose to speak out now, Qasim said: “We’ve gone through the legal routes. We’ve gone through every route that we thought would potentially get him out. We never thought he would be in there a fraction of how long he’s been in there. And it’s only getting worse. And, so, we’ve somewhat run out of those options. And now we’ve decided the only route of taking action is to come and speak publicly.”
He added: “What we want is international pressure on Pakistan right now, because currently he’s living in inhumane conditions. They’re not giving him basic human rights … They’re not really doing anywhere near enough. And what we want is global pressure.”
On the topic of a lack of success so far through legal channels, Suleman said: “We’ve exhausted other options [and] legal avenues and it’s gone very quiet. It seems, in the international media, it seems to have gone very quiet.”
 


The PTI has frequently complained about Imran’s facilities and has filed several petitions in the Islamabad High Court regarding the issue. On the other hand, the jail administration has refuted the claims.
Questioned about the calls by US official Richard Grenell for their father’s release, Suleman said the two had not had any contact with him so far but were grateful for “all the support he’s shown”.
Regarding a message they had for the Trump administration on the topic, Suleman said: “We’d call for any government that supports free speech and proper democracy to join the call for our father’s release.”
Qasim similarly said he wanted the international community to “look at what’s going and hopefully take action and who better than Trump to gain the attention of.
“We’d love to speak to Trump or try and figure out a way where he would be able to help out in some way. Because, at the end of the day, all we’re trying to do is free our father, bring democracy in Pakistan and just ensure his basic human rights.”
Talking about the toll the situation had had on them, Qasim said “it’s been pretty brutal”.
The brothers claimed their phone calls were set up with their father at odd times with limited duration, adding that the failure to miss the calls “meant going a long time before they could talk to him again.”
They further claimed they spoke to Imran only once every two or three months.
The brothers said they did not want to participate in politics, adding that they had taken permission from Imran before speaking out in the interview.
The two have stayed away from the limelight, with their mother, British journalist and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith, stressing that her sons had nothing to do with Pakistani politics.
In 2022, after anti-PTI protests were held outside her UK residence, she wrote on the former Twitter platform, “[…] I have got nothing to do with Pakistani politics and neither have my children. They are low-key private individuals who are not even on social media.”

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) missed its collection target by nearly Rs831 billion in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, mainly due to a decline in import volume and lower-than-expected inflation, which hit sales tax collections. The tax body collected Rs 2.299 trillion in July-April FY25 against the budgetary target of Rs 10.130tr. On monthly terms, it collected Rs846bn in April against the target of Rs963bn, which indicates a gap of Rs117bn.
The prime minister, chairing a review meeting on broadening the tax base and increasing tax revenue, said that the individuals and sectors capable of paying taxes must be brought into the tax net.
He also instructed the stringent accountability of officers and personnel assisting the tax evaders, according to a statement by the PM Office.
The meeting was informed that the tax revenue target equivalent to 10.6 per cent of GDP would be attained as a result of reforms in the FBR.
The prime minister lauded the efforts of the government’s economic team for swiftly heading towards achieving the FBR’s revenue targets for the current fiscal year. He said that expanding the tax net was the government’s priority to reduce the tax burden on the common man by lowering their tax rates.
The prime minister directed officials to complete the digital monitoring of cement and other sectors by next month. Besides, the efforts to increase tax revenue from the tobacco sector should be accelerated in collaboration with the provinces, PM Shehbaz said.
He directed that pending tax-related cases should be pursued effectively to ensure the recovery of the nation’s money. While calling for collective efforts for the country’s development, he said the national economy was stable and moving towards growth.
The participants were informed that the complete implementation of the Track and Trace System at cement plants nationwide led to a significant increase of billions of rupees in tax revenue. With the implementation of this system in the sugar industry, tax revenue increased by 35pc from November 2024 to April 2025.
It must be noted that the International Monetary Fund has revised the FBR revenue collection target for FY25, decreasing it to Rs12.333tr from Rs12.913tr, marking a reduction of Rs580bn.  The shortfall is primarily attributed to reduced import tax collection, sluggish manufacturing growth and unexpectedly low inflation, which has dropped to the lowest single digits in decades.
The FBR paid Rs427bn in refunds to taxpayers in 10MFY25, up 1.18pc from Rs422bn in the same period last year. However, Rs43bn was refunded in April, almost the same amount as last year.
In July-April, income tax collection totalled Rs4.479tr, exceeding the target of Rs4.152tr by Rs327bn. The income tax collection grew 28pc compared to last year`s Rs3.505tr.
The sales tax collection fell short of the target by Rs774bn in 10MFY25, totalling Rs3.174tr against the target of Rs3.948tr. The sales tax collection rose 27pc compared to last year`s Rs2.498tr.
The customs collection also fell short of the projected target by Rs228bn to Rs1.043tr in 10MFY25 against the target of Rs1.271tr. The customs collection recorded a growth of 17pc when compared with last years Rs894bn. The Federal Excise Duty collection fell short of the target by Rs156bn to Rs603bn in 10MFY25. The excise duty recorded a growth of 33pc over last years Rs453bn.</p><small>2025-05-13 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/131742452ff63ce.jpg?r=174323' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910779/junaid-akbar-submits-resignation-as-pac-chairman-to-pti' target='_blank'><strong>Junaid Akbar submits resignation as PAC chairman to PTI</strong></a><br><p>PTI MNA Junaid Akbar on Tuesday said he had handed over his resignation as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to the party.
The development came after it emerged that PTI founding chairman Imran Khan had directed Akbar to resign from the position and focus on provincial matters.
In a video statement issued today, Akbar confirmed that he had handed over his resignation to PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, saying that he readily accepted the decision of the party and Imran.
“Whatever the decision of the party and the decision of Imran Khan, I will not think for a moment and will readily accept it,” he said.
Akbar said the position was a responsibility given by the party and he would accept any decision by the PTI founder, including handing over the party presidency or resignation from the assembly.
PTI’s central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, had confirmed to Dawn, that Akbar would step down as PAC chairman. He said Imran had conveyed the message through his sister Aleema Khan during their last meeting and announced that Akbar would be replaced by Omar Ayub Khan. He said Aleema conveyed the message to Salman Akram Raja after coming out of Adiala Jail.
Akbar was elected unopposed as chairman of the PAC in January this year. In the same month, he was appointed by Imran as the president of PTI’s KP chapter, replacing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.
The position had been vacant since the February 2024 general elections, which brought the PML-N government to power. The PAC chairmanship is usually held by the leader of the opposition or their nominee, though there is no legal requirement for this parliamentary tradition.
After the general elections, the PTI made several U-turns over nominating a candidate for the post of PAC chairman. Sher Afzal Marwat was initially nominated, followed by the names of Akram and Omar. Ultimately, Akbar’s name was finalised for the post.</p><small>2025-05-13 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13155538374cb9c.jpg?r=163642' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910767/more-funds-to-be-allocated-for-education-sector-in-upcoming-budget-kp-cm' target='_blank'><strong>More funds to be allocated for education sector in upcoming budget: KP CM</strong></a><br><p>Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ali Amin Gandapur on Tuesday vowed that the provincial government will make education a “top priority” in the upcoming budget and allocate more resources towards the sector, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The chief minister’s concerns follow in the wake of the unexpected textbook shortage in the province which has disrupted classes, high dropout rates, and Pakistan’s “low” ranking in the District Education Performance Index Report 2020-23.
“Presiding over a meeting in Peshawar, he directed measures to enhance teachers’ capacity, ensure 100 per cent merit in new recruitments, and establish schools in rented buildings in areas where they are urgently needed,” the report said.
During the meeting, it was decided that comprehensive and multi-faceted measures would be taken to increase student enrollment in schools. In this regard, schemes would be included in the upcoming budget to support various activities.
“Gandapur expressed concern that in some districts,  the rate of out-of-school children remains alarming, and the declaration of an education emergency is a necessary step to reduce this number and improve enrollment rates,” it added.
The chief minister emphasised strengthening the monitoring system and taking steps to provide missing facilities such as laboratories, examination halls, and other essential infrastructure in existing schools.
During the last two decades, students received books from the provincial government free of charge at the start of the scholastic year in April.  Two years ago, the government decided to deliver only half of the required books as the costs reached over Rs10 billion, directing the schools’ administration to collect old books from the students promoted to the next grades and fulfil the remaining book requirements.
This year, however, a complex situation has emerged in schools as the textbook board claims that it has printed all the books requested by the education department but students and teachers have complained about a shortage of books.
In August last year, an official report placed the country’s education system in the ‘low’ performance category and highlighted critical areas requiring attention to improve education outcomes.</p><small>2025-05-13 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13154757e7e8cd7.jpg?r=161633' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910764/shoaib-malik-steps-down-as-domestic-cricket-mentor-with-love-and-gratitude' target='_blank'><strong>Shoaib Malik steps down as Domestic Cricket Mentor with ‘love and gratitude’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani all-rounder Shoaib Malik announced his resignation from the role of Domestic Cricket Mentor today through a social media post on X.
He submitted his formal resignation to the Pakistan Cricket Board two weeks ago, saying he believed it was “time to move on” to ensure fairness and pay attention to multiple personal and professional responsibilities in his life.
“This was not an easy choice, but after reflecting on my commitments, I realised that juggling multiple responsibilities would prevent me from giving my best — both to Pakistan cricket and to my other professional and personal priorities,” he wrote in his post.
The former skipper added he would continue to serve the role according to his contractual obligations, giving PCB enough time to appoint a new mentor for the next season.
Malik also expressed immense gratitude to PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, the PCB executive team, his former teammate and director of Champions Events Wahab Riaz, the coaching staff at Stallion, and the players who “entrusted him with the opportunity to share his knowledge.”
“Working with some of Pakistan’s most talented cricketers has been an immensely fulfilling experience, one I will always cherish.”
 






Malik has served as the captain of Pakistan cricket from 2007 to 2009. He made his one-day international debut in 1999 by starting his career as an off-break bowler. Eventually, Malik gained a name for being a batting all-rounder.
He appeared in 287 one-day internationals and scored 7,534 runs with nine hundreds. As an off-spinner, he finished with 158 wickets, while he also captained Pakistan in 41 ODIs.
He confirmed his retirement from one-day cricket post-2019 World Cup.</p><small>2025-05-13 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13153339d6c10ad.jpg?r=153433' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910762/bulls-dominate-as-psx-climbs-over-1000-points-upon-boost-in-investor-sentiment' target='_blank'><strong>Bulls dominate as PSX climbs over 1,000 points upon boost in investor sentiment</strong></a><br><p>Bulls maintained a hold of the trading floor at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday as shares gained over 1,000 points, continuing their upward momentum following de-escalation between India and Pakistan.

Finally, the index closed at 118,575.88 points, up 1.09pc or 1278.15 points compared to yesterday.
A day earlier, the PSX gained a record 9pc, with the market mirroring the restored calm in the region after the Pakistan-India ceasefire. The development, announced by US President Donald Trump on Saturday, followed four days of tit-for-tat strikes between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as well as diplomacy and pressure from Washington.
Commenting on today’s surge, Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities said: “Investor sentiment, initially lifted by the ceasefire, has been further boosted by Trump’s announcement to promote trade with both India and Pakistan.”
“Energy stocks are gaining on expectations of a Rs1.5 trillion injection linked to the resolution of the circular debt. However, the market has yet to price in the potential impact of the International Monetary Fund tranche release and a policy rate cut to below 12pc,” he commented.
Yousuf M Farooq, research director at Chase Securities, also said that the market was factoring in improved macroeconomic indicators, lower interest rates and the potential reduction in super tax which would like boost corporate earning across the board.
“With economic stability returning, the market’s price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is expected to gradually rerate to reflect these positive developments,” he added.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also concurred that the market performed well in continuation of Monday.
“Ceasefire, lower interest rate, IMF board approval, better corporate result expectations and a favourable budget expectation are driving market sentiment,” he said.</p><small>2025-05-13 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13134024fd253ef.jpg?r=135922' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910752/mike-hesson-to-be-pakistan-cricket-mens-team-odis-and-t20s-head-coach' target='_blank'><strong>Mike Hesson to be Pakistan cricket men’s team ODIs and T20s head coach</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has announced the former New Zealand cricketer Mike Hesson as the new white-ball (ODIs and T20 Internationals) head coach of the Pakistan men’s cricket team, according to a press release issued by PCB.
The role was left vacant by Gary Kirsten, who resigned just seven months into the job on October 29 following differences with the PCB. Last year, Aaqib Javed was temporarily handed the responsibility as Pakis­tan’s white-ball head coach until next year’s ICC Champions Trophy.
 


PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi took to X to welcome the new coach, saying
“After evaluation of numerous applications received against the vacancy, I’m pleased to announce that former New Zealand cricketer and renowned coach, Mike Hesson, will join us as the new White-ball Head Coach for the Pakistan National Team,” adding that he will join from May 26.
“We look forward to his expertise and guidance in shaping the future of Pakistani cricket,” added Naqvi.
 






Mike Hesson, who is the current head coach of Islamabad United, has previously served as the head coach of New Zealand and Kenya, among other international teams.
Separately, Mohsin Naqvi also welcomed the appointment of Aaqib Javed as the director of high performance. In a post on his X, he shared, “To strengthen our cricket infrastructure, Aaqib Javed joins us as Director of High Performance, complementing Mike Hesson’s appointment as White-ball Head Coach.”
Naqvi hoped that “together, they will play a pivotal role in the evolution and success of Pakistan Cricket.”
 






Aaqib Javed left his Job as the head coach following this year’s ICC Champions Trophy held in February-March.
This comes only a few weeks before Bangladesh’s T20 team is scheduled to tour Pakistan from May 25 for a five-match series.

Notable religious and political leader Senator Prof Sajid Mir passed away at the age of 86 after a heart attack. Mir, the head of Jamiat Ahle Hadith Pakistan, belonged to a suburban area of Punjab’s Sialkot.
Mir was elected as a PML-N senator in 2021, which was his fifth time contesting the Senate election on the party’s ticket. He had also served as a senator from March 2009 to March 2015.
On May 6, PPP’s Syed Waqar Mehdi won the by-election held for the vacant general seat of the Senate from the province of Sindh in Karachi.
The ruling PPP and the opposition MQM-P had nominated Waqar Mehdi and Nighat Mirza, respectively. The PTI did not field any candidate and announced boycotting the polling process as well.

The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan under the banner of Operation Sindoor, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
On Saturday, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), 40 civilians — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.
The martyrs from the Pakistan Army include Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar and Sepoy Nisar, as per the statement.
The martyrs from the Pakistan Air Force include Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.
“Pakistan Armed Forces mounted a resolute response under the banner of Marka-i-Haq, delivering precise and notch-up retributive strikes through Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, stated the ISPR in its statement.
“Their noble sacrifice of martyrs is an enduring symbol of courage, devotion, and unwavering patriotism — etched forever in the nation’s memory,” the statement said. “Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response.”
Paying tribute to the martyred civilians and military personnel, the ISPR offered heartfelt prayers for the recovery of the injured.
“Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response,” the statement read while reaffirming that the nation “remains resolute in the face of aggression.”
PM Shehbaz Sharif has announced that Youm-e-Marka-i-Haq will be observed every year on May 10 on the “magnificent success” of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. Friday, May 16, 2025, will be observed as a day to pay tribute to the armed forces for achieving magnificent success on the defence front and to bow before God in gratitude, he added.</p><small>2025-05-13 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13123634b6b5dbb.jpg?r=124929' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910744/five-students-among-6-injured-in-battagram-school-van-firing' target='_blank'><strong>Five students among 6 injured in Battagram school van firing</strong></a><br><p>An assailant opened fire at a school van injuring six people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Battagram district, police said on Tuesday.
Battagram police spokesperson Gul Nabi told Dawn.com that the school van was coming from the Pirwahari area when it was attacked. “Five students and the van driver were injured in the incident,” he added.
The injured were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital Battagram, he continued, adding that one person, who was in critical condition, was referred to the Ayub Medical Complex Abbottabad.
“A first information report [FIR] was lodged and efforts to arrest the suspect were underway,” Nabi added.
According to Kuzabanda Station House Officer (SHO) Amjid Khan, the suspect’s motive behind the incident was “personal vendetta” against the van driver. “The shooter opened fire, recklessly endangering the lives of the children onboard,” he said.
The president of the Private Education Network (PEN) Battagram chapter, Syed Raqib Shah, condemned the incident and characterised it as an “act of terrorism”.
Shah urged the Battagram district police officer (DPO) to register a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act and apprehend the assailant, warning that failure to do so would prompt a strong reaction from the community.
Last month, a senior civil judge and a lawyer were killed by unknown motorcyclists in Nowshera district.

In a post on X today, Naqvi stated that the league will pick up from where it left. “Let the aura take over as we unite and celebrate the spirit of cricket,” he wrote.
 






Earlier, it was reported that the six PSL franchises have reached out to players, who were flown from the country on a charter flight over the weekend as the cross-border skirmishes with India intensified last week, to return after a ceasefire agreement was reached.
“The franchises are in negotiations with their foreign players regarding the tentative dates of May 17 to 25 with Raw­a­lpindi proposed to be the ve­nue for the remaining matc­hes,” sour­ces told Dawn on Monday.
“As soon as the franchises confirm the availability of the foreign players, the PCB will announce the schedule of the remaining matches after getting the approval from chairman Mohsin Naqvi,” sources added.
With no international cricket during the proposed window, the PCB remains hopeful that the foreign players will return.
However, reports suggested that Australian players might not be open to the idea of returning to Pakistan or India, which also saw its T20 tournament — the Indian Premier League — suspended due to the escalating hostilities.
While most Australian players in both countries left for home, former Australia batter Ricky Ponting — now coach of IPL side Punjab Kings — deboarded his flight home following the ceasefire agreement.</p><small>2025-05-13 06:09</small></div><hr>
