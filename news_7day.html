Here’s why</strong></a><br><p>Despite decades of reform efforts and promises, Pakistan’s governance system fails to deliver. Time and again, ambitious agendas are announced, yet institutions remain marred by entrenched inefficiencies, widespread corruption, bureaucratic inertia, and poor service delivery. One may ask, what is it we keep getting wrong? The problem is, we’ve been looking for answers everywhere but within.
While civil service initiatives have been repeatedly proposed and occasionally implemented, their impact has been diluted by an enduring centralisation of power that resists meaningful change. At the heart of the failures lies an often overlooked truth: no reform can truly succeed without a genuinely empowered, autonomous, robust and constitutionally protected local government system.
The case for local government empowerment
Local governments form the foundation of democratic governance and responsive service delivery. They are uniquely positioned to identify and address the specific needs of communities, provide targeted solutions, and enable direct citizen participation. Yet, in Pakistan, these governments have historically been undermined or co-opted by provincial and federal powers that view decentralisation as a threat rather than an opportunity.
Around the world, decentralised governance has proven its worth. Germany’s decentralised administrative model delegates core services like education and health to local authorities, ensuring responsiveness and efficiency. In Brazil, participatory budgeting, which gives citizens a direct say in local spending, has enhanced transparency and reduced corruption.
 
 

In the Pakistani context, academic research has emphasised the strategic importance of local governance. A landmark study on decentralisation reveals that local government reforms often originated from non-democratic regimes — seeking legitimacy rather than lasting institutional change. However, such reforms, including those under Ayub Khan and Musharraf, lacked permanence due to the absence of constitutional backing and the deep entrenchment of central authority.
The Musharraf model and its lessons
General Pervez Musharraf’s Devolution of Power Plan (2000) remains one of the most ambitious local governance initiatives in Pakistan’s history. Implemented through the Local Government Ordinance (2001), the system introduced a three-tier structure — district, tehsil, and union councils — with elected representatives managing local development, finance, and public services.
Under this system, Citizen Community Boards (CCBs) and Musalihat Anjumans were introduced to institutionalise citizen participation and local dispute resolution. For the first time, bureaucrats were made subordinate to elected officials at the local level. However, the lack of constitutional protection meant that the system was dismantled once Musharraf left power. Post-2008 democratic governments did not hold timely local elections, and provincial governments resisted genuine decentralisation.
Despite its flaws, the Musharraf-era devolution revealed the transformative potential of local governance. District governments took ownership of development planning, citizens were engaged in project selection, and marginalised communities had greater access to public services.
Why civil service reform alone is not enough
Civil service reform typically focuses on merit-based recruitment, performance evaluation, training, and reducing corruption. However, without corresponding decentralisation, these reforms are confined to the upper echelons of governance and rarely affect outcomes at the grassroots level.
The Pakistani civil service remains highly centralised, with officers frequently rotated across provinces and ministries. This practice discourages specialisation and undermines local accountability. Without empowered local governments, even the most efficient bureaucrats cannot address local challenges effectively.
 
 

Moreover, civil servants in Pakistan often operate in a political vacuum — isolated from the constituencies they are meant to serve. This disconnect hampers their ability to respond to local needs and fosters a sense of alienation among citizens. In my recent article for weekly business and economic magazine Profit, I argue how local institutions can play a crucial role in countering extremism. By delivering essential services, creating employment opportunities, and improving community engagement, they can address the root causes of disillusionment — tasks that remote, centralised bureaucracies are ill-equipped to manage.
A comparative perspective
Across the globe, governments are discovering that the path to national progress begins at the local level.
India’s Panchayati Raj system showcases the power of grassroots democracy. Its local government structure mandates regular elections and assigns significant administrative and financial authority to local bodies. The integration of civil servants in this framework ensures accountability, responsiveness, and deeper citizen engagement.
Turkey’s urban governance is another example. Istanbul’s transformation through empowered municipal leadership illustrates how decentralisation can spur urban renewal, infrastructure development, and economic vibrancy.
Estonia’s e-governance revolution demonstrates the potential of digital integration at the local level. By streamlining services and enhancing transparency, it has significantly reduced corruption and increased efficiency. Countries such as Pakistan can draw on this approach to modernise civil services and empower local institutions.
Here’s what must be done
To truly empower citizens and transform governance from the ground up, Pakistan must reimagine and revitalise its local government systems. The foundation lies in granting constitutional safeguards that mandate regular elections and clearly define the authority of local bodies, with the Supreme Court ensuring provincial compliance. A specialised municipal civil service cadre, as seen in India, can infuse professionalism and continuity into local administration. Equally critical is devolution of finances — empowering local governments with control over property taxes, municipal services, and a fair share of national revenue.
Moreover, digitising administration at tehsil and union levels will bring much-needed transparency, while institutionalising public participation and oversight through citizen juries, community boards, and participatory budgeting will make governance more inclusive. Finally, a performance-based bureaucracy — where civil servants are evaluated on service delivery outcomes instead of tenure or connections — can drive a culture of accountability and effectiveness.
Without such bold reforms, Pakistan risks perpetuating a system that keeps power distant from the people it is meant to serve.
 


A holistic approach
These examples highlight that local government empowerment, combined with civil service reform, creates a governance architecture capable of addressing complex societal needs. Pakistan can draw valuable lessons from these experiences to navigate its own reform journey.
Civil service reform in Pakistan cannot — and should not — be pursued in isolation. The country’s administrative challenges are deeply intertwined with its political and governance structures. The absence of empowered local governments has not only hollowed out democratic participation but also undermined the effectiveness of the civil service.
To build a responsive, accountable, and citizen-oriented governance system, Pakistan must embrace a dual-track reform agenda: transforming the civil service while simultaneously devolving power to the grassroots. Only then can we hope to resolve the governance crisis that continues to plague this nation. It is imperative for policymakers, civil society, and international partners to support the cause of local governance — not just as an administrative reform, but as a democratic necessity.</p><small>2025-05-16 05:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/160932217e1778c.jpg?r=093314' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911307/indias-false-pride-stands-shattered-says-pm' target='_blank'><strong>India’s false pride stands shattered, says PM</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that Pakistan’s armed forces had shattered the ‘false hegemony’ of India and made the whole world realise that all states in the region are equal.
The premier again asked India to sit at the table to resolve contentious issues, including Kashmir, through dialogue, without which there will be no guarantee of permanent peace.
Meanwhile, according to a decision announced by the PM, the nation will be observing Youm-i-Tashakur on Friday (today) on the victory of Pakistan in the recent conflict with India.
“You have not only changed the mindset of the world but also the equation in the region and in the world,” the prime minister said while addressing a gathering of Pakistan Air Force officers during a visit to PAF airbase Kamra. He paid the visit to meet the Pakistani pilots who had successfully defended the nation during one of the longest aerial engagements of the 21st century between May 6 and 10.

Shehbaz showers praise on pilots during visit to PAF base

He noted that PAF had established its superiority over India by downing not five but six fighter planes, including three Rafale jets.
“Today I want to tell the nation with pride that you (PAF pilots) have not downed five but six Indian fighter planes,” he added.
He said that Pakistani Shaheens had made history. “Your friends and foes will remember this history forever. You destroyed the enemy and boosted the confidence of your friends,” he added.
He recalled that after the Pahalgam incident, Pakistan had offered a transparent and independent inquiry, but India imposed war on Pakistan and brutally killed innocent citizens. However, Pakistan’s response was vigorous and India will never dare to attack Pakistan again, he added.
The prime minister was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu, and other officials.
PM Shehbaz urged his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to hold dialogue and said: “Your fever of war would have gone, so now talk about peace and you know what are its prerequisites — first you have to give the right of self-determination to the people of Kashmir under the UN resolutions. “Let’s sit together to resolve this issue, otherwise it can ignite the fire anytime in the future,” he added.
Earlier, PM Shehbaz talked to Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev by telephone and conveyed his profound gratitude for resolutely standing with Pakistan during the crisis with India.
President Aliyev warmly congratulated the prime minister on Pakistan’s remarkable success and welcomed the ceasefire.

The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench had taken up petitions filed by five judges of the IHC concerning the seniority dispute and the transfer of three judges to the IHC. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar headed the bench.
“This is unfortunate that the national politics has seeped into the bar politics,” regretted Justice Hasan, adding that this tendency was started by a political party now opposed to the present opposition. The judge bemoaned that this malaise had never been the practice in the past.
While pointing towards senior counsel Hamid Khan, who was representing  the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) and the Lahore Bar  Association (LBA), Justice Hasan observed that it was to his knowledge  that the presidents of both associations were staunch members of a  political party and Mr Khan was also its senator.

Counsel says suo motu on ‘meddling’ still pending, claims it showed weakness of judiciary

He also wondered why  the Islamabad High Court Bar Association had earlier withdrawn their  petitions from the apex court.
Hamid Khan responded that when the judges could not stand extraneous pressures, how could the bars do that?
Referring to the letters written by IHC judges highlighting alleged meddling on the part of the intelligence agencies in the judicial affairs and subsequent hearings by the Supreme Court on a suo motu, the counsel emphasised that had the high court judges not shown courage by writing these letters, the matter would not have ever surfaced. But it is unfortunate that the suo motu case is still pending, which shows weakness on the part of the judiciary, he added.
The counsel said the Supreme Court should have decided the challenges to the 26th Amendment since it has become a roadblock in every other matter.
Hamid Khan also read out excerpts from the letter as well as the reports furnished by different high courts during the suo motu hearing on the letter by the IHC judges.
However, the constitutional bench repeatedly asked the counsel to stick to the constitutional disputes since the suo motu case was still pending before a larger bench. Justice Mazhar said the counsel should have filed an application seeking an early hearing of the suo motu case, if he was so concerned.
Earlier, senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, who was representing the five high court judges, closed his arguments while citing a statement by the five petitioner judges. The bench observed that the statement was irrelevant since the judges were already before the court through their petition.
In the statement, the five judges — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Justice Saman Riaffat Imtiaz — stated that they stood up to be counted in defence of constitutionalism, the rule of law, and judicial independence.
As high court judges, they said they did not seek self-aggrandisement or any personal benefit from the outcome of these proceedings.
“And we have done so in full view of the code of conduct requiring judges not to indulge in avoidable litigation and public controversy. The actions impugned in this petition would not have been intolerable had they merely affected our seniority amongst our peers. They are abhorrent as they constitute commandeering of IHC and demolition of its independence and sanctity before our eyes,” the statement said.
The judges went on to say that they had taken administrative measures to stem the slide in judicial independence and the resultant weakening of fundamental rights and the rule of law. They said their petition was a measure of last resort, as per the statement.
The counsel also left certain points for the constitutional bench to ponder by questioning whether any established mode was available for the transfer of judges from one high court to another and that what should be the best mode to protect the independence of the judiciary as held in previous judgements, like the Sharaf Faridi, Malik Asad Ali and Al-Jehad cases.
The counsel emphasised that the judges would never be independent unless fully insulated from outside pressures, and if a judge who was 16th in seniority was transferred to another high court to become the senior-most judge, then it would destroy the concept of legitimate expectancy of the rest of the judges to become the chief justice.
The counsel also questioned if the constitutional court could take guidance from the practice prevalent in the civil services, but Justice Mazhar reminded that transfer in the civil service was one of the conditions for which no consent was needed.

Had these two documents been embraced in letter and spirit, the recent tensions between Sindh and Punjab need not have occurred. The National Water Policy is an elaborate document that can be used to set the direction of projects in the water sector.
The policy emphatically calls for the implementation of the 1991 accord under the section on ‘Policy objectives’. Regrettably, the accord has been flagrantly violated for more than two decades as the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) resorted to the ingenuity of the three-tier formula since 2003.
The formula has no legal ground, yet it has practically dwarfed the legitimate Water Apportionment Accord. Sindh has already raised its concerns regarding the three-tier formula with the CCI, but the latter has brushed it under the carpet and Irsa continues to distribute water under this unauthorised regime by regularly declaring water shortages in the rivers.
Not only does this contravene the accord, it also defies a key planning principle of the water policy. Under the planning principles of the policy, clause 3.7.1 stipulates that decision-making on activities related to the water sector will be participatory and consultative at each level. This principle endorses a recent CCI decision on the canals project, in which consensus and mutual understanding have been set as the guiding principles for resolving all conflicts on water resources.
Endorsing the position of Sindh, the policy unambiguously recognises the rights of the lower riparian in the section on ‘Basin level planning for development of water resources’. Clause 5.2 of the water policy reads “the rights on sharing of water including the rights of lower riparian shall be scrupulously respected and followed in accordance with 1991 WAA [Water Apportionment Accord]”.

The National Water Policy can set the direction.

Sindh’s objections to the canals project were in line with this provision of the policy. Sindh is concerned that massive upstream diversion can deprive the province of its rightful share of water that has already been squeezed due to the three-tier formula. The principle of the priority right of the lower riparian on the Indus basin waters was also recognised in the 1945 water accord between Sindh and Punjab. The landmark accord was unfairly set aside after Partition and the deviation set in motion a series of breaches on the water rights of Sindh.
Conservation and efficiency are two important pillars of the policy. Under ‘Planning principles’, the policy reads “efficiency and conservation will be promoted at all levels”. Under strategic priority 3.1, the policy diagnoses the root causes of water scarcity, revealing over 50 per cent of canal water that is diverted from the Indus system does not reach the farm level. Clause 28.2 of the policy elaborates “of the 104.0 [million acre feet] of annual canal diversion, only 58.3 MAF reaches the farm-gate, while remaining 46.7 MAF seeps into the ground water”. As a remedy, it recommends a crash programme for lining the water courses to reduce seepage by at least one-third.
The policy sets a quantified target for 2030 to reduce 33 per cent of the 46 MAF river flows that are lost. Aligned with the same objective, clause 10.2 of the policy recommends a “more crop per drop” approach, and augm­enting the effici­ency of water use by at lea­st 30pc by adopting water-efficient irrigation methods.
 
 

Echoing a key concern of Sindh, the policy also identifies sea intrusion as a major cause of degradation of the Indus delta. In clause 8.1.5, the menace of sea intrusion has been identified as the reason why coastal agriculture, mangroves and fisheries are adversely affected. Section 20.5 of the policy admits that seawater intrusion poses serious threats to coastal agriculture and about two million acres of land have already been lost to this danger in Thatta, Badin and Sujawal districts of coastal Sindh.
A frequently dismissed demand of environmental flows has been recognised in clause 6.1 of the policy. It aptly prescribes “environmental flows” to be “ensured in the rivers to maintain a sound environment for the conservation of the river ecology, morphology, delta and coastal ecosystem and fisheries”.
The policy provides a roadmap for prudently planning water as a shared resource and an asset for future generations. This can be made possible by sticking to the principle of fair distribution and collective ownership of our rivers.

“It is true that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke to PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, and the chairman later informed Imran Khan about it. However, the call was solely related to the current tensions with India and had nothing to do with political negotiations,” PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram told Dawn.
Mr Akram added, “I spoke to Mr Gohar, and he confirmed that no offer for negotiations was made during the call, nor did he convey any such message to Imran Khan.”
Media reports have suggested that PM Shehbaz had extended an invitation for talks to PTI and that Imran Khan had not only accepted the offer but also instructed Mr Gohar to proceed, albeit with a condition to keep the process out of the media spotlight.

Gohar says former premier ‘will never strike a deal’

According to party sources, it was correct that talks couldn’t be held during media presence. “In the past, we tried to hold talks with the government and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, but because of the speculations by the media, the talks could not reach a logical end. However, no such offer has been made at the moment,” a party official said.
Sources claimed that during the meeting between Mr Khan and Mr Gohar, other people, including Salman Safdar and Zaheer Abbas, were also present, making it implausible for confidential matters such as negotiations to be discussed.
Mr Gohar also rejected any such development. Talking to media persons, he said that no deal was made with anyone regarding Imran Khan’s case.
“No such deal has been made. However, I believe that political issues should be addressed through dialogue. Khan Sahib’s sons Kasim and Sulaiman have also said that no deal has been made. Both sons are aware of the issues and are in contact with their father,” he said.
Replying to questions, Mr Gohar said the prime minister had given an offer for negotiations on the floor of the house, and Mr Gohar had welcomed it.
“I said that we would ask Khan Sahib and the party, and then we will be able to reply. I have never shared Khan Sahib’s talks with anyone on the record or even off the record,” he said.
He said that both sons of Imran Khan gave a very good interview and shared whatever was in their hearts. “They are very close to their father and are in contact with him,” he said.
Mr Gohar insisted that Imran Khan “will never make a deal and will never be broken”.

An IHC division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfaraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif directed the case be fixed for hearing next week following a request by senior lawyer Sardar Latif Khosa.
The courtroom witnessed the presence of a high-profile legal team of the PTI, including Salman Akram Raja, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, Niazullah Khan Niazi and Shoaib Shaheen, as well as PTI leaders Aleema Khan, Asad Qaiser, Shandana Gulzar, Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry and Nadia Khattak.
An accountability court in Islamabad had sentenced the former prime minister and Bushra Bibi to 14 and seven years in prison, respectively, on Jan 17 this year.

Directs case be fixed for hearing next week

In their appeal against the conviction, the former prime minister’s legal team highlighted significant procedural irregularities, withholding of key evidence, and political victimisation.
The defence pointed to a November 2021 judgement from the UK Court of Appeal which, they argued, clearly established that the disputed £190 million was not proceeds of crime.
 
 

The funds, part of a settlement between the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and property tycoon Malik Riaz Hussain, were to be transferred to the Supreme Court under a legally binding arrangement.
The appeal criticised NAB for failing to produce witnesses from the NCA or present credible documentation to establish the wrongdoing.
The defence also challenged the authenticity of a “confidentiality deed” presented by NAB, describing it as unverified and unsupported by forensic validation. Lawyers argued that the deed was procedural in nature and not indicative of any criminal activity.
Mr Khan’s petition said there was no evidence of personal financial gain and that the funds in question were deposited into the Al-Qadir University Trust — a legally registered entity for educational purposes.
“The prosecution’s own evidence confirms that no donations or monetary benefits were received personally by Mr Khan or his wife,” the appeal stated.
Furthermore, the petition accused NAB of a politically motivated investigation, highlighting the selective targeting of the PTI founder while omitting six other implicated individuals.
Bushra Bibi, who is serving a seven-year sentence in the same case, filed a separate appeal saying that the case against her lacked credible evidence and it was rooted in a political vendetta.
Her legal team referenced the testimony of the Chief Financial Officer (PW-5) of Al-Qadir Trust, who reportedly confirmed that neither she nor her husband gained any financial advantage from the Trust.
Later, talking to journalists outside the courtroom, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar confirmed that Barrister Gohar Ali Khan recently held a meeting with the party’s founder. The development comes amid growing speculation about possible negotiations between PTI and the government.
Barrister Zafar acknowledged there has been media buzz regarding the PTI founder’s openness to dialogue. However, he clarified that Barrister Gohar has neither confirmed nor denied reports of potential talks, stressing that any communication with the PTI founder remains confidential.
“The matter has not yet been discussed in our core committee,” Mr Zafar said. “Imran Khan, the founder of PTI, has consistently maintained that the current government is not legitimate. Any decisions or directions regarding negotiations will be made only after clear instructions are received from both Barrister Gohar and the party founder.”
Mr Zafar reiterated that PTI remains united for Pakistan and it is open to dialogue, but any formal talks will depend entirely on the directives of the party’s top leadership.
“If the PTI founder instructs us to engage in talks, then we will move forward accordingly,” he said.
Aleema Khan, the sister of Imran Khan, on the other hand, strongly rejected reports suggesting her brother has agreed to initiate talks with the government. Speaking to the media outside the Islamabad High Court, she said such claims were baseless and fabricated.
“I don’t understand where this news came from,” she said, referring to the alleged backchannel negotiations.

It has held it ‘in abeyance’ which is neither a technical nor a legal term in the treaty. The announcement represents a belligerent political action rather than a legal decision. Pakistan’s response therefore has to be primarily crafted in the political realm. The present status has left the door open for the treaty’s rehabilitation. Can Pakistan provide the Modi government a diplomatic opening, or a fig leaf, to engage in a meaningful process to preserve the treaty?
In the immediate term, India will not get extra water, nor will freshwater flows to Pakistan diminish. The engagement process therefore needs a long view. Since maintaining the treaty offers greater advantages to both nations, how can they look back and draw some lessons for future water relations within and outside the treaty?
India’s April 24 letter to Pakistan argued that fundamental changes in circumstances necessitated reassessment of treaty obligations. These changes include altered population demographics, clean energy development imperatives, and cross-border terrorism allegedly impeding India’s full utilisation of treaty rights. For precisely these reasons, the two countries need the treaty more than ever before. None of the listed issues can be addressed unilaterally by either side.
Regrettably, these issues were never formally raised by India in the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC) meetings. The negotiators from India and Pakistan, predominantly civil engineers, failed to recognise that climate change was altering the Indus basin hydrology, creating challenges beyond the treaty’s original scope. They failed to utilise Article 7 as a framework through which both nations could have collaboratively addressed the issues without treaty renegotiation.
The Indus basin has experienced unprecedented climate impacts including shifting monsoon patterns, extreme precipitation events and accelerated glacial melt. Water availability has begun to decrease, with projections indicating continuing decline. The IWT employed fixed allocation mechanisms not always suited to hydrological variability while PIC meetings remained infrequent and adversarial rather than collaborative.

Negotiators displayed no desire to study and adopt global best practices in transboundary water management.

Article 7 provided the legal foundation for future cooperation and “optimum development” of the rivers, yet it remained largely unutilised. India never requested the creation of specialised working groups under the PIC focused on climate adaptation and extreme weather response, the energy needs of the two sides or changing demographic trends. A joint climate research agenda examining glacial melt, changing precipitation patterns, and climate impact on water flows would have built mutual understanding of shared challenges.
 
 

Likewise, Pakistan never raised the subject of transboundary water terrorism. Not surprisingly, both nations failed to establish real-time coordination mechanisms for flood warnings, drought management and other extreme events. More agile dispute-resolution mechanisms would have prevented the escalation of tensions. The commission never increased the meetings’ frequency beyond the minimum twice yearly for more responsive governance.
The negotiators also did not show any appetite to study and adopt global best practices in transboundary water management. Approximately, 40 per cent of the global population relies on shared water sources, with 70pc of transboundary basin areas governed by treaties. The Ganges Water Treaty between Bangladesh and India, despite its imperfections, offered a regional model with provisions for water-sharing during droughts and a Joint Water Commission mandated to conduct studies on water-sharing, irrigation, and flood control.
The Permanent Joint Technical Commission on the Nile Basin represented another valuable model despite controversies surrounding Ethiopia’s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. This framework enabled upstream and downstream countries to make recommendations for cooperation in energy generation, dam filling, or water allocations during extraordinary droughts.
Water management experts had identified four key mechanisms that transboundary agreements should incorporate: flexible allocation strategies, specific drought and extreme weather provisions, regular review processes and strong institutional frameworks.
Despite past failures, the door remains open for both countries to rehabilitate the treaty. The World Bank, as the third signatory to the IWT, retains significant potential to facilitate this process. Article IX explicitly designates the World Bank as a potential mediator when differences arise, and this mechanism remains available despite the current tensions. Neither party appears to have informed the World Bank of recent developments. Pakistan need not hold back.
The World Bank’s unique position enables it to facilitate technical dialogues separated from political rhetoric. There is a case for the bank to expand beyond its role of appointing neutral experts or arbitrators, and bring together international experts with experience in successful transboundary water cooperation models like the Danube river basin, which transformed from a contested resource into “an emblem of peace and cooperation in Europe”.
Using the trust fund created when the treaty was signed in 1960, the World Bank can help India and Pakistan undertake studies on implementation experiences from agreements like the Mekong River Commission, which has developed sophisticated joint monitoring protocols for changing flow conditions.
 
 

Rather than allowing the treaty to stagnate, India and Pakistan can rehabilitate it through incremental technical cooperation. The World Bank could be requested to facilitate initial technical dialogues on non-controversial aspects of climate impacts, growing regional hydro energy needs, and gradually building momentum for more complex discussions. Article 7 remains the most viable pathway for tackling the issues raised by India without reopening the entire treaty.
There is still an opportunity to establish specialised technical working groups. Protocols for coordinated responses to extreme weather events, following models from other basins, could be developed without altering the treaty’s core structure.
The IWT remains a viable framework for transboundary water cooperation, but its implementation must evolve. By transforming climate challenges into opportunities for technical cooperation, India and Pakistan can ensure water security while potentially rebuilding a foundation for regional stability. The World Bank’s involvement as an honest broker could provide a neutral platform for this technical renaissance, allowing professionals to work beyond political constraints while giving the leadership in both countries space for a face-saving return to cooperative water governance. After all, it is in everyone’s interest to deweaponise regional waters rather than have a dysfunctional treaty parked in indefinite abeyance.

That was not unexpected. With the country living off repeated bailouts from the lender, it is but natural that its economic policies are tightly tied to the programme goal aimed at ensuring debt reduction and sustainability — in times of war and peace both.
Starting Wednesday, the virtual technical-level discussions, which precede formal policy-level talks on the budget from May 19, have revealed tentative fiscal, inflation, growth and other targets that our policymakers will be required to meet next year to stay in the programme.
Media reports say that the Fund expects Pakistan’s moribund economy to expand by 3.6pc next year, with headline consumer inflation averaging at 7.7pc, and total federal and provincial tax and non-tax revenues growing to nearly Rs20tr or 15.2pc of the economy’s size.
The IMF proposals also emphasise austerity by tightening controls on current and development expenditure to reduce the budget deficit from 5.6pc of the economy’s size estimated for the present fiscal year to 5.1pc next year.
 
 

Related to this is the hefty increase suggested in primary surplus from 1pc to 1.6pc of GDP in order to ensure sustainable debt servicing and bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio from 77.6pc to 75.6pc in FY26. The next budget will also map climate relevance in adaptation, mitigation and transition to receive the IMF’s climate-related funding of $1.4bn in the next 28 months.
Data for the current fiscal year shows that Pakistan is on track to meeting budget targets and other time-bound structural benchmarks agreed with the Fund. Cooperation from the provinces has proved critical in pulling off many of these goals. However, a significant increase in the revenue target proposed for next year amid a shortfall in tax revenues this year underlines the need for broadening the tax base by effectively bringing retail, real estate, agriculture and other undertaxed or untaxed areas of the economy into the net. This demands political commitment and substantial efforts by both the federal and provincial governments.
The decision to pull the government out of the wheat market this year despite opposition from the rural elite, and to cut energy subsidies for powerful textile and other manufacturers, shows that the state has what it takes to make tough decisions. The past policy of squeezing the salaried classes and fully documented corporations to collect taxes will not work any longer. Failure to reform the corrupt and inefficient tax system has already taken a huge toll on ordinary people and led to large cuts in spending on the development of infrastructure crucial for future economic growth and stability.

• Reforms expected to boost exports by $5bn in five years
• Simple average tariff to fall from 19pc to 9.5pc
ISLAMABAD: In a major policy shift, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has approved a comprehensive five-year tariff reform plan to be announced in the federal budget 2025-26, aiming to drastically reduce customs duties, additional customs duties, regulatory duties on raw materials and semi-finished goods, and a phased reduction in overall tariff protections for select industries.
The first phase of the reform, set to be launched with the next budget, introduces a simplified customs duty structure with slabs of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 per cent. The existing 16pc slab will be reduced to 15pc, while the 11pc rate will drop to 10pc. The 3pc slab will be abolished, with products either moved to a zero-duty category or the new 5pc slab.
The proposed tariff overhaul, seen by Dawn, is set to eliminate the additional customs duty of 2pc on 4,294 tariff lines in the upcoming budget. The plan also includes a reduction of additional customs duty from 4pc to 2pc on 545 tariff lines, from 6pc to 4pc on 2,227 tariff lines, and from 7pc to 6pc for all products currently subject to a customs duty above 20pc.
The government is set to slash regulatory duties, which currently reach as high as 90pc on various products, bringing them down to a maximum of 30pc. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has also supported the major overhaul of the tariffs to boost industrial production in the country.
A further substantial cut is scheduled for next year’s budget, while the final three years of the plan will see a gradual, nominal reduction in tariffs.
According to estimates, this tariff rationalisation is projected to boost exports by approximately $5 billion by the end of the plan’s implementation, reinforcing Pakistan’s drive towards a more competitive global trade position.
Five-year roadmap
Industries such as auto, iron and steel, textiles, chemicals and plastics — currently shielded by effective tariff rates ranging between 100pc and 150pc — will see those rates reduced to around 50pc to 60pc. The premier said his government’s priority is to shift away from import substitution to an export-led growth strategy.
Under its ambitious reform agenda, the government has set a target to slash the simple average tariff from the current 19pc to 9.5pc within five years. A key adjustment in the plan includes restructuring duty slabs, replacing the existing slabs of 0pc, 3pc, 11pc, 16pc and 20pc with a streamlined system of 0pc, 5pc, 10pc and 15pc. This will not only simplify the tariff structure but also bring certainty, transparency, and uniform cascading margins that are easy to administer and comply with.
By the end of the five-year implementation period, the tar­iff overhaul will establish a uniform maximum duty slab of 15pc, eliminating sector-specific peaks that previo­usly exceeded 20pc — primarily affecting the auto industry.
The additional customs duties currently set at 2pc, 4pc, 6pc and 7pc across various slabs will be gradually phased out to zero within the next three to four years.
Regulatory duties, which presently range from 5pc to 90pc on various products, will also be fully eliminated over five years, easing import costs and improving market accessibility.
Moreover, the 5th Schedule of Customs, which provides industry-specific tariff concessions, will be dissolved, with all products covered under it transitioning to the 1st Schedule in a phased manner.
According to the tariff reform plan, these concessions will either be discontinued or extended universally, ensuring a more equitable trade policy across industries.
Exports-led growth strategy
The government has decided to embark on an outward-looking, export-led growth tariff policy. This major shift in the trade and tariff policy is based on thorough research, evidence from successful economies and Pakistan’s own experience.
The drastic cuts in duties will provide full support to the vulnerable sectors and industries. The cascading principle will be maintained and industries will still enjoy substantially high effective rates of protection.
The current high, complex, and discriminatory tariff structure has favoured only a few big businesses, which over time have become less efficient and unproductive.
The vested interests taking advantage of the myths and disconnects around tariff reforms are raising their voice against the reforms, a senior Customs officer said. “There is no truth to the assertions that tariff rationalisation would affect external balance or revenue generation negatively,” the officer claimed.
Scientific models used in policy analysis suggest that while imports may rise slightly, exports are expected to grow at a faster pace, improving the trade balance. More than 45pc of imports are inelastic — comprising food and energy — and historically, spikes in the import bill have stemmed from global price hikes rather than imports of industrial inputs.
It is expected that this shift from import substitution to an export-led policy will give a much-needed boost to the economy. Lower tariffs will reduce anti-export bias and help businesses, especially small businesses in textile, agriculture and light engineering sectors, to integrate into global value chains, the policy said.

• PTI facing blackout in coverage by official media
ISLAMABAD: The government faced an embarrassing situation in the National Assembly on Thursday when the opposition cleverly blocked the passage of an important money bill in the middle of the process.
It was after facing a 67-32 vote defeat on the motion tabled by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to present the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024 for its passage that opposition members belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) realised that their absence could prevent the government from maintaining quorum for which the presence of 84 members is required in the 336-member house.
As soon as Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah declared the result of the headcount on the motion, the PTI members strategically walked out, leaving behind their colleague Aamir Dogar to point out lack of quorum at a time when the chair had already got approval of two clauses of the three-clause bill through a voice vote.
 
 

The deputy speaker desperately ordered a headcount and then suspended the proceedings till completion of the quorum. The government, however, not only failed to complete the quorum — for which it required the presence of 17 more members — but also could not hold the members already present in the house and thus the number dropped to even less than 67.
When the proceedings resumed after half an hour, the chair found no other option but to announce the adjournment of the sitting till Friday morning (today) without completing the agenda, which included the passage of five bills.
The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024 is already in the field as the government had introduced it last year in the form of an ordinance.
However, since the ordinance is about to lapse after completing its constitutional period, it has now become mandatory for the government to get it passed from the assembly for continuation of its enforcement. The bill, according to the Statement of Objects and Reasons, is aimed at removing some difficulties faced by taxpayers in the implementation of higher tax rates on income from federal government securities as well as rationalising standard tax rate on whole of the business income of banking companies.
Media blackout
The state-run media, as well as the official social media platforms of the National Assembly, continued the policy of censoring the proceedings of the house with opposition members facing a complete blackout.
Earlier, the National Assembly’s proceedings were not broadcast live on its official social media platforms when the house held a discussion on the Pakistan-India conflict, following the Pahalgam attack.
On May 6, when Leader of Opposition Omar Ayub Khan raised the issue of his speech being censored, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq asserted his authority, saying he had the right to expunge anything deemed “against national interest”.
The proceedings were not live-streamed on the NA’s official YouTube and Facebook channels, while PTV aired speeches from the treasury benches only.
At that time, a senior National Assembly Secretariat official had stated that the live-streaming of parliamentary proceedings had been stopped on social media in view of the sensitivity of the situation between Pakistan and India, adding that the live-stream would resume soon.
Though censorship of “objectionable parts” of opposition lawmakers’ speeches has become something of a norm, a complete blackout of proceedings during debate on an important issue was quite unprecedented.
After completion of the debate on India-Pakistan conflict, the live-streaming of the NA proceedings began on its official YouTube and Facebook channels, but now with complete blackout of the opposition members even during the question hour.
There was no word from the government on the issue. However, a senior official of the NA Secretariat told Dawn that the blackout of opposition members was being done on the directives of Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.

The government incre­ased the Inland Freight Equalisation Margin (IFEM) on both petrol and diesel to clear about Rs34 billion loss to the oil industry owing to a tax loophole in the Finance Bill 2024-25.
In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Fina­nce said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had reviewed and adjusted prices for petroleum products in view of the fluctuations in the international market.
The ex-depot price of high-speed diesel was reduced by Rs2 per litre to Rs254.64 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs256.64.
Most of the transport sector runs on high-speed diesel. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
The ex-depot price of petrol was kept unchanged at Rs252.63 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct effect on middle- and lower-income households.
At present, the government charges about Rs96 per litre tax on both petrol and high-speed diesel.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government charges Rs78 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on petrol, diesel and high-octane products that normally impact the masses.
The government also charges about Rs17 per litre customs duty on petrol and high-speed diesel, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Over the last two months, the government has disallowed about Rs18 per litre of potential reduction in petroleum prices to discourage a rise in petroleum consumption. This was done through an increase in the petroleum levy through a special presidential ordinance, to divert funds for higher subsidies on electricity rates and the construction of highways and motorways in Balochistan and Sindh.
At the request of the Petroleum Division, IFEM has now been increased by Rs1.87 per litre to address losses faced by refineries and oil marketing companies (OMCs). The financial impact, estimated at Rs34bn for FY25, stems from the reclassification of petroleum products as “exempt” under the new Finance Act, rendering input sales tax non-refundable for refineries and OMCs.
The Petroleum Division proposed that the Rs34bn shortfall be recovered through IFEM over a 12-month period, with the adjustment automatically ending in the 13th month.
Petrol and HSD remain the government’s top revenue generators, accounting for monthly sales of 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.

• Hamas says Gaza ‘not for sale’
GAZA: Palestinian rescuers reported more than 100 people killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes on blockaded Gaza, where a US-backed organisation said it intends to begin distributing aid by the end of the month.
Aid to Gaza has been cut off since March 2, a tactic Israel has said is intended to force concessions from Hamas, but the group insisted on Thursday that the restoration of humanitarian assistance to the war-ravaged territory was “the minimum requirement” for talks.
It also warned that Gaza was not “for sale” hours after US President Donald Trump, on a visit to the region, again floated taking over the territory and turning it into “a freedom zone”.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said the death toll from Israeli bombardment since dawn on Thursday had risen to 103.
Israel’s aid blockade preceded a resumption of military operations on March 18, ending a ceasefire that had largely halted hostilities since mid-January.
For weeks, UN agencies have warned that supplies of everything from food and clean water to fuel and medicines are reaching new lows.
“Israel’s blockade has transcended military tactics to become a tool of extermination,” Human Rights Watch interim executive director Federico Borello said.
AFPTV footage from the aftermath of a strike on Deir al-Balah in the centre of the territory showed flattened buildings and piles of concrete rubble.
“We pray for this war to end, and we appeal to all international institutions to end the war because enough is enough,” said Gaza resident Maher Ghanem, his arm in a sling.
Gaza not ‘for sale’
Israel says the aid stoppage and military pressure are meant to force Hamas to free the remaining prisoners.
But senior Hamas official Basem Naim said the entry of aid into Gaza was “the minimum requirement for a conducive and constructive negotiation environment”.
“Access to food, water, and medicine is a fundamental human right — not a subject for negotiation,” he added.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US-supported NGO, said it would begin distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza this month after talks with Israeli officials.
But the United Nations on Thursday ruled out involvement with the initiative.
“As we’ve stated repeatedly, this particular distribution plan does not accord with our basic principles, including those of impartiality, neutrality, independence, and we will not be participating in this,” said UN spokesman Farhan Haq.
Trump said he wanted the United States to “get involved” in Gaza.
“I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good… let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” he said on the Qatar leg of a Gulf tour, adding he would be “proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone”.
The comments echoed an idea he floated in February for the United States to “take over” the devastated territory and redevelop it into “the Riviera of the Middle East”.
Hamas official Naim said “Gaza is an integral part of Palestinian land — it is not real estate for sale on the open market”.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas — in remarks addressing a UN commemoration of the “Nakba”, the flight or expulsion of an estimated 700,000 Palestinians during the creation of Israel in 1948 — warned against repeating the displacement of his people in Gaza.
The United Nations estimates that 70 per cent of Gaza is now either an Israeli-declared no-go zone or under evacuation order.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said 2,876 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes on March 18, taking the war’s overall toll to 53,010.
West Bank raids
In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, raids were ongoing and roads blocked after Israel’s military chief vowed to find the perpetrators of an attack that killed a pregnant Israeli woman.
WhatsApp groups for Israeli settlers in the territory were rife with calls for vengeance in retaliation for the attack.
“To make sure this never happens again… we need real revenge!” one user said.
In the northern village of Tammun, Israeli troops killed five Palestinians in a raid the military described as targeting buildings suspected of being used to plan attacks.
The West Bank has seen an upsurge in violence since the beginning of the Gaza war.

• India says water treaty to remain suspended until end to ‘cross-border terrorism’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday urged the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to investigate the ‘nuclear black market’ in India and repeated incidents of theft and illicit trafficking of radioactive material, as it rejected a call by India’s defence minister for the nuclear watchdog to monitor Islamabad’s nuclear programme.
Pointing to multiple incidents of radioactive material theft in India and other security lapses, the Foreign Office said, “Pakistan urges a thorough investigation of these incidents and calls upon India to ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities and arsenal.”
“If anything, the IAEA and the international community should be worried about the repeated theft and illicit trafficking incidents involving nuclear and radioactive material in India,” the statement added.
The Foreign Office was responding to comments made by Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during a speech to Indian soldiers in Srinagar, in which he said, “I believe that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons should be taken under the supervision of the IAEA.”
Mr Singh’s remarks came days after the two nuclear-armed neighbours paused their worst military confrontation in nearly three decades following the Pahalgam attack, a militant assault that New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based groups. Tensions spiked as cross-border exchanges escalated, prompting global concern over a potential nuclear flashpoint.
In a separate statement days after the ceasefire, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.”
In its response, the Foreign Office said Mr Singh’s comments “reveal his profound insecurity and frustration regarding Pakistan’s effective defence and deterrence against Indian aggression through conventional means,” adding that “Pakistan’s conventional capabilities are adequate to deter India, without the self-imposed ‘nuclear blackmail’ that New Delhi suffers.”
The Foreign Office also criticised Mr Singh’s remarks as “ignorant of the mandate and responsibilities” of the IAEA, a Vienna-based UN agency tasked with verifying that nuclear programmes remain peaceful. India’s civilian nuclear facilities are subject to IAEA safeguards under a 2008 agreement, but its strategic programme is not.
Citing recent incidents, the Foreign Office recalled that five individuals were reportedly caught in the Indian city of Dehradun last year with a radioactive device allegedly stolen from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. In another case, a gang was found in possession of Californium — a highly radioactive element valued at over $100 million. Three separate incidents of Californium theft were also reported in 2021.
“These recurring incidents call into question the measures taken by New Delhi for the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive material. These incidents also suggest the existence of a black market for sensitive, dual-use materials inside India,” the Foreign Office said.
While tensions have de-escalated for now, the heated rhetoric and the Indus Waters Treaty suspension have pushed South Asia’s nuclear-armed rivals into another prolonged diplomatic standoff.
Water treaty tensions
In a further sign of deteriorating ties, India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar announced on Thursday that the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty would remain in effect “until cross-border terrorism by Pakistan is credibly and irrevocably stopped”.
 
 

India had announced the treaty’s suspension immediately after the Pahalgam attack on April 22.
Pakistan had then condemned the Indian move, stating: “Pakistan vehemently rejects the Indian announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. The treaty is a binding international agreement brokered by the World Bank and contains no provision for unilateral suspension.”
Water is a “vital national interest of Pakistan, a lifeline for its 240 million people and its availability will be safeguarded at all costs”, the Foreign Office warned at the time.
“Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty, and the usurpation of the rights of lower riparian will be considered an act of war and responded with full force across the complete spectrum of national power,” it added.

• Dar says ultimately ‘political dialogue’ will take place to address all issues; reiterates opposition to Indian move to end Kashmir’s autonomy
• Senate resolution condemns India for unprovoked strikes against Pakistan
• Trump claims hostilities between nuclear neighbours ‘settled’, asks both to focus on trade
ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan and India extended the nascent ceasefire till May 18, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday informed the Senate that Pakistan sought a “composite dialogue” with New Delhi to put all contentious matters to rest.
According to the foreign minister, the ceasefire was extended through military-to-military communication, but a political dialogue will ultimately have to take place to resolve the problems between the two neighbours. “We have told the world that we will hold a composite dialogue,” he informed the Senate.
The FM said Pakistan had never accepted the unilateral revocation of occupied Kashmir’s special status by India in 2019, while also warning that any attempt to block Pakistan’s water through the unlawful suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty would be treated as an act of war.
He said there was no clause in the treaty under which it could be held in abeyance. “It could neither be amended nor terminated unilaterally,” he said, alluding to the Indian move to hold the treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam shooting. The deputy prime minister said India used the Pahalgam incident as a pretext to sabotage the Indus Waters Treaty.
The FM also clarified that Pakistan had not sought the ceasefire in conversations with world leaders during the heightened tensions with India. In fact, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during a telephonic conversation, conveyed that India was willing to halt hostilities, he added.
 
 

The FM also referred to subsequent calls from friendly countries and said Pakistan’s position that it desired peace with dignity and honour was explained to all. “We told our friends that we would not initiate an attack, but we would certainly respond if provoked,” he said, adding that Pakistan’s response was measured, decisive, and in line with international law.
The foreign minister pointed out that the recent conflict began after the Pahalgam incident, which India instantly blamed on Pakistan in the absence of any evidence. “We offered a transparent and neutral investigation into the Pahalgam attack, but India refused,” he regretted.
‘No longer diplomatically irrelevant’
Speaking about the recent conflict, he said Pakistan was “no longer diplomatically irrelevant”. “Pakistan is no longer diplomatically irrelevant; we have proven our strategic and diplomatic significance.”
As she opened the debate on the recent escalation, PPP leader Sena­tor Sherry Rehman said that Pakis­tan established its clear dominance in the tactical field as compared to India’s far more expensive force. “This war was deliberately thrust on us,” she said, adding that Pak­istan demonstrated to the world it was a responsible nuclear power.
Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Shibli Faraz said it was the right time to push the country tow­a­rds normalisation and political stability. “We have seen the performance of the nation when it is united,” he said, urging the government to pursue Pakistan’s foreign policy aggressively. He said that the recent escalation internationali­sed the Kashmir issue once again.
Resolution against India
The house also unanimously adopted a resolution strongly condemning the unprovoked Indian attacks on innocent civilians, including women, children and mosques, while praising the befitting response by the armed forces. The resolution urged the government to proactively engage the international community for the peaceful, just and lasting resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
It stressed the importance of strict adherence to the Indus tre­aty and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering resolve to protect its rightful share of water as a fundamental component of national sec­u­rity, international agreements, eco­nomic stability, and sovereignty.
It reminded India that any violations of the Indus treaty constituted a serious breach of international humanitarian law, and amounted not only to a war crime, but also a crime against humanity, with grave, regional, and global repercussions.
Separately, US President Donald Trump urged the two countries to focus on trade instead of war. He told US troops at a base in Qatar during a Gulf tour that Pakistan and India were happy with that, reported Reuters.
‘Maintain ceasefire’
The State Department on Thursday said the United States had urged India and Pakistan to maintain the current ceasefire.
Asked at a Washington press briefing about the reported extension, State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Piggott said: “What we are happy to see is the ceasefire. That’s where our focus remains — and on the direct talks we want to see.”
Piggott credited both Indian and Pakistani leadership for agreeing to the truce. “The President (Trump) has been clear in praising both prime ministers for choosing the path of peace,” he said.
“For the past couple of days, we’ve been saying that we want to encourage and see direct talks between the parties. We have been clear on that,” Piggott emphasised.

Trump began a visit to the UAE on the latest stage of a tour of wealthy Gulf states after hailing plans by Doha to invest $10 billion in a US military facility during a trip to Qatar.
“I have absolutely no doubt that the relationship will only get bigger and better,” Trump said in a meeting with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
“Your wonderful brother came to Washington a few weeks ago and he told us about your generous statement as to the 1.4 trillion,” Trump said, referring to a UAE pledge to invest $1.4tn in the US over 10 years.
Trump was referring to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Sheikh Mohamed’s brother and the UAE’s national security adviser and chairman of two of Abu Dhabi’s deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds.
“And all I can say is thank you very much,” Trump added.
“We will work very hard to deserve it.”
Sheikh Mohamed told Trump the UAE was “keen to continue and strengthen this friendship for the benefit of the two countries and peoples”, adding to Trump: “Your presence here today, your excellency, the president, confirms that this keenness is mutual.”
Before his departure for the UAE, Trump said in a speech to US troops at the Al Udeid Air Base southwest of Doha that defence purchases signed by Qatar on Wednesday are worth $42bn.
He was met at the airport in Abu Dhabi by Sheikh Mohamed, and the two leaders visited the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, its white minarets and domes, impressive in the late-afternoon light.
“It is so beautiful,” Trump told reporters inside the mosque, which he said had been closed for the day.
“First time they closed it. It’s in honour of the United States. Better than in honour of me. Let’s give it to the country. That’s a great tribute.”
The UAE’s leaders want US help to make their wealthy Gulf nation a global leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
The US has a preliminary agreement with the UAE to allow it to import 500,000 of Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips a year, starting this year, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
The deal would boost the UAE’s construction of data centres vital to developing AI models.
But the agreement has provoked national security concerns among sectors of the US government, and the terms could change, sources said.
At the presidential palace, Trump and Sheikh Mohamed could be seen in TV footage in conversation with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.
Trump said he would probably return to Washington on Friday after a regional trip that began on Tuesday, although he said it was “almost destination unknown — because they’ll be getting calls, ‘could you be here? Could you be there?’”
Trump had hinted that he could stop in Istanbul for talks on Ukraine.
The two countries have finalised a technology framework agreement that was expected to be signed later on Thursday, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The agreement requires commitments on both sides to the security of technology, the source said, without immediately providing details.
Deals, diplomacy
Some big business agreements have been signed during Trump’s four-day swing through the Gulf region, including a deal for Qatar Airways to purchase up to 210 Boeing widebody jets, a $600bn commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in U.S. arms sales to the kingdom.
The trip has also brought a flurry of diplomacy.
Trump said in Qatar that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms.
He also announced on Tuesday that the US would remove longstanding sanctions on Syria and subsequently met with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.
He urged Sharaa to establish ties with Syria’s longtime foe, Israel.
AI is likely to be a focus of the final leg of Trump’s trip.
Former US president Joe Biden’s administration had imposed strict oversight of exports of US AI chips to the Middle East and other regions.
Among the Biden administration’s fears were that the prized semiconductors would be diverted to China and buttress Beijing’s military strength.
Trump has made improving ties with some Gulf countries a key goal of his administration.
If all the proposed chip deals in Gulf states, and the UAE in particular, come together, the region would become a third power centre in global AI competition after the United States and China.
Trump compared his visit to Saudi Arabia with one by his predecessor in 2022, when Biden gave the Saudi crown prince a fist bump.
“I shook more hands, more than any human being is capable of doing,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One.
“He travels all the way to Saudi Arabia, in that case, and he gives him a fist bump. That’s not what they want. They don’t want a fist bump. They want to shake his hand.”</p><small>2025-05-15 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/152142138c4e0ed.png?r=214247' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911216/pakistan-india-ceasefire-extended-until-may-18-says-fm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-India ceasefire extended until May 18, says FM Dar</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday said that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was extended until May 18, adding that the matter will “ultimately go to dialogue” between the civilian leadership of the two nations.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
On Monday, the director general of military operations for both sides held the first round of talks via hotline after the ceasefire.
Speaking in the Senate today, FM Dar said that a military-to-military conversation took place between the two countries today, where they decided to extend the ceasefire until May 18.
“Ultimately, the matter will go to dialogue between the civilian leadership of the countries,” FM Dar said. “Right now, these are military-to-military communications.”
He said that a political dialogue would take place between the two countries and that a “resolution for all the problems will be discussed”.
“We have told the world that we will carry out a composite dialogue,” Dar said.
A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif invited India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution, between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), Dar said that Pakistan did not request a ceasefire during the recent escalation with India.
Instead, it [ceasefire] was initiated following a call from the US Secretary of State, who conveyed that India was willing to halt hostilities, Dar said.
Dar emphasised that Pakistan had exercised restraint and communicated this to all friendly nations even before the outbreak of hostilities.
“We told our friends we would not initiate an attack, but we would certainly respond if provoked,” he said, adding that Pakistan’s response was measured, decisive, and in line with international norms.
Victory not only changed world’s perception but regional equation: PM
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the victory in Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos has not only changed the world’s perception about Pakistan but also the regional equation.
 






Paying tribute to the bravery and proficiency of Pakistan Air Force (PAF) falcons for inflicting a crushing defeat on the enemy during the operation, the premier said the success has also strengthened the belief of our friends and supporters in us.
Addressing the PAF falcons during his visit to Kamra Airbase today, PM Shehbaz said the PAF falcons “blew away the enemy’s pride into dust in a matter of just a few hours”.
He said, “Our daring eagles have taught a lesson to the enemy that if it ever tries to engage in any misadventure again, it will be served a destructive blow.”
The prime minister vowed that the nation will never forget the sacrifices of those martyred during this unprovoked aggression of the enemy.
He said we will uphold the dignity of our martyrs’ sacrifices and will build a prosperous and great country.
Directing his address to India, the premier said while India’s war-fever is over, we are ready to talk with it for peace.
He said let us remind India of the conditions for peace foremost among which is ensuring the right to self-determination for Kashmiri people under UNSC resolutions.
The prime minister said India mocked itself globally by unjustifiably blaming Pakistan for the Pahalgam incident, while there are irrefutable pieces of evidence of India’s involvement in terrorist activities inside Pakistan.
Senate passes resolution paying tribute to armed forces
Separately, the Senate passed a resolution paying tribute to the armed forces for demonstrating “unwavering resolve, unparalleled Professionalism, and steadfast dedication in the successful execution of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos.”
The resolution, presented by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, said the operation was carried out with exceptional restraint and maturity, reflecting the conduct of a responsible nuclear state.
It congratulated the people of Pakistan for rising above all political, ethnic, and ideological divides and differences, demonstrating unity in support of national leadership across the political spectrum and speaking with one voice and one purpose to defend the people, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and dignity of the country.
It honoured the sacrifices of the valiant martyrs who laid down their lives in the defence of the sovereignty and national honour of the country.
It condemned “the brutal and unprovoked Indian attacks on innocent civilians, including women, children and mosques”.
It urged the government to proactively engage the international community for a peaceful, just and lasting resolution of the Indian-held Kashmir, stressing the critical importance of strict adherence to the Indus water treaty.</p><small>2025-05-15 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/152225163466e70.jpg?r=222531' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911225/film-executive-in-cannes-accused-of-sexual-assault-during-event' target='_blank'><strong>Film executive in Cannes accused of sexual assault during event</strong></a><br><p>A vice president of one of the parallel film events at the Cannes Festival was suspended Thursday after being publicly denounced for sexual violence, witnesses and organisers told AFP.
During a roundtable discussion about sexual assault organised by France’s film board (CNC), a woman stood up and publicly denounced an executive from the ACID Cannes film section.
“The young woman acted with great courage and was immediately taken care of by charities present,” Erwan Balanant, a French MP who was in the room, told AFP.
It came as the main Cannes Festival barred a French actor from the premiere Thursday of a film in the running for the Palme d’Or top prize because he has been accused of rape by three former partners.
The ACID Cannes event is not part of the official festival, but runs at the same time and has some organisational links.
It showcases up-and-coming directors and more experimental cinema.
“Today, during a public roundtable, we heard testimony implicating one of our members, currently vice-president of ACID, in serious acts that could amount to sexual violence,” two other co-presidents of the organisation said in a statement to AFP.
They said the man had been suspended as a precautionary measure and that “an internal investigation process has been entrusted to an external body.” The vice president cannot be named for legal reasons.
Cannes has been under pressure from MPs and activists to take a tougher line on sexual violence.</p><small>2025-05-15 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/152135170df25b3.jpg?r=213553' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911223/egypt-sentences-prominent-dissident-to-six-months-in-prison' target='_blank'><strong>Egypt sentences prominent dissident to six months in prison</strong></a><br><p>Egypt has handed opposition figure and former presidential hopeful Hisham Kassem a new six-month prison sentence for defaming a former minister, his lawyer told AFP on Thursday.
Kassem was released in February 2024 after serving a six-month sentence that effectively stopped him from contesting a December 2023 presidential election.
The new sentence was issued in absentia on Wednesday because Kassem is out of the country, his lawyer Nasser Amin told AFP.
Kassem had not been notified of the new charges against him, Amin said, adding: “These measures have been very concerning.” The European Parliament described Kassem’s original prosecution in September 2023 as “politically motivated”.
His latest conviction was on charges of defaming another former labour minister, apparently in the same comments as the first.
Human rights group the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights condemned the ruling, describing it as “continued judicial persecution for political purposes”.
“Retrying Kassem for the same incident and on the same charges… is not only trying the same defendant for the same act twice, but also clearly indicates an explicit desire to punish him for his political statements criticising the regime as well as his political activity,” the group said.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s administration has faced persistent criticism of its human rights record since it came to power in 2014.
Since 2022, the administration has released hundreds of political prisoners, although human rights groups say many more have been detained over the same period.</p><small>2025-05-15 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/151904424217a85.jpg?r=192119' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911219/pm-directs-comprehensive-regulatory-framework-for-agriculture-sector' target='_blank'><strong>PM directs comprehensive regulatory framework for agriculture sector</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the agriculture sector was being developed on modern lines to achieve self-reliance and directed the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework for the sector.
During the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector experienced a significantly declined growth rate of 1.10pc compared to 5.80pc the previous year. The prime minister has previously stated his government’s determination to transform the sector on modern lines to achieve self-sufficiency, emphasising its vast potential for rapid economic development.
Chairing a meeting on agricultural sector reforms today, the prime minister stressed that government’s priority for the promotion of modern technology in the agricultural sector. He also directed the relevant department to present a National Agri-Innovation Plan for the agricultural sector.
The prime minister instructed the formulation of a coordinated strategy to develop the agriculture sector in consultation with provinces and relevant stakeholders. He instructed authorities concerned to formulate a sustainable and long-term policy for agro-industrial development to promote agriculture and forestry and help counter the effects of climate change.
PM Shehbaz directed the provision of agricultural loans to farmers on easy terms and stressed a focus on agricultural research to enhance production. He also called for accelerating ongoing reforms in the certification system for agricultural seed and developing an effective action plan to promote high-quality seeds.
Agriculture sector decline
The deceleration in the agriculture sector can be attributed mainly to negative growth in key crops such as cotton, rice, and maize. Cotton ginning and miscellaneous components showed growth in FY24 due to excellent cotton output but declined in FY25 due to poor cotton production.
Cotton production saw a substantial decline of 30.7pc, with this year’s output recorded at 7.084 million bales, compared to 10.22m bales the previous year. Rice production dropped by 1.4pc, totalling 9.72m tonnes, down from 9.86m tonnes the previous year. Similarly, maize production decreased by 15.4pc, with output falling to 8.24m tonnes from 9.74m tonnes the previous year.
The latest revised estimates indicate a 2.3pc decrease in sugarcane production, totalling 85.62m tonnes, down from 87.64m tonnes last year. The wheat area dropped by 6.8pc from last year, despite having no impact in Q1. Potatoes saw a 14.2pc increase, while other crops grew by 0.73pc.
During a high-level consultative meeting on the agriculture sector in April, the prime minister reaffirmed his government’s commitment to revitalising the country’s agriculture sector by promoting innovation, sustainable development, and the active involvement of young experts and key stakeholders to revive the agricultural economy.
PM Shehbaz called for tapping into the talent of young professionals and researchers while leveraging the wisdom of experienced experts to guide the process. He expressed concern that cotton production had fallen so low that Pakistan had become an importer while neighbouring countries like India and China had progressed in crop yield.
Referring to Pakistan’s 65 per cent rural population, the prime minister stressed the need to provide meaningful opportunities to rural youth, particularly in agri-tech and entrepreneurship. He noted the absence of patronage for local agri-machinery manufacturers and service companies supporting small farmers, urging that these be brought into a systematic framework.
He directed the formation of working committees on five critical sectors. The meeting highlighted the need to increase domestic and foreign investment in the agriculture sector, while also strengthening the role of financial institutions and facilitating agricultural loans.</p><small>2025-05-15 15:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1518194818bf153.jpg?r=182019' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911215/trump-asks-apple-chief-to-expand-production-back-to-us-instead-of-india' target='_blank'><strong>Trump asks Apple chief to expand production back to US instead of India</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook and told him not to expand his production facilities in India, but to do so in America.
“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said during his visit to Qatar.
“I said to him, Tim, you’re my friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India,” he said, referring to Apple’s plan announced in February to invest $500bn in the US over the next four years.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Trump said he informed Cook that he does not want him to build production facilities in India, and that Apple will be “upping their production in the United States”.
The US president claimed that selling American goods in the world’s most populous country is “very difficult” because India has one of the highest tariff barriers in the world.
However, he noted that while the Asian country looks for a deal on import duties, India has offered them a “no-tariff” deal.
 
 

Trump’s remarks came after Tim Cook said earlier this month that the majority of Apple’s products to be sold in the US in the coming months will be sourced from India and Vietnam rather than China, which has been the target of US President Donald Trump’s highest tariffs.
“We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,” Cook said.
The primary production location “for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the US” will be Vietnam in the meantime.
Cook noted that the great bulk of all products sold outside the US will continue to be manufactured in China.
Apple is among the most impacted tech firms in the US, with its shares falling by around 5.1 per cent since the tariffs were announced.
Due to low production costs, the majority of Apple products are now manufactured in China.
The Trump administration has repeatedly stated that it wants Apple to move production to the US.
Earlier this week, the US and China agreed to a sweeping rollback of punitive tariffs for an initial 90-day period, signalling a rare moment of relief in their protracted trade conflict and raising hopes for longer-term economic stability.</p><small>2025-05-15 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/15172049db20b01.png?r=172258' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911211/dg-ispr-warns-of-swift-and-assured-response-in-case-india-breaks-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR warns of ‘swift and assured response’ in case India breaks ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Thursday warned in an interview with British broadcaster Sky News that any Indian ceasefire violation would be met with a “swift and assured response” by Pakistan, cautioning that serious escalation could result in mutual destruction.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan. According to the government, forty civilians — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.
Speaking to Sky News, DG ISPR warned that by rooting for war, India was carving out a “recipe for mutual destruction,” adding that the world now recognised the extent of the nuclear threat.
“Any sane player like the USA understands this absurdity and what the Indians are trying to do here,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told the publications.
 


Talking about India’s actions in Kashmir, he accused the country of trying to “internalise the issue and harassing” Kashmiri people with a heavy troop presence.
“It is a problem that has to be resolved by the people of Kashmir as per the United Nations Security Council resolution,” he said.
He continued: “Anyone who tries to violate our territory and integrity and sovereignty, our response will be brutal.”
DG ISPR warned that a “serious escalation between India and Pakistan would destroy both sides” under the concept of mutually assured destruction — a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.
In a press conference held last week after the ceasefire was brokered, DG ISPR had cautioned that a conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi “can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.”
“In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan,” he added.</p><small>2025-05-15 14:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/15151800e092778.jpg?r=151806' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203/india-has-offered-us-a-trade-deal-with-no-tariffs-trump' target='_blank'><strong>India has offered US a trade deal with no tariffs: Trump</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “no tariffs” for American goods, while expressing his dissatisfaction with Apple’s (AAPL.O) plans to invest in India.
New Delhi is seeking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the 90-day pause announced by Trump on April 9 on tariff hikes for major trading partners.
“It is very hard to sell in India, and they are offering us a deal where basically they are willing to literally charge us no tariffs,” Trump said in a meeting with executives in the Qatari capital Doha.
Reuters has reported that New Delhi has offered to reduce duties to zero on 60 per cent of tariff lines in a first phase of the deal under negotiation with Washington, while offering preferential access to nearly 90pc of the merchandise India imports from the US.
India’s equity benchmarks jumped to a seven-month high after Trump’s comment on the deal with India.
The Indian trade ministry did not reply to a mail seeking comments on the proposed deal.
Trump in Doha said he had confronted Apple’s CEO Tim Cook about shifting production to India, as the American company moves to make most of its iPhones sold in the United States at factories in India by the end of 2026, and is speeding up those plans to navigate potentially higher tariffs in China.
“Tim, we treated you very good, we put up with all the plants you built in China for years … we are not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well, we want you to build here”, Trump recalled himself telling Cook, who was not in the Doha meeting.
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years promoted India as a smartphone manufacturing hub and Apple’s suppliers have ramped up production in the country.
In March, Apple’s main India suppliers Foxconn and Tata shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the US, an all-time high, to bypass Trump’s impending tariffs.
The United States is India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling some $129bn in 2024. The trade balance is currently in favour of India, which runs a $45.7bn surplus with the US.
India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal will lead a trade delegation to the United States starting May 16 to advance trade negotiations, two government officials told Reuters on Tuesday.

US President Donald Trump, on his Gulf tour, met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Wednesday. Despite concerns within sectors of his administration over Syria’s leaders’ former ties to Al Qaeda, Trump said on Tuesday during a speech in Riyadh that he would lift sanctions on Syria in a major policy shift.
“Pakistan has consistently advocated for constructive engagement and dialogue. The easing of sanctions is expected to facilitate economic growth, improve access to essential services, and support the rebuilding efforts of the Syrian authorities,” the FO statement read.
Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment towards Syria’s unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, the statement said, “Pakistan supports a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned resolution.”
“We commend the commitment of all countries, in particular the US, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, working constructively towards a peaceful Syria,” the statement read.
The decision is a major boost for Sharaa, who has been struggling to bring the country under the control of the Damascus government after toppling former President Bashar al-Assad in December.
According to Al Jazeera, the US was one of many countries that sanctioned Syria under the al-Assad regime (1971–2024). It labelled Syria a “State Sponsor of Terrorism” in 1979, triggering arms and financial restrictions.
Sanctions expanded in 2004 and intensified after the 2011 war, targeting regime-linked individuals, freezing assets, banning US investments, and restricting oil imports.
The US also offered a $10 million reward for Syria’s current leader, al-Sharaa, and designated his former group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a “Foreign Terrorist Organisation”.</p><small>2025-05-15 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/15162039badf1e7.jpg?r=163054' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911206/bullish-momentum-at-psx-as-shares-gain-1400-points-after-sbp-receives-2nd-imf-tranche' target='_blank'><strong>Bullish momentum at PSX as shares gain 1,400 points after SBP receives 2nd IMF tranche</strong></a><br><p>Bulls took control of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday as shares gained over 1,400 points, bringing calm to yesterday’s heightened volatility.

Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the market was positive due to the recent inflows from the IMF.
He also noted there were “expectations of further inflows on the back of the IMF Board approval”, which on May 9 greenlit the $1bn tranche but also allowed an additional arrangement for $1.4bn climate funds under the Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
 
 

Today’s bullish momentum comes as the market continues to recover from the upheaval brought by the intense military row between Pakistan and India last week, after the two agreed to a ceasefire.
Shares in the subsequent session had gained a record 9pc.
Tariq also mentioned lower yields on treasury bill auctions and expectations of resolution of circular debt in the gas and power sectors.

The explosion hit Maulana Noorullah’s car near Shahzad Madrassah, adjacent to a police station in the district’s Azam Warsak market. According to a police statement, the bomb attack was carried out to target Maulana Noorullah, who remained unharmed.
Police confirmed the incident and said there were no casualties in the explosion. Security forces cordoned off the area and started an investigation.
According to a video later released by the JUI-F, Maulana Noorullah told his supporters that he was accompanied by local party leaders Maulana Ishaq and Maulana Amanullah when the blast occurred.
“We all are safe,” he told his supporters. “We want peace in the country and protection of religious schools, mosques and all Muslims.”
JUI-F leaders have been targeted in different parts of KP and Balochistan over the past several months.
On March 14 this year, a bomb exploded at a mosque in South Waziristan district during Friday prayers, injuring JUI district chief Abdullah Nadeem and three others, police said. Nadeem was seriously wounded, while three others, also belonging to the JUI, sustained minor injuries.
Local JUI-F leaders have also come under attack in Balochistan. On April 25, a local leader of the JUI-F and two women were killed and five others were injured in a roadside explosion near the Kalat district.
The incident occurred in the Kapootu area when a pickup vehicle carrying eight people was hit by an improvised explosive device (IED) planted on the roadside near Killi Kapootu, according to Levies officials.
The vehicle was coming from Kalat when the blast took place. The pickup was driven by JUI-F local leader and union council member Maulana Abdullah Nachari.
In another incident on March 2, two leaders of JUI-F Balochistan were killed in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district in Balochistan.
The JUI-F leaders, Wadera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah were on their way home in the Tarsani area of Zehri when unknown assailants riding motorcycles opened fire on them with automatic weapons.

Marking the second phase of the initiative, the passengers were received at the airport by Minister of Religious Affairs & Interfaith Harmony Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah Khalid Majid, DG Hajj Abdul Wahab Soomro and the senior officers of the Consulate General of Pakistan. The pilgrims were presented bouqets by the receiving party.
This year, an estimated 50,500 Haj pilgrims will travel to Saudi Arabia under the initiative, with 28,000 departing from Islamabad and 22,500 from Karachi throughout 180 flights, out of which 100 will depart from Islamabad and 80 from Karachi.
Housing and other essential facilities have been arranged for all the pilgrims, including service personnel such as medical staff and officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, to facilitate the Haj pilgrims.
In April, a Saudi immigration team arrived in the country to process Pakistani Haj pilgrims at Jinnah International Airport and Islamabad International Airport.
In 2025, Pakistan’s Haj quota was set at 179,210, with half of the quota meant to be managed by private Haj operators. However, only 23,000 people were able to go under private operators.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-05-15 09:06</small></div><hr>
