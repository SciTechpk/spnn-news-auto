<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/191442323472b6e.jpg?r=155553' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925209/9-terrorists-killed-3-officials-injured-in-joint-operation-in-kps-hangu-police' target='_blank'><strong>9 terrorists killed, 3 officials injured in joint operation in KP’s Hangu: police</strong></a><br><p>Nine terrorists were killed and three officers including the district police officer were injured in an exchange of fire during an operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu district, police said on Saturday.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Earlier, a statement by KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed said that security forces and police carried out a joint operation in Hangu’s Zargari Shinawari area.
“Nine terrorists killed in Hangu operation, District Police Officer Khalid Khan undergoing treatment at the Kohat Combined Military Hospital,” the statement by Kohat Regional Police Officer DIG Abbas Majeed said.
The operation is continuing successfully and full action is being taken against the terrorists, the statement added.
Hangu DPO Khan, who was injured during the operation, is undergoing surgery at the Kohat CMH. His condition is said to be satisfactory, the statement added.
Federal Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi telephoned DPO Hangu and appreciated his bravery and determination.
“The interior minister said that the nation will never forget the sacrifices of its brave sons and is determined to achieve final victory in the war against terrorism,” the statement added.
“During the operation, there was a heavy exchange of fire between the terrorists and the law enforcement personnel,” the earlier statement by the KP IGP read.
“Security forces fought bravely and killed five terrorists. However, Hangu DPO Khalid Khan, the Doaba station house officer (SHO), and an officer of the security forces were injured in the exchange of fire,” it added.
The statement said that DPO Khan “was hit by three bullets”, while his condition was said to be stable.
Police were making arrangements for a helicopter to airlift DPO Khalid from the Hangu hospital to Peshawar for further treatment, Imran Khan, personal secretary to IG Hameed, told Dawn.com.
IG Hameed spoke to the injured officers and enquired about their well-being, according to the police statement.
“Law enforcement agencies are determined to continue their fight against terrorism,” the statement added.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.
 
 

On June 21, KP police killed a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.
In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a suicide attack in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
Earlier this week, three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu district.
On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a joint operation by the CTD.

Earlier this month, Pakistan assumed presidency of the UNSC, marking the country’s eighth term on the 15-member body and its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.
Dar will visit the US to “attend the high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency in New York, as well as for certain engagements in Washington”, the FO said in a statement.
The statement, which did not specify the dates of Dar’s visit, mentioned at least four UNSC-affiliated events that he will attend. His expected engagements in Washington, the hub of the White House, come amid ongoing trade talks between the countries.
 






To express Pakistan’s “strong commitment and unwavering support” for the right to self-determination of Palestinians, Dar will also attend a high-level conference on the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the implementation of Two-State Solution”.
The conference was originally planned for June but was postponed due to the Iran-Israel war, which also led to the rescheduling of Dar’s visit. According to The Guardian, the moot will now be held on July 28 and 29.
While in New York, Dar will chair a high-level open debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”. The debate will aim at exploring ways to strengthen multilateralism and enhance diplomacy and mediation for the peaceful settlement of disputes, the FO said.
In addition, the deputy premier will preside over the UNSC’s Quarterly Open Debate on the “Situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian Question”.
Pakistan’s high-level participation in UNSC’s Quarterly Debate on the Middle East, as well as the global conference on the Palestine question, “is a testimony to Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to and support for the Palestinian cause”, the FO stressed.
 
 

Dar will also chair a high-level UNSC briefing that will focus on enhancing cooperation between the UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The meeting will be held as part of Pakistan’s efforts to “strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for the maintenance of international peace and security”, according to the FO.
During his stay in New York, Dar is also expected to have several bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials.
“Dar’s visit to New York and Washington exemplifies Pakistan’s growing role and importance in the multilateral arena as well as its expanding multifaceted relations with the US,” the FO highlighted.
On Friday, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer as part of another round of trade negotiations to avoid a 29 per cent tariff.
US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an unprecedented meeting.
Earlier in the week, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, once again called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Speaking at the UNSC’s Briefing on the Humanitarian Situation in Gaza, he called on the international community to act without delay.
Earlier this month, Pakistan had urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in conflict-battered Gaza, where Israeli military operations continue to claim civilian lives and take a devastating toll on infrastructure.</p><small>2025-07-19 12:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/191643194c1a0b0.jpg?r=170351' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925217/karachis-business-community-partially-heeds-strike-call-against-new-fbr-powers' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi’s business community partially heeds strike call against new FBR powers</strong></a><br><p>The business community in Karachi observed a partial strike on Saturday against the tax measures and arrest powers of the federal tax authority under the Finance Act FY26.
The call for a countrywide strike was issued last week by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), backed by trade bodies, industrial area associations, petroleum dealers, transporters, and chain store operators. The KCCI protested against what they described as anti-business measures and proposed provincial labour policies.
“A partial strike was observed in Karachi on the call of industrialists and supported by traders of markets against enhancing  FBR’s powers to conduct raids and arrests of businessmen,” All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn.com.
All Karachi Tajir Ittehad is an association of markets and shopkeepers in the metropolis.
Mir said that the markets at Gul Plaza, Teen Talwar in Clifton and Nursery remained open. However, the majority of traders have supported the strike, though some of the traders have reservations over the nature of demands, he said.
“The demands of small traders were not included, particularly regarding the raids on shops and closure of shops on the pretext of being in poor condition,” he added.
A leader of the markets in the Old City areas, Sharjeel Goplani, told Dawn.com, “A partial strike was observed as Lea Market, Urdu Bazaar as well as Timber and Furniture markets remained open.”
 
 

The expanded enforcement powers for the FBR include the authority to block high-value financial transactions by non-filers — such as vehicle and property purchases, investment in securities and mutual funds, and opening certain prestigious bank accounts — along with powers to seal unregistered business premises, confiscate goods and recover taxes from firms, including those in the public sector. The move has generated criticism from many quarters.
The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry had also announced its participation in the strike, condemning the enhanced powers granted to FBR officials and the lack of consultation with the private sector.
A day earlier, the business community appeared divided over the strike with Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry Senior Vice-President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon claiming that chambers and trade associations had agreed to defer the strike following a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries Haroon Akhtar Khan.</p><small>2025-07-19 12:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/191220223dda95c.jpg?r=131135' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925200/local-mountaineer-iftikhar-hussain-dies-as-4-caught-in-k2-avalanche' target='_blank'><strong>Local mountaineer Iftikhar Hussain dies as 4 caught in K2 avalanche</strong></a><br><p>The body of local mountaineer Iftikhar Hussain who lost his life when his four-member international expedition team was caught in an avalanche on the K2 peak was brought to his hometown of Gilgit-Baltistan’s Skardu on Saturday, officials said.
K2, standing at 8,611 metres above sea level, is the second-highest peak in the world, attracting a host of local and foreign tourists. Last summer, GB authorities issued a total of 175 permits to climbers aspiring to conquer the mountain, despite the treacherous climb and harsh weather conditions.
The senior vice president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP), Karrar Haidri, told Dawn.com that at approximately 12:30pm on Friday, an avalanche struck Camp 1 on K2, located about 500m above the base camp. Four climbers were caught in the avalanche.
“A foreign climber sustained minor injuries, while two others successfully returned to the Advance Base Camp,” Haidri said in a statement. However, high-altitude porter Iftikhar Hussain from Sadpara in Skardu lost his life in the incident.
The other climbers were Dawa Finjo Sherpa and Dawa Geljen Sherpa from Nepal, and high-altitude porter Niaz Ali from Skardu. The international team was returning from Camp 2 during their rotation for the summit at the time of the incident.
Tour operator Syed Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that the deceased mountaineer’s body and Finjo, the injured Nepali climber, were brought from the K2 base camp to Skardu by Army Aviation helicopters on Saturday.
Hussain’s body was handed over to his family for burial, he added. Finjo was in stable condition and undergoing treatment at a government hospital in Skardu.
Two helicopters of the Pakistan Army Aviation Corps took part in the operation, Anwar said.
 
 

The expedition outfitter submitted a formal request to ACP President Major General Irfan Arshad and Askari Aviation for a helicopter operation to repatriate the deceased following the incident.
The request was approved by the army’s General Headquarters on humanitarian grounds.
Earlier this month, a tourist from the Czech Republic, Klára Kolouchová, died after falling into a ravine at the Nanga Parbat base camp in GB.
Kolouchová, 46, was part of a multinational expedition atte­m­pting to summit the mountain. Her health reportedly deteriorated at Camp 4, forcing her to abort the climb and begin her de­­s­­­cent with Nepali Sherpa Tara­man Tamang.</p><small>2025-07-19 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/19160906197ae23.png?r=162841' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925215/syrian-presidency-says-ceasefire-in-place-urges-parties-to-respect-it' target='_blank'><strong>Syrian presidency says ceasefire in place, urges parties to respect it</strong></a><br><p>Syria’s interim government said its security forces were deploying in the predominantly-Druze southern city of Sweida on Saturday and urged all parties to respect a ceasefire, after days of factional bloodshed that has left hundreds dead.
Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, in a separate speech, said that “Arab and American” mediation had helped bring calm, and criticised Israel for airstrikes against Syrian government forces in the south and Damascus during the week.
Sweida province has been engulfed by nearly a week of violence, which began with clashes between Bedouin fighters and Druze factions, before Damascus sent in government security forces.
Israel has carried out airstrikes in southern Syria and on the defence ministry in Damascus, saying it is protecting the Druze minority, of whom there are a significant number in Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
In a statement on Saturday, the Syrian presidency announced an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and urged all parties to end hostilities immediately.
 
 

The interior ministry said internal security forces had begun deploying in Sweida.
The death toll from violence in Sweida province, heartland of Syria’s Druze minority, has risen to 940 since last weekend, a war monitor said, despite the announcement of a ceasefire.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that the dead included 326 Druze fighters and 262 Druze civilians, 182 of whom were “summarily executed by defence and interior ministry personnel”.
They also included 312 government security personnel and 21 Sunni Bedouin, three of them civilians who were “summarily executed by Druze fighters”.
Another 15 government troops were killed in Israeli strikes, the observatory said.
Sharaa called for calm and said Syria would not be a “testing ground for partition, secession, or sectarian incitement”.
“The Israeli intervention pushed the country into a dangerous phase that threatened its stability,” he said in a televised speech.
US envoy Tom Barrack announced on Friday that Syria and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire supported by Turkiye, Jordan and neighbours.
Barrack, who is both US ambassador to Turkiye and Washington’s Syria envoy, urged Druze, Bedouins and Sunnis to put down their weapons “and, together with other minorities, build a new and united Syrian identity”.
Israel has attacked Syrian military facilities and weaponry in the seven months since Sharaa’s forces toppled President Bashar al-Assad, and says it wants areas of southern Syria near its border to remain demilitarised.
On Friday, an Israeli official said Israel had agreed to allow Syrian forces limited access to the Sweida area for the next two days.

RIAT, which runs from July 18 to 20, is one of the world’s largest military airshows, has been running for over 50 years and powers the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, according to its website.
On Thursday, a PAF contingent comprising “state-of-the-art JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter aircraft and the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, landed at the Royal Air Force Base Fairford in the UK to participate in the prestigious” RIAT 2025, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
 






The JF-17 Block-III was awarded the “Spirit of the Meet Trophy” for its “striking livery and the incredible journey from Pakistan with non-stop air-to-air refuelling,” PTV reported.
According to ISPR’s press release earlier this week, the JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker.
 






Meanwhile, the C-130H Hercules was awarded the “Concours d’Elegance Trophy”.
 






“These awards were given in recognition of the aircrafts’ excellent flying and technical skills,” PTV said.
It added that the JF-17C Block III represents Pakistan’s “advanced defence technology”.
“This success has honoured Pakistan’s aviation sector on an international level.”
PTV called the success at RIAT a “testament to the recognition of the capabilities of the Pakistan Air Force”.
In May, when Pakistan downed Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the Pakistan-India conflict, the PAF formally acknowledged a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down them down.
The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.
“There is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III,” the statement said.
“The aircraft’s combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.”</p><small>2025-07-19 10:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/191400387ce4a95.png?r=145832' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925210/aurangzeb-eyes-game-changer-investment-discussions-with-us' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb eyes ‘game-changer’ investment discussions with US</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said the government aims to follow the ongoing trade talks with the United States by discussing investment, terming it a potential “game-changer” for economic ties between the two countries.
He made the remarks after meeting with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer on Friday as part of a critical round of trade talks aimed at securing tariff relief and expanding bilateral economic cooperation.
“One thing we discussed was that we have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative, which is obviously very critical, but besides that, for the Pakistan-US relationship to be brought to the next level and bring in a real step change, [there is] an investment imperative that will hopefully emerge,” Aurangzeb said in a video statement.
“Areas [for investment] have already been identified,” the minister said, mentioning minerals and mining, artificial intelligence, digital infrastructure and cryptocurrency.
“We feel this will be a real game-changer, God-willing, in terms of the economic relationship between Pakistan and the United States.”
 






Aurangzeb added that both sides committed to begin their talks with trade and follow them through “very quickly with investment discussions between the two countries and real execution of the investment upside that is available, so that it becomes a win-win” for Pakistan and the US.
The minister termed his dialogue with Lutnick and Greer “very constructive”. Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, who were present during the meeting, accompanied Aurangzeb in the video statement.
“Positive progress over the last few weeks and months was reviewed. Equally importantly, we focused on the slightly outstanding aspects,” the finance czar said, adding there was a clear commitment from both sides to “get closure” on those items.
The minister highlighted that as the US was Pakistan’s largest trading partner, it was quite critical to move forward in the “same spirit” in which the recent discussions had taken place.
“In the next few days, we hope that the coming leadership-level announcements will reflect all the hard work and efforts that have been put in both by Pakistan and the US side,” Aurangzeb said.
Pakistan aims to finalise a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of a 29 per cent tariff on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products. While Trump has announced tariffs for some countries, talks with others are ongoing ahead of his extended August 1 deadline.
Earlier this month, the countries reached an initial understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country’s key export sectors. A formal announcement on any deal is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.
A source close to the US administration has mentioned a further deadline: “The president wants concrete deliverables before the August 15 deadline. Countries that stall may find themselves on the wrong end of a tariff wall.”
A senior Pakistani official involved in the negotiations said: “We’re not here for aid. We’re here for serious negotiations and a possible deal. It’s about mutual benefit now — trade, not dependence.”
 
 

Behind the scenes, influential US-based businessmen with stakes in cryptocurrency and rare earth mineral ventures have quietly supported Pakistan’s efforts to gain greater access to American markets.
In April, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) partnered with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by US President Donald Trump. Earlier that month, a US delegation expressed Washington’s strategic interest in the country’s mineral sector.</p><small>2025-07-19 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1913290655652e2.png?r=135108' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925204/trump-sues-media-magnate-rupert-murdoch-wsj-over-epstein-sex-bombshell' target='_blank'><strong>Trump sues media magnate Rupert Murdoch, WSJ over Epstein sex bombshell</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump sued media magnate Rupert Murdoch and The Wall Street Journal for at least $10 billion on Friday over the publication of a bombshell article on his friendship with the infamous alleged sex trafficker of underage girls, Jeffrey Epstein.
The defamation lawsuit, filed in federal court in Miami, saw the 79-year-old Republican hitting back at a scandal threatening to cause serious political damage.
“We have just filed a powerhouse lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, fake news ‘article’ in the useless ‘rag’ that is The Wall Street Journal,” Trump posted on Truth Social late on Friday.
 






The Journal reported on Thursday that in 2003, the then-real estate magnate wrote a suggestive birthday letter to Epstein, illustrated with a naked woman and alluding to a shared “secret”.
The lawsuit, which also names two reporters, the Dow Jones corporation and Murdoch’s parent company News Corp as defendants, claims that no such letter exists and that the paper intended to malign Trump with a story that has now been viewed by hundreds of millions of people.
“And given the timing of the defendants’ article, which shows their malicious intent behind it, the overwhelming financial and reputational harm suffered by President Trump will continue to multiply,” it said.
Dow Jones, the Journal‘s longtime publisher, responded to Trump’s libel suit on Friday, saying that it is standing by the story.
“We have full confidence in the rigour and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit,” a Dow Jones spokesperson said in a statement.
Alleged cover-up
In another bid to dampen outrage among his own supporters about an alleged government cover-up of Epstein’s activities and 2019 death, Trump ordered US Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony from the prosecution against the disgraced financier.
In a filing in New York, Bondi cited “extensive public interest” for the unusual request to release what is typically secret testimony.
 






Epstein, a longtime friend of Trump and multiple high-profile men, was found hanging dead in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial on charges that he sexually exploited dozens of underage girls at his homes in New York and Florida.
The case sparked conspiracy theories, especially among Trump’s far-right voters, about an alleged international cabal of wealthy pedophiles. Epstein’s death — declared a suicide — before he could face trial supercharged the narrative.
When Trump returned to power for a second term this January, his supporters clamoured for revelations about Epstein’s supposed list of clients. But Bondi issued an official memo this month declaring there was no such list.
The discontent in Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base poses a rare challenge to the Republican’s control of the political narrative in the United States.
It remained unclear whether a court would authorise the unsealing of the grand jury testimony.
But even if such material were made public, there is no assurance that it would shed much, if any, light on the main questions raised in the conspiracy theories — particularly the existence and possible contents of an Epstein client list.
Asked on Friday by reporters if he would pursue the broader release of information related to the case, Trump did not answer.
Naked woman and signature
Trump was close with Epstein for years, and the two were photographed and videotaped together at parties, although there has never been evidence of wrongdoing.
The Wall Street Journal article published late on Thursday was damaging because it indicated a shared interest in sex.
The Journal reported that Trump had wished Epstein a happy 50th birthday in 2003 with a “bawdy” letter, part of an album of messages from rich and well-known figures.
According to the Journal, the Trump letter contained the outline of a naked woman, apparently drawn with a marker, and had the future president’s signature “Donald” mimicking pubic hair. It ends, according to the newspaper, with “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret”.
Trump reacted in a series of furious social media posts, saying, “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”
 






“I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said.
US media has published multiple drawings done by Trump in the past, with several dating to the early 2000s when he used his celebrity status to donate sketches for charity.</p><small>2025-07-19 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/19105400c1b2c26.jpg?r=105445' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193/trump-says-5-jets-were-shot-down-in-india-pakistan-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says 5 jets were shot down in India-Pakistan conflict</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Friday that five jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict that began after a deadly attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, with the situation calming after a ceasefire in May.
Trump, who made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, did not specify which side’s jets he was referring to.
Pakistan had said it downed six Indian planes after the latter carried out deadly attacks in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, while New Delhi had claimed it had downed “a few planes”.
“Something I’m very proud of [is that] we stopped a lot of wars. A lot of wars. And these were serious, serious wars; would have been going on,” Trump said.
“You had India-Pakistan that was going, and in fact, planes were being shot out of the air. Five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down actually,” Trump said while talking about the India-Pakistan hostilities, without elaborating or providing further detail.
“It was getting worse and worse, wasn’t it? […] These are two serious nuclear countries and they were hitting each other. It seems like a new form of warfare; you saw it recently, when you looked at what we did in Iran when we knocked out their nuclear capability, totally knocked out,” he said, referring to the US strikes on Iran’s three nuclear sites.
 


Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later stating that figure as six. India’s highest-ranking general said in late May that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.
As New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam attack, which Islamabad denied, the Pakistan Air Force downed five Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
While India claimed downing jets, Islamabad has denied any losses of planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets were hit after its three air bases were targeted.
Trump has repeatedly said he prevented a “nuclear war” between Pakistan and India after Washington held talks with both sides, even crediting Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping in it. India has differed with Trump’s claims that it resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.
 
 

Most recently, on July 7, the Trump administration doubled down on its narrative of Trump playing a central role in defusing tensions, despite India claiming otherwise.
Asked about Indian officials’ repeated denials of Trump’s role, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided taking a position. “So many comments speak for themselves,” she said.
Pressed further, Bruce added, half in jest: “Everyone will have an opinion. That’s an opinion. Some opinions are wrong. Mine rarely are, but other people’s opinions can be wrong.”
Trump’s statements stand in contrast to India’s official position, which maintains that New Delhi acted independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump’s remarks support Pakistan’s view that quiet US diplomacy — and direct intervention from the White House — helped calm tensions.
India’s position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.
 
 

India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington’s effort to counter China’s influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a strong partner in counterterrorism.
The April attack in Pahalgam killed 26 men and sparked heavy fighting between the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry.
New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation. Washington condemned the attack but did not directly blame Islamabad.</p><small>2025-07-19 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/191129143d57499.jpg?r=112921' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925084/judges-opposing-cj-dogars-transfer-sidelined-in-committee-reshuffling' target='_blank'><strong>Judges opposing CJ Dogar’s transfer sidelined in committee reshuffling</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Five senior judges of Islamabad High Court (IHC), who challenged the transfer of the incumbent Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar from the Lahore High Court (LHC), have been sidelined in the recent reshuffling of key committees.

The formation of the new committee follows a major administrative reshuffle at the IHC which has notably curtailed the powers of senior puisne judge Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani. Previously considered one of the most influential judges in the court, Justice Kayani has been excluded from the administrative committee and the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC), and has also lost his role as the inspection judge.

Previously considered one of most influential judges in court, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani loses role as inspection judge

Sources said the new DPC would comprise Justice Soomro and Justice Azam Khan.
These developments come in the wake of amendments to Rule 237 and Rule 239 of Chapter 10 of the High Court Rules, which now grant the chief justice discretionary powers to appoint members of the administrative committee and define the duties of each administration judge.
It may be mentioned that Justice Babar Sattar along with four other judges has reportedly expressed serious concerns over the amendments in the rule, arguing that it undermines judicial seniority and due process.
Five judges initially challenged the transfer and subsequent change in the senior list of the IHC before the then chief justice Aamer Farooq.
Following dismissal of their representation, they approached the Supreme Court. However, the apex court also declined their request to reverse the seniority.
The Judicial Commission of Pakistan then approved the appointment of Justice Dogar as the chief justice of IHC.
 
 

The five judges, on the other hand, have filed an intra-court appeal against the SC’s constitutional bench decision of upholding the seniority of the IHC that raised Justice Dogar to the top.
The five judges have requested the Supreme Court not to consider justices Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Asif as judges of IHC until they take fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194.
The appeal contended that Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act 2010 only provides for the appointment of judges to the IHC from other provinces but makes no reference to transfers.
The appeal contended that the June 19 order impermissibly reads in “permanent” in Article 200(1) and (2) of the Constitution when no such language was contained in the provision.
The appeal pleaded that the constitutional bench had misunderstood the provisions of Article 200 by reading sub-article (1) in isolation from other provisions of the article by not holding that transfers envisioned in Article 200(1) were only for a temporary and time-specified period.

Sabri qawwal Ahmed Sabri, his young son, Raza Sabri ,and their fellow musician, Mohammed Asif, were shot dead while several others, including four other musicians, were wounded in an indiscriminate shooting carried out by terrorists on a bus that was on its way to Quetta from Karachi. The victims were going to perform at an event planned for Wednesday in Quetta.
Their funeral prayers were held at the KMC park in PIB Colony after  Juma, which was attended by a large number of people, including  political leaders, city dignitaries and the musicians’ fans.

Later, the victims were laid to rest at a local graveyard.
Governor blames RAW for terrorism wave
Talking to the media, the governor said that there was ‘evidence’ that Indian intelligence agency Research Analysis Wing (RAW) was involved in the recent wave of terrorism in Pakistan.
He said the motive of the hostile neighbour was to spread chaos in the country, but the Pakistani nation was united to foil such nefarious designs.
He said the nation along with the armed forces of Pakistan had given a befitting reply to the enemy on May 10. The governor vowed to give an active response to RAW and its facilitators.
Talking to reporters, MQM-P leader Dr Sattar said that the situation in Balochistan had deteriorated to an extent that innocent passengers from other parts of the country were being targeted.
He said that his party would not sit idle until “RAW and Indian proxies are eliminated from Pakistani soil”.

“The United States did not support recent Israeli strikes,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters.
“We are engaging diplomatically with Israel and Syria at the highest levels, both to address the present crisis and reach a lasting agreement between the two sovereign states,” she said.
She declined to say if the United States had expressed its displeasure with Israel or whether it would oppose future strikes on Syria.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio voiced concern when asked about the Israeli strikes, which included attacking the defence ministry in Damascus.

Fresh clashes rock Druze heartland

He later issued a statement that did not directly address the Israeli strikes, but voiced broader concern about the violence.
Israel said it was intervening on behalf of the Druze community after communal clashes.

Meanwhile, Bedouin tribes and Druze fighters clashed again in the latter’s Sweida heartland on Friday, a day after the Syrian army withdrew under Israeli bombardment and diplomatic pressure.

“The MPAs whose districts have experienced devastation [due to rains and flooding] should identify those areas, and the government will compensate farmers for their losses there,” the minister stated in response to a demand by the treasury MPA, Mehwish Sultana, seeking that the flood-affected areas be declared calamity-hit.
Acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the ongoing monsoon, the minister said: “We have received more rainfall than expected during the season,” confirming that the government has decided to provide financial assistance to compensate for the damages caused by the rains. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz would soon announce financial aid for the bereaved families of those who died in the calamities, while those who have suffered financial losses will also be compensated,“ he added.
 
 

The session also saw a heated debate regarding alleged corruption within the Auqaf and Religious Affairs Department. Treasury member Ahsan Raza directly accused the shrines’ custodians (matawallis) of corruption and demanded accountability for the funds donated to various shrines. “Where has the money from philanthropists gone? We are facing corruption,” the MPA said.
Admitting corruption within the department, Parliamentary Secretary for Auqaf, Malik Waheed, said: “Which department doesn’t have corruption, but we are trying to run the system in a better way.” He, however, urged the members to provide evidence of corruption. “If corruption has occurred anywhere in the department, point it out, and I will conduct an audit and present it to the house.”
During the session, three new legislative drafts were introduced by Punjab Law Minister Sohaib Bharath – The Punjab Agricultural Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2025, The Punjab Horticulture Authority Bill 2025, and The Punjab Senior Citizens Welfare Bill 2025.
Acting Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar referred all the bills to the relevant committees for review for a period of two months.
Upon completing the agenda, the chair adjourned the assembly proceedings until 2pm on Tuesday. Before adjourning, he announced that the Senate election for a general seat in Punjab would be held in the assembly on Monday. Voting will take place from 9am to 4pm. Special cards have been issued to MPAs for the polls and no one will be allowed to cast a vote without the card, he said.
Earlier, the session began over two hours behind its schedule. Prayers (Fateha) were offered for those who lost their lives in the recent floods, rains and storms across the province.
Opposition’s ‘public assembly’
In a show of solidarity with their suspended colleagues, the opposition PTI lawmakers staged a “public assembly” outside the provincial house. This unconventional session served as a platform for the opposition to voice their strong criticism of the government on various fronts, including the handling of recent floods, rising commodity prices and alleged political victimisation.
Ejaz Shafi, acting as the speaker for this “outdoor” assembly, allowed the opposition members to speak on points of order.
MPA Imtiaz Sheikh fiercely criticised the government, stating that the development projects being showcased by the administration have been “washed away in floodwaters.” Retired Col Shoaib Awan and Tayyab Rashid also joined in, accusing the chief minister of engaging in political theatrics and suppressing the opposition. They highlighted the dire situation in Punjab, asserting that the province is “drowning,” crops are submerged and houses are destroyed, yet the government remains “indifferent.”
Opposition Leader in the Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar declared, “Until our suspended members are reinstated, we will not enter the assembly.” He painted a grim picture of Punjab’s current state, saying that the situation has become “quite critical.”
Bhachar criticised the government’s response to the floods, saying the calamity has exposed the weaknesses of its development projects. He pointed out the massive human cost, with “63 people dead and 290 injured” due to rains and floods, asking, “Who is responsible for this?”
He also attacked the government on economic issues, highlighting the drastic increase in petrol prices from Rs134 to Rs272 in a coupleof years, asking, “Who is the thief?” He further alleged that the sugar mafia has taken over the province.
Bhachar highlighted the alleged restrictions on incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan in meeting the party leaders and workers in jail. He accused the government of “doing everything to suppress the PTI.”
He also presented a resolution against the devastation caused by floods and the soaring prices of sugar and petrol, that was passed by the “public assembly.” Following the completion of the agenda, Shafi adjourned the “session” indefinitely.

Shocked and frustrated at the unexpected resistance, the dacoits’ associates standing outside vented their anger at the walls and fired indiscriminately at all houses in the locality, wounding a passer-by, said local sources.
The sources said that over 15 members of notorious Rajab alias Rajjo Jatoi gang barged into the houses of Mohammad Ali Sheikh and his brothers and tried to rob the inmates when the men were at work.
However, to their utter surprise, the unarmed women bravely resisted them by using sticks, bricks and anything they could lay their hands on. Finally, they succeeded to push back the intruders and lock themselves up in their houses, they said.
During the ensuing commotion, the other dacoits standing outside fired indiscriminately at all the houses in the locality, creating fear and forcing inmates to lock their doors, said eyewitnesses, adding a young man from Jamali community sustained gunshot wound to his arm during the fierce firing.
The sources said that the gang managed to escape from the area before men of the Sheikh community rushed back to their homes. 
The area police, who were posted at a short distance from the scene, allegedly arrived an hour late and merely asked residents of the locality if anyone was dead and injured in the firing, said the sources.
A video clip went viral on social media following the incident, which purportedly showed Rajab Jatoi, ring leader of the Jatoi gang, threatening the Sheikh community of dire consequences.

The tariff is based on an average five per cent unrecoverable bills and is indexed to inflation and exchange rate variations for a six-year period ending in FY30.
The newly approved multi-year tariff (FY24-FY30) for KE is over Rs8 per unit higher than the national average tariff of Rs31.59 per unit notified for the current year. This means taxpayers will bear the additional cost through the federal budget in order to maintain uniform electricity rates across the country.
“Notwithstanding the notification of the attached decision of the Authority, the consumers of K-Electric shall not be charged the tariff outlined therein; rather, they shall be charged the uniform tariff as applicable to the consumers of ex-Wapda Discos as determined by Nepra and notified under the Act from time to time, in accordance with paragraph 5.6.3 of the National Electricity Policy, 2021”, Nepra said in gazette notification issued on Friday.
Last month, the Power Division announced that it had challenged Nepra’s May 27 determination on KE’s multi-year tariff, alleging that it had extended nearly Rs750 billion in undue financial favour to the private utility over seven years — at the cost of the national exchequer, consumers across the country, and taxpayers.
In a statement issued on June 2, the Power Division said that six separate tariff interventions approved by the regulator would result in a financial impact of about Rs453bn over seven years. Additionally, the higher fuel cost benchmark for FY25 alone would result in an extra Rs41bn burden, which, even if held flat, could amount to Rs287bn over the full control period.
Despite the formal challenge, Nepra did not acknowledge the Power Division’s review petition in its gazette notification.
The Power Division further alleged that Nepra had allowed KE to include losses in its tariff that were not actually incurred, with an estimated seven-year financial impact of over Rs200bn. It maintained that only actual losses, following a proper write-off process, should be permitted.

Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Senior Vice-President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon claimed that chambers and trade associations had agreed to defer the strike following a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Industries Haroon Akhtar Khan, attended by various chambers via Zoom.
The strike call was initially issued by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), backed by trade bodies, industrial area associations, petroleum dealers, transporters, and chain store operators.
“We have not supported the KCCI strike as it was announced by one chamber alone,” Mr Magoon said. He maintained that the FPCCI, representing chambers from across the country — including Faisalabad, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Sialkot, Multan, Khanewal, Sheikhupura, Sargodha, Quetta, and Peshawar — had unanimously decided to postpone the strike after the government agreed to address major concerns related to the Finance Act 2025.
“Only the KCCI and the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) are not on the same page,” he added, dismissing the possibility of a decisive nationwide strike.

FPCCI ‘postpones’ strike; Karachi Chamber sticks to shutdown in absence of written commitment

However, KCCI President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani insisted that a peaceful strike would be observed on Saturday, having secured backing from numerous trade and industrial organisations. “If the government fails to provide written assurances following our meeting with SAPM Haroon Akhtar, we will be compelled to extend the strike. We are not satisfied with verbal commitments,” Mr Bilwani said, warning that further shutdowns could extend to multiple days or even the full week.
 
 

Criticising the bureaucracy, he noted, “Businessmen work seven days a week, while government officials work only five.”
He warned that unresolved issues may force industries to relocate abroad, particularly to Dubai.
KCCI has expressed serious objections to Sections 37A and 37B of the Sales Tax Act, which it says grant sweeping and arbitrary powers to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Mr Bilwani said the decision to go ahead with the strike was reaffirmed after an unfruitful meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on July 16, during which demands to suspend five key anti-business measures remained unmet.
These include the immediate withdrawal of Sections 37A and 37B, repeal of Section 21(S) which penalises cash transactions above Rs200,000, scrapping of Section 40C mandating the e-Bilty system, revocation of SRO 709 introducing a disputed digital invoicing system, and restoration of the Final Tax Regime (FTR) for exporters.
LCCI President Mian Abu Zar Shaad stated that the chamber had decided to join the strike in solidarity with the broader business community. “The problems persist despite meetings with the government. We now demand implementation rather than assurances,” he said.
Meanwhile, FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh told the media that a charter of demands had been presented to Mr Haroon, who agreed to withdraw the contentious measures. “There will be no strike on Saturday,” Mr Sheikh claimed, adding that the SAPM’s recommendations would be forwarded to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

In a message on the occasion of Kashmir Accession Day, he affirmed that the government and people of Pakistan will continue to extend diplomatic, moral and political support to Kashmiris.
“Kashmir Accession Day is celebrated every year on July 19, in memory of the Srinagar session of the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference held in 1947,” he noted.
 
 

“On that day, the brave people of Kashmir passed a resolution to accede to Pakistan for the state of Jammu and Kashmir.”
He said the story of the Kashmiri people’s unending sacrifices, which began in 1947, continues to this day. Despite the brutal oppression, the “spirit of Kashmiri people remains unbroken. In fact, their desire for freedom has only grown stronger over time”.

In a three-two majority decision, the CB had ruled that the transfer of three judges from different high courts to the IHC was in accordance with the Constitution.
The petition, filed through senior counsel Idrees Ashraf on behalf of ex-PM Khan, contended that the June 19 judgement treated permanently transferred judges differently in terms of emoluments and privileges under Article 200, creating inequality among similarly placed judges — a move that is discriminatory and unconstitutional.
This is the eighth such appeal filed before the apex court. The earlier petitions were by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — as well as by the Lahore High Court Bar Association, Lahore Bar Association, Karachi Bar Association, PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen, Raja Muqsid Nawaz Khan and Riasat Ali Azad.
In his petition, Mr Khan argued that the CB had failed to distinguish between the “functions” and “powers” of the president under the Constitution, as he performed functions only on the advice of the cabinet or the prime minister.
The reference to “powers” in the June 19 order, the petition argued, erroneously implied autonomy that was constitutionally impermissible. Article 200 neither granted nor implied any independent discretion to the president to initiate or finalise judicial transfers, the petition said, adding that as a ceremonial head, the president always acted on the advice of the executive.

Argues CB order eroded judicial independence, bypassed appointment process, violated equality among judges

The CB erred in remanding the matter to determine whether the transfer was “temporary” or “permanent”, describing it as a judicial question. Delegating it to the president, the petition added, undermined judicial autonomy and violated the principle of separation of powers.
 
 

Articles 200(1) and 200(2), which have existed in tandem since the 1956 Constitution, indicated that judicial transfers were temporary, the petition  contended, adding that Clause (2), which stated that the transferee judge continued affiliation with the original high court, reinforced this temporariness.
Interpreting such transfers as “permanent” required inserting language not found in the constitutional text — a judicial overreach amounting to rewriting the Constitution, the petition stated.
Unlike India, where Article 217 explicitly declares a vacancy upon transfer, Pakistan’s Constitution does not create such a vacancy.
Therefore, a transferred judge retained affiliation with their parent high court and original seniority, the petition said.
Seniority, it argued, was an administrative matter within the judiciary, not an executive function. Allowing the president to determine seniority risked executive interference in the judicial hierarchy and autonomy, the petition contended.
Article 175-A governs judicial appointments and does not overlap with Article 200. Interpreting Article 200 to allow filling vacancies through transfers renders Article 175-A redundant and creates constitutional disharmony.
Moreover, treating permanently transferred judges differently in terms of emoluments and privileges under Article 200 results in inequality among similarly situated judges, which is discriminatory and unconstitutional.

During an interaction with a select group of reporters on Friday, Mr Naqvi said the plan was meant for the smooth coordination of the civil armed forces, which fall under the interior ministry, with the military and other stakeholders for effective counterterrorism operations.
One of the proposals was to ap­­point a retired or serving two-star general to head this wing, he added.
The minister noted that paramilitary and civil armed forces including the Frontier Corps, Rangers, Pakistan Coast Guard, Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts and newly established Federal Constabulary that fall under the administrative control of his ministry were involved in counterterrorism and counter-insurgency operations across Pakistan.
 
 

“There is a need for smooth coordination of the civil armed forces department with all stakeholders to improve delivery, efficiency, and end the pendency,” he said, explaining that several options were being considered including the appointment of a retired or serving major general to head this department.
He made it clear that such an appointee would work under the interior secretary and would have nothing to do with the working of other departments of the ministry, which deal with internal security, immigration and anti-corruption.
He said that the necessity of a federal force had arisen, which paved the way for the conversion of the Frontier Constabulary into a nationwide ‘Federal Constabu­lary’. He assured that the decision would have no impact on the personnel already serving in the force.

LAHORE / RAWALPINDI: After ten more people lost their lives across Punjab on Friday, it emerged that more than half of all rain-related deaths in the province have occurred in just the last 48 hours.
So far, 123 people have been killed and 462 injured since June 25 as the province received record rainfall, triggering urban flooding which inundated residential areas, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said.
Of these, 71 deaths were reported in the past two days alone, and there will be no respite from torrential rain as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued an alert for more downpours from July 20.
Another PDMA alert has warned of a high-level flood in the River Indus at Kalabagh and Chashma over the next 24 hours, with authorities being asked to take precautionary measures.
In a briefing on rescue operations carried out to evacuate people stranded in flooded areas, PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia said that said more than 1,000 people were shifted to safe places in the Pothohar region, including 398 in Jhelum, 209 in Chakwal, and 450 in Rawalpindi.
 


Death toll
Friday’s death toll includes three casualties each in Lahore and Chiniot, two in Okara and one each in Chakwal and Sargodha, according to data released by Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad.
In Chakwal, bodies of two persons who were swept away in torrents were recovered on Friday, while another died after being crushed under a roof which caved due to intense downpour, according to Rescue 1122.
The district was one of the worst-affected areas as it received record rainfall over the last three days. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif is expected to visit the district today.
According to Rescue 1122, the body of Tassaduque Hussain, who was swept away on Wednesday night in Saruli torrent near Pinwal village, was recovered near Chak Malook village on Friday noon.
The body of Abdul Rasheed, 42, who was also swept away by gushing water, was also recovered on Friday evening.
Separately, Muhamad Zubair, 36, was sleeping in a room near Aara village when a falling rock hit the roof, causing it to cave. Zubair died at the spot while the two other persons were injured.
Meanwhile, scores of villages in Chakwal were still plunged into darkness as the power supply could not be restored even after three days.
According to Iesco, 99 high tension and 48 low tension poles and 65 transformers were damaged due to intense rainfall.
Iesco Superintendent Engineer Waheed Ahmed Abbasi told Dawn it would take at least 48 hours to fully restore the power supply.
Fresh alert
The PMD and PDMA have issued fresh alerts about more downpours in Punjab and other parts of Pakistan.
The advisories, issued on Friday, directed provincial and district administrations to take precautionary measures as rains with wind and thundershowers are predicted from July 20.
The advisory warned of urban flooding and landslides.
According to the Met Office, monsoon currents are currently penetrating Sindh and the upper parts of the country and likely to intensify from July 20.

The sugar industry and meat export in Sudan, and encouraging Pakistani private sector stakeholders to explore investment in sugar processing, technology transfer, and slaughterhouse infrastructure are pivotal sectors in which Pakistan can join, Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain, told Sudanese Ambassador to Pakistan, Salih Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed Siddig, during a meeting here on Friday.
Reaffirming his commitment to transforming Pakistan into a hub of international agricultural cooperation, Mr Hussain said that such partnerships will not only contribute to regional prosperity but also align with Pakistan’s broader agenda of achieving sustainable development through strategic diplomacy and innovation in agriculture.
The minister enlightened the Sudanese envoy the ministry’s vision to forge new international agricultural alliances that align Pakistan’s strategic objectives of enhancing food security, boosting investment, and promoting South-South cooperation.

Minister tells Sudanese envoy such partnerships will enhance food security

The minister emphasised the deep-rooted cultural, religious, and historical relations between Pakistan and Sudan, describing them as a solid foundation for stronger collaboration in agricultural trade, education, and technology.
He briefed the Sudanese ambassador on Pakistan’s advanced research institutions and technical expertise in crop production, irrigation, and livestock health as ideal resources for Sudan’s agricultural development ambitions.
Sudanese Ambassador Salih Mohamed informed the minister about Sudan’s demographic composition and reaffirmed the goodwill and trust that exists between the two nations.
Mr Tanveer took note of the geopolitical situation in Sudan and appreciated the country’s efforts to maintain peace in the post-secession era.  He reiterated Pakistan’s readiness to cooperate in humanitarian and development domains through sustainable agriculture-based solutions.
He welcomed Sudan’s keen interest in educational collaboration, particularly in securing additional seats for Sudanese students at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad.
Mr Hussain further noted the health standards upheld by Sudan in its livestock exports to Gulf markets and recognised the country’s strength in producing disease-free meat.
He encouraged closer cooperation in veterinary science, breeding, and poultry management, ensuring Pakistan’s support in providing technical assistance where needed.
He also appreciated the contribution of the Pakistani diaspora in Sudan, especially in skilled trades and technical services.

Presiding over a meeting on civil service reforms, the PM said the civil service played a key role in the practical performance and implementation of the government’s policies across various ministries and sectors.
Calling the comprehensive and effective reform of the civil service a government’s priority, he directed the inclusion of input from public representatives and those of government officials in administrative and institutional reforms of the civil service.
Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal briefed the prime minister on the proposed civil service reforms. He said there was significant room for improvement in the current system of recruitment, promotion, training, and capacity building of government officials within the civil service structure.

Unveils plan to hand out e-bikes to students on merit; thousands of EVs to be provided on easy govt-supported loans

E-bikes for students
While heading a meeting on Electric Vehicles (EV), the PM said  encouraging the use of electric vehicles (EVs) would help save billions  of dollars in valuable foreign exchange spent on fuel, support  environmental protection efforts, and promote the local industry.
The prime minister directed officials to prepare a comprehensive action plan to make electric vehicles accessible to the common citizen. He announced that the federal government would provide electric bikes to top-performing students of all educational boards across the country including the federal board.
He vowed that jobless individuals would be provided with electric rickshaws and loaders on priority. He ordered a third-party validation of the entire process of EV distribution and the government support mechanism to ensure transparency.
The PM directed the launch of awareness campaign about the government assistance programmes for obtaining EVs.
A briefing was given in the meeting regarding the current status of EV manufacturers and the government’s supportive measures to make them accessible to the common people.
The meeting was informed that the government was taking steps to facilitate the acquisition of electric bikes, rickshaws, and loaders through low-cost loans and easy terms. It was further apprised that over 100,000 electric bikes and over 300,000 loaders would be made available to the public under easy loans and at low costs through government support.
The meeting was informed that under this scheme, students who perform well at the intermediate level would be provided free electric bikes, while a special quota of 25 per cent was allocated for women. The remaining quota was distributed among the provinces based on population ratio, the PM was briefed. However, he directed the officials concerned to increase Balochistan’s quota up to 10 per cent.
Due to this scheme, the meeting was told, four new battery manufacturing companies were commencing operations in the country.

• Plan hinges on withdrawal of five ‘disgruntled’ PTI candidates
• Peshawar chapter livid after its president denied ticket in favour of ‘affluent individual’
• Candidate denies late-night media reports on withdrawal from race
• JUI-F senator claims his party turned down ‘last-minute offer’ from PTI
PESHAWAR: As political parties hold negotiations over seat adjustments for the upcoming Senate elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the PTI’s Peshawar chapter seems to be at odds with the party leadership and has vowed to contest the polls independently.
On Thursday night, leaders of opposition parties had met Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur at the CM House to chalk out the modalities of seat adjustment.
The opposition delegation was led by KP Assembly Opposition Leader Dr Ibadullah.
Sources said that the initial understanding developed would see the PTI get six out of 11 Senate seats, comprising four general, one technocrat and one reserved for women.
In contrast, the opposition would receive five seats, including two seats each for JUI-F and PPP (one general and one technocrat each), and one general seat for the PML-N.
This agreement, however, hinges on the withdrawal of PTI candidates Irfan Saleem, Ayesha Bano, Irshad Hussain, Khurram Zeeshan and Waqas Orakzai. But these candidates are seemingly bent upon contesting elections and have refused to bow to party pressure.
In an attempt to defuse the crisis, the PTI’s top leadership, including Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and General Secretary Salman Akram Raja rushed to Peshawar and held talks with the dissidents on Friday.
At least two rounds of meetings remained inconclusive, and the party’s 38-member political committee was expected to make a final decision.
While there was no official word from either side till the filing of this report after midnight, media reports suggested the final round of PTI meeting ended, with the protesting aspirants agreeing to withdraw from the contest.
However, one of the candidates while talking to Dawn denied the media reports, explaining that they had not taken any such decision in the meeting.
Insiders said that the body may like to stick to the deal negotiated with the opposition. If that is the case, then the dissenting PTI figures are unlikely to withdraw their candidature.
Earlier, Irfan Saleem told Dawn that the PTI-opposition arrangement benefits only “pro-establishment elements”.
“Given the current scenario, we’re not ready to withdraw. The number of Senate seats PTI is getting under this arrangement is less than our actual strength in the provincial assembly,” he said.
But he added that if the PTI’s share in the Senate seats could be increased, they were ready to withdraw their candidacy.
‘Peshawar’s Imran Khan’
On the other hand, PTI’s Peshawar chapter has been up in arms against the party leadership for ignoring workers in the process of awarding Senate
tickets, and has threatened to stage a protest outside CM House and lay seige to the KP Assembly on polling day.
The rift deepened following the denial of a Senate ticket to Mr  Saleem, a longstanding party worker and president of PTI’s Peshawar chapter.
“Irfan Saleem is Peshawar’s Imran Khan,” said former district general secretary Jalal Khan at a press conference at Peshawar Press Club on Friday. He was joined by former city president Ihtisham Khan and several tehsil heads.
He said that Mr Saleem had been associated with the PTI for the last 23 years and has rendered tremendous sacrifices for the party before and after the May 9, 2023, violent protests.
“PTI workers in Peshawar were happy when Irfan Saleem was nominated, as he had previously been denied tickets for both the National and provincial assemblies,” he added.
Jalal Khan accused the leadership of dropping Mr Saleem in favour of affluent candidate Mirza Afridi.
He said Mr Saleem suffered a lot at the hands of the law enforcement agencies after the May 9 events, whereas Mr Afridi condemned the incident during a press conference, contrary to party policy.
He also alleged that Mr Saleem’s name was removed from the list of candidates through a conspiracy orchestrated by Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif.
On July 15, the PTI KP chapter had recommended five names to Chairman Barrister Gohar for general seats, including Murad Saeed, Irfan Saleem, Faisal Javed, Khurram Zeeshan and Azhar Mashwani.
A letter accompanying the recommendations said the names were listed “in order of priority, reflecting their dedication, service to the party and ability to represent PTI’s vision at the national level”.
However, Irfan Saleem’s name was dropped following a meeting between Imran Khan and Barrister Saif at Adiala Jail, reportedly to accommodate Mirza Afridi.
JUI-F ‘not interested’
Meanwhile, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza told DawnNewsTV on Friday that the PTI had also approached it for a potential alliance for the Senate elections.
Mr Murtaza said a senior PTI leader had recently contacted him to propose contesting the Senate elections jointly.
However, the JUI-F has turned down the offer, citing its prior  commitment to other opposition parties.
“I told PTI that we have already  given our word,” Mr Murtaza said, confirming that the JUI-F would not  entertain a last-minute alliance with PTI.

• Law introduced to meet EU’s GSP+ conditions requiring limitation of death penalty to the ‘most serious crimes’
• PTI leader slams govt over ‘poor’ disaster response
ISLAMABAD: A bill seeking to abolish the death penalty for harbouring hijackers and for publicly stripping a woman of her clothes was among the four bills passed by the Senate amidst voices of dissent from both sides of the aisle.
The Criminal Laws Amendment Bill, aimed at aligning Pakistan’s laws with its international obligations under the GSP+ trade agreement with the European Union (EU), which requires limiting capital punishment to the most serious crimes, was moved in the House by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry.
The bill proposes the replacement of the death penalty under Sections 354-A and 402-C of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) with life imprisonment.
Currently, Section 354-A states: “Whoever assaults or uses criminal force against any woman, strips her of her clothes, and exposes her in public shall be punished with death or life imprisonment, along with a fine.”
PTI’s parliamentary leader in the Senate Barrister Syed Ali Zafar remarked that the crime of stripping a woman in public is as serious as murder and stressed that death penalty for this offence should remain unchanged.
Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir questioned whether the death penalty for terrorism would be abolished.
Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) lawmaker Samina Mumtaz Zehri observed that the laws concerning crimes against women should be made stricter, not lenient. She warned that easing punishments would embolden criminals. She pointed out that the conviction rate in such cases is already low due to weak prosecution, and emphasised the need for reforms in the police and judicial systems.
“This is not right. This is not going to help the country or its people,” she said, opposing the amendment.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, however, argued that harsh sentences did not necessarily deter crime. He cited the example of European countries where death penalty did not exist, yet the crime rate ws just 2pc.
He added that in Pakistan, the death penalty currently applied to over a hundred offences. He noted the punishment for stripping a woman in public was originally seven-year imprisonment, and was converted to capital punishment during the regime of Gen Zia in 1982.
The Senate also passed the Extra­dition (Amendment) Bill to address procedural delays in extradition requests, and the Pakistan Citizen­ship Act (Amendment) Bill, enabling Pakistani diaspora members to resume their Pakistani citizenship.
Poor disaster response
Meanwhile, the government came under fire in the Senate over what was described as a lack of preparedness that led to loss of lives and immense suffering during the recent rains.
Speaking on a point of public importance, PTI’s Barrister Ali Zafar said: “The loss of precious lives and the severe hardships faced by the people due to the recent rains are a clear indication of the government’s unacceptable negligence and incompetence.”
He stressed that this was not the first instance. Despite early warnings from the meteorological department about the monsoon’s arrival, government institutions were not prepared.
He noted: “Roads and neighbourhoods were flooded, people were forced to spend nights on rooftops, and the state machinery remained a silent spectator. This wasn’t just a natural disaster — it was a failure of governance.”
He raised critical question is there any effective system in place at the government level to deal with emergencies or not? The people go through the same ordeal every year, and the government makes the same old promises and explanations every year.
He urged the chair that the House should be told: “Where were the NDMA and the provincial institutions? where was the emergency plan? what steps were taken to improve the electricity, water and sanitation systems? Why was immediate assistance not provided to the victims?
Mr Zafar demanded a comprehensive report on the government’s response to the rains and called for the formation of a special parliamentary committee to investigate the matter and suggest reforms to prevent such negligence in the future.
He concluded: “It is not only the right of those who lost their lives, but the constitutional and moral responsibility of the state to protect the life, property, and dignity of every citizen. For God’s sake, don’t wait for the next disaster. Reform now so that no mother is forced to search for her child in floodwaters again.”
In response, the Deputy Chairman, who was presiding over the session, said a detailed discussion on the matter would be held on Monday, as several motions were scheduled.
However, Ali Zafar pressed again: “Deputy Chairman Sahib, the time for debate is over. Don’t wait — act now. Decide on the proposed committee.”
The chair stated that it was not only the responsibility of the federal government but also of the four provincial governments to act during such emergencies. As other members stood to speak, the chair concluded the session, citing the approaching time for Friday prayers.

An FIR registered with the Dunga Bunga police on Thursday alleged that a local cleric of Maharwali village invited a 15-year-old of the same area to the mosque on July 16 through a text message. There, the FIR alleged, the cleric started lewd acts with him and incited the boy to commit sexual acts.  
Afterwards, the cleric allegedly grabbed the victim by the arm and took him to a room next to the mosque and started sexually harassing him. However, he fled when some passersby reached the scene after hearing the hue and cry of the boy, it added. 
In another incident, the B Division police claimed to have arrested two men who allegedly gang-raped a tailor after inviting him to their outhouse on the pretext of giving him measurements in Chishtian. 
The police said the two men from Purani Chishtian invited an 18-year-old tailor to their residence on Thursday and took him to an empty place near the house. There, the police alleged, the men repeatedly raped the victim and also snatched his mobile phone during the act. 
Police said all three men had been arrested on Friday while they were trying to flee from the area. They had confessed to their crimes during the investigation, the police said.
