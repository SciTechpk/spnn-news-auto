The incident, which left two Guard members critically wounded, was “an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror,” Trump said.
“It was a crime against our entire nation.”
He confirmed that the man taken into custody after the daylight shooting two blocks from the White House was “a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan”.







The suspect had arrived in the United States in 2021 “on those infamous flights,” Trump said, referring to the evacuations of Afghans fleeing as the Taliban took over the country in the wake of the US retreat after 20 years of war.
“We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan” under former president Joe Biden, Trump said.
“We must take all necessary measures to endure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country if they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”







Later, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it had stopped processing all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely.
“The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission,” the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a post on X.







‘Targeted shooting’
Trump was in Florida at the time of the attack, which prompted the White House to go into lockdown as law enforcement from multiple federal and city agencies swarmed the area.
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called it “a targeted shooting” by a single assailant.
“That individual has been taken into custody,” she said.
The shooting occurred around 2:15 pm local time, when the two soldiers — a man and a woman — were conducting what authorities described as a “high-visibility patrol”.
According to DC Police Executive Assistant Chief Jeffrey Carroll, the attacker rounded a corner, raised a firearm, and “ambushed these members of the National Guard” without warning.
Both soldiers were struck multiple times and rushed to local trauma centers, where they remain in critical condition. The suspect was also injured during the encounter.
Carroll said investigators were still working to determine whose gunfire wounded him, but confirmed that there were no additional suspects and no ongoing threat.
By evening, multiple law enforcement officials told CNN, ABC News and other outlets that the FBI believed it had identified the man in custody.
Fingerprints taken at the hospital produced an initial match to a man from Washington state who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan in August 2021.
The New York Times, citing people familiar with the investigation, identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, though none of the agencies involved had released the name publicly.
Senior counterterrorism officials confirmed to ABC News that the FBI was examining the shooting as a possible act of international terrorism, and investigators were looking into whether the attack may have been inspired by a foreign militant group.
Authorities stressed, however, that no motive had been established.
Trump was the first to announce the incident publicly, writing on social media that “the animal that shot the two National Guardsmen” was also severely wounded and would “pay a very steep price”.
He praised the National Guard and federal law-enforcement agencies as “truly great people”.







Following the shooting, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said the president directed him to deploy an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington “immediately,” saying: “This happened just steps away from the White House. It will not stand.”
A brief security lockdown was also imposed at the White House as the situation unfolded, though Trump was not in the capital at the time.
“The president has been briefed,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
Confusion briefly erupted when West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey issued — then retracted — a statement saying the two soldiers had died. His office later said the information was based on “early and conflicting reports”.
Unease within Muslim communities
The attack also triggered unease within Muslim communities in the US after NBC News initially reported that the FBI was treating the incident as a possible act of terrorism and that the suspect was “initially identified as an Afghan national”.
“We hope this report is incorrect,” a Muslim political commentator, who declined to be named, told Dawn.
“If it turns out to be true, it may trigger a strong backlash against Muslim communities across the United States.”
Civil-rights groups also issued statements urging caution and warning against speculation before authorities confirmed the identity and motive.
Law enforcement agencies echoed that sentiment.
“The nature of the investigation may change as more information emerges,” one federal official said, emphasising that the FBI had not yet reached any definitive conclusion.
National Guard personnel from several Republican-led states, including West Virginia, have been deployed in Washington since August, when Trump expanded an earlier mission aimed at combating street crime and supporting immigration enforcement initiatives.
The soldiers shot on Wednesday were part of that deployment.</p><small>2025-11-27 04:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27094302cf5bca1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957582/sea-discolouration-wrongly-linked-to-pollution-wwf-p' target='_blank'><strong>Sea discolouration wrongly linked to pollution: WWF-P</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The recent observations of sea discolouration and night-time bioluminescence by fishermen and coastal communities along Karachi and parts of the Balochistan coast are caused by naturally occurring, non-toxic bloom of Noctiluca scintillans, widely known as sea sparkle, and not linked to pollution, stated the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-P) on Wednesday.
The organisation also rejected concerns linking “these changes” with harmful algal blooms or eutrophication.
“We believe that the green discolouration of the ocean is caused by large, naturally occurring, non-toxic bloom of Noctiluca scintillans, a small, free-floating organism that may appear in red, orange, green, or even colourless forms.
“Along Pakistan’s coast, blooms are most often green or orange and can spread extensively depending on seasonal conditions. Although the organism itself is not green, the colour comes from its internal symbiont, Protoeuglena noctilucae, which enables it to photosynthesise and grow rapidly.
Because Noctiluca is naturally bioluminescent, its presence creates the glittering glow reported at night,” it stated. Similar seasonal blooms had been documented across the coasts of Yemen, Oman, Iran, Pakistan and western India.

“After the peaceful protest outside the Islamabad High Court until 1pm, lawmakers will march on Adiala Jail [in Rawalpindi] along with Mr Imran’s sisters and sit outside the jail,” Mr Afridi told PTI workers during a ceremony held here to “pay tribute to the PTI workers martyred on Nov 26, 2024” in the provincial capital.
He requested PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja to ensure the presence of all party members of the national and provincial assemblies and the Senate outside the high court on Tuesdays.
The chief minister also urged party workers to “ensure their elected representatives are present at the protest.”
“Wherever you [workers] are, make sure all your respective MNAs and MPAs are present at the peaceful protest. We’ll shame absent lawmakers afterward,” he said.
The chief minister said that those, who won elections in the name of the incarcerated prime minister Imran Khan to become parliamentarians, would protest to ensure justice is dispensed to the leader facing torture in the jail.
He said the party’s peaceful movement for the release of Mr Imran would continue and he himself would visit Adiala Jail on every Thursday until he met the detained leader.
Mr Afridi announced that a political gathering would be held in the provincial capital on December 7.
He said that Nov 26 was a painful day for PTI as its peaceful workers were fired at, martyred and wounded at D-Chowk in Islamabad.
The chief minister also complained that the police fired at and killed TLP workers in Punjab’s Muridke town.
“It’s a message for the entire country as powers-that-be want nobody to raise voice for rights. They do not want the supremacy of the Constitution, restoration of an independent judiciary and media,” he said.
Mr Afridi claimed that the PTI chief was illegally behind bars for over 850 days, just for the sake of the people’s rights.
He said that Mr Imran was waiting for people to do justice with him.
“The courts were paralysed through the 26th Constitutional Amendment and the rest was done in the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Now, the 28th Constitutional Amendment is in the works and it will be followed by the 29th Constitutional Amendment,” he said.
The chief minister said the PTI would continue the struggle for the release of its jailed activists and the people’s rights as allowed by the law and the Constitution. He said certain quarters wanted PTI to break the law for a crackdown, but that won’t happen.
Mr Afridi said that PTI protesters remained peaceful on May 9 and Nov 26 and would remain peaceful in the future as well but would never compromise on rights.
He said that party workers offered sacrifices, which wouldn’t go to waste.

THE presidency announced that a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels and halt deforestation would be presented at COP31.—AFP/file

• No mention of fossil fuel phase-out in final text• Vague promises for adaptation fund prompt call for reform• Multilateral process ‘being held hostage’, critics warn
THE script played out at COP30 in Belem was no different from that of previous climate conferences — some delegates left the venue with mixed feelings, while others were outright disappointed.
The conference, held in the Bra­z­i­l­ian city on the edge of the Amazon, overran its schedule and ended on Saturday, a day after its planned close.
One of the outcomes at this so-called implementation COP was a cause for celebration, particularly the just transition mechanism “to enhance international coo­­peration, technical assistance, capacity-building and knowledge-sharing, and enable equitable, inclusive just transitions”.

 

This agreement, widely celebrated by civil society as a “historic victory for people power”, came after days of protests and intense negotiations.
“This outcome didn’t fall from the sky; it was carved out through struggle, persistence and the moral clarity of those living on the frontlines of climate breakdown,” said Tasneem Essop, executive director at the Climate Action Network International.
“Governments must now honour this Just Transition mechanism with real action. Anything less is a betrayal of people, and of the Paris (agreement) promise,” she said.
However, adaptation finance for vulnerable communities left much to be desired. The conference was supposed to reach an agreement to triple adaptation finance to $120 billion by 2030.
However, the ‘mutirao’ decision — a Portuguese term for “collective efforts” — calls for efforts to “at least triple adaptation finance by 2035” without setting a baseline target, a move that does not match the level of ambition demanded by the developing countries and the civil society groups.
“The refusal to commit to scaling up finance to the necessary $300 billion annually for adaptation leaves the unprepared defenceless against inevitable ruin,” said Harjeet Singh, strategic adviser at the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative.
“By failing on their past commitment to double adaptation finance (to $40 billion) by 2025 and keeping the baseline of the new target vague, developed nations have attempted to diluted their responsibility, forcing the world’s most vulnerable to face the rising waters with empty hands,” he said.
Fossil fuel phase-out
The worst outcome was the fossil fuel phase-out, which did not even get a mention in the COP agreement despite robust support from more than 80 countries.
Instead, the COP presidency announced that a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels and halt deforestation would be presented at the next climate conference, ie COP31. The roadmap will be guided by a conference in Santa Marta in April to be co-hosted by Colombia and the Netherlands, according to Carbon Brief.
COP31 will be held in Turkiye, with Australia as its president.
According to CAN International, the decision to ignore the harmful impacts of fossil fuels was deeply disappointing. “Given that oil, coal and gas remain the root cause of climate breakdown, this omission represents a severe failure for COP30,” it said in a statement.
Tracy Carty of Greenpeace International said the negotiations were derailed by inadequate climate finance, weak leadership from G20 nations, particularly the developed ones, and the heavy hand of fossil fuel interests.
Like fossil fuels, the finance outcome was also dismal. In the absence of the US and the European Union’s focus on defence, it seems the responsibility for saving the planet has fallen to China and the developing world, said Dr Abid Suleri of the Islamabad-based Sustainable Devel­opment Policy Institute, about the reluctance of rich nations to pay for loss and damage.
Calls for reform
The presence of fossil fuel lobbyists and a dilute outcome also brought the wider UNFCCC process under scrutiny. Still, some hailed the mutirao text as a win for multilateralism.
“COP30 has proven that the current consensus model has become a veto for vandals. We are trying to put out a planetary fire, but the UN rules allow the arsonists — the petrostates and their 1,600 lobbyists — to stand in the doorway and block the fire trucks,” Mr Singh told Dawn.
He said the ‘consensus’ becomes a synonym for capitulation if a handful of countries, like Saudi Arabia and Russia, can simply erase the mention of the fossil fuel phase-out from the final text. “The multilateral process is alive, but it is being held hostage,” he added.
Erika Lennon, senior attorney at the Centre for International Env­i­r­onmental Law, also called for reforms in the UN process. “Petrostates and industry lobbyists use the consensus rule to block action and ambition. We now need to reform the UNFCCC so the global majority can act, starting with conflict of interest rules and allowing majority voting,” she said.
Dr Suleri agreed. He said the “polarised” conference ended in a compromise despite tall claims at the outset. “President Lula called COP30 the COP of truth; the truth, however, is hard to ignore. This COP still lacks both the money and the ambition needed to match the promises made at the start,” he added.
The conference also launched the Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change, which establishes shared international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote accurate, evidence-based information on climate issues.
This initiative aims to mobilise resources to fund research projects and investigative journalism ideas that can produce evidence in a coordinated manner, offering more inputs for better climate policies, said the Unesco Division for Digital Inclusion and Policies and Digital Transformation Director Guil­herme Canela in an email to Dawn.

It took courage for IAF Wing Commander Namansh Syal to die with his plane, when his Tejas Light Combat Aircraft malfunctioned on Nov 21 during the Dubai Air Show 2025. (The Sanskrit word ‘tejas’ is used in the Devi Mahatmya and refers to “the divine, fiery energy or brilliance of the gods that coalesced to form the goddess Durga”.)
It took courage of a special sort for a retired PAF air commodore (Pervez Akhtar Khan) to pay a tribute to his comrade in wings Namansh Syal. His requiem will never be as famous as other tributes like, for example, Abraham Lincoln’s immortal Gettysburg address of November 1863. It is twice as long as Lincoln’s succinct 271 words, but it deserves a wide audience, for writers in the armed forces are a rare breed. Warrior poets who can distil their emotions into words are even rarer.

 

In the first year of the 1914-18 war, the young poet Rupert Brooke wrote The Soldier, for which he has remained famous. He died the following year, not in combat but unpoetically, of septicemia (blood poisoning) from a mosquito bite.

Aviation history is replete with loss and poetry.

His contemporary T.E. Lawrence (of Arabia) opened his memoir Seven Pillars of Wisdom: A Triumph (1926) with these lyrical words:“So I drew these tides of men into my hands/ and wrote my will across the sky in stars.”
Another poet of their time — the Irishman W.B. Yeats — took a more prosaic view of war: “I think it better that in times like these/ We poets keep our mouths shut, for in truth/ We have no gift to set a statesman right.”
Two notable British author/ warriors of World War II were Lt-Col Airey Neave and Wing Commander Douglas Bader. Neave succeeded in escaping from the impenetrable Colditz Castle and recounted his feat in his book They Have Their Exits (1953). Douglas Bader, despite having lost the lower part of both his legs, flew in the RAF until he crashed over France in 1941 and was imprisoned by the Germans, also in Colditz Castle. His story — Reach for the Sky (1954) — became a best-seller.
Here, in Pakistan, senior officers have inflicted their memoirs on a credulous readership. Most of these recollections are self-serving. Exceptions are those by lower ranking officers such as Col (later brigadier) Siddique Salik. A student of English literature before he joined the army, Salik wrote with moving candour of his incarceration as a prisoner of war in India after the 1971 war. His books include Witness to Surrender (1977) and in 1984, The Wounded Pride: Reminiscences of a Pakistani Prisoner of War in India (1971-73). He died with his commander-in-chief Gen Ziaul Haq in the Bahawalpur air crash in 1988.
More of us should remember the late Sq Ldr Sayed Sajjad ‘Nosey’ Haider — one of our ace fighter pilots, honoured for his “exceptional leadership, courage and flying skill” when, in 1965, he destroyed “four enemy aircraft, 11 enemy tanks and damaged three tanks”. His distinguished career came to an abrupt end when he told Gen Ziaul Haq some unwelcome truths about the perils of dictatorship. Haider’s candid memoir Flight of the Falcon (2009) deserves better recognition.
And the most recent achievement of his PAF was demonstrated during the aerial skirmish in May this year, when a number of Indian aircraft (Don­ald Trump swears se­­ven) were downed by Pakistani pilots.
Air Commodore Per­vez Khan’s tribute shou­­ld be viewed against this backdrop. “Coura­­ge,” Khan writes, “ne­eds no passport”. He lauds the daring of such pilots: “These are not performances for cameras [at air shows]; they are testimonies of human mastery, flown by souls who accept the unforgiving contract between gravity and grace… .”
He continues: “The sky demands everything and promises nothing. At the moment an aircraft goes quiet, there are no nationalities, no anthems, no flags. There is only the terrible democracy of loss, and families left clutching photographs of men who once touched clouds.” And finally, he reminds us that we are “all of us trying to touch something infinite before gravity reclaims us”.
Lord Tennyson defined the fatal union of obedience and patriotism in these lines, familiar to every schoolboy: “Theirs not to reason why, Theirs but to do and die.” Rupert Brooke, in his less well-known poem Second Best (c. 1908) echoed the same call: “Go to greet/ Death as a friend.”
That friendship ends only when eternity ends.

There is obviously far more to it but transparency promises greater bang for the buck and is something that can be done relatively easily.
For an idea of how tough a task the fight against corruption can be, consider some of the things the report itself is able to point to but not say out loud. Take this sentence as an example: “While corruption vulnerabilities are present at all levels of government, the most economically damaging manifestations involve privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.”
So the authors can tell that the “most economically damaging manifestation” of corruption involves “privileged entities” that in some cases are “owned by or affiliated with the state”. This is a remarkable sentence given the enormity of what it is striving to convey, and the enormous effort it is taking to avoid any specifics. Reminds one of the old saying which tells us if you want to know who rules you, look for those whose names you cannot take.
But here are some names we can take. For example, one such privileged entity is the Board of Investment (BOI), which was given powers under its Act in 2023 to issues directions to the federal government to exempt or otherwise loosen regulatory compliance and immunity, for certain projects. These powers are contained in Articles 10E, F and G of the Board of Investment (Amendment) Act in 2023. According to the diagnostic, “[g]reater transparency is needed to understand how these powers will be exercised and monitored in practice. The provisions outlined in Articles 10F and 10G, along with the subsequent clauses, appear to create a framework that prioritises facilitation of strategic projects by allowing exemptions from regulatory compliance and shielding officials from personal liability”.

Real reform seeks to change the landscape against which economic behaviour plays itself out.

Burning holes in the country’s compliance framework carries risks. That is what the report is pointing out. The powers to grant such exemptions to particular projects can be misused. Best practice would be for such powers to not be granted in the first place. Second best would be to circumscribe them with clear rules to try and prevent misuse. Third best would be to have greater transparency via legally mandated obligations to disclose every time these powers are used.

 

This is what the report recommends. In its own words, the first annual report of the Special Investment Facilitation Council, the body entrusted with these powers of the BOI, should be released now, given almost two years since the body’s creation. The report should disclose “information on all investments that it has facilitated, including concessions provided (tax, policy/regulatory, or legislative) along with detailed rationale of concessions, and the estimated value of the concessions, and publishing the information on the implementation of the BOI (Amendment) Act, Article 10F (Power to relax or exempt from regulatory compliance).”
This is a simple step and practically should not be difficult to do. And once the BOI starts following this practice, it should be mandatory on all other bodies that exercise similar authority to do the same. Not only annual reports, but real-time data releases need to be made legally mandatory on many government departments, with special focus on (but not limited to) the FBR and the Power Division. It is a little surprising that given the scale of the revenue challenges and the circular debt, neither body is legally required to disclose any details of its operations.
Given the opacity, the fragmented and overlapping authority enjoyed by different governmental bodies, all the elements with which oversight is built in a system are weakened. The report mentions parliamentary scrutiny, transparency in decision-making, corporate governance, financial reporting and disclosure standards as examples of oversight mechanisms that suffer due to opacity, overlapping mandates, and selective endowment of powers to grant exemptions and enjoy immunity in governmental decision-making.
“Against this backdrop, individuals and industries vie for preferential treatment, resulting in market distortion, limited competition, and collusive arrangements,” the authors say. Once these behaviours are baked in, they create an environment of their own in which those who thrive do so through their contacts and connections, through gaming the system rather than excelling at taking risks and identifying the next generation of business opportunities. Once the state sits heavy over the system, and takes the power to grant special exemptions to a select few, and makes decisions in the dark, and keeps results out of the public sight except through controlled press releases to magnify successes and cloak failures, the stage is set for all manner of carpetbaggers and influence peddlers and speculators and racketeers to pass themselves off as businessmen. (And yes, they are overwhelmingly men in this arena).
If those who run our country want to bring about real growth in the economy, the kind of growth that doesn’t devour itself once it gets going, they should focus their minds on changing this environment. Real reform seeks to change the landscape against which economic behaviour plays itself out. When investors ask for protections from your own tax authorities and judicial system, for example, they are communicating something important. They are saying, we don’t like the landscape in your country. The bad response to these investors is to offer them exemptions. The good response is to find ways to reform the tax and judicial systems and improve their operation. Because if there is no confidence in the institutions that run a country, and the rulers respond by creating supra-institutional authorities that can lift particular investors and individuals above the fray and keep them beyond the law, that action causes confidence in the system to drop even further.
It is a good thing the government requested this diagnostic study to be done. It will be a better thing yet for the government to heed its advice in letter and spirit.

The new policy is being taken as a major blow to the efforts of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to provide the aspiring young women, particularly those having underprivileged background, access to free nursing education.

 

The critics hold Punjab Health Minister Khwaja Salman Rafique and Health Secretary Azmat Mahmood responsible for the flawed policy as they had formulated the recommendations with regard to it and sent the same to the chief minister for her final approval.
The experts say that Ms Nawaz has been kept in dark about the policy’s financial fallout for, mostly, poor parents of aspiring nurses, who will have to bear the brunt of these controversial changes.

Policy change adds to the financial burden of their families

The experts also see it as a gradual and systematic shift by the health authorities towards privatising the nursing education, which, they apprehend, could have long-term drastic consequences for the public healthcare sector that was already facing an acute shortage of qualified and experienced nurses across the province.
They fear that the new policy may also leave an adverse impact on the patient care at the massively-burdened state-run hospitals of Punjab.
According to the newly-introduced policy, the University of Health Sciences (UHS) Lahore has been notified as admission authority for Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN Generic – the four-year degree programme. The admissions will be offered on 3,100 seats (in the morning batch) across 45 public nursing colleges in Punjab.
Similarly, the Punjab government has added 1,400 new seats for the evening programmes in 15 public sector nursing colleges. Of these 1,400 seats, 100 have been allocated to each government nursing college. These included College of Nursing Mayo Hospital/King Edward Medical University, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital/Fatima Jinnah Medical University, Jinnah Hospital/Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore General Hospital/Ameerud Din Medical College, Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, Nishtar Hospital, Multan, DHQ Hospital, Dera Ghazi Khan, etc.
Under the changes to the policy, free hostel facility in the government nursing colleges have been withdrawn, allowing these institutions to charge annual fees, on par with the private institutions.
“There shall be no stipend for the students enrolled for BSN Generic programme, in both the morning and evening batches,” reads the notified policy.
A senior official says that with these changes to the policy, nursing education has become very expensive in Punjab, apprehending it may aggravate the shortage of the trained health professionals in the cadre.
He says the female nursing students, mostly coming from rural or urban low- and middle-income families, will have to either pay the hefty hostel fees or opt for costly private lodging far away from their hometowns, risking their own safety.
He says that previously, through subsidised nursing education, even girls from financially-challenged families had an opportunity to seek a bright future in the nursing profession.
Withdrawing of financial support by the government has caused resentment among the students, as well as their parents.
On the other hand, the policy also elaborates the eligibility, scoring criteria and application process for admissions to nursing colleges.
Published in Dawn, November 27th, 2025</p><small>2025-11-27 03:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957651/hardening-rhetoric' target='_blank'><strong>Hardening rhetoric</strong></a><br><p>WITH the Pakistani state hardening its position against the Afghan Taliban, and the Kabul regime accusing this country of bombing its territory, the already limited space for a negotiated, peaceful settlement with Afghanistan is closing fast.
On Tuesday, the Taliban said that Pakistan had bombed several Afghan provinces, allegedly causing civilian casualties. The state swiftly denied these accusations, with the military spokesperson saying Pakistan had not attacked Afghan civilians, and adding that this country announces its strikes.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who also denied hitting Afghan civilians, was blunt in his criticism of the Taliban. He said Pakistan had “no good hope from them” while noting that it would be “idiocy” to trust Kabul’s current rulers. Despite the Afghan claims, the ceasefire reached between both states last month is holding, and it is hoped matters do not escalate further.
There can be little argument with the official demand that the Taliban stop TTP and other terrorists based in Afghanistan from attacking Pakistan; the state must remain vigilant to prevent violent actors from carrying out attacks in the country. But combative rhetoric and exchanges of fire between the two countries is hardly in anyone’s interest; if matters deteriorate further, it would result in a permanently hostile state on Pakistan’s western border at a time when the situation on the eastern frontier, too, is unsettled.

 

Islamabad’s growing rift with Kabul calls for greater diplomatic efforts by this country. While Pakistan in 2021 had hailed the Taliban’s recapture of Kabul, today the government feels that it is useless to talk to them. True, the Taliban’s obduracy and denialism cannot be put aside. But Pakistani officialdom’s at times strong commentary can further alienate ordinary Afghans, undermining whatever remains of the goodwill built after decades of hosting Afghan refugees, for example.
Moreover, strikes inside Afghanistan have failed to deter the TTP, as the banned terrorist outfit is getting more brazen in its attacks. It is also worth considering that closing channels with Kabul is pushing the Taliban further into the Indian embrace, which presents a fresh strategic dilemma for Pakistan.
The Taliban are difficult customers, but ‘writing them off’ will not help. In the long term, it is primarily diplomacy, as well as collective regional pressure, that can address the issue of cross-border terrorism, and restore harmony to the Pak-Afghan relationship.

Police said the device had been planted inside the home of a local named Abdul Hayee Jatoi. The explosion occurred while children were playing in the house.
“One of the children stepped on the landmine, resulting in a powerful blast. Three children died on the spot,” senior police officer Jan Muhammad Khosa told Dawn, adding that three others, including two boys and a young girl, were seriously injured.
Security forces and police reached the site soon after the incident and shifted the bodies and the injured to the district hospital.
The deceased were identified as Nadeem Ahmed, Soma Khan and a teenage girl, Bakhtawar Bibi. Police said an investigation was under way to determine how the landmine was planted inside the house.

• PM Shehbaz meets King Hamad and Crown Prince Salman, reaffirms strong, historic partnership• Invites Bahraini investors to explore opportunities in food security, IT, minerals and healthcare; proposes enhanced port connectivity
ISLAMABAD: Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif on Wedn­esday reiterated Pakis­tan’s commitment to deepening ties with the Kingdom of Bahrain, based on shared faith and mutual respect.
The prime minister, who is in Bahrain on a two-day official visit, met King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa in Manama and reaffirmed the strong and historic partnership between the two countries, the PM Office said.
Discussing economic relations, the prime minister unde­r­lined Pakistan’s desire to expand trade and investment and said bilateral trade was set to grow with the Pak­istan-GCC Free Trade Agree­ment, which is at an advanced stage of finalisation.







He invited Bahraini investors to explore opportunities in Pakistan through the Special Investment Facilit­ation Council (SIFC), especially in food security, information technology, construction, mining, tourism and healthcare.
The prime minister appreciated Bahrain’s support for the more than 150,000 Pakistanis living there and thanked the king for pardoning Pakistani prisoners.
Both sides reaffirmed the importance of their longstanding defence partnership and agreed to deepen cooperation in training, logistics, manpower and defence production. They reviewed the encouraging momentum in bilateral ties and agreed to further enhance cooperation in political, economic, defence and cultural fields.
The situation in Gaza also came under discussion. Both sides agreed that peace and stability were long overdue for the people of Gaza who had suffered for decades.
PM Shehbaz congratulated Bahrain on securing a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2026-27 term and expressed Pakis­tan’s readiness for close coordination during its tenure.
The meeting also focused on economic cooperation. The prime minister noted the potential to raise bilateral trade, currently over $550 million, to $1 billion honour upon his arrival at Al-Qudaibiya Palace.
Meeting with crown prince
PM Shehbaz also met Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. The meeting concluded with confidence that the discussions would translate into tangible outcomes and further elevate Pakistan-Bahrain relations across strategic, economic, security and people-to-people spheres.
According to state broadcaster PTV, the premier received a warm welcome at the Manama airport by Crown Prince and PM Salman, Deputy PM Khalid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, Foreign Minister Dr Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani, and senior members of the Bahraini leadership.
The Pakistani delegation includes Deputy PM and FM Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister of State for Railways Bilal Azhar Kayani, and other senior officials.
“This visit reflects the longstanding cordial relations between the Kingdom of Bahrain and Pakistan, with the aim of promoting a results-oriented and strategic partnership between the two countries,” PTV said.
“The visit will strengthen traditionally warm and cordial relations, chart new avenues of partnership, and deepen people-to-people connections, which will contribute to mutually beneficial cooperation,” it added.
Last month, the two countries agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in different fields during the first meeting of the Pakistan-Bahrain Parliamentary Friendship Group.

“We have now completely restricted passenger vehicles, motorists and tourists from travelling to neighbouring GB for their safety,” Assistant Commissioner Balakot Hasrat Khan told reporters on Wednesday. He said the decision to impose a travel ban between KP and GB was taken in a meeting attended by the heads of all relevant departments.
The AC said that the Chilas (GB) district administration and police were in contact with Mansehra’s administration, and they too had imposed a ban on travel along Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad road. “
We have decided to allow tourists to travel only up to Battakundi and Saiful Muluk between 11am and 3pm, and only with chained tyres, as vehicles cannot move safely on icy roads before or after the four-hour period,” Mr Khan said.
He clarified that no restrictions had been placed on travel up to Naran until the next spell of snowfall. The official said most of the indigenous community settled in Barawai, Battakundi, and other areas beyond Naran had already migrated, while the remaining people were expected to leave within a week or after the second snowfall in Kaghan valley.
He stated that police posts in the upper reaches of the valley had also been closed for the winter. “We expect the Kaghan–Babusar Top section of the MNJ road to reopen in early May next year, and until then the valley will remain completely closed to movement,” he said.

During the hearing, Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra noted that despite multiple summons, Omar Ayub failed to appear before the court, prompting the judge to invoke proclamation proceedings.
The court also sought complete details of his movable and immovable properties and issued directions to block his passport and Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC).
The case concerns a PTI demonstration held last year, for which Mr Ayub and other senior party figures have been nominated under anti-terrorism charges.

Defence, prosecution clash after Aleema Khan briefly detained for attempting to leave courtroom

Earlier this year, prosecutors submitted a challan formally naming several top PTI leaders, accusing them of inciting violence and causing disruption during the protest.
The court adjourned further hearings while ordering officials to complete the requirements associated with the proclamation process.
Aleema briefly in custody
Separately in Rawalpindi, proceedings in a different protest-related case took an unexpected turn when Aleema Khan, sister of former prime minister Imran Khan, was briefly detained by women police officers inside an Anti-Terrorism Court.
Aleema, one of 11 charged with arson and obstructing government operations during a protest on 26 November last year, appeared before ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah.
At the outset of the hearing, the court was informed that lawyers would be arguing on an application filed by an accused named Safai regarding the jurisdiction of the ATC over the matter. The court noted that 11 accused, including Aleema Khan, had already been indicted in the case.
Prosecutor Zaheer Shah informed the court that the accused were facing charges under terrorism-related laws due to allegations of arson and encirclement during last year’s protest.
During the hearing, Aleema Khan attempted to exit the courtroom. “Our lawyers are busy in the Supreme Court, we should be allowed to go,” she said.
Women police officers, however, intercepted her and brought her back inside. Prosecutor Zaheer Shah insisted that the accused was “in judicial custody under Section 351” and therefore could not leave without the judge’s explicit permission.
Defence lawyer Faisal Malik strongly objected, arguing that Aleema Khan had voluntarily surrendered before the court and that there was “no order to take her into custody”. He termed the police action “unacceptable” and urged the court to initiate proceedings against the officers involved.
The judge, responding to the defence protests, remarked, “If you had come on time, this might not have happened”.
The courtroom witnessed heated exchanges as the prosecution maintained that the accused and her lawyers were creating hurdles in the trial.
Prosecutor Zaheer Shah added that eight police witnesses were present in court despite their official duties and that unnecessary delays were obstructing proceedings.
Following arguments, the court allowed Aleema Khan to proceed with filing her bail bonds. Additionally, the court ordered the accused to pay Rs 10,000 each to the eight police witnesses, citing the inconvenience caused by repeated adjournment requests.
During the proceedings, defence lawyers also requested that the court direct authorities to unfreeze the bank accounts of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust and Namal University, Mianwali.
The prosecutor, Zaheer Shah, responded sharply. “We regret that Shaukat Khanum’s account had to be frozen due to the irresponsible behaviour of the accused,” he said.
In a brief interaction with the judge, Aleema Khan said she had faith in the court and believed justice would prevail.
After hearing arguments, the court accepted the defence’s request and adjourned the hearing until Dec 1.

ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has signalled a clear shift in the government’s economic direction, saying the goal is no longer to pursue short bursts of five to six per cent GDP growth that have repeatedly led to instability.
“We do not want to repeat the past cycles of unsustainable growth,” he said while addressing a two-day economic dialogue organised by the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) on Wednesday. The focus, he added, is moving towards steady, sustainable growth that can break recurring boom-and-bust cycles and place the economy on firmer footing.
He said the growth trajectory itself is not the issue; the real challenge is maintaining momentum once achieved. Previous attempts, he noted, proved unsustainable.
He cautioned against repeating earlier patterns and reiterated that export-led growth remains the only path to stronger performance.
Without naming the country, he referred to a neighbouring economy moving towards 8pc growth but facing high unemployment. In Pakistan, he said, the debate centres on equity and representative growth.
Discussing sectoral performance, Mr Aurangzeb highlighted the government’s aim to revive industrialisation, saying the upcoming industrial policy will place special emphasis on this effort. He expressed hope for 3.5pc GDP growth in the current fiscal year.
He projected growth of around 4pc over the next two to three years, with the potential to reach 6-7pc over the medium term, provided the momentum in agriculture, manufacturing and services continues.
He also gave updates on remittances and external inflows, noting stable monthly remittance levels through formal channels and strong performance of the Roshan Digital Account. He said remittances this year are expected to reach around $41 billion.
The minister said easing monetary conditions would help reduce financing costs, but urged corporate leaders to diversify beyond bank borrowing and make greater use of capital markets for longer-tenor, more competitive financing.
Mr Aurangzeb reaffirmed the government’s commitment to addressing structural issues in taxation and energy. “We are going to hold the first tax advisory council meeting on Thursday. The council will now reach out to businesses for input ahead of the next budget.”
Responding to concerns about security raised by foreign investors, the minister stressed that national security is non-negotiable. Security, macroeconomic stability, and smooth profit repatriation, he said, are the basic prerequisites for attracting and retaining global investment.
He said the inaugural meeting of the 11th NFC will be held on Dec 4. “We will engage provinces to come up with some tangible results.”
He also announced that Pakistan is preparing for its first Panda Bond issuance, expected before the Chinese New Year.
Mr Aurangzeb pointed to renewed interest from global companies such as Aramco, and firms from Turkiye and Abu Dhabi, which have begun investing in energy, mining, technology, logistics and automotive sectors. He described this as a sign of growing confidence in Pakistan’s economic direction.
Dr Zeelaf Munir, chairperson of the PBC, highlighted the role of productive businesses in national progress. “Pakistan’s economic strength depends on evidence-based policy, stability and long-term reform,” she said.
She added that growth requires predictability, fairness and confidence for business, and that sustainable progress needs partnership between government, business, academia and civil society.
Long-term stability
At another session, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan said exports must grow faster than imports to ease pressure on the economy and secure long-term stability. He described industrial development as essential for national prosperity and called industry the backbone of economic progress.
He said stronger export performance requires support for manufacturing and local production, adding that producing key inputs such as steel domestically is necessary to expand export capacity. He was of the opinion that Pakistan should strengthen domestic investment before relying on foreign investors. Faster economic progress, he said, is needed to create employment.
Mr Haroon said a tax package under the upcoming industrial policy will be presented to the IMF. The reform measures being prepared, he added, are intended to support long-term, sustainable economic growth.

The committee, headed by Muhammad Farooq Sattar, asked the privatisation commission to present the timeline at its next meeting. The committee also emphasised safeguarding PIA employees’ jobs before the sale.
It called for retaining staff based on performance and merit and ensuring benefits, such as pensions and gratuity, are processed fairly. Officials were instructed to consult the PIA employees’ union and address their concerns to ensure a transparent process.

 

The privatisation commission has already approved a transaction structure to sell a stake of 51 per cent to 100pc in PIACL, along with management control.
Four bidders have been pre-qualified for the sale: Lucky Cement Consortium, Arif Habib Corporation Consortium, Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited Air Blue Limited.
According to the commission, the pre-qualified bidders now have access to a virtual data room, can conduct site visits and participate in the pre-bid conference. Negotiations are ongoing to finalise commercial terms, advancing the privatisation process.
In a separate matter, an additional secretary for the power division told the committee that the government has begun the phased privatisation of public sector power generation companies (GENCOs), under a 2024–29 programme.
He said only operational plants will be offered, with the Guddu (747MW) and Nandipur (525MW) facilities identified for privatisation once pre-conditions are met. Non-operational units are proposed for delisting from the programme.
The privatisation commission advised GENCOs may dispose of old, non-functional assets with the board and ministry’s approval.
The committee also sought a detailed report from the power ministry on the installation of 1.5 million smart meters nationwide and requested a formal briefing for Karachi’s elected representatives about the project’s progress and to explain why Karachi is not included in the current phase.

More than 10 hours after the fire started in the northern Tai Po district, flames and thick smoke still engulfed the 32-storey towers as rescue workers swarmed the site and shocked inhabitants watched nearby.
The cause of the blaze was not immediately known, but it was fanned by green construction mesh and bamboo scaffolding which the government began phasing out in March for safety reasons.
Working through the night, firefighters were struggling to reach upper floors of the Wang Fuk Court housing complex, which has 2,000 apartments in eight blocks, due to the intense heat.
One 71-year-old resident surnamed Wong broke down in tears, saying his wife was trapped inside.
A firefighter was among the 36 killed, and 29 people were in hospital, Hong Kong leader John Lee told reporters. Some 900 people were in eight shelters.

“The priority is to extinguish the fire and rescue the residents who are trapped. The second is to support the injured. The third is to support and recover. Then, we’ll launch a thorough investigation,” Lee told reporters.
Harry Cheung, 66, who has lived at Block Two in one of the complexes for more than 40 years, said he heard a loud noise about 2:45 p.m. (0645 GMT) and saw fire erupt in a nearby block.
“I immediately went back to pack up my things,” he said.
“I don’t even know how I feel right now. I’m just thinking about where I’m going to sleep tonight because I probably won’t be able to go back home.”
China’s Xi urges ‘all out’ effort against fire
Frames of scaffolding were seen tumbling to the ground as firefighters battled the blaze, while scores of fire engines and ambulances lined the road below the development.
From the mainland, China’s President Xi Jinping urged an “all-out effort” to extinguish the fire and to minimise casualties and losses, China’s state broadcaster CCTV said.

Hong Kong’s sky-high property prices have long been a trigger for social discontent in the city and the fire tragedy could stoke resentment towards authorities ahead of a city-wide legislative election in early December.
Hong Kong’s Transport Department said that due to the fire, an entire section of the Tai Po road, one of Hong Kong’s two main highways, had been closed and buses were being diverted.
At least six schools will be closed on Thursday due to the fire and traffic congestion, the city’s Education Bureau said.
It was Hong Kong’s worst fire since 41 people died in a commercial building in the heart of Kowloon in November 1996.
That fire was later found to be caused by welding during internal renovations.
A public inquiry yielded sweeping updates to building standards and fire safety regulations in the city’s high-rise offices, shops and homes.
Bamboo scaffolding being phased out
Hong Kong is one of the last places in the world where bamboo is still widely used for scaffolding in construction.

 

The government moved to start phasing that out in March, citing safety. It announced that 50% of public construction works would be required to use metal frames instead.
Wang Fuk Court is one of many high-rise housing complexes in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Tai Po, located near the border with mainland China, is an established suburban district with some 300,000 residents.

Occupied since 1983, the complex is under the government’s subsidised home ownership scheme, according to property agency websites. According to online posts, it has been undergoing renovations for a year at a cost of HK$330 million ($42.43 million), with each unit paying between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000.
Owning a home is a distant dream for many in Hong Kong, one of the world’s most expensive housing markets and where residential rents are hovering around record highs.</p><small>2025-11-26 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2623321725c9ded.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957531/jurist-bodies-slam-ongoing-judicial-harassment-of-imaan-mazari-hadi-ali-chatta' target='_blank'><strong>Jurist bodies slam ‘ongoing judicial harassment’ of Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chatta</strong></a><br><p>Jurist’s body Lawyers for Lawyers published an open letter on Wednesday condemning the “ongoing judicial harassment” of lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chatta and urging the government to drop the cases against them.
The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCIA) had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
Their lawyer, appointed by the court, refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses during the most recent hearing on Tuesday, saying that he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.
In a press release, Lawyers for Lawyers, the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute, the Law Society of England and Wales, the International Commission of Jurists and the International Observatory of Lawyers at Risk expressed concern over the case.
“We have received credible information indicating that the recent indictment and criminal proceedings against the couple, marred by serious irregularities and the denial of due process guarantees, are intended to obstruct their legitimate legal work and retaliate against them for exercising their right to freedom of expression,” it read.
Lawyers for Lawyers noted tweets made by the couple criticising the armed forces and that the trial progressed rapidly but was “marred by procedural irregularities and apparent judicial bias, raising serious concerns about [its] fairness and legitimacy”.
“The ongoing trial is part of a broader troubling trend of judicial harassment aimed at exhausting the lawyers’ time and resources, discrediting their work, and obstructing their ability to represent victims of state violence,” Lawyers for Lawyers said.
The body urged the authorities to:

Immediately drop all charges and end criminal proceedings against Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chattha related to their legitimate professional activities and exercise of freedom of expression;
Immediately cease all acts of harassment, intimidation, and improper interference in their legitimate professional work;
Ensure that all lawyers in Pakistan can perform their professional duties without fear of reprisals and free of all undue restrictions in accordance with international standards.

On a plateau overlooking the fertile plains of what is often called the “cradle of civilisation”, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gobeklitepe and nearby Karahantepe are transforming archaeologists’ understanding of prehistoric times.
Among the latest finds in Sanliurfa province is a statue with a facial expression reminiscent of a deceased individual. Archaeologists said it was a unique discovery in terms of death rituals and symbolic expression among Neolithic communities.

It was one of some 30 artefacts revealed on Wednesday, including human and animal statues, figurines, vessels, plates, necklaces and beads including a human-shaped one.
“What makes these archaeological sites unique is the way they reshape our knowledge of Neolithic history, as well as the transition to settled life,” Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy told Reuters.
He said the sites, which Turkey has dubbed the Stone Mounds project, show that humanity had a far higher level of consciousness in terms of belief, rituals, social organisation and cultural production than previously assumed.
Gobeklitepe is expected to attract around 800,000 visitors this year, he said, illustrating the growing recognition of the site’s importance.
The ministry-led project encompasses 12 Neolithic sites of settled communities in Sanliurfa dating back to 9,500 BC, with Gobeklitepe and Karahantepe featuring the world’s oldest structures used for gathering and performance rituals.

Among the most striking features at the sites are oval-shaped monumental structures up to 28 metres in diameter surrounded with T-shaped limestone pillars, regarded as representations of humans, with reliefs of animals depicted on some of them.
Archaeologists say one recent excavation at Karahantepe uncovered a T-shaped pillar with a human face, representing the first known depiction of a human face on such a pillar.
“From nutrition to architecture, from the symbolic world to the rituals, the vast diversity of evidence obtained here bring us incredibly close to prehistoric societies,” said Necmi Karul, the head of excavations, describing the builders of the structures as skilled craftsmen.
He said that until recently it was assumed that settled life started with agriculture and animal husbandry but the project indicated that these people were still hunter-gatherers but had become settled.</p><small>2025-11-26 18:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26223426d04803d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957529/where-will-the-constitution-go-occupied-kashmir-cm-slams-college-admissions-on-basis-of-religion' target='_blank'><strong>‘Where will the constitution go?’: Occupied Kashmir CM slams college admissions on basis of religion</strong></a><br><p>The Chief Minister of India-occupied Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, on Wednesday assailed the use of religion as a criterion for student admissions at the territory’s Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence, according to Kashmiri media.
According to the Kashmir Media Service (KMS), the institute was sanctioned 50 MBBS seats for the current academic year. Of the 50 seats, 42 were allotted to Muslim students based on merit, sparking protests from right-wing Hindu groups and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who said Hindu students should be prioritised as the institution’s funding came from donations to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine.
Speaking at the golden jubilee programme of Jamia Ziaul Uloom institute in Poonch, Abdullah said that Constitution Day “should not be reduced to a symbolic observance”.
“Today, Constitution Day is being celebrated. The meaning of Constitution Day is not that we remember the Constitution for an hour … its meaning is that every day of the year, we must keep it alive,” Abdullah was quoted as saying by the Kashmir Observer.
The chief executive of the occupied territory noted that the Indian constitution’s preamble grants equal status to all religions, ensures democratic rights for every citizen and guarantees protection under the law, according to the Observer’s report.
It added that he expressed concern that the country was witnessing a trend where even educational institutions were being viewed through a communal lens.
“Today, in one of the medical colleges, it is being said that Muslims and non-Hindus should not study here. If we set aside merit and start making decisions on the basis of religion, then where will the Constitution go?” he was quoted as saying about the rejection of the student list.
On Monday, Abdullah said that when the bill to establish the university was passed, there was no mention of people being excluded from admissions based on their religion.
“Where was it written?” he asked the press. “It was said that admissions will be based on merit and not religion. When admission is granted based on merit, then some people don’t like that. If they are not in favour, then they can approach the Supreme Court.”
He added that admissions cannot be decided without merit and said that admitting students based on religion would violate the Indian constitution.
“Will social welfare schemes be handled based on religion?” He asked. “Will ration shops ask about [the customer’s] religion? Will policemen work based on religion?
“Right now, secularism remains a key part of our constitution. If you do not want to keep the nation secular, then remove that from the constitution,” he added. “You (BJP) do what you will, we’ll do what we will.”
In response to a question, Abdullah reiterated, “When students will be granted admission, it will be on merit. Some students will excel, while others will be left behind. It’s nobody’s fault.”
 






In another press talk on Tuesday, the CM said that when the college was being built, it should have been classified as a “minority institute” in order to allow admission to any one religious group.
“Admissions are based on NEET (National Eligibility Entrance Test) and entrance tests, not on religion,” he reiterated. “If you don’t want Muslims to study here, then declare it a minority institute. They’ll get admission elsewhere … they’ll go to Bangladesh or Turkiye.
“But, if you point the finger at Muslims and call them communal, sectarian and don’t tolerate their children, then remember this situation,” he added.
“When children are ready to attend an institution like Mata Vaishno Devi, they are not concerned about the name or where the funding comes from; they want to study and become doctors,” the CM said. “Now you want them to be denied admission based on their religion.”

A protest camp was established by the Baloch Students Council (BSC) against the enforced disappearance of a sixth-semester student, Saeedullah Baloch.
The BSC students had earlier reached out to students from other councils and groups to join the camp.
However, fearing a larger protest campaign, the administration of QAU suspended all academic activities at the varsity.
The BSC students participating in the sit-in remained wary of certain consequences and declined to disclose their names to the media.
However, speakers at the protest camp said they had remained firm in their stance for the past three days and refused to remain silent. They added that these three days have shown that students cannot be intimidated when justice is denied.
 
 

Mohammad Azam, brother of missing Saeedullah, said that the protest camp has become more than a protest site; it is a symbol of collective resilience.
“With every hour that passes, our message grows louder, we will not accept enforced disappearances, we will not accept fear, and we will not walk away until our voices are heard,” he added.
There was no official reply from the QAU administration over the situation and the continued suspension of studies on campus.
However, a senior QAU official said the administration had reached out to the BSC, offering assistance and requesting that they not establish a protest camp over the enforced disappearance
“But they flatly refused because the (varsity) administration was not in a position to offer any help, secondly, the BSC maintained that the protest camp was not a political activity but a demand for the recovery of a student of the university,” the official added.
Saeedullah Baloch was a student of the Defence and Strategic Studies (DSS) department.
The speakers at the camp highlighted that Saeedullah was forcibly taken away by unknown men in civil dress on July 8, 2025, between 7 and 7.30pm, from the Islamabad toll plaza when he and his friend were travelling to Quetta on a public bus.
The protestors added that the abductors were accompanied by officials of law enforcement, and they offloaded the two from the bus.
While Saeedullah’s friend was allowed to proceed on the same bus, he was taken away.
The speakers, who preferred not to be named in the media, said that they were students, but they were also witnesses to illegal acts by the authorities.
In the first half of 2025, a total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said.
In December 2024, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emphasised that only parliament held the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances — a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.</p><small>2025-11-26 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2621303017e7186.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957526/china-ready-to-organically-integrate-pakistans-development-plans-says-chinese-envoy' target='_blank'><strong>China ready to ‘organically integrate’ Pakistan’s development plans, says Chinese envoy</strong></a><br><p>China is ready to work with Pakistan to organically integrate the country’s development plans and the action plan on building a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad Jiang Zaidong said on Wednesday.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with ties that span various sectors, including trade, energy, defence, and infrastructure.
Ambassador Jiang was speaking at the Policy Dialogue on “Redefining Regional Connectivity: Pakistan-China Friendship in the New Geo-Economic Paradigm.”
“Guided by the important consensus of our leaders, centered on building a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, using the advancement of CPEC 2.0 as a platform, and focusing on deepening cooperation in industry, agriculture, and mining, we will continuously consolidate, deepen, and expand our all-round partnership,” the Chinese envoy said while speaking via video link.
He said the approach will tangibly serve the modernisation drives of both countries and better benefit the two peoples. 
“We will promote the inclusion of more Pakistani agricultural products under contract farming cooperation and facilitate the export of more high-quality agricultural products to China. Furthermore, we will continue to support industrial park cooperation, making new and greater contributions to Pakistan’s export expansion and foreign exchange earnings,” he said.
The day-long dialogue brought together senior policymakers, including the Chinese ambassador, alongside leading experts who discussed the transformative potential of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in fostering regional stability, connectivity, and economic interdependence. 
The Chinese envoy said his country will support the Chinese company Haier’s investment of US $400 million to establish a new home appliance industrial park in Pakistan, which is expected to achieve an annual production capacity of approximately 10 million units. “We will also support Chinese company Challenge Group’s investment of US $150 million to build a new textile industrial park, aiming to achieve an annual export value of US $400 million.”
“Looking to the future, CPEC will help Pakistan expand regional cooperation. Pakistan is a hub connecting South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East, possessing many unique advantages for development, one of which is its critical geographical location,” he said.
Ambassador Jiang said Beijing is also willing to accelerate the Karakoram Highway realignment, promote the modernisation of the Khunjerab-Sost Port, advance the comprehensive development of Gwadar Port, and transform it into a hub for regional connectivity. 
“We are ready to actively and steadily advance third-party cooperation under CPEC, promoting its extension towards Central Asia and the Middle East to leverage Pakistan’s geographic advantages,” he added.
Jiang elaborated that CPEC has brought Pakistan a cumulative total of US $25.93 billion in direct investment, 510 kilometers of highways, over 8,000 megawatts of power generation, and 886 kilometers of core grid networks, significantly improving Pakistan’s infrastructure and industrial transformation.
“Taking the flagship Gwadar Port and its supporting projects as an example, the upgraded China-Pakistan Friendship Hospital has greatly enhanced the modernisation of local medical services, with cumulative patient visits exceeding 340,000.” 
About the Gwadar seawater desalination plant, he said the plant is now officially operational with a daily output of over 2,000 tons, effectively alleviating local water supply shortages. 
He also mentioned the Lahore Orange Line Metro train and said he has personally taken a ride during a tour and found it as smooth and comfortable as the urban rail transit in Beijing, adding that its cumulative passenger traffic has exceeded 270 million. 
The envoy pointed out that CPEC has created a total of 261,000 jobs in Pakistan, improving the lives of countless families and building a solid foundation of public support for CPEC.
Talking about the Pakistani government’s policies, he said Pakistan’s economic indicators have significantly improved. 
“In the last fiscal year, GDP grew by 3.04 percent, and per capita income increased from US $1,663 to US $1,824. Pakistan is also advancing its “Uraan Pakistan” five-year plan, prioritising digital transformation and technology empowerment, emphasising an export-oriented strategy, and aiming to achieve high-speed, sustainable growth in key industries through opening up, to become an upper-middle-income country by 2035,” said Jiang.
Pakistan’s former National Security Adviser, Moeed Yusuf, in his address highlighted regional connectivity with special reference to Afghanistan.
Yusuf, said, “things with Afghanistan are messy, but we need to expand and work on regional cooperation, and expand such partnerships to Central Asia”. 
While endorsing Pakistan’s security concerns, he favoured the approach of separating economic issues from political matters and said others would find alternatives and “would not wait”. He also mentioned the idea of CPEC’s to Afghanistan and stated that China and Pakistan are interested in achieving this goal.</p><small>2025-11-26 16:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/262025489efd579.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957524/pti-decides-to-establish-chain-of-command-within-party-amid-criticism-from-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>PTI decides to establish ‘chain of command’ within party amid criticism from leaders</strong></a><br><p>While the PTI issued an internal memo to establish a chain of command, some of the party leaders criticised the move as an effort to run the party like an “army unit” and argued that differences of opinion are the “beauty and plus point” of the organisation.
The leaders believe that the internal memo is undemocratic and ensures one-man rule instead of decentralisation. They also claimed that the original constitution of PTI had a core committee and nothing like a political one.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram stated that “the internal memo was the need of the hour and was issued by Additional Secretary General PTI Firdous Shamim Naqvi to streamline recent issues faced by the party.”
The memo, available with Dawn, states that in the centre, provincial presidents and general secretaries or equivalent office bearers will report to the party’s secretary general.
Similarly, at the provincial level, the regional president and general secretary will report to the secretary general of the party on organisational matters. District and tehsil presidents will report to the general secretary of the region and district.
“To clarify further, no tier can break this chain of command. For the party to function properly, the office bearers must recognise their domain,” the memo, signed by party leader Firdous Shamim Naqvi, stated.
“At each tier, their many functions which are the purview of the tier as per the general directions called out above. The functional duties of the office bearer will be decided by the [secretary general] with the approval of the cabinet of the tier.”
The memo added that all provincial or regional heads’ complaints would be addressed to the centre and to the respective office bearer, as the case may be.
A leader of the party, wishing not to be quoted, said that the PTI was going under “one-man rule” with this move.
“Now, no decision can be taken without getting the approval from the secretary general. However, it is a fact that currently there is no secretary general in the PTI, and that is why Additional Secretary General Mr Naqvi has signed the internal memo,” he explained.
Another leader said that the PTI had a core committee, and there was no mention of the political committee in the party’s constitution.
“Now, there is no room for dissent or difference with the secretary general,” he said. “Once, PTI leaders had their own opinion, and Imran Khan used to say that the difference of opinion was the beauty of the political party.
“Unfortunately, now the political party will be run like an army unit in which there will be a ‘chain of command’. I can foresee that the differences within the party will further increase,” he said.
Information Secretary Akram, while talking to Dawn, said that the chain of command was already defined in the constitution of the PTI.
“The internal memo is basically related to block code, which is related to Election Management and Assessment Cell (EMAC),” he explained.
“We had to issue the internal memo as at different places, appointments for EMAC were not being understood by party wings. So Mr Naqvi has given just a clarification to streamline the issues related to appointments regarding EMAC.”

Akram emphasised that the hierarchy of the PTI was arranged according to the party constitution was submitted to the Election Commission of Pakistan in 2019, further stating that all have to perform their roles as per the constitution.
“Chain of command has to be recognised to run any party smoothly. Parties cannot be run without a chain of command. Otherwise, there is a structure including Centre, Province, Region, District, Tehsil and then Unions,” the PTI Information Secretary said.</p><small>2025-11-26 15:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26210240b32fd5b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957514/nawaz-calls-for-accountability-for-those-who-brought-imran-to-power-terms-them-bigger-criminals' target='_blank'><strong>Nawaz calls for accountability for ‘those who brought Imran’ to power, terms them bigger ‘criminals’</strong></a><br><p>PML-N president and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday called for accountability for “those who brought Imran” into power, claiming that they were bigger “criminals” than the PTI founder.
“Imran Khan was not the only criminal; the ones who brought him to power were the bigger criminals, and they should be held fully accountable,” said the PML-N supremo while addressing a gathering of newly elected lawmakers today.
Nawaz has generally maintained a low profile since the PML-N, following the formation of a coalition with the PPP, came into power after the 2024 elections.
In 2018, according to figures provided by the Election Commission of Pakistan, PTI had emerged as the largest political party in the country, winning 115 of the 270 National Assembly seats on which the elections were held.
During a session in parliament following the election of then-PM Imran, PML-N leader Shehbaz brought up allegations of rigging in the July 25 polls. Alleging that 1.6 million votes were rejected, he questioned the discovery of ballot papers from gutters and streets across the country.

“You know their (PTI’s) narrative well, they used to call others robbers and dacoits while they were the bigger robbers.”
Nawaz added that the people of the country are now aware of what the previous government did and further said, “they only indulged in chaos, anarchy and fights, including slandering others”.
He asked if a country can progress under such circumstances and with such people residing in the corridors of power.
The PML chief lamented that prior to the change of power in 2018, the country was on a path of progress with low inflation and higher growth rates.
Nawaz recalled that the Saudi riyal was valued at Rs11 when Pervez Musharraf imposed martial law in 1999, compared to around Rs78 today (as pointed out by an audience member). He said currency depreciation had made life unaffordable for Pakistanis.
The PML-N supremo added that Pakistan cannot make decisions independently due to its reliance on the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“If our rate of progress had remained the same, who knows where we would’ve reached today. There would be no worries about IMF or about foreign exchange,” Nawaz said.
“Now we have all these worries; what are our reserves, whether IMF will let us do this or not. We cannot make any decision ourselves. Our personal decisions are in the hands of foreigners,” he stated.
The PML-N leader claimed that people voted for the party on the basis of its performance, praising both PM Shehbaz and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for their efforts to “reach the level that we had lost”.
He said the two were “working hard” to restore economic stability, saying the government had “taken the economy out of the trenches” and moved the country away from default.
Nawaz said provincial schemes, including low-cost housing, hospital projects, student laptops, scholarships and the “Suthra Punjab” and green bus initiatives, are evidence of progress.
He also highlighted what he described as improved security and social protection in Punjab, stating that ration cards and health facilities were being distributed to vulnerable families without discrimination. “People of all beliefs and religions are our brothers and sisters,” Nawaz stated.</p><small>2025-11-26 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26195057182bf19.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957523/joint-counter-terrorism-drill-al-battar-ii-between-pakistan-and-saudi-arabia-concludes-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Joint counter-terrorism drill Al Battar-II between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia concludes: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The joint counter-terror drills between troops of the Pakistan Army and the Royal Saudi Land Forces concluded on Wednesday, said a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“Troops from both brotherly countries demonstrated exceptional standards of professionalism, operational skill, and interoperability throughout the exercise,” said the military’s media wing.
The exercise, Al Battar-II, focused on enhancing joint proficiency in counter-terrorism operations, with an emphasis on fighting in urban terrain, countering improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and refining tactical drills and procedures through integrated training.
“The exercise also served to further strengthen the deep-rooted and historic military-to-military ties between Pakistan and the KSA,” said the ISPR.
The military’s media wing further stated that all “objectives were successfully achieved, reinforcing the commitment of both nations to regional peace, security, and collaborative defence preparedness”.
The closing ceremony of the drills was attended by senior Saudi and Pakistani officials, with the general officer commanding (GOC) of the Special Services Group (SSG) attending as the chief guest of the ceremony.
On Monday, the Saudi armed forces chief had relayed the kingdom’s desire to elevate its defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.
In September, the two countries had signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.</p><small>2025-11-26 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2619385752d09c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957522/un-report-warns-karachi-among-cities-expected-to-become-substantially-hotter' target='_blank'><strong>UN report warns Karachi among cities expected to become ‘substantially hotter’</strong></a><br><p>Karachi is among the nine densely built megacities in Asia and the Pacific which are particularly vulnerable to heat and are projected to become substantially hotter in the years ahead, a report released by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) on Wednesday said.
The report, titled Asia-Pacific Disaster Report 2025: Rising Heat, Rising Risk, stated that urban areas are already at high risk for extreme heat due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Densely built surfaces trap heat and raise city temperatures above those of surrounding rural areas.
It added that this challenge is being exacerbated by rapid and often unplanned urbanisation and insufficient green spaces, further warning that UHI would raise temperatures by 2 to 7°C, on top of global warming.
As access to cooling, water and healthcare comes under increased strain, children, the elderly and outdoor workers in densely populated urban areas are disproportionately affected. Higher-income areas usually lie in cooler, greener neighbourhoods, exacerbating issues of equity and environmental justice, the report says.

Cities including Seoul, Tokyo, Beijing, Delhi, Karachi, Dhaka, Manila, Jakarta and Phnom Penh were identified as high-risk locations.
It added that during the period 2041–2060, countries projected to be the most arid include Mongolia, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Iran and Turkmenistan, as higher temperatures evaporate more surface water, drying out soils and vegetation and causing droughts and water shortages.
“Asia and the Pacific were impacted by various natural hazards and climate-induced extreme events in 2024 and 2025, and the fastest-growing climate-related hazards are driven by extreme heat,” the report reads.
The report shows that rising temperatures are “impacting all, everywhere”, with expanding and intensifying risks to food systems, public health, urban living, rural livelihoods, infrastructure and the ecosystem.
It warns that across the Asia-Pacific region, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme heat events are now creating a silent but growing health emergency.

“Under all future climate scenarios, heat stress is projected to rise sharply across Asia and the Pacific, with mortality potentially doubling by 2050,” the report added.
The report said that the urban poor are highly exposed, especially in densely populated cities where extreme heat is amplified by the UHI effect.
On the other hand, it noted that the region has had considerable experience with managing cascading disasters, but stated that the rising threat of extreme heat demands a new level of urgency.
“Every country needs to act now, with the implementation of regional cooperation initiatives turbocharged to meet the scale of this evolving disaster risk landscape,” the report read.
According to the report, the melting of glaciers is one of the most disastrous consequences of global warming.
It “exacerbates changes in tele-connected systems of oceans and atmosphere across distant regions — disrupting monsoon patterns, snow and melt dynamics, and permafrost thaw, which all lead to the increased frequency, intensity and expansion of floods, landslides, droughts, land degradation and sand and dust storms”, the report read.
According to UN-ESCAP, glaciers around the world have lost about 5 per cent of their volume this century. Out of 58 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 17 contain glaciers which can melt into lakes that burst their banks, leading to sudden glacial lake outburst floods (Glof).
 
 

“The glaciers with the highest Glof risks are in High Mountain Asia, where a total of 9.3 million people are exposed to 2,211 glacial lakes,” the report stated. “By 2060, countries like Iran, Mongolia, Myanmar, Turkiye and Uzbekistan could lose over 70pc of their glacier mass … posing Glof risks.”
New projections in the 2025 report highlight the scale of the threat. By 2100, regional disaster losses could increase from $418 billion under the current scenario to $498 billion under a worst-case climate scenario.

Additionally, the frequency of days above critical heat thresholds is set to increase sharply, with south and southwest Asia, parts of southeast Asia and northern and eastern Australia trending toward chronic heat exposure.
The report called for strategic, long-term action grounded in science, innovation and regional cooperation, emphasising the need to place heat at the centre of multi-hazard planning, supported by heat-ready early warning systems that use interoperable alerting, agreed metrics and trusted last-mile communication.
With only 54 per cent of global meteorological services issuing warnings for extreme temperatures, expanding heat-health warning systems in just 57 countries could save approximately 100,000 lives each year, the report notes.
Over the past five decades, the Asia-Pacific region has been experiencing more frequent and more severe climate-related extreme events, which often overlap and intersect to create multi-hazard events, with widespread, cascading impacts.
Intensifying multi-hazard risks, including earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, floods and cyclonic storms, threaten much of the region’s critical infrastructure.</p><small>2025-11-26 14:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26150037a64b342.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957491/in-additional-note-justice-najafi-says-noor-mukadam-case-direct-result-of-vice-known-as-living-relationship' target='_blank'><strong>In additional note, Justice Najafi says Noor Mukadam case direct result of ‘vice’ known as ‘living relationship’</strong></a><br><p>Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, who is now part of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), has observed that the Noor Mukadam case is the direct result of a “vice” spreading in society known as “living relationship”, it emerged on Wednesday.
It appeared the judge was referring to a live-in relationship, where two unmarried individuals in a romantic relationship cohabitate.
Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at the Islamabad residence of Zahir Zakir Jaffer in July 2021. In May, a three-judge Supreme Court bench, led by Justice Hashim Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Najafi, had upheld the death sentence awarded to Zahir, who was convicted by an Islamabad trial court in 2022.
Last month, the apex court had taken up Zakir’s review petition challenging the capital punishment awarded to him. During the hearing, Justice Najafi told senior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, representing the convict, that it would be more appropriate for him to start arguments after going through the additional note he had not yet issued at the time.
Later, Justice Najafi was sworn in as a judge of the FCC, established earlier this month after the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In an additional note on the Noor murder case, which was uploaded on the SC website today, Justice Najafi upheld the sentence handed to Zahir and observed that “the present case is a direct result of a vice spreading in the upper society which we know as ‘living relationship’ [sic]”.
He stressed that such relationships ignored “societal compulsions” and “defy not only the law of the land but also the personal law” under Sharia.
 
 

Justice Najafi went on to say that engaging in a relationship like that was a “direct revolt against Almighty Allah”, calling on the younger generation to note its “horrible consequences, such as in the present case, which is also a topic for the social reformist to discuss in their circles”.
Justice Najafi further said that in his view, “no mitigating circumstances” existed in the present case.
He noted that the “minor discrepancies in the time of occurrence, the delay in postmortem, absence of the finger prints on the knife but matched with the DNA of the petitioner, minor delay in lodging the first information would not affect the credibility of the prosecution evidence, which had circumstantial evidence”.
“In this case of circumstantial evidence, one end of the rope is found tied with the dead body of Noor Mukadam, and the other end tied with the neck of the petitioner,” he said.
Mentioning the filing of the first information report (FIR) at 11:30pm of the incident that occurred at 9:30pm, Justice Najafi observed that the statement of Noor’s father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam, of “receiving the information […] about the murder of his daughter is well corroborated”.
The judge wrote: “It is natural that after reaching the place of occurrence, the complainant being the real father of the victim required some time and extraordinary nerves to absorb the extreme shock of his life and then draft the complaint for registration of FIR.”
Noting that the postmortem report suggested a gap of eight to nine hours between Noor’s death and her body’s autopsy, Justice Najafi said, “This delay of conducting postmortem of about 12 hours is not fatal.”
 
 

The judge also mentioned the CCTV footage obtained during the trial, showing Noor jumped from the window and “came limping towards main gate to escape”, but watchman Mohammad Iftikhar locked the door.
He further said that Zahir “snatched the mobile phone of [the] deceased, locked her in the outer cabin”, then opened it and physically assaulted her, while gardener Muhammad Jan “did not make any effort to stop” Zahir.
“It was not mere seeing the petitioner (Zahir) with the deceased (Noor) before the unnatural death caused in most brutal manner, but there are circumstantial evidence which connect the petitioner with crime,” Justice Najafi remarked.
Touching upon Zahir’s stance, Justice Najafi said his version, which alleged Noor had consumed drugs in excess, was “found incorrect” as no intoxicant was identified in either the convict’s or the victim’s medical evidence, and no “guest of drug party” was seen in the CCTV footage.
On Zahir’s plea of insanity, the judge observed that there was “no evidence on record that the petitioner used to consult any psychiatrist, therapy workers or consume any drug in the absence of which, or due to which, he became infurious and went out of mind”.
The case
Noor was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. A first information report was registered later the same day against Zahir, who was arrested at the site of the murder.
In February 2022, a district and sessions judge sentenced Jaffer to death for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, were indicted by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later acquitted by the court.
Six officials of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents.
According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.
In March 2023, the Islamabad High Court (IHC), dismissing Zahir’s appeal against the conviction, not only upheld the death sentence but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction.
The next month, Zahir approached the SC against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and that the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR.
In May of this year, the SC upheld the death sentence of Zahir for the murder of Noor.</p><small>2025-11-26 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/261822424c1614c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957520/thousands-of-trade-union-workers-protest-indias-new-labour-codes' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands of trade union workers protest India’s new labour codes</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of trade union workers across India protested on Wednesday against the government’s rollout of new labour codes, saying they would lead to corporate exploitation and erode their hard-won rights.
The world’s fifth-largest economy last week implemented long-awaited labour laws that will replace colonial-era legislation and simplify a maze of confusing regulations.
The overhaul consolidates 29 existing labour laws into four key codes, with the number of rules being cut from more than 1,400 to about 350, but unions say the reforms will hurt workers’ rights.
Gautam Mody from the New Trade Union Initiative said workers from across all sectors were protesting on Wednesday outside factories and in many city centres.
“Workers have been blindsided by the government,” he told AFP. “We want fairness, justice and equity before the law, which are being denied under the new codes.”

While the new regulations boost safety standards and mandate guaranteed social security benefits for gig workers, they also allow for longer factory shifts, make it tougher for workers to conduct strikes and easier for medium-sized firms to fire employees.
A controversial key provision raises the threshold for firms that needed prior government permission for layoffs from 100 to 300 workers, which means companies with up to 300 employees can retrench staff without any approval.
‘Deceptive fraud’
The move has sparked worry among trade unions, aligned with parties opposed to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who have called it a “deceptive fraud” against the nation’s working people.
The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) said in a statement that the government wanted to portray these codes as “pro-worker” and “modernising”.
But “in reality they constitute the most sweeping and aggressive abrogation of workers’ hard-won rights and entitlements since Independence, aimed at facilitating corporate exploitation, contractualisation and unrestrained hire-and-fire”.
Modi has said the overhaul represented an opportunity to eliminate compliance-intensive labour laws, often seen as preventing the Indian economy from wooing foreign investors.
He has described the changes as “one of the most comprehensive and progressive labour-oriented reforms since Independence.”

India remains the world’s fastest-growing major economy, but a slowdown over the last year has left it short of the 8 per cent growth rate that most economists say is needed to create millions of well-paying jobs for its people.
US President Donald Trump’s tariff blitz, partly sparked by the White House’s anger over New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil, has also clouded the country’s economic outlook and raised questions over its energy security.
Analysts at Nomura said in a recent note that the labour law reform was an “attempt to modernise disparate, arcane and compliance-intensive labour laws” that have emerged as one of the “major challenges to the ease of doing business”.
But they added it was “part of a broader trend by the government to hasten economic reforms, especially in the wake of the 50pc Trump tariffs”.</p><small>2025-11-26 13:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26174123a6ccd5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957517/karachis-safari-park-welcomes-birth-of-15-animals' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi’s Safari Park welcomes birth of 15 animals</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) on Wednesday announced that 15 animals from different species were born at the metropolis’s Safari Park, hailing the arrivals as a “significant and heartening development”.
According to a statement from the municipal body, the park saw the birth of a mouflon, four Sindh ibex, four blackbucks, two chitals (spotted deer), one horse, two fallow deer and one white fallow deer.
“The newly born animals underwent thorough medical examinations by the veterinary team. The doctors confirmed that all animals are in excellent health, and special care arrangements have been made to ensure their continued well-being,” the statement read, quoting KMC spokesperson Daniyal Siyal.
The statement added that Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab expressed his delight at the births and directed the relevant departments to provide enhanced care and maintain a sustainable habitat for the newborns.
“I am pleased to announce the birth of 15 wildlife species at Safari Park. Their arrival not only enhances the beauty and diversity of the park but also stands as proof of the healthy and nurturing environment we have created for them,” Wahab was quoted as saying in the statement.
“These efforts reflect our commitment to expanding the park’s wildlife capacity and improving the overall ecosystem.”
The mayor added that this is a moment of joy for Safari Park, Karachi’s residents and all wildlife enthusiasts and instructed officials to arrange a naming ceremony and a formal celebration for the newly born animals.
“We must celebrate their arrival to express our care and compassion. Wildlife deserves the same respect and protection as humans, and this celebration is a gesture of our commitment to their well-being,” he noted.
3 lion cubs born at Karachi Zoo
KMC announced on Tuesday that three lion cubs were born at the Karachi Zoological Gardens on November 16 and are in “excellent health and active”.
According to the zoo’s medical staff, all three cubs are in excellent health, active and showing strong early signs of growth and vitality. Their mother is also reported to be healthy and is receiving continuous care.
The KMC took around 10 days to announce the birth because lion cubs are very vulnerable in their first few weeks, as they are born blind and entirely dependent on their mother for care, a zoo official said.
“Hence, it’s important to protect them from outside interference and help the mother strengthen her bond with the babies,” the official added.</p><small>2025-11-26 12:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26170507f0cd835.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957511/special-ceremony-held-in-honour-of-countrys-last-cjcsc-at-joint-staff-headquarters' target='_blank'><strong>Special ceremony held in honour of country’s last CJCSC at Joint Staff Headquarters</strong></a><br><p>A special ceremony was held at Joint Staff Headquarters on Wednesday to bid farewell to the country’s last Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, who has completed 40 years of service, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
Gen Mirza’s tenure as CJCSC will end on November 27 (tomorrow), as the office will be abolished as per the recent 27th Constitutional Amendment. He has conducted farewell visits to both civilian and military leadership in the past several days.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the outgoing CJCSC was presented with a guard of honour by a contingent comprising personnel from the three services. The event was attended by former CJCSCs and senior military officers from the army, navy and air force.

“In his address, the outgoing CJCSC expressed gratitude to Allah Almighty for granting him the strength to perform his duties with dedication, professionalism and selfless devotion,” the statement read, adding that he paid tribute to the armed forces and martyrs for their sacrifices.
“He (Gen Mirza) highlighted that in the current geo-strategic environment, strong national defence is an essential pillar of national security and reaffirmed that the nation’s defence remains impregnable and our valiant officers and soldiers stand ever-ready to make it even more formidable,” the ISPR said.
Abolition of the CJCSC office
Earlier this month, the national security establishment was restructured through an amendment in Article 243 of the Constitution and the subsequent changes in the legislation governing the Army, Air Force and Navy.
The legislation also abolished the office of CJCSC, the tri-service post designed to maintain institutional balance and coordination within the armed forces.
The dissolution of the chairman’s office, effective November 27, would formally end nearly five decades of joint-service representation in armed forces decision-making, at least during wartime.</p><small>2025-11-26 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/261432329705240.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957490/coas-munir-meets-irans-security-chief-stresses-need-for-counter-terrorism-collaboration' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir meets Iran’s security chief, stresses need for counter-terrorism collaboration</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday met with Iran’s top security official Ali Ardeshir Larijani in Rawalpindi, where he stressed the need for counter-terrorism cooperation between their countries.
Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Secu­ri­­ty Council (SNSC), called on the army chief at the General Headquarters in the garrison city, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability, COAS Munir emphasised the “need for closer collaboration with Iran to combat terrorism”.
“He also highlighted the growing importance of strategic cooperation in light of the evolving geopolitical situation,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media affairs wing described Larijani as Iran’s NSA (national security adviser).

Iran and Pakistan share a long, often tense border where terrorist groups have carried out attacks on both sides, prompting growing security coordination. Tehran has also offered to mediate between Islamabad and Kabul amid rising cross-border tensions.
Islamabad and Tehran had also vowed to enhance joint efforts to eradicate terrorism in both countries when Iranian Parliament Speaker Dr Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad earlier this month.
Today’s meeting between COAS Munir and Larijani focused on bilateral cooperation, regional security issues, and the importance of strengthening ties between Pakistan and Iran. “Both dignitaries discussed the prevailing security dynamics in the region,” the ISPR added.
On his part, Larijani acknowledged “Pakistan’s vital role in ensuring peace and security in the region and expressed his commitment to furthering Iran-Pakistan ties”, according to the ISPR.
The Iranian top official also underlined the significance of dialogue and partnership between the two nations in tackling regional challenges and ensuring long-term stability.
Larijani’s visit
Larijani, who arrived in Pakistan on Monday, met with President Asif Ali Zardari, PM Shehbaz, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar and National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq yesterday.
He is also scheduled to meet National Security Adviser Lt Gen Asim Malik, also the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief.
The visit is focused on reviewing bilateral ties, pursuing pending agreements and discussing regional developments, including those in the Muslim world.
Larijani’s trip comes as Iran expressed reservations about United States President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan, which Pakistan has supported and is seen as a potential contributor to an international stabilisation force envisioned under it.
 
 

Though Pakistan’s statements on the SNSC official’s meetings did not say much on discussions about the Gaza plan, Larijani, in a post on X at the end of the day, conveyed Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s greetings to “honourable people of Pakistan” for supporting Iran during the 12-day war with Israel.
“This reflects the firm and principled thinking of the Pakistani people,” he said.
Larijani’s trip also comes on the heels of the Saudi armed forces’ chief visiting Pakistan, with him and Pakistani officials mostly discussing defence partnership and counterterrorism efforts.</p><small>2025-11-26 10:22</small></div><hr>
