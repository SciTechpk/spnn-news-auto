During the month, the commission stated that “14 missing persons returned home”. From March 2011 to September 2025, the commission received 10,636 cases, out of which 8,986 cases have been disposed of, while 1,650 cases are under investigation.
“The disposal of cases works out to be 84.48% consequent to the investigation of cases,” stated the monthly report.
The report further stated that the commission has disposed of 289 cases during the three-month period of July-September, at approximately 96 cases per month.
The commission said it has also taken steps for the welfare of families of missing persons, establishing a cell “providing relief to families by addressing matters such as the issuance of Form B of children of missing persons and the grant of pension to families of missing persons, who happen to be government servants”.</p><small>2025-10-03 12:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/03163430e89fa61.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946315/govt-delegation-holds-second-round-of-negotiations-with-joint-awami-action-committee-amid-ajk-unrest' target='_blank'><strong>Govt delegation holds second round of negotiations with Joint Awami Action Committee amid AJK unrest</strong></a><br><p>A second round of negotiations between a negotiating team of the government and the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) was held in Muzaffarabad on Friday, in a continued bid to end the ongoing unrest in the territory.
Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Rival groups have since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory.
A fresh round of talks between a high-level government delegation and a civil society alliance was held yesterday, followed by another one today.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said in a post on X that the government’s committee was holding a second round of talks with the JAAC representatives in Muzaffarabad.
“We fully support the rights of the people of Kashmir,” he said, maintaining that most of their demands, which were in public interest, had already been accepted.
“Constitutional amendments are required to fulfil the remaining few demands and talks are ongoing regarding that.
“We believe that violence is not the solution to any problem. We hope that the Action Committee will resolve all issues through peaceful dialogue,” the minister said.
 






In an earlier post, he shared that PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf,
Senator Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, Adviser to Prime Minister on Kashmir Affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, Masood Ahmed and Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam Chaudhry himself were part of the government’s negotiating team.
 






Yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to the AJK capital and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues.
A shutter-down strike has paralysed AJK under a communications blackout since the start of this week as the JAAC continues to press its demands.
HRCP sounds alarm
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has said it is
“deeply alarmed by the ongoing violence in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), where reportedly at least nine people, including three police officers, have lost their lives and hundreds have been injured during protests”.
“We strongly condemn the use of excessive force and the deaths of civilians and law enforcers alike as well as communication blackouts,” the HRCP posted on X.
It underlined that while “dialogue is essential, it cannot be meaningful amid the continued political disenfranchisement of the region’s people. The right to peaceful protest must be upheld and grievances addressed transparently”.
“We urge both the federal and AJK governments to avoid further escalation, respect people’s fundamental rights and commit to genuine, inclusive negotiations. To this end, HRCP intends to send a fact-finding mission to AJK as soon as possible to assess the situation,” it added.

Direct flights between the world’s two most populous countries were suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and were not resumed as tensions grew between Beijing and New Delhi over border disputes.
Relations between the Asian rivals have since thawed, and their leaders spoke in China in August and in Kazan, Russia, last year.
Following technical discussions, “it has now been agreed that direct air services connecting designated points in India and China can resume by late October”, an Indian government statement released on Thursday said.
“This agreement of the civil aviation authorities will further facilitate people-to-people contact between India and China, contributing towards the gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges,” it said.
IndiGo, India’s largest commercial operator, said today it would start direct daily flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou from October 26 and later expand operations to New Delhi.
 






The airline opened bookings on Friday and said the direct flights would “re-establish avenues for cross-border trade and strategic business partnerships and promote tourism between the two nations”.
India and China announced in August that they would restart direct flights, advance talks on their disputed border and boost trade.
Relations between China and India plummeted in 2020 after their soldiers clashed along a disputed border in the Himalayan mountains. Four Chinese soldiers and 20 Indian troops were killed in the worst violence between the two countries in decades.
In June, Beijing granted permission to Indian pilgrims wishing to trek to Mount Kailash in Tibet, a holy site for Hindus and Buddhists, for the first time since the 2020 clash.</p><small>2025-10-03 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/03150532a17cd80.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946316/talal-chaudhry-apologises-for-press-club-incident-assures-steps-to-prevent-reoccurrence' target='_blank'><strong>Talal Chaudhry apologises for press club incident, assures steps to prevent reoccurrence</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Friday apologised for the attack on journalists in Islamabad a day prior, assuring the media that steps will be taken to ensure such an incident does not reoccur.
On Thursday, a raid was carried out by Islamabad police at the National Press Club (NPC), where several journalists were allegedly assaulted. Visuals aired on DawnNewsTV showed policemen armed with batons attacking journalists on the press club premises.
Moreover, visuals shared on social media also showed police dragging journalists out of what appeared to be the cafeteria. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had ordered an inquiry into the incident.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad today, Talal said that he apologises for the incident on behalf of the government and that the information minister was on board regarding the matter. Condemning the incident, he reassured the media that steps will be taken so no one dares to “disrespect the press club” again.
“I went to the press club immediately and asked for an unconditional apology,” Chaudhry said. “Whatever shortcomings there have been, we have apologised and action will be taken.”
When it comes to freedom of speech, journalists, and the sanctity of the press club, Chaudhry reiterated that “there can be no compromise”. He added that the administration of the press club and other stakeholders will collectively make a decision and the corresponding action will be seen.
Meanwhile, in a post on X, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui also condemned the incident, saying the decision to investigate it is a good step, but it should not be a mere formality.
“The officials who are irresponsible and abusive should be identified and punished under the law,” Senator Siddiqui said. “While keeping the investigation process transparent, journalist organisations should also be involved.”
He added that the sanctity of press clubs should not be violated. “No justification for violence against a journalist performing professional duties can be acceptable. A solid arrangement to permanently prevent such actions is very important,” he said.
 






In May, Freedom Network’s annual Freedom of Expression and Media Freedom Report for 2025 said Pakistan’s media is “standing at a crossroad amid an existential threat and increased restrictive environment, deteriorating safety and job security, significant challenges to professional integrity of media and its practitioners”.
Last year, Pakistan dropped two places in the World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, with the country ranking 152 out of 180 countries.

In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on October 1, security forces conducted an IBO in Sherani on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.
It added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in “numerous terrorist activities” in the area.
According to the ISPR, a sanitisation operation was underway to eliminate other terrorists in the area.
“The security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” it added.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the armed forces on the successful completion of the operation in Sherani, reiterating the state’s resolve to uproot the menace of terrorism“ from the country.
“We will never allow those who seek to harm Pakistan’s integrity to succeed,” he said, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
Meanwhile, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti expressed pride for the security forces, who “stand as a shield for the defence of the homeland in every difficult time”.
“The failure of Pakistan-hostile networks and Indian proxies in Shirani district is the result of the great sacrifices and splendid capabilities of our brave security forces,” the CM wrote in a post on X.
 






Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Two reports, issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) on Wednesday, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.</p><small>2025-10-03 11:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0315292063f62b2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946311/indian-air-force-chief-repeats-implausible-claims-of-downing-5-paf-jets' target='_blank'><strong>Indian air force chief repeats ‘implausible’ claims of downing 5 PAF jets</strong></a><br><p>Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh on Friday claimed that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
“As far as air defence part is concerned, we have evidence of one long-range strike … along with that five fighters, high-tech fighters between F-16 and JF-17 class, our system tells us,” Singh told reporters at the Indian Air Force annual day press conference. However, he did not share the said evidence.
The F-16 is a US-made fighter jet, while the JF-17 is of Chinese origin.
Although Singh had previously too claimed without credible evidence that five Pakistani fighter jets and another military aircraft were shot down during the conflict, this is the first time New Delhi has mentioned the class of jets in public. He also refused to comment on Pakistan downing Indian jets in May.
His comments come a week after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during a United Nations General Assembly speech, said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Earlier this week, United States President Donald Trump also described how he confronted both nations during an active war that saw “seven aircraft shot down” and tensions rapidly escalating between the two neighbours.
In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale.
New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. In response, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif dismissed the “implausible” Indian assertions, offering instead to open both countries’ air fleets to independent verification.
“The belated assertions made by the Indian Air Force chief regarding alleged destruction of Pakistani aircraft during Operation Sindoor are as implausible as they are ill-timed,” Khawaja Asif said in a sharply worded August statement. “It is also ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by the strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians.”
He also said that India did not make any such claims for three months after the conflict ended, while Pakistan immediately presented deta­iled technical briefings to the international media, and independent obser­vers recorded widespread acknowledgement of the loss of multiple Indian aircraft, including Rafales, by sources ranging from world leaders, senior Indian politicians, to foreign intelligence assessments.
The May fighting, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan.
Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire.
Ties between the countries have downgraded since the attack, with the impact being felt in areas ranging from trade and travel to sports.
India has also kept in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty — a move Pakistan termed an “act of war”.</p><small>2025-10-03 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/031229091ec5838.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946306/dar-asserts-trumps-gaza-peace-plan-not-ours-but-says-no-room-for-politicking' target='_blank'><strong>Dar asserts Trump’s Gaza peace plan ‘not ours’ but says no room for politicking</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Friday that the 20-point Gaza peace plan released by US President Donald Trump was “not ours” but insisted that there was no room for politicking on the matter.
Speaking on the floor of the National Assembly, Dar referred to his earlier press briefing in Islamabad and said: “I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record.”
However, he went on to say: “This is the end result, and there is no room for politicking.”
Eight Muslim and Arab countries — Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt — had held a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly session, where the US president discussed his plan for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza.
 
 

On Sept 29, US President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had met and, in a press conference after the meeting, announced the former’s 20-point plan for Gaza.
However, despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s initial welcoming of the plan, Dar had later made it clear in so many words that the plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included.
During his speech, Dar said that the eight Arab and Muslim countries had come together for a meeting on Gaza on the sidelines of the UNGA.
“During the meeting, there was no other agenda. Today I am telling you the details,” he said, adding that it was decided to keep the meetings “discreet”.
He further said that before the main meeting, a preparatory meeting of all the foreign ministers of the eight countries was held in New York, where the situation in Gaza was discussed.
He said that for his part, US President Trump took this positively and said his team would sit with the foreign ministers to find a “workable solution”. He said Trump also said that he was scheduled to meet Israeli PM Netanyahu soon, and to try and stop the bombardment of Gaza.
He said that Qatar’s embassy was the convener for these meetings, which were not released to the media. “President Trump’s committee also came and open talks were held on what they wanted […]. They gave us a 20-point proposal.”
Dar further said that the ministers took the proposal and decided to deliberate on it for the next 24 hours.
“Instead of making a completely new draft, we decided to remain within this framework and decided to either amend or delete points based on our wish list,” he said. “We held different meetings in the next 24 hours. We were exchanging hard copies in hotel rooms.”
He said that the final draft prepared by the eight countries, not just Pakistan, was then sent onward as a “counter draft”. He said that two hours after the Pakistani delegation left New York, he received a phone call where he was told that some countries wanted all eight foreign ministers to sign off on the document, while some were saying it was not necessary.
“This was a small thing in my eyes,” Dar said, adding that he asked the majority to make a decision in this regard. “By the time we landed at our next destination, I was told the American side had received the draft.”
He said that during Monday’s meeting between Trump and Netanyahu, a 20-point plan was announced. He said that he then spoke to the Saudi foreign minister, who said that the urgent points put forth by the eight countries were accepte,d but some things still required further engagement.
Quoting the Saudi minister, he said that at that point there were two choices: to continue and perhaps Israel will continue its bloodshed, or we let Trump’s plan be implemented and issue a joint statement.
“I said you are right, we should do this,” he said, adding that the statement was later finalised. Dar then proceeded to read out the joint statement issued on September 29.
He said that this was the only way to end Israel’s bombardment of Gaza when all other forums had failed. “Statements will not suffice. We need practical work,” he said, extending his thanks to the other countries involved.
During his speech, Dar also said that Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remained the same as that of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. “There has not been any change nor will there ever be,” he said, reiterating Pakistan’s unwavering demand for an independent and sovereign Palestinian state with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
Gaza flotilla
Dar also talked about Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), on board which was former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan.
He said that out of the 45 vessels part of the fleet, reports indicated that Israel had captured 22 and detained several activists. “According to our information, it is not confirmed yet, […] but according to our information, Khan is included in this,” he said.
Dar further said that Pakistan had involved a third European country that was “influential” for the ex-senator’s release. Without naming the country, he said that definitive information would be known by Sunday.
He asserted that he and the foreign ministry were working on retrieving the Pakistanis who were with the flotilla.</p><small>2025-10-03 09:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0312392897d42a3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946307/ppp-journalists-briefly-boycott-national-assembly-session' target='_blank'><strong>PPP, journalists briefly boycott National Assembly session</strong></a><br><p>Members of the PPP and media representatives briefly boycotted the National Assembly session on Friday over separate matters.
The PPP, which is a coalition partner of the ruling PML-N in the Centre, has been incensed after Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks amid an ongoing rift between the two parties over flood relief. Meanwhile, journalists have been protesting a raid by Islamabad police at the National Press Club (NPC) yesterday, during which media persons were assaulted.
A while after the NA session began today, PPP’s Naveed Qamar said, “I want to say this on record that in the last session, we had raised some issues. We had also protested and walked out. After that, the government sent a team that engaged in dialogue with us.”
He, however, maintained that nothing changed despite the talks. “There has been no difference on the ground […] We cannot be a part of this House until this matter is resolved.”
“So, we are walking out today,” he announced.
Later, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar began his speech by expressing the hope that differences between the PPP and PML-N would be resolved. He also requested Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and National Food Security and Research Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain to talk and convince PPP leaders to rejoin the session if they had not left parliament by then.
As Dar continued his speech, some of the PPP members were seen returning to the hall amid applause.
At that, the foreign minister expressed gratitude and said the issues between the two parties would be resolved with the involvement of the leadership on both sides.
The PPP had walked out of the last NA session as well on September 30 over Maryam’s remarks.
The war of words between the two sides, which had begun over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP had lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe.
On Wednesday, PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights and Sindh’s ruling party.
During the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Law Minister Azam Nazir, Senator Rana Sanaullah and PPP’s Navid Qamar and Ijaz Jakhrani at the NA speaker’s office, it was agreed that the matter would be taken up with PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam.
Journalists walk out
Separately, a Dawn.com correspondent at the NA reported that journalists, too, had boycotted today’s session over yesterday’s police raid at the NPC.
Members of the Parliamentary Reporters Association of Pakistan (PRA) walked out of the press gallery, led by PRA President MB Soomro and Secretary Naveed Akbar.
A statement issued by the PRA in this connection said the NPC was “home to journalists” that was attacked by Islamabad police yesterday. “Violence against journalists and such incidents are becoming common,” it said, adding that the PRA considered these occurrences as a “reflection of undemocratic thinking”.
The association also strongly condemned the incident.
 
 

While journalists boycotted the session, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq urged that some treasury bench members hold dialogue with journalists.
Subsequently, Public Affairs Minister Rana Mubashir Iqbal, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik and Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani went to the NA’s press lounge on the speaker’s directives. Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry also reached the press lounge.
Chaudhry assured the journalists that their demands would be fulfilled, condemned the raid at the NPC and expressed solidarity with journalists.
He said the law minister had been in contact with him over the matter and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, too, had been briefed on it.
On assurances by government representatives regarding the fulfilment of their demands, journalists decided to postpone the boycott.</p><small>2025-10-03 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/031103417bd4e74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946297/shc-suspends-ku-notification-cancelling-ihc-judge-jahangiris-law-degree' target='_blank'><strong>SHC suspends KU notification cancelling IHC judge Jahangiri’s law degree</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh High Court on Friday suspended a notification issued by the University of Karachi (KU) that cancelled the law degree of Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri.
The court’s decision came during the hearing of a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri on Monday impugning the decisions of the KU’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate, which cancelled his degree in August last year.
The KU registrar, the Sindh advocate general and others appeared before the court as it took up the plea today. They sought more time for submitting their replies on the plea, saying that they had received notices pertaining to the case yesterday.
At that, Justice Iqbal Kalhoro remarked, “We are ready to give more time but what if any action is taken against the petitioner in this duration? If we accept your request today and any action is taken tomorrow, who will take responsibility in that case?”
He further enquired whether the respondents had issued any notice to Jahangiri before “taking action against him”.
Noting that questions were being raised on Justice Jahangiri’s degree, Justice Kalhoro observed that he should have been issued a notice if an application was moved against him 30 to 35 years after the issuance of his degree.
He further stated, “We are not saying that action cannot be taken against him because the law allows it … [but] how can we put someone’s honour at stake? Someone’s life-long earning is at stake here.”
The court then adjourned the hearing, seeking replies from respondents on October 24.
The petition
In his petition, Justice Jahangiri contended that the “illegal and mala fide” cancellation of his LLB degree occurred in the context of his “unflinching judicial independence”.
Justice Jahangiri claimed that when the campaign to have him removed through the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) failed, “a new strategy” was adopted by misusing official processes and institutions. He said the degree cancellation became the basis for the IHC’s decision to restrain him from judicial duties.
He described the KU Unfair Means Committee’s decision as “shocking and surprising,” noting that the committee revived the issue after 32 years without issuing him a notice or providing reasons.
Fake degree controversy
The controversy pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s law degree began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the KU’s examinations regarding the validity of the degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC.
The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016.
It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri.
Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme.
On July 10, 2024, the IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.”
As the degree accusations came to light, a writ petition was filed, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer.
At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that the petitioner was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC.
On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its UFM Committee, varsity officials said.
The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree.
Then, on Sept 5 2024, the SHC suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself.
To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person.
On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the Supreme Court (SC). The IHC decision was declared “null and void” by the SC on Sept 30.
Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea by Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions challenging the cancellation of his law degree. As lawyers protested the move, the bench also dismissed the set of pleas against the cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree for “non-prosecution”.
On Thursday, Justice Jahangiri moved the SC, challenging the SHC ruling of dismissing his application.</p><small>2025-10-03 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0312382840cd8cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946308/pakistan-uae-agree-to-strengthen-partnership-in-rail-modernisation-regional-connectivity' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UAE agree to strengthen partnership in rail modernisation, regional connectivity</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Friday agreed to strengthen partnership on rail modernisation and regional connectivity, Press Information Department (PID) said.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.
According to the PID, Minister of State for Finance and Railways Bilal Azhar Kayani met the UAE’s Minister of Energy and Infrastructure Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei in Abu Dhabi, discussing “opportunities to strengthen cooperation in upgrading Pakistan’s rail network to boost trade, enhancing connectivity and supporting sustainable economic growth.”
The ministers reaffirmed the “strong brotherly ties between both countries and expressed their shared commitment to advancing mutual prosperity and promoting environmentally responsible transport solutions in the region,” the statement added.
The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Global Rail Infrastructure Conference and Exhibition, which was held from September 30 to October 2, bringing together transport ministers, policymakers, and industry leaders from around the world to shape the future of rail and infrastructure.
A day prior, Minister Kayani participated in a high-level ministerial panel discussion on “Building Connected Nations: The Role of Transport and Infrastructure in Sustainable Development“, where he emphasised the central role of modern transport infrastructure in driving sustainable economic prosperity.
“It goes without saying that infrastructure and economic prosperity are intertwined,” he noted, highlighting how robust connectivity could unlock growth, create jobs, and strengthen regional integration.
He cited Pakistan’s infrastructure achievements, including the construction of a vast network of motorways that have enhanced provincial connectivity and boosted freight movement across the country, according to the PID.
The minister also outlined Pakistan’s vision for transforming its railway sector into an efficient, reliable, and environmentally sustainable backbone of national transport.
He particularly emphasised the upgradation of two major railway corridors—ML-1 and ML-3—which are critical to boosting regional trade and connectivity while aligning Pakistan’s rail network with international standards.</p><small>2025-10-03 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/03123146a2efcb6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946304/apple-removes-us-immigration-enforcement-tracker-from-app-store' target='_blank'><strong>Apple removes US immigration enforcement tracker from app store</strong></a><br><p>Apple removed on Thursday several apps used to anonymously report the movements of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from its app store, reportedly following Trump administration pressure.
The apps had become increasingly popular in recent months as President Donald Trump’s deportation drive gained steam in cities around the country.
But Trump administration officials had fiercely criticised the apps as endangering officers, particularly following a deadly shooting at an ICE facility in Texas last month.
Officials said the shooter had used such an app in the days leading up to his attack.
Two detainees died as a result of the shooting, and another was wounded, though investigators believe the shooter was targeting ICE personnel.
Protests have occurred at ICE facilities and during ICE operations around the country, as Trump’s mass deportation drive has seen thousands of migrants rounded up, often by masked agents.
ICE tracking apps, including the popular ICEBlock, were inaccessible to AFP reporters on the Apple App Store late Thursday.
Fox Business first reported on the apps’ removal, with Attorney General Pam Bondi telling the news outlet that the Justice Department had “reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store —  and Apple did so.”
Apple did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment.
In a statement to NBC News, the company said: “Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store. “</p><small>2025-10-03 07:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/031128510c33d1b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946295/please-dont-politicise-it-sana-mir-responds-to-indian-backlash-over-commentary-during-womens-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>‘Please don’t politicise it’: Sana Mir responds to Indian backlash over commentary during Women’s World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Former women’s captain Sana Mir has issued a statement after receiving backlash from neighbouring India over saying that one of the Pakistan players included in the team for the Women’s World Cup belonged to Azad Kashmir, saying that things were being “blown out of proportion” and calling for it to not be politicised.
The Women’s World Cup is officially being hosted by India while Pakistan are playing their matches in Colombo as per a hybrid model. Mir is part of the ICC’s commentary panel for the Women’s World Cup.
During Pakistan’s match against Bangladesh on Thursday, which the Green Team lost, Mir had stated the following about Pakistan player Natalia Pervaiz: “A lot of these players are new, Natalia — who comes from Kashmir, Azad Kashmir — play in Lahore […]. She has to come to Lahore to play most of her cricket there.”
According to Times of India, the remark immediately drew reactions across social media, with Indian fans tagging the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) demanding her removal for “allegedly politicising the broadcast”.
“What caught even more attention was that Mir initially said ‘Kashmir’, before correcting herself to say ‘Azad Kashmir’,” Hindustan Times reported.
Subsequently, in a statement posted on X, Mir — who in June became the first female cricketer in Pakistan to be inducted into the ICC’s Hall of Fame — said: “It’s unfortunate how things are being blown out of proportion and people in sports are being subjected to unnecessary pressure. It is sad that this requires an explanation at public level.”
Without taking any names, she said that her comments about a “Pakistan player’s hometown” was only meant to “highlight the challenges she faced of coming from a certain region in Pakistan and her incredible journey”.
“It is part of the story telling we do as commentators as where the players come from. I did that today for two other players coming from other regions, too. Please don’t politicise it,” she added.
“As a commentator on the World Feed, we are meant to focus on the sport, teams, and players, highlighting inspiring stories of grit and perseverance. There is no malice in my heart or any intention to hurt sentiments,” she said.
Along with her post, Mir also shared an image of Pervaiz’s ESPNCricinfo profile which showed her hometown as Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Currently, the page shows her hometown as “Pakistan-administered Kashmir”.
“I am also attaching the screen shot of where I research most of my players from, whether from Pakistan or any other country. I realise that they have changed it by now, but this is what I was referring to,” Mir said in her statement.
The development comes days after tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad spilled over onto the cricketing field during the Sept 9-28 Men’s Asia Cup staged in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), when Indian cricketers refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during all three clashes in the tournament. The tensions had culminated in India not accepting the trophy from Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief.
The tournament had seen the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May after India had launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan had denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention.</p><small>2025-10-03 06:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/021446483d99c9b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946114/can-trumps-plan-bring-long-term-peace-to-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Can Trump’s plan bring long-term peace to Gaza?</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s plan for a ceasefire in Gaza may become a pivotal moment after nearly two years of war. It presents both the opportunity for a short-term cessation of hostilities and a long-term pathway to reordering Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories.
In the short-term, if accepted by both Hamas and Israel, it would immediately bring relief to the Palestinian people. That’s the only positive bit for the people of occupied Palestine, in the wake of Israel’s brutal bombardment campaign over the last two years that has killed over 65,000 people and injured more than 165,000 civilians.
A hostage-prisoner exchange will also relieve Israeli families. To this end, a template from the temporary ceasefire in January can be adopted.
Beyond that, for the long-term, the proposal is way too ambitious, and frankly speaking, unworkable. Intractable conflicts aren’t resolved suddenly through sketchy plans. Politics is difficult to square across Palestine, Israel and the Muslim world. And while this ‘peace plan’ has been drawn up following considerable pressure from across the globe, eventually President Trump’s focus will shift away to the next crisis and then, implementation will become even more challenging.
 
 

Ironically, the plan doesn’t even attempt to hold Israel accountable for its indiscriminate bombing of civilians, especially children over the past two years.
Ceasefire: Realistic yet elusive
For the people of Gaza and occupied territories, the two urgent priorities are a ceasefire agreement, followed by the resumption of aid. At this point, they cannot even think about the long-term mechanics of peace and prosperity. For them, a halt to the ongoing genocide and the indiscriminate bombing of civilians is a daily nightmare. This needs to end now.
Until the atrocities are stopped, any concurrence of Israel’s Netanyahu to any version of Trump’s plan is meaningless. Unfortunately, even after Nethanyahu agreed to the American proposal, bombardment in Gaza continued. On Wednesday, the Israeli defence minister issued a final warning to the residents of Gaza city to flee towards the southern part of the strip, as the Israeli military intensified its ground offensive to encircle the city. For the people of Gaza, even the prospect of a ceasefire is elusive, until the strikes continue.
For a realistic and sustainable ceasefire, a mechanism that places limitations on Israel’s military activity should have been included in the plan. Absent that, all substantive demands — political, military and governance — are being presented to Hamas as a fait accompli. The reason being: desperation of external stakeholders, especially regional actors, to broker a ceasefire where the fighting stops, even at the cost of the long-term interests of the Palestinian people.
Enter the Muslim world and the US
In recent weeks, as global diplomacy picked pace in New York on the sidelines of the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly, focus remained on the humanitarian crisis and the ongoing genocide in Gaza.
To respond to global rage, the US leadership engaged leaders of leading Muslim-majority countries, even outside the Arab world, to craft a new plan that would achieve both: a ceasefire and an attempt at a long-term mechanism for peace. The original goal has been short-term — secure a ceasefire, at any cost, while the long-term details are ironed out. Qatar’s leadership has stated as much on the record, giving an insight into the motivations behind the frantic diplomacy witnessed in recent days.
 
 

At a certain level, Israel and the US are adapting to the growing public pressure by Western and Muslim countries for establishing a ceasefire.
Israel’s international isolation has been growing and was on stark display during the annual session of the UN General Assembly, where Saudi-France efforts to recognise a Palestinian state and push for a two-state solution dominated the diplomacy.
For Gulf countries, especially Qatar, the Israeli airstrike in Doha proved to be a jolt: if war lingers, it can even reach secure cities of the Gulf. For President Trump, the relentless Israeli strikes and expanding ground invasion of Gaza undercut his pitch for the Nobel Peace prize: how could President Trump claim to have achieved world peace when a genocide in Gaza continues?
By consenting to the American and Arab-backed peace proposal, Israel is tactically changing the story in the court of international public opinion.
After the ceasefire: Challenge for Arab and Muslim leaders
The first part of the 20-point plan aims to establish a ceasefire in Gaza’s territory followed by a hostage-prisoner exchange and resumption of humanitarian aid.
Beyond that, it ventures into disarming Hamas, reordering governance in Gaza and the West Bank, and establishing a new security mechanism. It envisions managing the security of the occupied Palestinian territories by a multi-national International Stabilisation Force, in coordination with the Israeli military, while a Board of Peace comprising Trump and Tony Blair and a technocratic apolitical Palestinian administration implement the plan and run the region.
The multi-pronged plan, in its current form, is a vision that requires deliberations on each aspect between different Palestinian factions, and among the regional stakeholders. To implement the plan would require sustainable oversight and empowered regional or international mechanism.
In its current form, the plan appears to be a package proposed to secure a ceasefire by advancing aspirational ideas for the end-state of Gaza and occupied Palestinian territories. Even the end-state envisioned in the plan is problematic, as it pushes an unsustainable and asymmetric peace deal.
The fragility of the plan is manifested by shifting positions of Arab and Muslim countries, where notably Pakistan and Qatar have stated on the record that the document released by the White House has been modified without consultation with regional partners.
 
 

Crucially, Doha is stressing that details on future mechanics can be worked out later, while a ceasefire is realised now. This will create a new status-quo where a conditional ceasefire may be secured while the implementation of the plan will stay in limbo until the finer details are worked out.
Politics of the next steps
Beyond immediate ceasefire concerns, each stakeholder involved in framing the peace deal, as well as the parties who are expected to implement the plan will be guided by their own political imperatives and constraints.
For Israel, the deal in its current form as released by the White House, gives it a decisive veto over the future trajectory of the occupied Palestinian territories. The timeframe and guarantees related to the withdrawal of the Israeli military from Gaza are vague, and this can enable Netanyahu to own the deal politically, while boasting that Israel can begin military operations again, if it so wishes.
For Hamas, it is a decisive moment, where its future role either as a military force or a political movement will be determined. As Hamas faces pressure from its key partners — Qatar and Turkey — to agree to the ceasefire, its leadership will find it difficult to accept the full framework being advocated by the US and the regional countries.
Any amendments proposed by Hamas to its future role will complicate the viability of the fragile agreement and make the task of the Trump administration and mediating parties difficult. On its part, Hamas will continue to be a formidable force in Gazan society though its current bargaining position is under strain.
Beyond Israel and Hamas, the leading Muslim countries have entered uncharted territory. In their bid to secure a ceasefire and avert the displacement of Gazans from their territory, Muslim countries cannot become accessory to enabling Israel’s permanent military occupation.
 
 

Moreover, by shifting the responsibility of ensuring that Hamas agrees to the peace plan, the US has put Muslim leaders in the political spotlight — if Hamas doesn’t agree to the framework draft, then the onus of escalation in Israeli military activity rests with Hamas and Muslim countries. Conversely, even if the plan is implemented in some shape, then Muslim countries, especially Pakistan, Turkey and Indonesia, will have to engage with Israel on security coordination of the Gaza and West Bank, which will spark its own new challenges, both domestically and across the region.
The Gulf states will provide both diplomatic support and economic resources for rebuilding Gaza and the rehabilitation of Gazans, but they will likely not take on security responsibilities.
Peacebuilding is inherently chaotic, as witnessed in recent days. Crucially, peacebuilding requires patience and continuous engagement by all parties, and these are the two elements that are currently missing. For a peace initiative to be sustainable across Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories, it must have political ownership of the people of Palestine. Absent that, all efforts will only lead to a temporary cessation of hostilities until the next round.

“The woman had lost her way after being separated from her seven-member group. After several hours of hectic efforts, our personnel rescued her and shifted her back to her hotel,” DPO Shafiullah Khan Gandapur told journalists.
The tourist, identified as 66-year-old Karun Anne Malarik, was hiking on the Chapra track near Naran along with six other Germans when she lost contact with the group after nightfall in the thick forest.
“We mobilised two teams immediately after receiving information from our high-ups. After an intensive search in the mountainous terrain, she was safely rescued and reunited with her group,” said Mr Gandapur. He added that the group of German tourists, comprising four women and three men, had entered Kaghan Valley via Babusar Top after spending several days in Gilgit-Baltistan.
They were later heading to Islamabad following the incident and would proceed to their motherland.
Meanwhile, a team from the revenue department, led by tehsildar, warned Afghan refugees residing in camps to vacate their slum houses by October 5 or face forcible expulsion.
The team held talks with refugee elders in Barari Ichrian and Khaki camps, urging them to comply with the deadline. The refugees assured the officials that they were already preparing to leave.

The proposal was shared by Senator Ali Zafar after his meeting with the incarcerated former prime minister. He was speaking to the media the other day, after attending the hearing of Toshakhana-2 case against Mr Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi.
It is worth mentioning that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in August disqualified Omar Ayub Khan as the opposition leader in the National Assembly, following his conviction in the May 9 cases. After the disqualification of Omer Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the PTI chief on August 20 nominated Mr Achakzai and party veteran Azam Swati as opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate, respectively. The decision was announced by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja.
The move sparked a debate as to why an outsider was being considered for the slot of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, due to which the idea was dropped. Mr Achakzai is a veteran political figure from Balochistan, particularly known for his outspoken stance against the establishment.

However, Senator Ali Zafar revealed that Mr Khan was still interested in nominating Mr Achakzai as leader of the opposition.
He also said that Mr Khan expressed annoyance over the recent public allegations exchanged between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and his sister Aleema Khan, directing them to refrain from making statements against each other.
CM Gandapur had alleged that Aleema Khan was working for the Military Intelligence (MI) and establishment, and that she aspired to become party chairperson.

MUZAFFARABAD: A high-level government delegation held negotiations with a civil society alliance in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Thursday after days of fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers that have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured.
The eight-member committee, dispatched by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, comprises federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Amir Muq­am, Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Rana Sanaullah and Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, along with PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf and Qamar Zaman Kaira, and former AJK president Sardar Masood Khan.
They were accompanied by AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, who had been staying at Kashmir House in Islamabad for the past several days.
Negotiations began in the committee room of the Chief Secretary’s office in the afternoon, with Shaukat Nawaz Mir, Raja Amjad Ali Khan and Anjum Zaman Awan from the Muzaffarabad division representing the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), which has been spearheading the rights movement in the territory.
 






However, core members from the other two divisions — Poonch and Mirpur — could not immediately join the negotiations as they were away from the capital.
Sources said the Muzaffarabad trio, along with other core members, later left for Dhirkot, where their colleagues from Poonch and Mirpur had already gathered for consultations. The meeting continued until late in the night on Thursday and talks with the government’s high-level committee were expected to resume on Friday morning.
A strike has paralysed Azad Jammu and Kashmir under a communications blackout after talks over elite privileges and reserved refugee seats collapsed between the JKJAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers, sparking protests and violence. On Wed­nesday, the AJK prime minister and Parliamentary Affairs Mini­ster Tariq Fazal Chaudhry invited the alliance for fresh dialogue.
On Thursday, the entire region observed a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike for the fourth consecutive day, under a ceaseless communications blackout imposed since Monday. No fresh incidents of violence were reported.
Though government offices and banks technically remained open, attendance was negligible. Interestingly, many government officials avoided using official vehicles for commuting and instead preferred to walk or use rented motorcycles.
‘Enemies of Pakistan’
Before the delegation left for AJK capital Muzaffarabad, members of the government negotiating committee spoke to the media in Islamabad and stressed the need for dialogue to end the unrest that has gripped AJK for the past three days, Dawn.com reported.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the government should play its role to address the issues in AJK. However, he added that given the present situation in the region and the world, some “elements would want to disturb peace and stability in Pakistan to push forward their agendas”.
He said the government remained committed to resolving the issues of the people of AJK, but they should also be mindful that no such situation was being created, which “Pakistan’s enemies” could take advantage of.
AJK PM Haq thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz for issuing directives for sending a “high-level delegation” for restarting talks in the region and expressed the hope that members of the JKJAAC would also work towards ending the impasse in negotiations between the two sides.
Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said, “We are all saddened and concerned over the situation. We will try our best to fulfil the just demands of the people of Kashmir and steer them out of the current situation at the earliest as the enemies of Pakistan and Kashmir would have their own objectives.”
Rana Sanaullah also emphasised that “violence is not the solution” to any problem. He said they aimed to resolve the matters in accordance with the law and Constitution, ensuring the restoration and maintenance of peace.
Amir Muqam also thanked PM Shehbaz for addressing the issue. “We want the protest and the difficulties of the people of Kashmir to end. We hope that [JKJAAC] members would consider this … and engage with us for talks.”
Sardar Muhammad Yousuf, Qamar Zaman Kaira and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also shared similar views. The Ministry of Interior also convened an important meeting in Islamabad on Thursday to consider steps to defuse the situation.
PM calls for peace
According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on X earlier on Thursday, PM Shehbaz had directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad.
According to the statement, the prime minister voiced deep concern over the law and order situation in AJK as Wednesday’s violent protests left three policemen dead. He urged citizens to remain peaceful and instructed law enforcement agencies to show restraint.
 






“The prime minister has made a strong appeal to citizens to remain peaceful. He has urged that peaceful protest is the constitutional and democratic right of every citizen, but protesters should refrain from causing harm to public order.”
The premier also directed that law enforcement agencies exercise restraint and patience with the protesters.
“The prime minister has said that respect for public sentiments must be ensured, and any unnecessary harshness should be avoided,” the statement said, adding that the government was always ready to address the issues of its Kashmiri brothers.
Expressing “deep concern over the unfortunate incidents during the protests”, the premier ordered a transparent investigation into the matter.
Funerals in Muzaffarabad
Earlier in the day, hundreds of people gathered at Khurshid Football Stadium and the AJK capital’s famous Lala Chowk to attend the funerals of two people killed in an alleged police firing in Muzaffarabad.
Addressing the mourners, Mr Mir of JKJAAC updated the crowd on the latest developments, vowing that the struggle would continue until the acceptance of key demands.
These include the abolition of 12 refugee seats, withdrawal of elite privileges, implementation of a June 2019 High Court decision regarding agreements on power projects in AJK, and provision of health cards.
He stressed that before discussing these issues, the alliance would demand the immediate arrest and exemplary punishment of those responsible for killing “unarmed protesters” in Muzaffarabad, Dhirkot and other areas of AJK.
He also sought a public mandate to engage in negotiations with the official committee, pledging that there would be no compromise on people’s rights.
Reports from Kohala, a border town about 35km away, said that thousands of people from AJK’s southern districts had reached there by evening.
A source told Dawn that JKJAAC leaders had directed the crowd to wait in Kohala until further instructions after the conclusion of their consultations.

“The judiciary will not tolerate fissures within its ranks,” Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani said while hearing a contempt of court petition.
The petition was filed by Hafiz Ehtesham against lawyer Imaan Mazari. The petitioner, who is known for frequent litigation, objected to remarks attributed to Imaan Mazari in a speech about judges.
Hafiz Ehtesham alleged that she implied “five judges” were “victims of division” and “working under pressure”.
Justice Kayani put a question to the petitioner: “Which five judges do you mean?” After Ehtesham named five judges — including Justice Kayani himself — the bench intervened immediately, warning him not to continue.
“There is no division in this court, and neither shall we allow any division,” Justice Kayani asserted.
The five judges are: Justices Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Raffat Imtiaz.
 
 

He emphasised that if any judge believed their dignity had been undermined, they could choose to respond personally, but allowing others to speak on their behalf would create a misleading impression.
The judge said “there are good judges and incompetent judges”, but at the same time stressed that remarks like those made by Imaan Mazari fell within the domain of freedom of expression and should not be conflated with allegations of institutional discord.
The petitioner read aloud excerpts from Mazari’s speech delivered outside the National Press Club in an effort to substantiate his plea for contempt proceedings.
The bench, however, repeatedly questioned whether her comments crossed the legal threshold for contempt.
Justice Kayani observed that these days people consume information from multiple platforms ranging from traditional news outlets to YouTube vlogs and social media.
After hearing preliminary arguments, the court reserved its ruling on maintainability of the petition.
Pleasant change
Justice Kayani’s observations coincided with a notable change in atmosphere at the IHC. For the last few months, the five judges had refrained from attending official tea breaks hosted by Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar as they had challenged his transfer and subsequent elevation as IHC chief justice.
In the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision on Sept 30 to overturn the chief justice’s interim order (Sept 16) barring Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri from performing judicial functions, the five judges rejoined Justice Dogar and other colleagues at a tea break on Wednesday for the first time in months.
According to sources privy to the development, the five judges maintained a reserved demeanour during Wednesday’s interaction, but appeared noticeably more relaxed during Thursday’s gathering.

They highlight that the state needs a much more proactive counterterrorism policy. As per the Pakistan Institute of Conflict and Security Studies, the number of militant attacks in the country last month had dropped compared to August’s figures. However, as a report from the Centre for Research and Security Studies points out, the current year may be the deadliest in a decade where terrorism-related fatalities are concerned. According to the PICSS findings, there were 69 militant attacks in September, causing 135 deaths. The overwhelming number of fatalities were those of security men and civilians. Also, in keeping with the general trend, KP and Balochistan were the hardest hit by terrorist violence, with the former recording 45 attacks in September, and the latter province witnessing 21 attacks. The most recent of these was Tuesday’s deadly bombing targeting the Frontier Corps headquarters in Quetta. While there may have been a dip in militant violence last month, the overall numbers for 2025 are nevertheless extremely worrying. The CRSS says that in the first three quarters of this year, over 2,400 fatalities were recorded, which means that “2025 could mark one of the deadliest years in a decade”.
Yet, despite the perturbing statistics, the sense of urgency to deal with the terrorist threat seems to be lacking within the corridors of power. This is so despite the fact that the country has lost a high number of troops and civilians. The state’s response is more reactive, going after militants after every deadly incident of terrorism. In fact, the state needs to defeat both major insurgencies — the TTP-led campaign in KP and the separatist movement in Balochistan. While inimical external forces that are supporting these insurgencies need to be dealt with on the diplomatic front, we very much need to raise our own level of preparedness too. Pakistan cannot go through endless cycles of terrorist violence, followed by security operations, only for the situation to deteriorate once again. A mix of kinetic and policy actions are needed to address the core issues fuelling both insurgencies. While there should be zero tolerance for terrorism, the socioeconomic and political issues that are often used to ‘justify’ these violent campaigns also need to be addressed by the state.

Speaking at the Pakistan Business Summit, he noted that issues such as child stunting, poverty, and climate change were directly affecting the country’s long-term productivity and global standing.
The summit, held under the patronage of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, brought together policymakers, business leaders, and corporate executives to discuss Pakistan’s economic outlook, innovation, and global competitiveness. It was co-hosted by Nutshell Group and Al Baraka Bank, with the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) as a strategic partner.
The finance minister emphasised the government’s commitment to fostering an environment where the private sector could drive economic growth. He stated that the government’s role is to ensure macroeconomic stability, implement structural reforms, and create the right conditions for business and investment.

Outlines steps to foster private sector growth, boost remittances

Reviewing recent economic developments, Senator Aurangzeb highlighted a significant drop in financing costs following a reduction in the policy rate, an improvement in foreign exchange reserves, and stability in the exchange rate. These factors, he said, had bolstered investor confidence and facilitated the repatriation of dividends and profits.
The minister also reported a notable increase in remittances, which reached $38 billion last year and were projected to rise to between $41bn and $43bn in the current fiscal year. He pointed out that Pakistan had successfully repaid $500 million in Eurobond obligations in September, without causing market disruption, and was well-positioned to meet the upcoming $1.3bn repayment in April 2026.
 
 

Aurangzeb reaffirmed the government’s commitment to comprehensive tax reforms, aiming to separate tax policy from tax administration in order to restore credibility and consistency for investors. He also stressed that reforms in state-owned enterprises, privatisation efforts, and energy pricing were critical elements of the country’s economic agenda.
The minister further discussed Pakistan’s export-led growth strategy, tariff reforms to reduce duties on raw materials and intermediate goods, and measures to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). He cited recent engagements in Beijing, Riyadh, Washington, and New York as signs of renewed investor confidence, which included the signing of 24 joint venture agreements with Chinese companies.
He concluded by stressing that Pakistan’s path to sustainable growth hinges on increased competitiveness, private sector dynamism, and stronger coordination between the federal and provincial governments.
He also highlighted the importance of effectively utilising the Rs4.3tr national development budget, particularly for infrastructure, health, and education.
Minister Aurangzeb affirmed the government’s resolve to guide Pakistan toward sustainable economic recovery, global competitiveness, and resilience.

• Barter trade rules with Afghanistan, Iran, Russia overhauled to ease B2B flows              
ISLAMABAD: The Economic Co­­or­dination Committee (ECC) on Thursday approved about Rs24 billion in supplementary grants for security-related exp­enditures and ordered a rationalised plan for immediate costs linked to reopening the Roosevelt Hotel in New York.
The ECC meeting, presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb, also approved a barter trade mechanism for business-to-business (B2B) operations with Afghanistan, Iran and Russia — the latter two facing US sanctions.
Sources said the Ministry of Defence sought around $17.5 million to meet urgent liabilities at the historic Manhattan property, which could require up to $20m to restart operations pending a joint-venture arrangement through the Privatisation Commission. The hotel’s $200m lease with New York City, under which it housed migrants, was terminated earlier this year.
The ECC directed Pakistan International Airlines Investment Limited (PIA-IL) to hold separate deliberations with the Ministry of Finance to rationalise their demand, which appeared exaggerated to the committee members. It considered a summary submitted by the Ministry of Defence regarding financial support in the form of a Technical Supplementary Grant (TSG) to the Roosevelt Hotel. It expressed support for addressing the most urgent financial requirements of the hotel and directed the ministry to revisit and reconfirm its estimates and resubmit the matter, an official statement said.
Separately, the Privatisation Commis­sion is advancing a long-term joint venture for multi-purpose redevelopment and has received seven requests for proposals. The process was delayed after transaction adviser Jones Lang LaSalle exited in July over a potential conflict of interest; a new adviser is expected to be appointed within two weeks, with the transaction targeted within six months.
Among other decisions, the ECC approved Rs4bn for cash compensation to residents whose land was acquired for the Defence Complex Islamabad, to be arranged by the Finance Division, with the balance to come from the Capital Development Authority.
It also allocated Rs20bn to the Inte­rior Ministry for “maintenance of law and order”, to be released in tranches on demand, and Rs174.8m for law-enforcement requirements of Frontier Corps KP (North), Peshawar.
The ECC also approved a draft SRO at the req­u­­est of the Ministry of Commerce, aimed at amending the B2B Barter Trade Mechanism. Since the introduction of the mechanism in June 2023 for trade with Afghanistan, Iran and Russia, a number of problems have emerged in its implementation.
Sources said the business groups and stakeholders have been complaining about difficulties such as restrictions on sanctioned or non-sanctioned products, the condition of completing imports before exports could take place, etc. These issues slowed down trade and created obstacles for businesses.
To address these concerns, the Ministry of Commerce held detailed consultations with both public and private sector stakeholders, concluding that the list of specific products should be omitted and instead aligned with the general Export and Import Policy Orders.

The ad, issued by the Ministry of Information on Oct 1 and 2, appeared to warn social media users of an “enemy hiding behind the veil of technology and the internet”.
According to the ad, “Sometimes disguised as a reporter, sometimes as an NGO worker or freelancer, he extracts sensitive information from you that brings unrest, fear, and chaos to our streets.”
“Whoever wrote, designed and approved this ad has endangered the lives of journalists and civil society workers by depicting them as threats to national security. At a time when the media is already under intense pressure, this narrative is reckless and dangerous,” Freedom Network said in a statement released on Thursday.
The organisation expressed serious concern over the ad’s reference to reporters, freelancers, and civil society organisations, calling it “deeply troubling”.
The statement said it stigmatises journalists, undermines independent media, and amounts to a direct attack on press freedom guaranteed under Article 19.
Freedom Network further warned that the ad fuels hostility against individuals who deliver reliable information to the public.
The statement warned the campaign further endangers journalists already facing threats, harassment, and violence.
The half-page advertisement carried the headline: “Have you ever wondered what war looks like today?” It went on to declare: “Today, war is no longer fought on the battlefield. It is fought in our minds. The enemy’s bullets are no longer gunpowder … it’s information.”
The statement said the ad comes amid growing government pressure on social media, especially after an opposition leader’s jailing, adding that the crackdown on dissent has intensified nationwide.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the Women’s Action Forum (Lahore), Shirkat Gah-Women’s Resource Centre, South Asia Partnership-Pakistan, Simorgh, and the Centre for Legal Aid, Assistance and Settlement (CLAAS) have also strongly condemned the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s advertisement.
