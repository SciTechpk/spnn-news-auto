The 27th Amendment, passed by Parliament after five days of heated debate, opposition protests, and last-minute revisions, was widely criticised for abolishing judicial independence through the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and introducing changes to the military leadership structure by rewriting Article 243 of the Constitution (command of the armed forces).
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the rights body said the Amendment was a “crescendo of a concerted and sustained attack on the independence of the judiciary, right to fair trial and the rule of law in Pakistan”.







It called on authorities to conduct an urgent review of the Amendment to “ensure that all its provisions fully comply with Pakistan’s international human rights law obligations and commitments”.
It added the Amendment “insulates the president and heads of the naval, armed and air forces from accountability”.
“The Pakistani authorities must immediately take all appropriate measures to safeguard the impartiality, independence and safety of judges, ensuring that they can carry out their judicial functions without any inappropriate or unwarranted interference and any restrictions, improper influences, pressures and threats, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason,” the rights body said.
It noted that the Amendment violated “international human rights law, particularly undermining the independence of the judiciary, right to fair trial and justice and accountability”.
It urged Pakistani authorities to “uphold their international human rights obligations, effectively protect the human rights of everyone in the country, and ensure access to justice and effective remedies for victims, as well as respect the separation of powers and the rule of law”.
Amnesty maintained that the 27th Amendment had ensured the establishment of the FCC, which “lacks independence, erodes judges’ security“.
It noted that despite the Amendment’s “far-reaching consequences”, it was passed through Parliament with “no consultation with civil society and opposition parties”.
It recalled that on the day the Amendment was signed into law, two senior judges of the Supreme Court — Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah — had resigned. It added that two days later, a Lahore High Court had also resigned, referring to ex-judge Shams Mehmood Mirza.
The rights body said the 27th Amendment “further erodes judicial independence,” which it maintained had been “already weakened” by the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed in 2024. It noted that the 26th Amendment was “passed with similar haste, in less than 24 hours in October 2024”.
It added that the composition of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) — the body responsible for the appointment of judges of the Supreme and high courts — was changed under the 26th Amendment. Members of Parliament were added to the commission and judicial members were reduced to a minority, the statement said, adding that  the “change in composition to include the legislature of the JCP risks politicisation” of the appointment of judges.
Amnesty noted that the 26th Amendment transferred “the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction — the authority to hear cases at its own initiation — and advisory jurisdiction and authority to provide opinion on significant questions of law or public importance referred by the president — to the newly created Constitutional Benches“.
It said that the benches had “exclusive jurisdiction for cases that dealt with the interpretation of the Constitution.”
“A little over a year after the Constitutional Benches were constituted, the twenty-seventh amendment abolished the bench at the Supreme Court level and replaced it with a separate court — the Federal Constitutional Court.”
Concerns about ‘attacks on judiciary’
Amnesty noted that the 26th and 27th Amendments were brought “amid larger concerns regarding attacks on the judiciary”.
It noted that “in the past two years, various judges have raised concerns over interference with the judiciary as well as threats to judges deciding key cases involving the ruling coalition and military.”
The group recalled an open letter written by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — in March 2024.
It said that the letter, which was addressed to the then-chief justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, spoke of “intimidation by the military’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), abduction of family members of judges and surveillance in the judge’s private homes as tactics to pressurise them regarding ongoing cases, particularly those related to the former Prime Minister Imran Khan“.
Subsequent to the letter, Amnesty recalled, the case was then taken up by the SC that sought replies from the respective high courts, out of which the Peshawar High Court (PHC) responded that “interference in judicial matters by the executive was an ‘open secret’.”
In its reply, the PHC maintained that judges “faced threats from intelligence agencies while hearing ‘political’ cases. Judges are also subject to threats online and physically”.
The Amnesty statement also recalled an April 2024 incident, where various judges of the SC, as well as the high courts, received letters containing suspicious powder.
It added that in the same month, “an online campaign was launched maligning Justice Babar Sattar of the Islamabad High Court, one of the judges who had written the open letter.”
The rights body continued: “In March 2024, an anonymous complaint was filed against another author of the open letter, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, accusing him of ‘bias’ and ‘favouritism’.”
“It was subsequently not adjudicated upon by the SJC (Supreme Judicial Council).”
Amnesty recalled that another signatory to the letter — Justice Jahangiri — was removed over a case questioning the validity of his law degree in December 2025.
“Justice Jahangiri had raised concerns regarding his trial, arguing that it bypassed the procedure for removal of judges in the Constitution and that the bench hearing his case had [a] conflict of interest, as it included the [Islamabad High Court] Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, against whom Justice Jahangiri had filed a case at the SC challenging his eligibility as chief justice.“
‘Hastily adopted’
Amnesty noted that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk had referred to the 27th Amendment as “hastily adopted” and said that the process of its passing lacked “broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society”.
It said that the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also raised alarm over the hasty passage of the Amendment.
The HRCP, in a statement, had said that the Amendment was passed in “the absence of any meaningful consultation with the political opposition, the wider legal fraternity and civil society”.
“Amnesty International notes that there was no consultation with civil society and the draft was made public only on November 8 when it was presented in the Senate, mere hours after approval from the federal cabinet.”
Detailing further parliamentary proceedings that led to the eventual passing of the Amendment, the rights group said that “at no point during this process were civil society and other stakeholders consulted or given an opportunity to provide feedback on the draft amendment”.
Amnesty also took note of the “contested” composition of the parliament at the time of the passage of the Amendment.
In its statement, Amnesty said, “This amendment was passed at a time when opposition leaders in both houses had been disqualified after their convictions by anti-terrorism courts for alleged involvement in protests following the arrest of Imran on May 9 2023.”
It also recalled the issue of PTI’s reserved seats in the National Assembly (NA).
The PTI was stripped of its election symbol right before the 2024 general elections, following which the party nominees were forced to contest the polls as independent candidates.
The 80 PTI-backed independents in the NA had then joined the Sunni Ittehad Council to be able to claim reserved seats.

 

Amnesty said that in July 2024, a 13-member bench of the Supreme Court also “ruled that the PTI was entitled to its share of reserved seats”.
Had the 2024 judgment been implemented, the PTI-Sunni Ittehad Council bloc would have been the single largest party with 114 seats in the National Assembly, the Amnesty statement said.
“The verdict, however, was challenged at the Constitutional Bench after the 26th Amendment was adopted, and the bench ruled in June 2025 that the party was ineligible for the reserved seats.
“PTI’s reserved seats were then distributed among three parties, PML-N, PPP and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), effectively giving the ruling coalition a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.“
Implications of FCC’s establishment
Amnesty also raised alarm over the implications resulting from the establishment of the FCC.
The rights group warned of “serious implications for access to justice and human rights as cases relating to the application of fundamental rights under the constitution shall now lie with the new court”.
It further recalled that “powers of the Supreme Court to validate and review bans on political parties imposed by the federal government — under Article 17, which guarantees the right to freedom of association — have been transferred to the Federal Constitutional Court.“
“This has severe implications as the government has publicly made statements intending to ban its largest opposition party, PTI, in the past and the Punjab Assembly has passed a resolution to ban the PTI for being a ‘national security threat’.”
Amnesty said, “The absence of clear rules delineating jurisdiction between the Supreme Court and the Federal Constitutional Courts  [also] creates significant confusion on which forum would hear particular cases.”
It added that the ambiguity was “likely to cause procedural delays, to the detriment of litigant’s access to justice.”
Amnesty also warned of the possibility of “further confusion regarding the interpretation of the Constitution since the new court is not bound by past precedent of the Supreme Court”.
It also raised alarm over the process for the appointment of judges to the FCC and noted that the first batch of FCC judges was appointed directly by the executive branch.
“The first batch of judges to the Federal Constitutional Court and its chief justice are to be appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister, bypassing the JCP process under Article 175-A of the Constitution. These initial appointments raise concerns regarding direct political interference by the executive branch.
“Concerns persist for future appointments given the composition of the JCP after the 26th Amendment, as members of Parliament outnumber the judicial members and can thus dictate all future appointments.”
Amnesty quoted the United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers as saying that “there is a risk of court capture when laws establish that political branches should be involved in selecting judges to hear certain politically sensitive cases.”
“Additionally, the president also has powers to determine the number of judges for the new court, allowing the ruling government to change the composition of the court if certain judges are deemed unfavourable,” the rights group said.
These apprehensions deepened when the chief justice and first four judges of the FCC were sworn in on November 14, 2025, less than 24 hours after the 27th Amendment became law,“ it added.
“No criteria or justification for the appointments were provided.”
It also took note of the changes made to the process of the transfer of high court judges under Article 200.
The Amendment “gives the president absolute powers to make transfers, subject merely to recommendation from the JCP. The arbitrary and executive-heavy nature of this power now opens the possibility of transfer used as a punitive measure against judges who rule against the Pakistani authorities”.
Amnesty further noted that the Amendment also declared that any judge who refused transfer would be suspended and their case would be reviewed by the SJC, which now has powers to remove them for refusal of transfer under Article 209.
“This is in direct violation of the Basic Principles that state that removal of judges must only be for reasons of ‘incapacity or behaviour that renders them unfit to discharge their duties,’“ it said.

The decision came a day after Lahore High Court’s Justice Malik Awais Khalid heard a petition filed by Advocate Ashfaq challenging the suspension of his licence to practise law. The court had summoned the complete record of the PbBC about the licence suspension and also directed the council’s vice chairman to afford the lawyer an opportunity of a personal hearing and decide the matter by 2pm today.
The PbBC had suspended Ashfaq’s licence on a complaint from the president and general secretary of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) for representing Butt before a Karachi court despite a strike called by the bar.
On Tuesday, PbBC Vice Chairman Muhammad Ashfaq Kahooti said that Ashfaq’s licence had been “restored”. It stated that the same day the complaint against Ashfaq had been received, “a short notice was issued to him and, without affording him a proper opportunity of hearing, his licence to practice as an advocate was suspended” by the bar’s executive committee.
However, the order noted that the objection raised by Ashfaq regarding the lack of authority of the PbBC’s executive committee was “turned down as the said contention is misconceived”.
The vice chairman referred the matter to the council’s disciplinary committee for further proceedings and directed the office to inform the LHC about the decision.

 

The PbBC order stated that Ashfaq had submitted an application in the shape of an objection petition challenging his licence suspension. His application argued that the December 31 order was a “clear violation” of Article 10-A of the Constitution, as well as the “principles of natural justice, as the order was passed in absentia without providing him an opportunity of hearing”.
Ashfaq further contended that he had not “committed any misconduct either towards the legal fraternity or against the dignity of the legal profession”. The lawyer had described the complaint filed by KBA as “biased, mala fide, and motivated by certain members of its cabinet”.
The KBA had called the strike in protest against the alleged victimisation of its former librarian, Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro.
The PbBC’s December 31 order had noted that while defending his client, Ashfaq made statements against the legal fraternity, which the council described as serious professional impropriety.

 

The PbBC’s executive committee then unanimously decided to suspend Ashfaq’s licence to practice law with immediate effect. It referred the matter to the council’s disciplinary committee for further proceedings regarding the permanent cancellation.
Ashfaq has also been appearing as counsel for former spymaster Faiz Hameed in the trial concluded against him before a military court.</p><small>2026-01-06 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0613180575f7e46.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965450/item-a-film-that-wants-to-smash-the-male-gaze-but-ends-up-feeding-it' target='_blank'><strong>Item — a film that wants to smash the male gaze but ends up feeding it</strong></a><br><p></p><small>2026-01-06 08:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/061259142a97ad9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965448/azerbaijan-says-will-not-send-peacekeepers-to-gaza-president-says' target='_blank'><strong>Azerbaijan says will not send peacekeepers to Gaza, president says</strong></a><br><p>Azerbaijan has no intention of sending a contingent of its troops to take part in peacekeeping operations outside its borders, including in Gaza, President Ilham Aliyev said late on Monday.
Aliyev, interviewed by Azeri television channels, said Azerbaijan had been in contact with Donald Trump’s US administration with a list of questions about the operation of a peacekeeping force in Gaza.
“We prepared a questionnaire of more than 20 questions and provided it to the American side. No participation in peacekeeping forces is envisaged,” Aliyev said.
“I am not considering participation in hostilities outside Azerbaijan at all.”
An Azeri government source had said last November that Azerbaijan would provide no troops for such an operation unless there was a complete halt to fighting between Israel and Hamas.
Meanwhile, diplomats involved in the discussions told Dawn on Monday that despite deep reservations and fears of domestic backlash, most Muslim-majority countries associated with the Gaza peace process want the proposed ISF to succeed, arguing that only such a force can ensure the security and survival of Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
“Israel has already killed [more than] 70,000 people in Gaza, and only an international force with a clear mandate can stop this genocide,” said a diplomat from a Muslim nation, directly associated with the process.
Another diplomat acknowledged that participation in the ISF would place contributing states in an extremely difficult position, but said the alternatives were even bleaker.
“We know we would be pushed into a very difficult situation if we joined the ISF,” he said. “But the alternative is even worse — uninterrupted bloodshed in Gaza, and that’s not acceptable to us.”</p><small>2026-01-06 08:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06114346aead559.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965445/ex-nazim-injured-in-ied-blast-outside-his-office-in-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-nazim injured in IED blast outside his office in Bannu</strong></a><br><p>BANNU: The former nazim of Bannu district’s Domel tehsil, Fida Muhammad Khan Wazir, was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on Tuesday.
Asif Hassan, the Bannu police spokesperson, confirmed the incident to Dawn, saying that a pre-installed improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated at the office gate in the Domel Bazaar area.
Soon after it was reported, a heavy contingent rushed to the scene, cordoned off the area and formally initiated an investigation.
Police and local sources said the explosion occurred outside the main gate of the former nazim’s office in Domel Bazaar.
At the time of the blast, Wazir was present in his vehicle and sustained minor injuries, they said.
As a result of the explosion, his vehicle was completely destroyed, while the office gate and the surrounding area also suffered damage, they added.
It is worth mentioning that Wazir has previously played a leading role in peace movements against terrorism and remained at the forefront in forming tribal lashkars to establish peace in the area.
On Tuesday, an important gathering of tribal elders was expected to be held at the same office. The former nazim was on his way to attend the meeting when the incident occurred.
Meanwhile, tribal elders came out onto the streets and announced a strong protest and harsh response by gathering at the scene of the incident. Further, armed individuals were also spotted along the Bannu Kohat Road.
The Bannu police spokesperson said the situation was being closely monitored.

 

The incident comes a day after a man and his son, belonging to the Hathikhel tribe, were allegedly abducted by suspected terrorists in Bannu. Police and locals said on Monday that Ahya Jan and his son were travelling in a car with their family to visit their relatives in the area when unidentified armed men intercepted them near Jhandokhel in Domel, made them disembark from the vehicle and shifted them to an unknown location.
On Sunday, a police constable was martyred when armed assailants shot him in Bannu‘s Kashfi Khel area. The same day, three traffic police personnel were martyred in firing by suspected terrorists in Lakki Marwat district’s Serai Naurang area, police said.
On December 2, then-Miranshah assistant commissioner Shah Wali and two cops were among four martyred after the official’s vehicle came under attack in Bannu.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.</p><small>2026-01-06 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06101906658b37d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965438/venezuelan-opposition-leader-vows-to-return-home-as-soon-as-possible-rejects-countrys-interim-president' target='_blank'><strong>Venezuelan opposition leader vows to return home ‘as soon as possible’, rejects country’s interim president</strong></a><br><p>Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said on Monday she plans to return home “as soon as possible,” and slammed the interim president in Caracas.
In her first public comments since a social media post over the weekend, when the US military forcibly removed and kidnapped President Nicolas Maduro, the Nobel Peace Prize winner vowed to return to her country.
She had left Venezuela last month to travel to Norway to accept the award, and hasn’t returned since.

 

“I’m planning to go back to Venezuela as soon as possible,” Machado told broadcaster Sean Hannity on Fox News, speaking from an undisclosed location.
Machado openly rejected the country’s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, saying she “is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narcotrafficking”.
Rodriguez, who has signalled her willingness to cooperate with Washington, was Venezuela’s vice president under Maduro.
Machado said Rodriguez is “rejected” by the Venezuelan people, and voters were on the opposition’s side.
“In free and fair elections, we will win by over 90 per cent of the votes, I have no doubt about it,” Machado said.
Machado also vowed to “turn Venezuela into the energy hub of the Americas” and “dismantle all these criminal structures” that have harmed her countrymen, promising to “bring millions of Venezuelans that have been forced to flee our country back home”.







Machado says she hasn’t spoken to Trump since Oct
Machado also said on Monday she hasn’t spoken to US President Donald Trump since October 2025.
“Actually, I spoke with President Trump on October 10, the same day the (Noble Peace) Prize was announced, (but) not since then,” Machado said on the Fox News programme.
She was awarded the prize for her fight against what the Norwegian Nobel Committee called a dictatorship.
She also welcomed the US actions as “a huge step for humanity, for freedom and human dignity”.
Trump on Saturday had dismissed the idea of working with Machado, saying “she doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country.”
CIA concludes regime loyalists best suited to lead Venezuela: sources
A classified CIA assessment presented to Trump has concluded senior Maduro loyalists, including vice president Rodriguez, were best positioned to maintain stability if the Venezuelan leader lost power, two sources briefed on the matter said on Monday.
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed an exclusive report by the Wall Street Journal.
Trump was briefed on the report, and it was shared with a small group of his senior national security team, the sources said.
The assessment was one reason why Trump decided to back Maduro’s vice president, Rodriguez, instead of opposition leader Machado, the sources said.
The White House declined to confirm the report.
“President Trump is routinely briefed on domestic political dynamics all over the world. The president and his national security team are making realistic decisions to finally ensure Venezuela aligns with the interests of the United States, and becomes a better country for the Venezuelan people,“ White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in response to a query.</p><small>2026-01-06 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/061029444888224.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965439/smith-in-charge-after-heads-163-to-put-australia-seven-behind-england' target='_blank'><strong>Smith in charge after Head’s 163 to put Australia seven behind England</strong></a><br><p>Run-machine Travis Head hit a swashbuckling 163 and Steve Smith an unbeaten 65 as Australia moved to within seven runs of England’s first innings 384 at tea on day three of the fifth and final Ashes Test on Tuesday.
It was the destructive opener’s third ton of the series, to go with the phenomenal match-winning 123 he made in Perth and 170 at Adelaide.
It helped drive the hosts, who began the day 166-2, to 377-6 at the break in a packed Sydney Cricket Ground, with Cameron Green alongside Smith on eight not out.
Head brought up three figures off just 105 balls and seemed destined to score 200.







But he came undone in the third over after lunch by the part-time spin of Jacob Bethell, who was bowling for the first time in the series.
In his second over, Bethell trapped the 32-year-old lbw attempting a sweep shot to end a magnificent knock.
Usman Khawaja, in his 88th and last Test after announcing his retirement, also fell lbw in the second session, to Brydon Carse for 17.
Josh Tongue was probing and finally got a reward when he enticed an edge from Alex Carey to Bethell in the slips on 16 just before tea to reinvigorate England.
The hosts lead the series 3-1 and have already retained the Ashes, with England desperate for another win after victory at the previous Test in Melbourne.
Head resumed on 91 and nightwatchman Michael Neser on one after Jake Weatherald (21) and Marnus Labuschagne (48) were out on Monday.
Head clattered an early midwicket boundary off Ben Stokes and reached three figures with his 17th four, crunched through the covers from Tongue, windmilling his bat in celebration.
It was his 12th century and first in Sydney to cement his reputation as one of the game’s most versatile batsmen.
Head only moved to the top of the order in the second innings of the first Test in Perth due to Khawaja’s back injury, but he has made the position his own.
With his hundred secure, he banged three straight fours off Matthew Potts then had a massive let-off on 121 when he pulled Carse and Will Jacks dropped a sitter near the ropes.
A big six off Potts took him to 148 and he passed 150 with another four from Tongue.
Neser ably stuck around for 90 balls to foil England, who wasted their last two reviews on him.
Batting like a top-order batsman, he smacked four boundaries before getting a thin edge on 24 to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith off Carse.
Smith, on 12, was dropped at leg slip by Zak Crawley but safely made it to lunch and posted 50 for a 45th time with a drive down the ground.
When Khawaja departed, Carey produced a series of textbook strokes before being dismissed in a similar way to his last two Tests.</p><small>2026-01-06 05:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06101428ca239ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965324/exotic-fish-species-are-threat-to-aquatic-biodiversity-govt-warned' target='_blank'><strong>Exotic fish species are threat to aquatic biodiversity, govt warned</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-P) has called upon the government to keep a vigil on the introduction of exotic fish species in the country and to establish quarantine facilities for keeping fish species imported for aquaculture and aquarium trade. 
The organisation issued a statement on Monday, describing invasive fish species a looming threat to aquatic biodiversity and fisheries economy after an unusual fish was brought to the Karachi Fish Harbour from Sukkur on Sunday and no one there was able to identify it.
“It was an Amazon sailfin catfish. This fish, which has thick armoured body covered with bony plates, is an exotic fish that has an exotic species accidently introduced into natural water bodies and is spread in the provinces of Sindh and lower Punjab,” the WWF-P said, adding that the catfish is native to Latin America and is popular around the world as an aquarium fish. 
It said: “This species is among the 26 invasive fish species that have been introduced in Pakistan accidentally or deliberately, and have become invasive, have a detrimental impact on the aquatic biodiversity of Pakistan, and are threatening the delicate balance and function of the ecosystem.

WWF-Pakistan calls for strict oversight on fish imported for aquaculture and aquarium trade

“Invasive fish species are known to severely disrupt aquatic ecosystems by outcompeting natives for food and space, preying on them, introducing diseases, and altering habitats, leading to biodiversity loss, economic damage to fisheries, and even ecosystem collapse, with impacts ranging from increased water turbidity to native fish extinctions and significant losses in commercial fishing revenue. The spread of invasive species is considered a serious threat to delicate aquatic ecosystems in natural water bodies, including rivers, streams, and lakes in Pakistan,” the organisation said.
Considering the serious impact of invasive fish on the aquatic ecosystem, WWF-P has ensured inclusion of these species in the recent revision of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan under the Convention on Biological Diversity as a potential threat to national biodiversity. 
“WWF-Pakistan has requested all concerned organisations including the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, and the Animal Quarantine Department (under the Ministry of National Food Security and Research), to keep a vigil on the introduction of exotic fish species in Pakistan and to establish quarantine facilities for keeping fish species imported for aquaculture and aquarium trade,” the statement said.

The statement was made at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) summoned to discuss the recent developments in Venezuela. This is also the first meeting for the year of the UNSC, with Somalia in the chair.
The US had launched a shock military operation in Venezuela on Saturday, with special forces capturing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in a nighttime raid.
Pakistan’s Acting Permanent Representative Ambassador Usman Jadoon said in his address that at a time when the world was already facing multiple crises, instability in the region “does not augur well for regional and international peace and security”.
He reminded Council members that the UN Charter bound states to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, and to uphold sovereign equality, non-interference in internal affairs and the peaceful settlement of disputes.
Ambassador Jadoon added that unilateral military action contravened these “sacrosanct principles” as well as the doctrine of sovereign immunity, warning that such actions set dangerous precedents and risked eroding the foundations of the global legal framework.
He cautioned that such actions also fuel instability, which, “as history has shown time and again, can lead to unpredictable and uncontrollable outcomes for years to come“.
Calling for de-escalation, the Pakistani envoy said that at this critical juncture, “the path forward must be one of dialogue and diplomacy,” stressing that durable solutions to political differences could only be achieved through peaceful means and with full respect for the will of the Venezuelan people, free from external interference.
He expressed hope that Latin America and the Caribbean, recognised as a ‘Zone of Peace’, would remain free from conflict and confrontation and continue moving towards enhanced regional cooperation and improved prosperity.

Pakistan urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint, de-escalate tensions, refrain from actions that could exacerbate the situation, and engage in dialogue, including by utilising sincere offers of mediation.
Jadoon noted that the offices of the secretary-general remained available for that purpose.
Concluding his remarks, he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to contributing constructively to the Security Council’s primary responsibility for addressing threats to international peace and security by diffusing tensions, promoting pacific settlement and upholding respect for international law and the UN Charter.
“Peace and stability of Venezuela and the welfare and prosperity of its people, with full ownership, must be the overriding objective of all efforts,” he said.
UN chief concerned about instability in Venezuela, legality of US operation
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres raised concerns about a possible intensification of instability in Venezuela after Maduro’s capture.
“I am deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability in the country, the potential impact on the region, and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted,” Guterres said in a statement delivered to the council by UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo.







Guterres called on all Venezuelan actors to engage in an inclusive and democratic dialogue, adding: “I welcome and am ready to support all efforts aimed at assisting Venezuelans in finding a peaceful way forward.”
He also expressed concern that the US operation to capture Maduro in Caracas on Saturday did not respect the rules of international law.Pakistan urges restraint, dialogue on Venezuela
‘Surgical law enforcement operation’
As UN officials and several UN diplomats sharply criticised Washington’s intervention in Venezuela, US Ambassador Michael G. Waltz defended the action before the Security Council as a justified “surgical law enforcement operation”.
“If the United Nations in this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist with the same treatment in this Charter as a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organisation is this?” Waltz asked.
The US envoy said Washington had acted to apprehend two indicted fugitives, naming President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Celia Flores, and insisted the operation did not constitute a war against Venezuela or its people.
He described Maduro as a fugitive and the leader of a “vicious foreign terrorist organisation”, alleging links to international drug trafficking networks that use “illegal narcotics as a weapon”.

Waltz compared the action to the 1989 US operation that led to the arrest of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
Citing broader human rights concerns, the ambassador referred to allegations of extra-judicial killings, torture and arbitrary detentions in Venezuela, and said more than eight million Venezuelans had fled the country.
China’s representative said his country was “deeply shocked by, and strongly condemns” what he described as the United States’ “unilateral, illegal and bullying acts” against Venezuela.
He accused Washington of “wantonly trampling upon Venezuela’s sovereignty, security and legitimate rights and interests“, placing power above multilateralism and military action above diplomacy.
Warning of a grave threat to peace in Latin America and beyond, the Chinese envoy urged the United States to heed what he called the “overwhelming voice” of the international community and return to dialogue.
Russian Ambassador Vassily A. Nebenzia condemned the United States for what he called armed aggression against Venezuela in violation of international law, urging Washington to immediately release the “legitimately elected President” and his spouse.
Calling on Council members to abandon double standards, Mr Nebenzia warned against justifying “such an egregious act of aggression” out of fear of what he termed the “American global gendarme”.
He further accused the United States of seeking control over Venezuela’s natural resources, saying its actions were generating “fresh momentum for neocolonialism and imperialism”.
Following Maduro’s capture, US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Washington would govern Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition takes place”.
“We don‘t want to be involved with having somebody else get in and we have the same situation that we had for the last, long period of years,” the US president said. “So we’re going to run the country, until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition. We’re going to run it, essentially.”

Is there a power vacuum after Maduro’s exit? Evidently not. Will the Bolivarian republic crumble before the firepower of America? Unlikely, in view of the fact that too much Russian, Chinese and Iranian investment has gone into buttressing Bolivarian rule for it to be easily scuttled. Remember that Hugo Chávez was also kidnapped in a coup staged by the CIA. But his people rallied and Chávez returned to lead the country until his mysterious early death. Tariq Ali, in his memoirs, You Can’t Please All has a chapter on his meetings with Chávez and Maduro. It’s titled “Was Hugo Chávez murdered?” There’s a distinct possibility his cancer was induced.
The story, however, is about Donald Trump’s fear of Brics and his suspicion of the Bolivarian revolution Chávez launched after his electoral victory in Venezuela in 1998. This has irked the West. In this sense, the story hasn’t really moved forward since the Anglo-American Operation Ajax toppled Mohammad Mosaddegh’s elected government in Iran in 1953. That was about oil. Last week’s kidnapping of Maduro is also about oil even if the Trump administration is rowing back from its claim of running Venezuela.
What role is Brics playing to worry Trump, so much so that two key Brics members, Iran and Venezuela, are in America’s constant crosshairs? They are both heavily sanctioned countries. With Brics becoming a cohesive financial and economic platform, the hold of sanctions as a tool of US coercion would most likely be rendered ineffective, a key worry for the US.
Chávez’s Bolivarian revolution needs to be understood nicely for a good reason. Chávez leaned heavily on Simón Bolívar’s ideals of Latin American unity, sovereignty, and anti-imperialism. Simón Bolívar was the 19th-century liberator who led South America’s independence from Spain. However, dozens of roads and landmarks in the US and other Western countries are named after Bolívar. Chávez plotted something else.

We don’t know how many Venezuelans were killed. But there was resistance.

Nehru inaugurated a Simón Bolívar Road in Delhi’s diplomatic enclave in 1955. Bolívar inspired Nehru’s Non-aligned Movement and Third World solidarity. To the right-wing Narendra Modi government, the road would be an embarrassment. It was evident in the foreign ministry’s tame response to Trump’s attack on a Brics country. “Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation.” Thus spake the Brics host for later this year. In neighbouring Bangladesh, people took to the streets to protest the heist.
Trump has strong reasons to want to oust the Bolivarian republic. Chávez rewrote the constitution that established new rights, strengthened the executive, and allowed for re-election. Funded by oil revenue, he launched vast social programmes targeting poverty. These included free community healthcare, staffed initially by Cuban doctors; a massive literacy campaign; a mission for subsidised food, housing, and university education. A Qadhafi-like irritant but in the Western hemisphere, a challenge to the Monroe Doctrine.

 

In his adventurous attack on Venezuela, Trump looked like a quack dressed as a handyman assigned the task of staunching America’s slide as a Great Power. His bombing raids on seven nations last year defined his view of Pax Americana. His targets were Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria, Nigeria, Somalia and Venezuela. For all that and more, including the supervision of Israeli genocide of Palestinians, he demanded the Nobel Peace Prize, which went instead to a female Venezuelan dissenter who Trump cheered first but has distanced himself from after last week’s removal of Maduro to New York. Seymour Hersh noted that the bombings were inflicted without significant complaint from the Republican-led Congress.
Easily the most significant concern for the US is the Venezuelan state taking control of key sectors of oil, telecommunications, electricity, steel, and cement. The constitution is committed to the redistribution of large, unused estates to peasants. Currency and price controls are implemented to combat capital flight and inflation, though they also contributed to economic distortions. Venezuela under Chávez/Maduro pursued Latin American integration outside US influence, promoting the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America and offering subsidised oil for Caribbean nations. The revolution aimed to fundamentally transform Venezuelan society, moving it away from the neoliberal, two-party system that had dominated since 1958 and towards a model of ‘21st century socialism’.
As usual, the news about the dangerous military intervention was used to highlight American intelligence and military prowess instead. Stories were circulated about the derring-do of the elite Delta Force commandos who seized Maduro and his wife by bombing their way into his heavily guarded palace. However, Cuba is mourning the death of 32 Cuban guards who were protecting the first family. They were killed in the air and ground mission. We don’t know how many Vene­zuelans were killed. But there was resistance, and that resistance is believed to be the signal for a rehearsed plan to turn a swoop on Venezuelan resources into a nightmare for Trump.
Sensing the resistance, Trump threatened Venezuela’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, with the fate of her president. Tapped to take control of the country after Maduro’s removal to the US, Rodríguez has claimed that the operation to arrest him had a “Zionist tinge”. She warned that “the extremists who have promoted armed aggression against our country — history and justice will make them pay”.
What role could Israel have played in the assault on a distant country? Not very different from the role that Iran has as a strategic ally of Bolivarian Venezuela. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar was quick to congratulate Trump, saying the US “acted as the leader of the free world”. But Trump’s ties with Israel have split his MAGA base. As he struggles to keep his majority in both Houses of Congress in polls due in November, Trump may have overplayed his hand in using the military to fix runaway domestic challenges.

The mortals among us — and who have friends to party with — had barely recovered from New Year’s Eve when the US’s Nobel Peace Prize aspirant invaded a country and kidnapped its president.
Hardly new stuff for those who remember Iraq, or Panama, or … the list can be rather long. But it was a wee bit surprising, coming from a president who can’t stop listing the number of wars he has stopped. What stopped journos in their tracks was the president’s failure to invoke either the fruits of democracy or the freedoms of brown oppressed people, especially women. There were no such helpful diversions. The oil will help the US, it was proclaimed. Now where does that leave the likes of us who want to shake their heads in despair and explain the limitations of nation-building exercises? The world and its craziness is forcing commentators out of a job faster than one can say AI.
It is no easier in Pakistan.
How does one make sense of an authoritarian interlude in which no dollars are flowing in? After all, we are trained to analyse the power flowing down the barrel of a gun that has dollar signs painted on it. However, without the dollars, it seems a bit uncertain and unstable (and it has been for quite a few years now), but it is hard to figure out how long it will last. The 10-year pendulum surely doesn’t cut it anymore. But what ready analysis can replace this? No one knows.

It seems as if all the political soap opera plot twists have been done, and talked about, to death.

So the state is hardening and it rules with an iron glove. Yet it has not been able to tame the people entirely. The anger may not be expressed as loudly as it once was, but no one can ignore the simmering. As a result, the PTI is still a force and so is Imran Khan. On top of this, he refuses to go into exile. What a pain he is because if he left for foreign climes, it would be so easy to believe the khatam shud predictions of some of the commentariat.

 

In other words, the nail-biting contest threatens to continue in 2026 and those of us in the business of analysis have little left to say. Truly. There are just so many times one can predict doom and gloom and ask everyone to talk for the greater good. Because frankly, our leadership just isn’t as honest as the chap in the US; our lot claims to worry about the people here and it’s a story that no one buys now and yet they continue to tell it. They know that no one buys it; we know that they know that we know they don’t care and yet the drama continues. And now no one is listening.
It seems as if all the political soap opera plot twists have been done and talked about to death. Take another example. The predictions about the democratic DNA in Nawaz Sharif or Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari coming to the fore are now also becoming less common. It’s been months since anyone has spoken of Sharif senior’s desire to see Imran Khan free and nearly years since anyone has spoken of the tensions between father Zardari and son Bhutto-Zardari and the latter struggling to break free. No one is now expecting the true democrats to say “enough” and hiding their disappointment analysts speak of the choices in Pakistan being limited to authoritarianism and fascism.
No different is all the ‘sane’ talk about talks. It’s about as promising as the MoUs Pakistan signs each time a foreign leader meets a government official or the promises about the economy taking off. No one can even be bothered to argue about it. And neither does anyone think 2026 will bring any change, so great is the ‘paralysis’. Though I have learnt that one can call it jamood on the talk show.
Even the soothsayers or najoomis who were called to talk shows while the rest of us were making New Year plans had nothing new to offer. They seem to sound no different from the political soothsayers who tell us of the greatness that awaits the country in 2026. The king is in his counting house and the prime minister is having bread and honey. And the rest are stuck hanging out clothes in their backyard while the FBR is pecking noses and far more.
The point here is that there is nothing new to say about the state of the nation, the society and what passes for politics. It is now beyond us all, be it the najoomis or the analysts. And don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. But because we too have to pay taxes and then the bills which have more taxes within them, this column has to be written week after week.
So it might just happen that soon this space turns into something rather different. Instead of Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan and others, it might just make sense to write on middle-age challenges such as trying to lose weight or deal with acidity; cooking; the painful watching options on Netflix; or even an agony aunt section. Anything at the moment seems more possible than writing on politics. The latter, even politicians assure me, is done and dusted. Which reminds me, what about a styling column for politicians? Many of them, especially the men, can do with a makeover. What is this love affair with Kala Kola, for instance? Why not go for sophisticated grey streaks?
If there are better ideas out there for what a weekly column can be about, suggestions are welcome. For I have taxes to pay before I sleep. Miles of taxes … with apologies to Robert Frost.

For quite a while, US President Donald Trump had been issuing blunt statements regarding the Venezuelan leadership, framing its policies and even existence as a threat to regional stability. Last weekend, he made good on his implied threats by sending US forces into the Latin American nation to forcibly bring its president to the US.
Nicolás Maduro has since been paraded on US streets, on his way to face US justice: the head of a sovereign nation reduced to a war trophy for the American president. It is an extraordinary development that cannot be viewed merely through the lens of South American politics. Rather, it represents the unapologetic revival of regime-change tactics by a major global power, and raises the question: what remains of the so-called ‘rules-based order’ when the sovereignty of nations has been reduced to a conditional privilege?
The US has a long history of intervention in South America, often driven by the protection of corporate interests rather than any genuine commitment to democratic ideals. During the Cold War era, it used the fear of communism to justify supporting authoritarian regimes that had aligned themselves with US economic priorities.
The rhetoric has shifted since then. Today, in the US leadership’s discourse around Venezuela and its neighbouring states, there is reduced emphasis on ideology and an increased focus on resources, specifically oil and minerals. Regime change has thus been turned into a tool for appropriation and exploitation.
There seems to be no shame in it either. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently declared, “I do not care what the UN says. The UN does not know what they’re talking about.” He had been challenged on the repeated claim that Venezuela was involved in the drug trade. In short, the US will now act as judge, jury and executioner.

 

The silence of the international community has been equally disconcerting. There has been a very muted or fragmented response from the UN and major powers that claim to defend multilateralism. Some have even gone so far as to endorse the overthrow of the Maduro government. Others have issued mealy-mouthed condemnations and meek appeals to adhere to the UN Charter.
This lack of pushback contrasts sharply with the swift condemnations seen from the same nations in other geopolitical contexts, where the aggressor is not the US or one of its allies. This selective outrage will further erode the credibility and moral authority of the global order. The sovereignty of every nation must be respected, regardless of which political system they employ. If this simple principle cannot be honoured in practice, the international order cannot survive long.
Interventions like the one in Venezuela cannot be countenanced. The world must speak up.

During talks in Cairo, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan stressed their countries’ “identical” positions on “reaching peaceful solutions to the region’s crises”, an Egyptian presidency statement said.
They said solutions must “preserve the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of states,” singling out Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and the Gaza Strip.
A recent internal conflict in Yemen involves the internationally recognised government and the separatist Southern Transitional Coun­­cil (STC).

Sisi welcomes Riyadh’s proposal to host ‘inclusive conference’ for southern groups

President Sisi on Monday welcomed Saudi Arabia’s proposal to host an “inclusive conference” for southern Yemeni groups, while Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty called for de-escalation and a Yemeni-led political settlement.
On Sunday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Saudi crown prince in a phone call that his country was ready to help dialogue between Yemen’s factions.
Erdogan told Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman during the phone call that Turkiye “is ready to contribute to efforts aimed at bringing parties together”, according to his office.
The STC has welcomed a call for dialogue by Saudi Arabia to end the recent military escalation. The STC said in a statement on Saturday that the Saudi initiative was a “genuine opportunity for serious dialogue” that could safeguard “the aspirations of the southern people”.
Tarek Saleh, a member of the Yem­en Presidential Council, met Saudi Defence Minister Prince Khaled bin Salman and exchanged viewpoints on Yemen.
They discussed means to bolster joint efforts to support the stability of the country and the region’s security.
Yemen’s government on Sunday accused the separatists of cutting off the city of Aden and warned it would “take all necessary measures” after recapturing territory from them in the east on Saturday.

The announcement was made on Monday by PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh during a press conference at party headquarters, Insaf House, where senior leaders vowed to take Imran Khan’s “clear and unequivocal” message directly to the people.

 

Framing the tour as a turning point, Mr Sheikh said Imran Khan had personally entrusted CM Afridi with the mission of mobilising the masses and challenging what the party described as an assault on the public mandate.
“PTI is not a party of one province or one city. From Karachi to Kashmore, from Hyderabad to Thar, Imran Khan’s message will echo through the streets of Sindh,” he added.

Haleem Adil says KP chief executive will tour Karachi and other cities from Jan 9 to 11

According to the announced schedule, CM Afridi will depart from Islamabad on Jan 9 and arrive in Karachi at around 11am, where he will be received by party workers and supporters. A rally will then accompany him to Insaf House, followed by a series of meetings with party leaders and delegations.
His Karachi engagements include interactions with traders at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a Meet with the Press at the Karachi Press Club, and street movements across districts South, Korangi and Malir.
He is also expected to meet incarcerated PTI workers, which the party says underscores its campaign narrative of resistance and sacrifice.
The momentum will carry into Jan 10 as CM Afridi travels to Hyderabad. On his route, he will be welcomed in Jamshoro by Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah.
The Hyderabad leg features street protests in Kotri, addresses to the High Court Bar Association and Press Club, meetings with journalists, intellectuals and farmers, and a gathering at Insaf House Hyderabad.
An ISF convention and city-wide street mobilisation are also planned before CM Afridi returns to Karachi later that night.
On Jan 11, the focus shifts back to Karachi, with organisational meetings, media talks and street movements planned in District Central, Keamari, West and East.
The KP chief minister will also visit Mazar-i-Quaid, where he is expected to address supporters, while the PTI Youth Wing launches a special mobilisation drive.
The PTI Sindh chapter president said that a meeting between the chief ministers of KP and Sindh is expected on Jan 12, pending official confirmation.
He added that senior PTI leaders, including Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja, ministers, and parliamentary leaders, will accompany CM Afridi throughout the tour.
Warning against any obstruction, Mr Sheikh said PTI hoped the Sindh government would avoid “fascist tactics,” stressing that public mobilisation was a constitutional right.
Declaring February 8, 2024 a “black day”, he said the party was united and ready to intensify its struggle for judicial independence and Imran Khan’s release.

PARIS: Iran refused on Monday to offer “rioters” leniency while defending citizens’ right to demonstrate, a defiant stance taken after US President Donald Trump warned Tehran would “get hit very hard” if authorities killed more demonstrators amid deadly unrest.
Judiciary Chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei ordered officials to take a hard line against those causing instability as protests, which erupted over economic stagnation, expanded to include political demands.
“I instruct the attorney general and prosecutors across the country to act in accordance with the law and with resolve against the rioters and those who support them… and to show no leniency or indulgence,” Mohseni Ejei said, according to the judiciary’s Mizan news agency.
He added that Iran “listens to the protesters and their criticism, and distinguishes between them and rioters”.
Demonstrations have taken place in 23 of Iran’s 31 provinces, affecting at least 45 different cities to varying degrees.
The unrest has been concentrated in the west and consists mostly of small or medium-sized gatherings, according to an AFP tally based on official statements and media reports.
At least 12 people, including members of the security forces, have been killed in localised clashes since Dec 30, officials announced.
Since the protests began on Dec 28 — sparked when shopkeepers in the capital of Tehran staged a strike over high prices — officials have struck a conciliatory tone regarding economic demands while vowing to crush destabilisation.
Trump threats
Trump on Sunday told reporters aboard Air Force One that the US was watching the situation “very closely”.
“If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump said.
Iran’s economy has been hit hard by tough international sanctions.
The national currency, the rial, has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year, and inflation is in the double digits.
To alleviate economic pressure, the government announced Sunday a monthly allowance for every citizen equivalent to roughly 3.5 per cent of the average monthly wage.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country stood “in solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people and with their aspirations for freedom.”
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei, speaking at a press conference, accused Israel of trying “to exploit the slightest opportunity to sow division and undermine our national unity.”
Israel fought a 12-day war with Iran in June, which the US briefly joined with limited strikes on Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities.
Explosives seized
Police intelligence officers in Tehran have identified a suspected hideout used by “rioters,” seizing “weapons, ammunition, and materials for making improvised explosive devices,” according to Mizan.
The Fars news agency reported on Monday that “the trend observed on Sun­day night shows a notable decrease in the number of gatherings and their geogra­phic reach compared to previous nights.”
While videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify, local media’s accounting is not exhaustive, and state-run outlets have downplayed coverage of the demonstrations.
Most shops in Tehran were open Monday and residents went about their business. However, riot police were deployed at major intersections and officers were stationed outside some schools. Several universities have resumed classes, though only online.
The reformist newspaper Arman Melli said Monday that authorities had “heard the voices of the protesters”, while the conservative papers Javan and Kayhan accused the United States and Israel of financially supporting rioters.
Protests have also taken place among the Iranian diaspora.
“With each new protest, Iranian men and women gain ground,” Sahar Aghakhani, a 29-year-old French-Iranian translator, said at a demonstration in Paris on Sunday. “Movement by movement, we’re getting closer to the end of the regime.” Iran has experienced several outbreaks of nationwide protests in recent years, most notably in 2022 over the death in custody of Mahsa Amini for an alleged breach of the country’s strict dress laws for women. The current protests have not yet reached the same scale.

A sessions court on Monday granted pre-arrest bail to the qawwal after he was booked in a case for performing a song associated with ex-premier Imran Khan during a government-sponsored cultural event.
In the first information report (FIR), the complainant, Shalimar Gardens in-charge Zameerul Hasan, alleged that qawwal Faraz Amjad Khan gave the event a “political colour” as he sung “Qaidi No. 804” in reference to former prime minister Imran Khan. Additional District and Sessions Judge Shazaib Dar took up the bail application filed by the artist, who appeared before the court along with his lawyer.
Faraz’s counsel submitted that the petitioner had no affiliation with any political party and that he performed the song at the request of participants in the cultural programme.

Qawwal gets pre-arrest bail for singing a song linked to party leader; 7 wedding guests detained for raising slogans for Imran

He requested the court to grant pre-arrest bail to the singer as he wanted to join the investigation to “prove his innocence”.
After preliminary arguments, the judge allowed the bail till Jan 13 and sought the case record from the police.
Baghbanpura police registered an FIR on Sunday night against Faraz for performing the song ‘Nak Da Koka 2 Murshid’ at the “non-political” programme organised by the Walled City of Lahore Authority on Jan 3.
According to the complainant, the qawwal and his band members “deliberately sang an inciting political song without permission.”
The administration then asked the singer to stop, which sparked public unrest and incitement, posing a risk to law and order.
The case invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace), and 505 (1b) (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In the other incident, the Gujranwala district administration detained seven supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf after they chanted slogans carrying pictures of jailed party founder Imran Khan at a wedding function near Rahwali Cantonment.
Gujranwala Deputy Commissioner Naveed Ahmed, on the basis of a report from the Gujranwala police, issued the detention orders of seven PTI supporters under section 03 of the maintenance of public order (MPO) for the period of 14 days from January 03.
Earlier the local police had arrested the PTI supporters including Istikhar Ahmed of Talwandi Khajoor Wali, Tariq Mehmood of Lambawali, Kareem Bhinder of Rahwali, Zahid of Shareefpura, Imran Beig of Salamat Pura, Zeeshan of Kashmirpura and Ayaz of Tarragari. They were later sent to the Gujranwala district jail.
These detained people had chanted slogans in favour of Imran Khan while carrying his posters at the stage of a wedding ceremony of Hassan Malik in a banquet hall near Rahwali.
The local police reported to the administration that these PTI supporters had planned to stage a protest demonstration by blocking the main GT road in favour of the party leader.

KARACHI: After sealing the entire motorcycle market on Akbar Road, authorities on Monday sealed the automobilespareparts market off M.A.Jinnah Road near Tibet Centre, as well as hundreds of shops in other parts of the metropolis.
The expansion of the drive against encroachments — from owners of roadside eateries to traders who contribute millions in taxes daily — raised many eyebrows.
Officials claimed that as many as 86 shops in the autospareparts market were sealed because vehicles parked in front of the shops for repairs encroached on the main road, causing traffic snarls.
A similar reason was given by the authorities for sealing as many as 115 shops in the Akbar Road motorcycle market, which remained shut on Monday, as well as dozens of other shops in the city’s business district.
Deputy Commissioner South Javed Nabi Khoso said that the shopkeepers at Tibet Centre had been given warning three times to remove encroachments in front of their shops.
He claimed that most mechanics and electricians who worked on the roadside in front of the sealed shops were hired by shop owners, seeking to grow their businesses. “Due to double parking of vehicles, the road had become too congested, affecting the flow of traffic,” he said.
Shopkeepers told to submit affidavit
A meeting held on Monday decided that any shopkeeper who does not submit an affidavit providing written assurance of compliance with the standard operating procedures (SOPs) will not be allowed to open shops.
It was decided that shops which submitted undertakings to the DCs would be reopened in a phased manner and any establishment that violated the SOPs would have its premises sealed for three days.
The DC-South said that after the affidavit was submitted, any further breach of the SOPs would result in arrests and the registration of FIRs against the violators.
Officials said that the authorities had sealed as many as 196 eateries in different parts of the city during the past three days.
Karachi Commissioner SyedHassanNaqvi told Dawn that the city’s antiencroachment campaign would remain in force, and that no shop or eatery would be permitted to place articles or goods on walkways.
He said that the crackdown would continue to curb the growing trend of encroachments and obstructions on footpaths, roads and service lanes.
‘Action may harm economy’
However, traders dismissed the government action as unnecessary, warning that it would harm their businesses and the country’s economy.
Muhammad Sabir Shaikh, a former officebearer of the Motorcycle Dealers Association, said that showcasing automobiles and bikes in front of their outlets is a worldwide practice.
“Authorities should have marked a lane in front of the shops for displaying motorcycles,” he demanded.
“The whole exercise, under the guise of an antiencroachment drive, is simply aimed at raising rates,” alleged another bike dealer, without elaborating.

The meetings are crucial to the administration’s hopes of getting top US oil companies back into the South American nation after its government, nearly two decades ago, took control of US-led energy operations there.
The three biggest US oil companies — Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron — have not yet had any conversations with the administration about Maduro’s ouster, according to four oil industry executives familiar with the matter, contradicting Trump’s statements over the weekend that he had already held meetings with “all” the US oil companies, both before and since Maduro was seized.

 

“Nobody in those three companies has had conversations with the White House about operating in Venezuela, pre-removal or post-removal to this point,” one of the sources said on Monday.
The upcoming meetings will be crucial to the administration’s hopes to boost crude oil production and exports from Venezuela, a former OPEC nation which sits atop the world’s largest reserves and whose barrels can be refined by specially designed US refineries.
Achieving that goal will require years of work and billions of dollars of investment, analysts say.
It is unclear what executives will be attending the upcoming meetings, and whether oil companies will be attending individually or collectively.
The White House did not comment on the meetings but said it believed the US oil industry was ready to move into Venezuela.
“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.
Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump told NBC News the US may subsidise oil companies to enable them to rebuild Venezuela’s energy infrastructure.
Asked if the administration had briefed any oil companies ahead of the military operation, Trump said, “No. But weve been talking to the concept of, ‘what if we did it?’”
“The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something,” Trump told NBC News.
“But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it.”
He told NBC News it was “too soon” to say whether he had personally spoken to top executives at the three companies.
“I speak to everybody,” he said.
CBS News, citing an unnamed source, said executives from the three were expected to meet on Thursday with Energy Secretary Chris Wright.
One oil industry executive told Reuters the companies would be reluctant to talk about potential Venezuela operations in group settings with the White House, citing anti-trust concerns that limit collective discussions among competitors about investment plans, timing and production levels.
Big plans, big problems
US forces on Saturday conducted a lightning raid on Venezuela’s capital, arresting Maduro in the dead of night and sending him to the United States to face narcoterrorism charges.
Trump said hours after Maduro’s capture he expects the biggest US oil companies to spend billions of dollars boosting Venezuela’s oil production, after it dropped to around a third of its peak over the past two decades due to underinvestment and sanctions.
But those plans will be hindered by lack of infrastructure, along with deep uncertainty over the countrys political future, legal framework and long-term US policy, according to industry analysts.
Chevron is the only American major currently operating in Venezuela’s oil fields.
Exxon and ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, had storied histories in the country before their projects were nationalised by former President Hugo Chavez.
“I don’t think you’re going to see any company other than Chevron, who’s already there, you know, commit to developing this resource,” said one oil industry executive, who asked not to be named discussing the issue.
Conoco has been seeking billions of dollars in restitution for the takeover of three oil projects in Venezuela under Chavez. Exxon was involved in lengthy arbitration cases against Venezuela after it exited the country in 2007.
Chevron, which exports around 150,000 barrels per day of crude from Venezuela to the US Gulf Coast, meanwhile, has had to carefully maneuver with the Trump administration in an effort to maintain its presence in the country in recent years.
Investors were optimistic, betting Washington’s move against Venezuela’s leadership would allow US firms access to the oil reserves.
A US embargo on Venezuelan oil remained in full effect, Trump said.
The S&P 500 energy index rose to its highest since March 2025, with heavyweights Exxon Mobil rising 2.2 per cent and Chevron jumping 5.1pc.</p><small>2026-01-06 03:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06075832dbe7364.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965373/chinas-birth-rate-push-sputters-as-couples-opt-to-stay-child-free' target='_blank'><strong>China’s birth-rate push sputters as couples opt to stay child-free</strong></a><br><p>BEIJING: Twenty-five-year-old Grace and her husband are set on staying child-free, resisting pressure from their parents and society to produce offspring, even as China strives to boost its flagging birth rate.
A decade since China scrapped its stringent one-child policy and implemented a two-child policy in January 2016, the nation is dealing with a looming demographic crisis.
The country’s population has shrunk for three straight years, with the United Nations predicting it could fall from 1.4 billion today to 633 million by 2100.
There were just 9.54 million births in China in 2024 — half the number than in 2016 — and concerns about the shrinking and ageing population have been growing as couples choose to buck traditional Chinese norms.
More young people like Grace, who refers to herself and her husband as DINKs — or “dual income no kids” — have either sworn against having children at all or are putting it off for the next few years.
These couples’ reasons run the gamut from high child-rearing costs to career concerns.
Grace, who asked to be identified by her English name over fears of repercussions, said she needed to have a decent income and “some savings” before starting a family.
Without these conditions, “I wouldn’t even consider having kids”, the content creator added.
The term “DINK” has gone viral on Chinese social media, including Xiaohongshu, where its hashtag has received more than 731 million views, sparking differing views on the subject.
“If I were to widely publicise the fact that I’m a DINK and talk about how comfortable my life is, there would definitely be many people who wouldn’t be happy about it,” Grace said.
Changing attitudes
Chinese authorities have rolled out pronatalist incentives after ending their one-child policy — which had been in place for more than three decades to address poverty and overpopulation.
Top leaders have pledged more childcare relief, including subsidies to parents to the tune of $500 per year for every child under the age of three, state media reported in July.
Beijing also slapped a value-added tax on condoms and other contraceptives in January.
But experts say China, which was overtaken by India as the world’s most populous nation in 2023, still faces significant hurdles in boosting its birth rate.
“The number of people choosing not to marry or not to have children is increasing, and fertility intentions among the younger generation are weak,” He Yafu, an independent Chinese demographer, said.
Cultural constraints have limited the long-term effectiveness of China’s pronatalist measures, said Pan Wang, an associate professor at Australia’s University of New South Wales.
“The one-child policy fundamentally reshaped family norms and also people’s lifestyles, because many people, especially the one-child generation, were used to and often prefer smaller family sizes,” Wang said.

The Balochistan Home Department issued a notification confirming the extension, which includes a ban on the display of weapons, public processions and the use of tinted vehicle windows.
The order prohibits public gatherings of five or more people. Authorities also banned the operation of unregistered motorcycles and the covering of faces in public using masks or mufflers. Pillion riding remains forbidden, though exceptions allow for the transportation of women and children. Violators will face legal action under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code, according to the notification.

The dispute emerged in November 2020 when the CCP — an independent regulatory body established in 2007 under the Competition Act with an objective to ensure a level-playing field in markets by preventing anti-competitive practices such as cartels, deceptive marketing and mergers that may harm competition — issued identical show-cause notices to the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) and different sugar mills across the country, accusing them of violating Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2010, which bans cartelisation.
A four-member CCP panel after hearing the case had a split decision in August 2021 whereby two members, including then chairperson Rahat Kaunain Hassan, found the mills guilty and the remaining two members sought a fresh inquiry. However, the chairperson cast a deciding vote that resulted in the imposition of Rs44 billion fines on almost 72 sugar mills for alleged manipulative practices.
The sugar mills challenged that decision before the appellate tribunal, which in May 2025 ordered a new hearing by a member who had not signed either opinion. In September, the SC struck down the tribunal’s order and CCP’s casting-vote decision, and while annulling the fines referred the matter back to the ‘tribunal’ for fresh proceedings based on the original 2020 notices.
Instituted by senior counsel Asma Hamid, the review petition sought a clarification on the SC’s decision to remand the matter to the tribunal instead of the CCP for fresh hearing.
The review petition pleaded that the power to make an order on the basis of inquiries/show cause notices vests with the commission in exercise of its powers under Section 30 of the Competition Commission Act, 2010. It is in exercise of powers vested in the commission that the inquiries were conducted and show cause notices were issued, orders made and penalties recovered for the contraventions of the act committed by the parties (sugar mills), it argued.

The rally was organised by All Parties Kech in collaboration with traders, the Doctors Association and civil society.
Marchers moved through main roads and streets of the district headquarters of Kech district, starting from Officer Bazaar, passing through various routes, reaching the Press Club and then proceeding to Shaheed Fida Chowk, where the march turned into a protest.
“The protection of citizens is the responsibility of the state and its institutions,” National Party President Dr Abdul Malik Baloch said while describing the situation in Kech as “alarming”.

Political leaders warn of district-wide strike

Demonstrators demanded the recovery of two recently abducted youths, Haseeb Haji Yaseen and Shah Nawaz Gul Jan, and called on state institutions to protect citizens.
Mr Malik, while demanding the recovery, warned that attempts were once again being made to push Kech toward instability, but said the people of Kech would resist such efforts.
He urged the district administration to provide protection to citizens and said that for the past month, affected families and political leaders had approached relevant institutions, but each continued to shift responsibility to others.
All Parties Kech Convener Nawab Khan Shambezai announced that a district-wide strike would be observed on Jan 7 if the two youths did not return.
The Kech Bar Association boycotted court proceedings in solidarity with the families of the abducted.
Advocate Syed Majeed Shah, the association’s president, condemned the kidnappings.
Business activities and daily life have been severely disrupted by the recent wave of crime, according to local leaders.
Mir Ghafoor Ahmed Bizenjo, a former minister, said that citizens were “living under a sense of fear” and called on the state to ensure public safety.
Human rights defenders and other speakers at the rally said the insecurity affects the entire Makran region, demanding an end to the kidnappings that have particularly targeted the business community.

In its first of the kind “Fiscal Risk Monitoring Framework for Contingent Liabilities of PPP Projects”, in line with commitments made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the ministry’s Debt Management Office reported a total of Rs472.3bn in such liabilities as of Dec 2025.
More than 71pc (Rs335.6bn) of the total pertained to contingent liabilities of the Sindh government, which has the largest portfolio of 17 PPP projects — almost half of 36 across the country.

Total liabilities exceeded Rs472bn by end of last month

The federal government’s total contingent liabilities against PPP projects amounted to Rs90.6bn, or 19.3pc of the cumulative amount, followed by Punjab at Rs26.5bn (5.6pc) and Rs19.6bn (4.2pc of the total) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government.
Balochistan has no such liabilities, although its five projects were among the 36 total PPP project portfolio across the country.
In its latest written commitment to the IMF, the government had promised to improve the risk monitoring framework of public-private partnerships, including those at the provincial level.
“We will subject PPP-funded projects to the same rigorous selection criteria applied to projects funded through other sources”, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said, adding that Risk Management Unit (RMU) in the Ministry of Finance, in coordination with other stakeholders, was in the process of establishing a monitoring framework for quantifying contingent liabilities related to PPPs for publishing estimates by end-December 2025.
Contingent liabilities are those contractual obligations of the state for which public sector entities have assumed risks against these PPP projects and are calculated in nominal values calculated over the life of the contract.
Of the total liabilities, Rs368.3bn pertain to contingent fiscal responsibilities that may accrue due to minimum revenue guaranteed by the respective governments against a specific project, cost escalation, interest rate fluctuations or terminal liabilities, while another Rs104bn have been pitched as financial guarantees.
Cost escalation
The report suggests Sindh’s direct contingent liabilities because of cost escalation, minimum revenue guarantee and terminal liabilities stand at Rs255.5bn, accounting for close to 70pc of the Rs368.3bn consolidated national amount. Sindh’s largest risk exposure for contingent liabilities stems from cost escalation estimated at Rs146.6bn, followed by Rs61bn for minimum revenue guaranteed by the provincial government to private partners.
This is in addition to about Rs80bn in financial guarantees.
The federal government’s total PPP liabilities of Rs90.6bn include Rs83.7bn on account of termination liabilities and Rs7bn in financial guarantees. Financial guarantees are instruments issued against a financial commitment agreed to be undertaken by the public sector like viability gap financing support.
The report highlighted ‘high’ risk of these contingent liabilities becoming actually due on account of Rs150bn each for cost escalation and termination liabilities, Rs104bn on account of financial guarantees and about Rs66bn for minimum revenue guarantees, led by Sindh with Rs61bn.
IMF stipulation
The framework is required under the IMF programme to establish a consistent system for identifying, quantifying, and reporting contingent liabilities arising from PPP projects at both federal and provincial government levels.
This is because the PPP contracts can create fiscal exposures that do not immediately appear in budget or debt statements, but could materialise later through guarantee calls, revenue support mechanisms, indexation adjustments or termination-related payments.
The framework provides a uniform methodology to classify and quantify both direct and contingent liabilities and to consolidate these into a single national PPP fiscal exposure dataset managed by the RMU of the Ministry of Finance.

A two-member BHC bench comprising Chief Justice Muhammad Kamran Mulakhail and Justice Gul Hassan Tareen ordered the suspension of the provincial government notification during the hearing of a petition filed by senior advocate Rahib Khan Buledi, chairman of executive committee of the Balochistan Bar Council, challenging the provincial government move. 
Advocates Iftikhar Ahmed Langove and Abdul Baseer Kakar also filed similar petitions in the high court. 
In their petitions, the petitioners challenged the notification issued by the Balochistan government on December 30, 2025, under Section 22 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). 
The notification appointed all divisional commissioners, additional commissioners, deputy commissioners, additional deputy commissioners, and assistant commissioners as Justices of Peace within their jurisdiction. 
The notification also authorised them to perform functions under Sections 22-A and 22-B of the CrPC.
Counsel for the petitioners pleaded that the notification was issued unilaterally, without consultation or approval from the Chief Justice of Balochistan High Court, in violation of Articles 175(3), 202, and 203 of the Constitution. 
They pointed out that under existing law, sessions judges and designated additional sessions judges already serve as ex-officio Justices of Peace, and that granting such judicial powers to executive officers undermines the constitutional principle of separation of powers and threatens the independence of the judiciary.
They further contended that although Section 22 of the CrPC allows the government to appoint Justices of Peace in rural areas, such appointments must follow proper rules defining their powers and limitations. They argued that the impu­gned notification has effectively created a parallel judicial system by vesting judicial authority in executive officials.
The BHC bench admitted petitions for hearing and issued notices to respondents, and ordered that the notification would stay suspended until the next hearing of the case. 
It also directed that copies of the court order be sent to respondents and the office of the advocate general for information and compliance. The matter is expected to be taken up again after the winter vacation.

Addressing a press conference alongside CTD Additional Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Ali Larik in Karachi, CTD Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ghulam Azfar Mahesar said that law enforcement agencies and the “premier intelligence agency” received information that terrorists were planning an attack to target the city.
Mahesar said that the terrorists were planning to attack specific targets in Karachi to “destabilise” national security. He said that intelligence agencies, the Special Branch, the Intelligence Bureau as well as Sindh and Balochistan CTD designed a strategy to thwart these plans.
He said that intelligence officials were deployed in different locations, while focusing on Karachi’s west region.
Mahesar said that after several days of robust efforts, officials succeeded in getting information on a terrorist hideout in Raees Goth, Karachi, where terrorists had prepared a large amount of explosive material.
He said that upon receiving the information, Sindh CTD and the “premier intelligence agency” conducted a joint raid.
“We captured one terrorist, while three or four of them managed to escape the scene,“ he said. Mahesar affirmed that the agencies had initiated a search operation to ensure their capture.
“The officials recovered a Mazda truck loaded with explosive materials,” he said. He said 30 drums filled with explosives, five cylinders filled with explosives, 2,000kg of explosives and detonators had been seized.

He said that raids were conducted on six sites on the information provided by the terrorist who was arrested, after which another two terrorists were captured, who were also in possession of explosive material.
He said a total of three terrorists had been arrested.
Mahesar said that during the initial interrogation, the terrorists revealed that they were associated with the Bashir Zeb network of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Majeed Brigade.

The CTD official said that the additional interrogation and investigation was under way, and authorities were conducting raids to make more arrests. He further said that facilitators and handlers of this terrorist network were identified.
“All the planning regarding the attack was done from outside the country,“ he said. The CTD official said that the facilitators and the handlers involved had been identified, adding that several teams were working on their arrest.

He said that the explosive material that was shifted to the metropolis was “ready to go”, adding that this was a major achievement of all agencies that had prevented a major attack in Karachi.
He said that the explosive material seized was “a mix”, saying that some of it was an amalgam of commercial explosives and other items, while some of it was smuggled through Balochistan’s mountainous regions.
The CTD official said that more details on this would be shared at a later date.</p><small>2026-01-05 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0516552338009d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965268/greenland-says-no-more-fantasies-about-annexation-after-trump-remarks' target='_blank'><strong>Greenland says ‘no more fantasies about annexation’ after Trump remarks</strong></a><br><p>Greenland’s leader declared “enough is enough”, and Denmark’s allies in Europe affirmed that the Arctic island’s future must be determined by its people, rebuffing renewed remarks by US President Donald Trump about acquiring the vast territory.
Trump spoke a day after the US special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a stunning raid, with Trump stating that Washington intended to oversee governance of the oil-rich Latin American country. The US operation rekindled concerns in Denmark that Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, might face a similar scenario.
Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take over Greenland, an ambition first voiced in 2019 during his first presidency. On Sunday, he told The Atlantic magazine in an interview: “We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence.”
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early on Monday, Trump said he would revisit the topic in a few weeks.
“Threats, pressure, and talk of annexation have no place between friends,” Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Facebook late on Sunday.
“Enough is enough. […] No more fantasies about annexation.”



On December 21, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. Landry has publicly expressed support for incorporating Greenland into the US.
Greenland’s strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site in the US ballistic missile defence system. The island’s significant mineral resources also align with Washington’s ambition to reduce dependence on Chinese exports.
Support for Denmark and Greenland came swiftly from Nordic and Baltic leaders following Trump’s latest remarks.
President Alexander Stubb of Finland posted on X late on Sunday: “No one decides for Greenland and Denmark but Greenland and Denmark themselves. Our Nordic friend Denmark and Statsministeriet (Prime Minister’s Office) have our full support.”







France also expressed solidarity, saying Greenland belonged to the people of Greenland. President Emmanuel Macron said last June during a visit to Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, that the island was threatened by “predatory ambition”.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Sunday that US comments about needing to take over Greenland made “absolutely no sense”.
Protection of Greenland will be discussed within Nato if needed: Germany
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Monday that Greenland belonged to Denmark and that the Nato alliance could discuss strengthening its protection if necessary.
Wadephul was speaking after US President Donald Trump made renewed threats to take over Greenland.
Speaking to reporters in Lithuania, Wadephul said Germany had questions about Maduro’s removal and stressed the Venezuelan people should determine their country’s future in free and fair elections, after Trump said the US would run the country.
On Greenland, Wadephul stressed it was part of Denmark.
“And since Denmark is a member of Nato, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to Nato defence,” he said.
“And if there are further requirements to strengthen defence efforts concerning Greenland, then we will have to discuss this within the framework of the alliance.”
He did not elaborate on the nature of those discussions.</p><small>2026-01-05 13:35</small></div><hr>
