<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051211183d52f0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959322/trump-set-for-soccer-or-football-diplomacy-at-world-cup-draw' target='_blank'><strong>Trump set for soccer — or football — diplomacy at World Cup draw</strong></a><br><p>Donald Trump still seems unsure whether to call it soccer or football. But the US president’s aim is truer when using the world’s favorite sport to score diplomatic goals.
Trump will try to do so again Friday when he meets the leaders of 2026 World Cup co-hosts Canada and Mexico at the tournament’s draw in Washington.
As the first World Cup hosted by three countries simultaneously, it should be a golden opportunity to show North American unity, with the three leaders reportedly set to take part in a ceremonial draw.
But Trump’s aggressive stance towards his allies on trade, migration and drug-trafficking since his return to power means they will have thorny issues to tackle on the sidelines of the gala event.
For Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum it will be her first meeting with Trump. She told reporters they would discuss bilateral trade during the “small meeting” before the draw, in which the 48 qualifying teams are divided into 12 World Cup groups.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has visited the White House twice but it will be his first encounter with Trump since briefly meeting in South Korea in November, after Trump suspended trade talks in a bizarre row over an anti-tariff ad.
They will have a “brief meeting during their time together at the Kennedy Center,” the venue for the tournament draw, Carney’s office told AFP Thursday, adding that he would also meet briefly with Sheinbaum.
Trump has slapped steep tariffs on exports from Canada and Mexico that do not fall under the USMCA trade agreement that Washington is seeking to renegotiate next year.
He has threatened further punishment if they fail to curb cross-border migration and drug trafficking — and irked Sheinbaum by saying he would be “OK” with airstrikes on Mexico to tackle traffickers.
Canada meanwhile was outraged by Trump’s calls earlier this year for it to become the 51st US state.
FIFA ‘peace prize’
Yet the three countries now find themselves hosting the world’s biggest sporting event together, having launched their joint bid in 2017 during Trump’s first term in the White House.
He has unashamedly seized on the World Cup to score political and diplomatic points — even though the golf fan’s knowledge of the beautiful game mainly comes from his son Barron, 19.
The US president has struck up a close friendship with FIFA boss Gianni Infantino, who also has close ties with a number of authoritarian leaders including Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
Trump dangled the carrot of the chance to compete at the 2026 World Cup as a possible “incentive” for Russia — banned from international football since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine — to end the war.
Infantino is set to play to Trump’s love of flattery when he presents a new FIFA “peace prize” on Friday that the US leader is widely expected to win.
Trump has hosted Infantino several times at the White House — as he did Portuguese superstar Ronaldo at a dinner for visiting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November.

But Trump’s football diplomacy has also risked colliding with his domestic priority of a massive crackdown on immigration.
Trump recently unveiled a special fast-track visa process for people with World Cup tickets, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that a ticket would not guarantee admission to the United States.
More recently, Trump responded to an Afghan national allegedly shooting two National Guard members in Washington by slapping a freeze on all asylum decisions from 19 countries.
They include World Cup participants Haiti and Iran.
Trump has also caused jitters at FIFA and in foreign capitals by threatening to move World Cup matches from Democratic-run cities where he has launched anti-crime and immigrant operations.</p><small>2025-12-05 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28174456d63758b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957084/going-back-in-time-on-the-banks-of-the-indus' target='_blank'><strong>Going back in time on the banks of the Indus</strong></a><br><p>The journey began the moment we veered onto the newly built Hakla-D.I. Khan Motorway, leaving Islamabad for a landscape that felt almost primordial.
Within minutes, the view changed: rolling mountains unfurled on either side and gorges plunged unexpectedly beside us, at times intercepted by small mountain streams. We were bound for Kalabagh (about two hours from Islamabad) for a boat journey along the mighty Indus.


On the banks of the Indus River

At Tarap, we took a short detour to visit a centuries-old baoli — a traditional Indian stepwell once used for drinking water and everyday domestic needs. This one was impressively well preserved, and the tourism department is now working to restore it, along with several other baolis across Punjab. From there, we drove to a beautifully kept farmhouse overlooking fruit orchards and the River Soan, where we paused for tea. With miles still ahead of us, we eventually tore ourselves away, promising to return one day to spend a night there under a star-studded, smog free sky.

One of the unintended pleasures of travelling through Pakistan’s hinterland is encountering colonial-era buildings in the most unexpected places: a quaint, decrepit dak bungalow (a government-run rest house in British India); a quiet, small railway station where trains no longer stop; or a Glasgow-manufactured iron girder railway bridge standing steadfast over a stream for more than a century. As we left, we again drove through Potohar’s backyard, the sun setting as we crossed the Soan River, which originates in the Murree Hills before merging with the mighty Indus — but more on the Soan in a bit.
We reached Kalabagh by evening and checked in, delighted, to the renowned Bohr Bangla on the Indus, only to discover we were being placed in an annexe rather than the historic bungalow itself, contrary to what had been stated on the online booking site. After a brief protest and an unyielding management, we shifted to an Irrigation Department dak bungalow next door. It was a typical government rest house but comfortable enough for three friends on the road. We ended our day with tea on the floating barge outside, watching the vast river drift by as the lights from the 19th-century Kalabagh Bridge shimmered across its dark waters.


The historical Bohr Bangla at Kalabagh

The journey upstream
The next morning, a boat arrived from the Punjab Tourism Department’s facility on the eastern bank of the river. A guide and a pilot accompanied it.
We set off around 10am, heading about two hours upstream toward our destination: Makhad Sharif, a small, historic town on the Indus in District Attock.
As we pulled away, we captured some striking photographs of Bohr Bangla and the tiered steps of Kalabagh — a town known for its salt mines, its tillay wali chappal (ornamental shoes), and, of course, the legendary Nawab of Kalabagh. On our left was Kalabagh town; on our right, the tourism facility and the historic Mari Indus railway station slid past. Soon we crossed the Kalabagh Bridge and passed a restaurant-cum-hotel recently opened by a local entrepreneur.
To our right rose a massive mound marking the ancient town of Mari Indus. At its summit stood abandoned Hindu temples, their silhouettes stark against the sky, while below lay the river port that once bustled with trade.
That era has long faded with the advent of railways, roads, and faster means of transport. As we crossed Mari Indus, the locally famed village of Kukran Wala appeared on our left (perhaps the only village in Punjab situated west of the Indus, reachable only by passing through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa).
Beyond Kukran Wala, the landscape grew quieter. The river narrowed, funnelling us into a gorge, with Punjab on one side and KP on the other. About 30 minutes into our journey, the remains of rusting cables and weathered structures came into view along the bank. This was the proposed site of the hotly contested Kalabagh Dam — a project that was debated for decades but ultimately never built.


Soan River on the right merges with Indus River on the left

We were marvelling at the raw wilderness when a foul stench hit our noses. Our guide explained that we were approaching the point where the Soan River meets the Indus, and that the Soan, carrying all the sewage from Rawalpindi, makes this section of the river particularly odorous.
All we could do was silently hope for some sense to prevail. After all, whenever humans tamper with nature, it often strikes back, as the recent floods along the Soan had painfully shown. But expecting better judgement seemed optimistic at best.
We pressed on and soon crossed the magnificent confluence of the Soan and Indus. The merging of the two rivers was a spectacle to behold, etched permanently in my memory. Beyond the intersection, the water grew clearer, and the gorge deepened. At times, the cliffs seemed barely a couple of hundred metres apart, hinting at the immense depth of the river below.


Kalabagh town on the river

Along the way, we passed a few fishing huts under construction by the tourism department. Whether they would ever be actively used remained a question; building infrastructure is one thing, running it successfully is another. I sincerely hoped for their success.
Further along, we spotted multiple excavators along the riverbanks (mostly on the KP side) digging for gold, apparently all illegal. Judging by the number of operations, it seemed like a surprisingly profitable venture.
Eventually, we stopped at a private hut belonging to a friend near Makhad Sharif. We sat under a sprawling banyan tree, sipping tea and watching the Indus flow past. In such moments, the concepts of time and space dissolve. You feel part of another world, moving at its own pace. far removed from phones, emails, and the constant buzz of the internet.


The revered shrine of the Pirs of Makhad

Gold mining along the riverbank
We strolled along the riverbank and learned about the gold mining process from a group of young boys working manually with simple tools: fine steel meshes and a few pans.
By sifting river soil through the mesh, they could gather tiny golden specks, which they then separated into raw gold using mercury. The yield from such manual operations is minimal, unlike those using excavators and mechanised equipment to extract gold from the riverbed. I believe the government should permit these small-scale manual operations to support local livelihoods, while banning commercial excavation except for licensed government operators.
Resuming our journey to Makhad Sharif, we arrived at the historic town’s banks about two hours later. An elaborate ancient Hindu temple graces the riverbank, but it awaits attention from the Archaeology Department to explore its historical significance. We wandered through the bazaar, alive with local crafts and, of course, the famous Makhadi halwa, celebrated for its unique flavour and now available as far afield as Peshawar, Mianwali, and Rawalpindi.
We visited a library maintained by a local religious leader, which claims to be the largest in the Potohar region, before paying our respects at the shrines of the saints for whom Makhad Sharif is named.
The shrines are majestic, adorned with intricate blue tile work, and even the surrounding graveyards narrate the town’s ancient history. During the annual urs, Makhad comes alive with thousands of disciples, who are provided free boarding and lodging, reminiscent of the arrangements at Kartarpur. Finally, we rested and enjoyed tea at a friend’s house before beginning our journey back to Kalabagh.

The return journey was faster as it was with the flow of the river. The sun was setting and the whole gorge and Indus before us was glowing. The wilderness was awe inspiring but in less than two hours, we reached Kalabagh. The sunset afforded us some great photography, but it also made one feel that the sun has probably set over an otherwise historic town by the river.
This relatively small corridor along Indus offers a glimpse into ancient Hindu heritage, colonial heritage, railways heritage, religious landmarks, a peek into the Nawabs of Kalabagh and Pirs of Makhad Sharifs’ heritage besides a breath-taking landscape. Together, this endowment makes this corridor an excellent eco-tourism site for Punjab as well as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Eco-tourism potential of the Indus corridor
Reviving the Kalabagh-Indus River-Makhad Sharif corridor could begin with a comprehensive masterplan to develop the area into an ecotourism zone, supported by a dedicated tourism authority to manage and regulate activities
Introducing speed boats and water sports at Kalabagh and Makhad Sharif, alongside technical assistance to develop the towns on the model of Lahore’s Walled City, would enhance their appeal.
River-facing buildings in Kalabagh, Makhad, Mari Indus, and surrounding villages could be whitewashed or blue-washed, while robust solid waste management and strict measures to prevent untreated sewage from entering the Indus and Soan rivers would protect the fragile ecosystem.

Cable cars across the river, revival of the Mari Indus railway, timely completion of fishing huts, and the establishment of riverfront boutique hotels by recognised chains, complemented by substantial tax and other incentives for private operators, would further energise the region.
The impact of such ecotourism initiatives on local livelihoods, heritage preservation, and economic growth cannot be overstated, offering Pakistan and Punjab a much-needed tourism destination while restoring the historic glory of these towns.

The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said: “In exercise of the powers conferred under Article 243 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, read with Section 8A of the Pakistan Army Act, the president on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years.”
A separate notification issued by the ministry also notified Zardari’s approval of the prime minister’s advice regarding the leadership of the air force.
“In exercise of the powers conferred by Article 243 of the Consitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, read with Section 10B of the Pakistan Air Force Act, 1953, the president on the advice of the prime minister is pleased to extend the appointment of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar (NI) M, as chief of the air staff for a tenure of two years with effect from March 19, 2026,” a separate notification said.
The extension will take effect upon completion of his current five-year term in Mar­­ch next year, keeping him in office until March 2028.
The army chief has been named the first CDF in the most sweeping restructuring of the military command since the 1970s.
The new arrangement consolidates operational, administrative and strategic authority in a single office established through amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution under the 27th Amendment.
The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, shall appoint the chief of the army staff, who will concurrently serve as the chief of defence forces.
The amendment also abolished the office of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC), dismantling the tri-service coordination system in place since 1976 and transferring joint command integration to the CDF.
On Thursday, PM Shehbaz had conveyed his best wishes to Field Marshal Munir.
“Under the leadership of Field Marshal Munir, our brave armed forces inflicted a humiliating defeat on the enemy,” the statement quoted the prime minister as saying.
Five-year tenure reset
To translate the constitutional overhaul into the military’s legal framework, the government amended the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) of 1952 in the wake of the 27th Amendment.
Sub-section (i) of PAA’s Article 8A now states that “for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces […], the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
It explains that upon the issuance of the notification for the first COAS-plus-CDF, the “existing tenure of the incumbent chief of the army staff shall be deemed to have recommenced from the date of such notification”.
Under sub-section (iii) of Article 8A, the “terms and conditions” of the COAS concurrently with the CDF shall be determined by the president on the prime minister’s advice.
Field Marshal Munir was appointed army chief on Nov 29, 2022, becoming the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
In November 2024, the government brought changes to the PAA, extending the tenure for all three services chiefs from three to five years, keeping the CJCSC’s tenure unchanged at three years. The same amendments allowed the services chiefs to be reappointed and/or their tenures to be extended for up to five years, instead of up to three years.
Therefore, in line with the restructuring under the 27th Amendment, the recent PAA changes allow the president, on the prime minister’s advice, to reappoint the COAS-plus-CDF for another five years, or extend his tenure by up to five years, creating legal space for him to retain his position till December 2035.
Delay in notification
The prolonged delay in issuing the notification had triggered intense speculation, especially after the post of CJCSC was abolished on Nov 27 when Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza retired.
The absence of a notification on Nov 29, the date when Field Marshal Munir’s original three-year term as army chief (prior to last year’s amendment) ended, fuelled further uncertainty about whether the government was holding back the appointment to negotiate upcoming four-star postings.
Political circles suggested the delay may have been used to bargain over the selection of the new Commander National Strategic Command (CNSC), the Vice Chief of the Army Staff (VCOAS) and potentially a future ISI chief.
The army had already clarified that no VCOAS was being appointed. Under the amended law, the appointments of the CNSC and any VCOAS are tied to the CDF’s recommendations.
Government officials repeatedly denied any tensions with the military, maintaining that procedural requirements and the prime minister’s travel itinerary dictated the timeline. None­t­heless, the silence was widely viewed as unusual, especially after the speed with which the 27th Amendment was rushed through parliament.
The amendment also empowers the federal government to define the CDF’s functions, including multi-domain integration, restructuring and enhancing jointness across services.
New organogram
Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said on Thursday the defence ministry was finalising a new organogram for the CDF and had shared a draft with the Prime Minister’s Office a day earlier.
He dispelled the impression of differences over a CDF notification, stressing that it was delayed since the premier was out of the country.
Officials say the organogram will lay out the command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly established strategic command.</p><small>2025-12-05 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05100316962c5e5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959292/in-pictures-last-supermoon-of-2025-illuminates-skylines-across-globe' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Last supermoon of 2025 illuminates skylines across globe</strong></a><br><p>The final supermoon of 2025, known as the ‘Cold Moon’, put on a spectacular cosmic display on Thursday night, lighting up skylines across the world.
US Space Agency Nasa states that a supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with the Moon’s closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit, a point known as perigee.
According to CNN, the moniker ‘Cold Moon’ indicates that it’s the full moon event closest to the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.
Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission has said that the supermoon, which was visible on Thursday night, will also be visible in the country tonight.
Here are some pictures of the supermoon dazzling stargazers across the world.

The issues of undervalued customs assessments will be taken up with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and Customs Valuation, he informed the local vehicle assemblers during a meeting held in Islamabad on Thursday.
The government remains committed to ensuring a fair and competitive playing field. “Fixed valuations and import trade prices (ITPs) for used vehicles must be updated and reviewed annually. The Ministry of Industries will continue prioritising local manufacturing, job creation, and a progressive auto policy to encourage competitive pricing, which ultimately benefits Pakistani consumers,” Mr Akhtar stated.
He assured the delegation that the government is fully aware of the industry’s concerns regarding the import of used vehicles.
On the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, new legislation and regulatory frameworks will be introduced to address these issues comprehensively, he said, adding that only those used vehicles that meet safety and environmental standards will be allowed to enter Pakistan.

PM’s aide promises all vehicles will meet strict safety, quality regulations

He added that open competition would promote efficiency and lead the auto sector toward low-cost and competitive local manufacturing.
Secretary Industries Saif Anjum informed the meeting that, for commercial imports, three years of overseas residency and one year of registration under the owner’s name will remain mandatory.
He further said that the safety and quality standards of imported vehicles will be verified through pre-shipment inspections.
22,000 used vehicles
Industry representatives noted that nearly 22,000 used vehicles entered the country under the baggage scheme between July and November 2025, capturing almost 25 per cent share of the market. If this trend continues, they warned, total imports could surpass 50,000 units this year, posing a serious threat to local investment, production, and employment.
“Because of outdated and significantly lower fixed customs valuations, used vehicles brought in under the baggage scheme pay far less in duties and taxes than locally manufactured cars. This imbalance is deeply concerning,” said Nadeem Malik, Chairman, Master Changan Motors.
Director Lucky Motor Corporation, Babar S. Khan said the delegation emphasised that these imports do not comply with UN safety regulations, which all local manufacturers must meet.
“No Government agency is currently checking whether these imported vehicles meet basic safety regulations. This puts both consumers and the public at risk,” he added.
Hyundai Nishat Motors COO Sohail Nawaz said the industry also highlighted the strain on local operations, which are running at only 35pc capacity.
“It is unfortunate that despite such low capacity utilisation, used vehicle imports under the baggage scheme continue at this scale,” he said.
Director NexGen Auto, Aqib Zulfiqar noted that local manufacturing creates jobs, supports value addition, drives technology transfer, and strengthens large-scale manufacturing — the backbone of our economy. In contrast, uncontrolled used car imports burden the economy while putting lives and long-term investments at risk.
Reflecting on the changing market dynamics, COO of Sazgar Haval, Mian Ali Hameed, said the original justification for allowing used imports no longer exists.
Consumers today have so many choices — 16 new players offering modern vehicles with full safety and advanced driver assistance features, zero-interest financing options, and immediate availability with no waiting periods.
Auto assemblers also emphasised that tax reforms and effective control over used car imports could help stabilise domestic production.
They cautioned that liberal policies on used car imports could undermine the hard-earned gains made by the local auto industry.

Noem, in an interview on Fox News’ ‘The Ingraham Angle’, was asked to confirm whether the administration of US President Donald Trump would be increasing the number of countries on the travel ban list to 32.
“I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries,” she said.
Trump signed a proclamation in June banning the citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats. The bans apply to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.
Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list.
“If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” Noem said.
Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.
An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration has taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.
Investigators say the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement program under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting.
Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”
Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic president Joe Biden and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries.
Since returning to the office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border.
His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now, it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.</p><small>2025-12-05 05:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05085503d6323f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959195/despite-stakeholders-criticism-sindh-govt-pushes-ahead-with-plan-to-detach-iccbs-from-ku' target='_blank'><strong>Despite stakeholders’ criticism, Sindh govt pushes ahead with plan to detach ICCBS from KU</strong></a><br><p>• Minister Rahu says draft bill sent to charter evaluation body for review• Inaugurates e-marking, digital examination system for Sindh boards
KARACHI: Despite serious reservations by teachers’ bodies, political parties and other stakeholders, the Sindh government is moving ahead with its plan to separate the International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS) from Karachi University (KU) as Minister for Universities and Boards Ismail Rahu disclosed that a draft bill regarding the matter has been forwarded to the Charter Inspection Committee.
Sindh Higher Education Commission’s Charter Inspection and Evaluation Committee advises the government on proposals for granting a charter to award degrees in both public and private sector institutions. However, the minister told reporters that teachers, staff, donors and all other stakeholders would be taken into confidence before any step is finalised.
He was speaking at a meeting of the Inter-Board Coordination Commission (IBCC) at a local hotel to inaugurate Sindh’s new e-marking and digital examination system on Tuesday.

 

Mr Rahu said that the government is not planning to “split KU”, adding on the contrary that a draft bill has been forwarded to the said inspection committee to grant ICCBS the powers to independently award degrees.
It may be mentioned that in recent weeks, teachers’ bodies, political parties and other stakeholders have raised concerns over a government plan to detach ICCBS from KU. Teachers and other stakeholders had maintained that the move would prove harmful to the quality of research, besides hindering students’ access to the ICCBS, as the institute could become very expensive if privatised.
E-marking system launched for Sindh boards
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Rahu also said that the federal government has handed over all e-marking softwares to the Sindh government’s educational boards, marking the formal beginning of a new phase of examination digitalisation in the province.
The inauguration ceremony of the e-marking and digitalisation project was held under the IBCC. It was attended by Secretary for Universities and Educational Boards Muhammad Abbas Baloch, Faqeer Muhammad Lakho, as well as chairpersons of all educational boards across the province and representatives of federal boards.
Mr Rahu stated that annual examinations for grades IX and XI across Sindh will now be conducted through e-marking, ensuring transparency, quality, and timely results in the examination system.
He added that a system is being developed in which complete transparency will be maintained from the preparation of question papers to the conduct of examinations, making it possible to eliminate issues such as paper leaks.
He further said that under the current traditional system, there are delays in preparing results, whereas through e-marking this stage will not only become faster but also error-free. He shared that some boards in Sindh have already begun limited e-marking of certain papers.

The high-profile two-day dash is being seen as a diplomatic tightrope walk for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, coping with a brusque and demanding US President Donald Trump over India’s ties with Russia, particularly its oil purchases from Moscow.
Mr Modi signalled the importance of the occasion by personally receiving Mr Putin at the airport, though he also continued to breach a long held protocol by denying the Russian head of state a meeting with India’s opposition leaders.
To Rahul Gandhi, leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, Mr Modi’s decision to not allow him a meeting with Mr Putin indicated the government’s “insecurity”. Given that three European ambassadors had published a strong critique of Mr Putin in Indian newspapers in the run up to the visit last week, there eviden­tly was a strong need for Mr Modi to keep the talks close to his chest.
This would be the first visit to India by Mr Putin since the war in Ukraine began in 2022, and “is not without some anxious moments for New Delhi,” said The Hindu. “The government manages a tense tightrope walk between Russia and Wes­tern countries, particularly Europe, on a number of issues including the optics of the visit, oil imports and trade, defence, nuclear cooperation and a mobility agreement.”
The visit was earlier slated for January this year, and the Russian side had announced it in October 2024. Then it curiously disappeared from the radar evidently in deference to Mr Modi’s proximity to Mr Trump. When that relationship soured, however, Mr Modi found himself clasping the only stable hand available.
While high-grade defence purchases have been pencilled for the talks, an unusual centre-piece of Mr Putin’s visit is the dire need for Rus­sia to find skilled labour for his cou­ntry that has put much of its manpower in the debilitating Ukraine war.
The India-Russia labour mobility agreement to be launched as the “centrepiece” of the visit on Friday, will also be crucial for Indian skilled and semi-skilled workers, who are seeking jobs as other Western markets tighten immigration controls.
According to The Hindu a war-weary and heavily-sanctioned Russia is facing a labour shortfall of what is estimated to be about 3.1 million jobs by the end of the decade. Russia is seeking Indian workers in construction, technology and manufacturing sectors.
A controversy over an editorial piece written by the envoys of Fra­n­­ce, Germany and the United Kin­gdom to India criticising Mr Putin over the war and accusing him of delaying peace talks stalks Mr Modi. Indian officials tamely said the editorials were unacceptable.
On the other hand, New Delhi is expecting to host German Chan­­cel­lor Friedrich Merz in early January, followed by EU’s top leadership Ursula Von Der Leyen and Antonio Costa as guests for Republic Day, and hopes to finalise the EU-India FTA at the EU-India Leaders’ Sum­m­it at that time. Given the circumstances, the Indian government cou­ld only lean on Russian Ambassador Denis Alipov writing a rebuttal piece the next day.
Russian oil remains a key component of the visit. After a leap in India’s oil purchases, which went from less than 2 per cent before the war, to 40pc last year, India is now drastically curtailing import of Russian oil. Russian sources have said the reduction was expected to be temporary amid reports that the Ukraine war could be coming to an end under the twin pressure of Mr Trump’s engagements with Mr Putin and Russia’s widely acknowledged successes in the battlefield.
India had earlier given up on purchasing Iranian and Venezuelan oil. In the final equation, as Mr Putin put it in October, it is India that stands to lose, a whopping 9-10 billion dollars, whether it braves sanctions or gives up on Russian oil.

According to Met Off­i­­ce, a shallow westerly wave is likely to affect the northern areas of the country from the night of Dec 4 to 5.
Under the influence of this weather system, mo­­stly cloudy conditions are expected, with light rain and snowfall over the mountains at isolated pla­ces in Gilgit-Baltistan, Ka­­shmir and upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Dir, Chit­ral, Swat, Kohistan, Shan­gla, Battagram) today.







Cold and dry weather is likely to persist in other parts of the country.
Smoggy and foggy conditions are expected to continue in the plain areas of Punjab (Sialkot, Naro­wal, Lahore, Sheikhupura, Gujran­wala, Gujrat, Jhe­lum, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Multan, Khanewal, Lay­yah, Kot Addu and Ba­­ha­walpur) and Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa (Peshawar, Swa­bi, Mardan. Dera Ismail Khan) during night and especi­ally in the morning hours.
Regarding the possible impacts of the new weather system in the northern parts, the Pakistan Meteorological Department stated that smog and fog may affect transportation in parts of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
It added that snowfall may cause road closures and slippery conditions at Babusar and surrounding areas.
Daytime temperatures are likely to drop by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius from normal in the upper parts in the coming days.

Beginning each year on Nov 25 — International Day of Elimination of Violence against Women — and ending on Dec 10 — International Human Rights Day — the global campaign calls on individuals and groups to take action to end violence against women and girls. This year’s theme — ‘UNiTE to End Digital Violence against All Women and Girls’ — draws attention to one of the fastest-growing forms of abuse. Digital tools are increasingly being used to stalk, harass, and abuse women and girls. These acts often lead to offline violence, such as coercion, physical abuse, and even the killing of women and girls. Survivors feel the effects over a prolonged period. Digital violence targets more women than men, especially those with public or online visibility, including activists, journalists, women in politics and young women. The impact is worse for women facing intersecting forms of discrimination, including religion, race, disability or gender identity.
The UN defines violence against women as “any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life”. Unless specified differently, the term ‘women’ refers to females of all ages, including girls, according to the UN.
International standards and obligations, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women assert the rights of women and girls. The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women is the first international instrument specifically addressing VAW that provides a framework for action to eliminate it. The Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDG5 that deals with gender equality, include targets related to ending VAW. Through its various entities, such as UN Women and Unicef, the UN leads and supports initiatives focused on eliminating VAW. It provides resources, expertise and coordination to facilitate global efforts in preventing and responding to GBV.

Organisations must spread awareness and enhance advocacy against digital GBV.

Likewise, the Constitution ensures equality between men and women in Articles 25 and 34, which serve as the basis for efforts to combat GBV. There are also laws with special protections for women including the Federal Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2020; Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act, 2016, etc. Pakistan has laws to combat cybercrimes including the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016, which criminalises actions like sexual threats, defamation, and non-consensual sharing of images or videos — although reservations have been voiced regarding some provisos of the law.

 

Besides punitive measures, the laws also provide for prevention, protection, and rehabilitation services for survivors. This can include psychosocial support, legal aid, and shelter. However, their effective implementation remains a significant challenge.
For the last year alone, the Digital Rights Foundation reported 3,171 complaints of tech-facilitated GBV. Of these, women filed 1,772. Thanks to underreporting, this is likely just the tip of the iceberg. According to a study, 65 per cent of Pakistani women who experience harassment online do not report abuse due to fear or shame or because they don’t trust institutions.
Going by a 2023 National Commission on the Status of Women report, almost 40pc of the Pakistani women respondents indicated they had faced digital cyber-bullying or harassment. The conviction rates are low; for example, only 92 cybercrime convictions out of 1,375 were secured in2023. The statistics of other forms of VAW are just as alarming. The NCSW estimates that 90pc of women experience some form of domestic violence, yet half of them never tell anyone and only 0.4pc reach out to the courts. Last month, the human rights minister informed the National Assembly that more than 7,500 women had been killed from 2021 to 2024, of which 1,553 were ‘honour’ killings.
According to a recent report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation, in 2024 alone 32,617 cases of GBV were reported including over 5,339 cases of rape, 24,439 of abduction, 2,238 of domestic violence and 547 of ‘honour killings’.
Despite thousands of cases, Pakistan’s conviction rate remains dismally low, at just 0.5pc for rape and killings in the name of honour, 0.1pc for abduction, and 1.3pc for cases of domestic violence, exposing deep-rooted faults in the justice system. As pointed out in media reports, “Weak police investigations, lack of forensic evidence, societal stigma, and judicial inefficiencies prevent survivors from getting justice, allowing perpetrators to walk free”.
This year’s campaign is a reminder that digital safety has become central to the issue of gender equality. The campaign aims to stop digital abuse against women by mobilising society. Governments must enact and implement effective laws; technology companies must ensure the safety of platforms for women; organisations must spread awareness and enhance advocacy against digital GBV. Individuals must speak out, support survivors, challenge harmful online norms, host or participate in digital safety sessions and support male allyship campaigns that reject digital VAW.
Likewise, we should connect with community organisations that are dedicated to ending VAW. Volunteering our time, offering financial support or participating in their events, we can intensify the impact and create safer spaces. We can raise our voice for gender equality and women’s rights by engaging with lawmakers and policymakers to promote laws and policies that protect women from violence.
We must lend an ear to survivors of violence, share their stories, empathise with them and support them in their healing journey. By amplifying their voices, we break the silence surrounding VAW and empower others to seek justice.

WASHINGTON: US Pres­ident Donald Trump has indicated that the next stage of his administration’s plan for Gaza is poised to begin soon, making the declaration even as violence flared anew in the region.
Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office on Wednesday when phase two will commence, Trump avoided answering directly, saying the process is “going along well”, the Times of Israel reported.
“It’s going on very well. We have peace in the Middle East. People don’t realise it,” Yeni Safak quoted him as saying — a claim immediately challenged by the reported casualties from Israeli airstrikes.

 

The attacks followed a threat from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netan­yahu to respond after soldiers were injured in clashes with Palestinian fighters in the city of Rafah.
“Phase two is moving along. It’s going to happen pret­ty soon,” he added. Tru­mp had previously declared on October 14 that phase two “had already begun”.
According to the Middle East Monitor, during a recent phone call between the US president and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, the former raised several issues where he wanted Netanyahu to adjust his approach, starting with allowing the second phase of the agreement intended to end the war in Gaza.
During the call, Trump asked Netanyahu: “Why they were being killed rather than allowed to surrender,” referring to Hamas fighters reportedly killed in Rafah. Netanyahu reportedly replied that they were “armed and dangerous”, so they are being eliminated.
Negotiations
Meanwhile, negotiations on the next stage of the Gaza ceasefire continue without significant progress at a moment when the truce appears particularly fragile, AFP reported on Thursday.
The first phase included a withdrawal of Israeli forces on October 10 to a line that still gave them military control of over half of Gaza, the release of all prisoners, living or dead, held by Hamas or its allies, and an increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.
Though all living prisoners were released on October 13, one body is still said to be in Gaza.
For now, the Israeli government demands that the last hostage’s remains are returned before any talks begin on the second phase via mediating countries: United States, Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye.
Egypt will also host a conference on Gaza’s reconstruction that will focus on the territory’s humanitarian needs but no date has yet been set.
The process seems to be stuck mainly due to the Trump plan’s grey areas.
“Israel doesn’t really seem to be putting any serious thought into what the post-war phase is supposed to look like,” said Michael Milshtein, a researcher at Tel Aviv University.

The PTA believes these measures are necessary to ensure fair competition in the telecom sector, particularly given PTCL’s dominant market position.
In line with an earlier decision by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP), the PTA has also treated PTCL and its mobile arm Ufone (Pak Telecommu­nication Mobile Ltd, PTML) as separate legal entities, barring any cross-subsidy bet­ween them and requiring the maintenance of separate accounts.

 

Cross-subsidisation is the practice of using profits from one product, service or customer group to finance another that is losing money or sold at a lower price.
In an order issued on Thursday, the PTA granted merger approval for Telenor Pakistan, Telenor LDI Company (TLDI) and Orion Towers — which operates Telenor’s radio base towers — with PTCL (collectively termed the “notifying parties”).

New operator barred from exclusive deals, discriminatory pricing, cross-subsidisation

However, the newly emerged mobile operator comprising Ufone and Telenor Pakistan has been designated as “MergedCo” by the PTA.
The order has been signed by PTA Chairman Hafeezur Rehman, member finance Muhammad Naveed, and Dr Khawar Siddique Khokhar, member compliance and enforcement.
The PTA said the notifying parties and the MergedCo will be req­uired to maintain separate, detailed accounts for all business units, in line with prescribed standards.
Given PTCL’s status as the largest telecom service provider, the regulator has barred it from entering into agreements, directly or indirectly, or exclusive deals that would prevent other licensees from procuring bandwidth from PTCL to serve their own customers. All liabilities and obligations related to Telenor Pakistan, TLDI and Orion Towers will be assumed by PTCL. The notifying parties and PTML/MergedCo, individually and collectively, have also been directed not to introduce or modify brand names without prior written approval of the PTA.
PTCL and the MergedCo will not be allowed to discriminate among other telecom operators in matters relating to interconnection for local or international termination. Their pricing may not be used in a way that impedes or restricts other operators’ access to PTCL or MergedCo customers, and no preferential treatment is to be given to their affiliates or subsidiaries.
The PTA has prohibited cross-subsidisation between PTCL and MergedCo and directed both to maintain transparent pricing structures for wholesale and retail services. PTCL shall not cross-subsidise its retail or downstream services through revenues derived from upstream services, nor offer unreasonably low or predatory prices intended to foreclose competition in any market.
The order also states that the merged company will be required to participate in upcoming spectrum auctions to enhance coverage and resolve capacity issues.

LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday was moved against the Punjab government’s deci­sion to lift the ban on Basant celebration thro­ugh an ordinance that revived the festival after 18 years, with strict conditions to prevent any potential loss of life.
The Judicial Activism Panel (JAP), a self-styled public interest litigation organisation, filed the petition assailing the law on multiple grounds. The petition filed through Advocate Azhar Siddique stated that the government issued the ordinance despite the provincial assembly being in session.
It expressed concern that kite flying had caused numerous deaths in the past in different cities of the province and even the Supreme Court had previously ruled against the activity. The petition feared that allowing kite flying again may lead to further loss of life while the Constitution guaranteed the safety of every citizen’s life and property.

 

It states that before any revival, it should be remembered that last year, PML-N President Mian Nawaz Sharif and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz visited the home of one Asif Ashfaq, who died due to a kite string in Faisalabad. The petition noted that the chief minister had then termed kite flying a ‘bloody sport’, expressing her sympathies with the bereaved family.
It asked the court to declare that the purported exercise of power under Article 128 of the Constitution for promulgating the impugned ordinance without any lawful or emergent circumstances was mala fide and constituted an abuse of the governor’s ordinance-making power. The petition requested the court to declare the ordinance, along with the notification permitting kite flying, null and void.
‘Safe and regulated’
On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said the festival would be “completely safe, regulated, and strictly monitored”.
The iconic festival of Basant, which heralded the coming of spring and saw the skies over Punjab’s cities spring to life with thousands of colourful kites, has been revi­ved by the provincial government after an 18-year hiatus. The Punjab government imposed a full ban on kite-flying in 2007, following several deaths — especially of motorcyclists and children — due to sharp kite string.
In a statement issued here on Thursday, the minister said that Basant would no longer be a dangerous activity but a secure cultural celebration, and no one would be allowed to violate the law.
“The business of deadly, metallic, and chemically coated kite strings has been permanently eradicated from the province,” she claimed. According to the minister, the use or sale of metal or chemically coated string will result in three to five years of imprisonment and fines up to Rs2 million.
She said that violations of the Kite Flying Act by children would incur a Rs50,000 fine for the first offence and Rs100,000 for the second.
Additionally, registration has been made mandatory for those who manufacture or sell kite string, with QR-coded identification required on every roll.
Azma Bokhari explained safety measures for motorcyclists had also been tightened. She clarified that the objective of Punjab’s new traffic laws was not punishment, but the protection of every citizen’s life, home, and family. Traffic violations would lead to fines, and repeated offences may result in the auction of the vehicle.
The minister said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif had strictly banned the handcuffing of minors, ensuring that underage offenders would only be fined, not arrested. She said that legislation was also being drafted to provide legal cover for underage motorcyclists.

With it came the usual platitudes, speeches and ceremonies. We still have such a long way to go before PWDs can enjoy all the rights, privileges and opportunities that any society should offer all citizens.
It is not that we have not had progress. Some headway has been made. Though we do not have robust data as yet on PWDs, some government surveys, and even the census, have started factoring in disability status and functioning. The same has been initiated in some administrative data-gathering efforts at the government school level. Hopefully, such data-gathering efforts will become more comprehensive over time.
Initially, education policies did not even mention children with disabilities, who were not in the picture for quite a while post-independence. When they did appear in official documents, it was usually implied that education for PWDs was an act of charity and beneficence to make the children independent only to the extent of not remaining a ‘burden’ on their families or the state. For a long time, even when government documents said that education should be the right of each child (this was prior to the 18th Amendment when education was made a basic right), it was not extended to children with disabilities. Regarding them, the conversation was usually that the government did not have money to provide facilities to children with disabilities and that the private sector should come forward to perform this act of charity to ensure some training skills for them. These documents do not make for pleasant reading today.
By the 1990s, education policies in the country were acknowledging that children with disabilities needed access to education facilities. But it was still not seen as a right and most of the thinking was about separate institutions for these children.
The situation is not too different today. Though the 18th Amendment added Article 25A to the Constitution giving each child the right to “free and compulsory” education up to the age of 16, most children with disabilities remain unseen, unacknowledged and underserved. Though global estimates say that about 12-15 per cent of children might have special needs in any child population, with 40pc or so of our children malnourished these numbers can only be higher in Pakistan. Budgets for special education across the provinces are a small fraction of what is spent on mainstream education. And few, if any, of our schools are inclusive or welcoming of children with disabilities.

 

Most elite and even medium-fee private-sector schools do not allow children with disabilities to enrol in their schools. Some high-fee school administrators say quite openly that their school systems have a policy of not enrolling children with disabilities. Most feel that they do not have the resources to cater to their needs. Many feel it is hard enough for a teacher to manage a class of 35-odd children. Others feel it does not make financial sense to spend resources training teachers and providing other support if there are only a few children with disabilities who might enrol in their school. So, for any who try the schools reject them.

Most children with disabilities remain unseen, unacknowledged and underserved.

Some schools do claim that they are ‘inclusive’. For some, this is a requirement: for example, International Baccalaureate requires its schools to be inclusive. But even for many such schools, the requirement for ‘inclusion’ is more lip-service than an actual effort to be inclusive.
One parent whose child is on the autism spectrum told me that though she was paying for a shadow teacher’s salary in addition to the usual fee of the elite ‘inclusive’ school, her child was mostly ignored by teachers in the class. She was allowed to sit in class but was mostly left alone. The teachers left everything to the shadow teacher but given the high turnover of shadow teachers, her child was not learning anything though attending school every day. This did not seem to bother the teachers or school administrators.
The parent had tried hard to communicate more with the administrators but was shut out to the point that she is now afraid to raise any issue fearing that the school might turn her child away. One day, recently, the child was being a bit disruptive in class, talking loudly as she was upset about something, and her teachers ended up locking her in the storeroom for two hours. The ‘reason’ was to calm the child. The parent is heartbroken but feels she cannot go to the school and complain as they might tell her to take the child to another school.
How can this be acceptable? Why are parents afraid to advocate and stand up for their children? They are afraid because society is still giving signals, and strong ones, that services provided to children with disabilities are a ‘favour’. It is not a matter of rights or duty of care. It is ‘charity’ and ‘beneficence’. Society’s mindset is still stuck in that rut, placing an uncalled for and undue burden on parents of children with disabilities and the latter themselves. Schools are places where children go to learn. It is the place where we should be setting standards and pushing boundaries. If schools reinforce existing outmoded beliefs, it is a sad commentary on our education system and society.
The government has to come forward as well. Rather than just having celebratory events and moving forward at a snail’s pace, the government should take the lead and create the narrative and reality of recognition and implementation of all citizens’ rights and privileges — for PWDs as well. It should also provide the framework for the private sector. No one should be allowed to get away with disrespecting any person including a child. No one should be denied rights that all should have. Society has a duty to care for every person, and especially those who need the most support.

ISLAMABAD: Building the case on overburdening and rising debt servicing costs post-2010, the federal government on Thursday proposed mobilising additional consolidated revenues amounting to more than five per cent of GDP over the next three years (roughly Rs6.5 trillion per annum at the current exchange rate).
The suggestion came during the much-delayed inaugural meeting of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC), which also sought legal opinion on whether provinces are bound by federal expenditure priorities.
The Centre urged the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by 3 to 3.5 percentage points from around 10pc at present in three years and asked the provinces to enhance their share of revenues to 3pc of GDP — through taxes on property, agriculture income and sales tax on services — from the existing 0.28pc.
It argued that the measure was necessary to stabilise the rising fiscal deficit, which had gone up from close to 4pc to over 6.6pc now after the fiscal imbalance created since 2010 under the 7th NFC award, resulting in massive deterioration of the debt-to-GDP ratio.
The meeting, held over an official lunch in a “very good atmosphere”, was chaired by Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb and was attended by the chief ministers of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (both holding the finance minister portfolio), finance ministers of Punjab and Balochistan, four provincial non-statutory NFC members, KP chief minister’s adviser Muzammil Aslam, and federal and provincial finance secretaries.







Participants told journalists outside the Ministry of Finance that there was no demand for reducing the provincial share in the divisible pool from the existing 57.5pc as being speculated, nor any discussion about more or less responsibilities, as they were subjects of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and the National Economic Council (NEC).
Fiscal requirements of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan would also be deliberated at a working-group level.
The participants decided with consensus to form seven different thematic working groups and call a second meeting of the NFC between Jan 8 and 15, depending on the reports of working groups before Jan 8.
These groups would deliberate on horizontal and vertical distribution of resources, how the provinces should advance taxation policies based on the latest experiences, impacts of debt servicing, poverty and so on.
A special working group was also agreed upon on the request of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as to the fiscal and social impact of the merger of tribal districts and how to move forward with adequate resources.

 

Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said the meeting was held in a very good environment and all stakeholders — the Centre and the provinces — explained their fiscal positions.
“It was agreed to form six to seven working groups. They will continue their consultations to take the process forward before the next NFC meeting,” he said, adding that a joint statement would be issued by the federal finance ministry.
Mr Aslam, the KP chief minister’s adviser on finance, said the beauty of the inaugural meeting was that the Centre acknowledged the issues facing Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s merged districts (formerly Fata), and the larger provinces — Sindh and Punjab — supported KP’s cause in this regard.
He said the Sindh chief minister raised the issue of questions and discussions in certain quarters on provincial expenditures.
Mr Shah reminded that under Article 160 of the Constitution, the NFC was a forum of only revenue sharing and the provinces were not bound to follow “federal dictations” on the expenditure side, meaning that provinces were autonomous in setting their spending priorities. Their item-wise expenditure details are publicly available through respective budget documents and official websites.
Federal Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal reportedly suggested that a legal opinion might be required from the Attorney General of Pakistan for interpreting the constitutional provision and whether the provincial and federal spending priorities are in national alignment, and if a reduction or an increase in shares means absolute numbers or a percentage of the pie.
Centre’s fiscal challenges
The Centre put on the table its fiscal challenges following the 7th NFC award in 2010 and its continuation for more than 15 years, putting a squeeze on the country’s defence and development expenditure that compromised infrastructure development and social standards, as a major part of the resources went into interest payments. This financially weakened the Centre and, as a result, the provinces as well.
This could only be addressed with the best revenue efforts, both by the Centre and the provinces. All participants agreed that a strong federation could transform strong federating units and vice versa.
Earlier, Finance Minister Aurangzeb recalled the constitutional importance and collaborative spirit of the NFC process and noted the inaugural gathering reflected a shared resolve to fulfil a vital constitutional responsibility. He promised Centre’s commitment to transparent and sincere dialogue, ready to listen to the provinces and work collectively in the national interest, an official statement said.
He also commended the provinces for their cooperation in signing the National Fiscal Pact and in achieving mandatory fiscal surpluses to support Pakistan’s compliance with IMF requirements.
KP CM thanks Centre
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was quoted as expressing gratitude to the federal government for holding the NFC meeting. “A strong federation and strong provinces will guarantee a strong and united Pakistan,” he said.







He highlighted the sacrifices of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa made in the ‘war on terror’, which he said had resurfaced again.
Mr Afridi hoped the NFC would “address the ultra vires of the 7th NFC since June 2018 and include the population and other variables of the newly merged districts in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and update the share of the province to give them due representation”.
Punjab’s Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman also emphasised the need for consensus but stressed that “consensus-building will take a lot of effort on everyone’s part”, according to the statement.
Balochistan’s Finance Minister Shoaib Nosherwani said the province would continue the path of cooperation and consensus and mentioned his province’s efforts in strengthening the federation through projects like Sui Gas, Saindak and Reko Diq.
After the meeting, KP Chief Minister Afridi told reporters that it was held in a cordial atmosphere and a decision was taken to form sub-committees for different issues, including the merged districts’ share.
“I raised the issue and said that it was unconstitutional to deprive KP of its due share. It was decided that the next meeting will be held in January,” he said.
When asked why the PTI government did not address the issue of provincial share when it was in power, he said it was because his party’s government, which came to power in 2018, was toppled in 2022.

The effort is led by Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Congressman Greg Casar, and includes signatures from Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, two Muslim members of the House known for their advocacy on Palestinian and other Muslim issues.
In the letter, made public on Wednesday, the lawmakers called for targeted measures, including visa bans and asset freezes on officials responsible for threatening US citizens and residents who criticise Pakistan’s military establishment, as well as their family members in Pakistan.
There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, or the embassy in Washington.

More than 40 lawmakers write to Marco Rubio, ask for sanctions against officials involved in ‘transnational repression’

The letter emphasises the need for Washington to act against those who “weaponise state power to jail political opponents, intimidate citizens abroad, and crush democratic freedoms”, said First Pakistan Global, a rights group sympathetic to the PTI, which distributed the letter.
“In recent years, US citizens and residents who have spoken out against authoritarian abuses in Pakistan have faced threats, intimidation, and harassment — often extending to their families in Pakistan. These tactics include arbitrary detentions, coercion, and retaliatory violence, targeting diaspora individuals and their relatives,” the letter stated.
The lawmakers warned that Pakistan was experiencing a deepening authoritarian crisis: opposition leaders have been detained without charge, journalists intimidated or forced into exile, and ordinary citizens arrested for social media activity. Women, religious minorities, and ethnic communities — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate repression, they claimed.
“This authoritarian system in Pakistan is sustained through relentless repression. Opposition leaders are held without charge, denied fair trial, and kept in indefinite pretrial detention. Independent journalists are harassed, abducted, or forced into exile. Ordinary citizens are arrested for social media posts, while women, religious minorities, and marginalised ethnic groups — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate violence and surveillance,” the letter read.
The lawmakers cited specific cases, including that of Virginia-based investigative journalist Ahmad Noorani, whose brothers were allegedly abducted and held for over a month after his reporting on military corruption.
They also raised concerns about the 2024 elections, noting irregularities documented by independent observation reports.
The US State Department had previously expressed concern over these irregularities and called for a full investigation.
The letter urged the US administration to impose measures such as Global Magnitsky sanctions, visa bans, and asset freezes against officials credibly perpetrating systematic and transnational repression.
It also called for the release of former prime minister Imran Khan and other political prisoners. “Such steps would reinforce US commitment to human rights, protect American citizens from transnational repression, and promote regional stability,” the lawmakers wrote.
To strengthen congressional oversight, the lawmakers submitted five detailed questions to the State Department regarding sanctions, conditions for targeted measures, and steps to protect US residents from threats directed at their families abroad. The lawmakers have requested a response from Secretary Rubio by Dec 17, 2025.
Earlier this year, more than 50 lawmakers submitted another resolution in the House, named the “Pakistan Freedom and Accountability Act”. It sought legal sanctions against those responsible for “undermining democracy in Pakistan”.
That resolution, HR 5271, is in queue for voting at the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

• ‘Flouts rules himself’ by prohibiting lawmaker from participating in session for pointing out quorum                    
ISLAMABAD: In a strange ruling that left many red-faced, Senate Deputy Chairman Syedal Khan Nasir on Thursday barred criticism of ‘national heroes’ and political leadership in the House.
“You cannot speak against political heroes who suffered martyrdom, went into exile, worked for the nation and the country, conducted nuclear tests, and made [the] nuclear bomb,” he remarked just after finishing the day’s agenda of Senate amid voices of dissent from the opposition benches.
The Senate deputy chairman asserted that he could place such a bar declaring that the House would now run under the law.
“Nobody can speak against institutions, national heroes and leaders of political parties,” he added. 
When Awami National Party (ANP) chief Aimal Wali Khan asked as to who these “national heroes” were, Mr Nasir replied that they included former premiers Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto, and Nawaz Sharif; nuclear scientist Dr A. Q. Khan; and all those who signed the 1973 Constitution.
“A handful of elements cannot hold the House hostage,” he said before abruptly adjourning the House to meet again on Friday (today).
Minutes earlier, Mr Nasir said he needed a minute to say something crucial and had assured a senator, who wanted to speak on a point of public importance, that he would be given time.
The Senate deputy chairman said maintaining dignity of the House was a shared responsibility and it was the chair’s job to run it in accordance with the rules.
He added that the chair had the power to issue a strict order for the sake of decorum of the House. “This also includes the power under Rule 246 to suspend a member obstructing proceedings of the House,” he continued.
Mr Nasir recalled that he had given a ruling to this effect on Feb 18 as well but regretted that certain members from the opposition benches were continuously disrupting proceedings of the House.
He warned that he would not refrain from taking extreme steps to smoothly run the proceedings, if the unruly conduct continued.
Without naming the PTI, the deputy chairman said he would write a letter to the parliamentary leader of the party, seeking instructions for their members to act as per law and the rules.
He expressed alarm over the practice of members gathering around the chair’s podium.
Mr Nasir stressed that the chair and its rulings must be respected.
The Senate deputy chairman, who stressed the need for running the proceedings as per the law and the rules, surprised many during the Question Hour, by punishing an opposition lawmaker for pointing out the quorum.
Prohibiting the opposition senator who had pointed out the quorum from participating in the session, Mr Nasir said: “This is my ruling”.
However, the ruling was seen by many as something against the rules provide and an established parliamentary practice.
Govt negligence
Earlier, during the Question Hour, PPP Senator Shahadat Awan regretted the delay in disbursement of postal life insurance claims to around 34,000 individuals including widows and orphans, terming it a failure on the part of the government his party was allied with.
Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan candidly conceded that it was indeed the government’s incompetence and “negligence” that disbursement under the Postal Life Insurance Company Limited (PLICL) could not be delivered to the people on time.
The minister also agreed with Mr Awan that as per the Insurance Ordinance, 2000, the PLICL was liable to pay liquidated damages for delays beyond 90 days, calculated at monthly base with a 5 per cent additional rate over the prevailing base rate.
“This escalating financial exposure underscores the immediate need for additional budgetary allocation,” the minister noted, holding the finance ministry responsible for it.

At least nine higher education institutions have placed the two countries in a “high-risk” category for student visas and have tightened their enrolment policies to protect their ability to sponsor international applicants, according to the report published on Thursday.
The move follows a surge in asylum claims lodged by international students, prompting UK ministers to warn that the study route “must not be used as a backdoor” to settlement.
Among the universities taking action, the University of Chester has suspended recruitment from Pakistan until autumn 2026, citing a “recent and unexpected rise in visa refusals”.
The University of Wolverhampton is not accepting undergraduate applications from either Pakistan or Bangladesh, while the University of East London has paused recruitment from Pakistan altogether.
Other institutions, including Sunderland, Coventry, Hertfordshire, Oxford Brookes, Glasgow Caledonian and private provider BPP University, have also halted or scaled back admissions from the two countries under what they describe as risk-mitigation measures.
The restrictions come after a regulatory overhaul that took effect in September, reducing the maximum visa refusal rate allowed for institutions sponsoring international students from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.
However, refusal rates for Pakistani and Bangladeshi student visa applications stand at 18pc and 22pc respectively, far exceeding the new limit, FT reported.
Together, applicants from the two countries make up half of the 23,036 student visa refusals recorded by the Home Office in the year to September 2025.
Asylum claims from both nationalities have also risen, many involving students who first entered the UK on study or work visas.
International higher education consultant Vincenzo Raimo told FT the crackdown had created a “real dilemma” for lower-fee universities heavily dependent on overseas enrolments. Even limited numbers of problematic cases, he warned, could jeopardise compliance with the tightened thresholds.
The measures have drawn frustration from education advisers. Maryem Abbas, founder of Lahore-based Edvance Advisors, described the decisions as “heartbreaking” for genuine students whose applications were being rejected at the final stage.
She argued that weak oversight of recruitment agents had contributed to the rise in misuse of the student route, turning it into a “moneymaking business”.
Universities UK International said some institutions would need to diversify international recruitment and strengthen application checks to retain their sponsorship rights. While the new rules may prove “challenging”, it said they were essential to maintain confidence in the system.
A Home Office spokesperson told FT that the government “strongly values” international students but is tightening rules to ensure those who come to Britain are genuine and that education providers uphold their responsibilities.</p><small>2025-12-04 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041837543a280bd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959169/govt-rules-out-meetings-for-uzma-khan-other-violators-of-prison-code' target='_blank'><strong>Govt rules out meetings for Uzma Khan, other violators of prison code</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Thursday ruled out any further meetings for Uzma Khanum and others who violated the prison code while meeting PTI founder Imran Khan.
Uzma met the party founder in prison on Tuesday after weeks of effort. The meeting took place as rumours regarding Imran’s health began circulating in local and foreign media, despite claims by the government and PTI leaders that the former prime minister was in good health.
These speculations, however, gained traction due to the government’s reluctance to let visitors, including his family members and legal team, meet Imran over the past few weeks. Uzma subsequently detailed instructions from Imran to the party regarding political and other matters.
Addressing a press conference with Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on the entire situation, the information minister announced: “There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen.”

         View this post on Instagram            

He added that reports of incitement against the state and its officials had surfaced. “Meetings are banned for anyone who violates the rules,” Attaullah said, adding that it was not right for people to hold meetings and then go on to peddle “Indian and Afghan stances and orchestrate posts against the army and the army chief”.
The minister added that a chance was provided, and now “the meeting has been banned for whoever committed the violation.”
Attaullah said the government would tolerate no more violations and would deal with anyone who did so with an iron hand.
“There is zero room for a circus.”
The law minister also said that the prison rules for allowing meetings were the same as always and laid out specific provisions that contained restrictions on how they should be conducted.
PTI slams press conference against Imran’s family
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram lashed out at what he described as “political clowns and puppets” for their “relentless campaign” against Imran and his family.
He said the onslaught “exposes the imposed and petrified regime’s sheer desperation to divert public attention from the chronic crises the country is grappling with as a result of its myopic, shortsighted, and self-serving policies”.
The PTI spokesperson expressed his astonishment that the “Sharif courtiers and political pawns” would now “presume to distribute certificates of patriotism and nationalism”, even though, he said, they were the very ones who hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Jati Umra and attended his family’s wedding functions.
Akram emphasised that the PTI founder never hosted any Pakistani adversaries in Bani Gala, nor did he establish business links with anti-Pakistani elements. He alleged that it was only the Sharif dynasty that compromised the country and state interests for its personal and business gains, showing little regard for the nation itself.
He made it clear that the “imposed regime’s false and fabricated rhetoric” was nothing more than a “desperate attempt to divert media and public attention, as self-serving sycophants have plunged the country headlong into the whirlwinds of economic, political, social and constitutional crises”.
Akram said that “disinformation minister Atta Tarar’s press conference was completely devoid of facts, driven by panic and dripping with political vengeance,” adding that it was a reflection of the ruling circle’s “fear” and what he called “Imran Khan phobia”.
He vowed that the “daily circus of jokers” unleashed to spew venom against Imran and the PTI may pollute the political environment, but it could no longer fool a nation that was now wide awake, fully aware of the real culprits and how state power was being weaponised for revenge.
Commenting on the government’s claims of providing all facilities to Imran, the PTI spokesperson asserted that the PTI patron-in-chief was kept in arbitrary detention under death-cell conditions in solitary confinement, being denied all entitlements as per jail rules.
He also blasted the “hybrid regime” for repeatedly denying meetings between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Imran, refusing access to personal physicians and preventing his sons from speaking with him for several months.
Akram stated that the hue and cry was a clear reflection that Imran remained a nightmare for them, so much so that they could not even sleep peacefully due to their “fear”.
He vowed that neither the nation’s leader nor the now-awakened public would allow these “fraudulently imposed rulers” to escape accountability for their crimes.
The PTI spokesperson asserted that the days of this “cabal of crooks” were numbered, and that soon the public would punish them for their “transgressions, corruption, theft of the public mandate, and tyranny”.
Akram reaffirmed that Imran and his party, together with the nation, would continue their just struggle to uphold democracy, the rule of law, constitutional supremacy and the independence of the judiciary.</p><small>2025-12-04 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/042312243c1cdaa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959181/trump-envoys-press-plan-with-ukraine-as-sanctions-eased-on-russia' target='_blank'><strong>Trump envoys press plan with Ukraine as sanctions eased on Russia</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump’s envoys were to meet Thursday with Ukrainian negotiators for the third time in two weeks to press his plan to end the war as his administration eased economic pressure on Russia.
Two days after the envoys met Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Treasury Department partially suspended measures that Trump had announced in October when he finally vowed to get tough on Moscow.
The Treasury Department suspended until at least April 29 economic sanctions against Lukoil-branded gas stations outside of Russia.
A ban remains on place to prevent the money from flowing back to Russia, which has been under sweeping US and EU sanctions since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Trump’s sanctions had been one of the most concrete means to pressure Russia, which European diplomats accuse of trying to avoid pressure by pursuing negotiations.
Easing isolation
Steve Witkoff, Trump’s business partner-turned-roving global ambassador, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, will meet in the Miami area for dinner late Thursday with the top Ukrainian negotiator, Rustem Umerov, a US official said.
The gathering, which will be closed to the press, came two days after the Trump duo met with Putin for five hours, stretching into the early morning, in Moscow.
Trump said the envoys had a “reasonably good meeting” with Putin.Pressed on whether Witkoff and Kushner got any sense that Putin genuinely wanted to halt Russia’s nearly four-yearinvasion, Trump replied: “He would like to end the war. That was their impression.” But Putin showed no public signs of budging, as Russia makes slow but steady progress seizing land in eastern Ukraine.
“This is a complex task and a challenging mission that President Trump took upon himself,” Putin said of the diplomacy in an interview as he visited India.
“Achieving consensus among competing parties is no easy task, but President Trump, truly, I believe – he sincerely tries to do this,” he said, according to magazine India Today.
“I think we should engage with this effort rather than obstruct it.” Putin’s visit to India, a historic partner of Russia, comes as international isolation of him gradually eases.
Trump in August welcomed Putin to Alaska where they made no clear progress on ending the Ukraine conflict.
Critical time for Ukraine
Trump has previously mused that Russia will inevitably win more land and that Ukraine would be better off settling.
A first draft of the US plan would see Ukraine surrendering land that Russia has not been able to win on the battleground in return for security promises that fall short of Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO.
Witkoff and Kushner have been working on modifications since meeting with the Ukrainians on November 23 in Geneva. The two sides met again the following week in Miami alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
The talks come at a delicate time for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was hailed as a hero in the West at the start of the war but has had a tumultuous relationship with Trump.
Zelensky last week removed his top aide and negotiator Andriy Yermak, who days earlier had negotiated with Witkoff, as he came under investigation in a corruption scandal.</p><small>2025-12-04 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/04165151c495da3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959162/pakistan-rubbishes-claims-of-israeli-spyware-being-used-in-country' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rubbishes claims of Israeli spyware being used in country</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan rubbished claims published in an Amnesty International report on Thursday that a spyware, manufactured by an Israeli company, was actively being used in the country.
According to a senior intelligence officer, who spoke to Dawn on condition of anonymity, the report was an “an attempt to malign Pakistan”.
“There is not an iota of truth in it,” he stressed.
The official was referring to a claim made in the Amnesty International investigation, titled “Intellexa Leaks”, which described the story of a human rights lawyer based in Pakistan. The lawyer, according to the report, had approached Amnesty International in the summer of 2025 after receiving a suspicious link on WhatsApp from an unknown number.
Amnesty Security Lab investigated the link and identified it as a Predator attack attempt based on the technical behaviour of the infection server. Predator is a highly invasive spyware manufactured by the Israeli company Intellexa.
According to Amnesty International, the investigation was based on a combination of highly sensitive documents and other material leaked from the company, including internal company documents, sales and marketing materials, and training videos.
The months-long investigation was published in collaboration with Inside Story in Greece, Haaretz in Israel, and WAV Research Collective in Switzerland.
In 2023, Intellexa was fined by the Greek Data Protection Authority for failing to comply with its investigations into the company.
Google started sending spyware threat notifications to several hundred of its users across various countries, including Pakistan. The accounts were identified as Predator spyware targets.
How Predator works
Intellexa’s Predator relies on “1-click” attacks to infect a device, which require a malicious link to be opened in the target’s phone. The malicious link then loads a browser exploit for Chrome or Safari to gain initial access to the device and download the full spyware payload.
Once the spyware is installed, it can access encrypted instant messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, audio recordings, emails, device locations, screenshots and camera photos, stored passwords, contacts, and call logs. It also activates the device’s microphone.
The spyware then communicates with, and uploads surveillance data to, a Predator backend server physically located in the customer’s country.
All data from the spyware is first relayed through a chain of anonymization servers, termed the “CNC Anonymization Network” to prevent the risk of exposure for the operator with the 1-click attack link.
The surveillance company overcame the limitation of exposure by using different approaches to trigger the opening of an infection link on the target’s phone, without requiring the target to manually click the link.
Intellexa also developed a strategic infection vector, ‘Aladdin,’ which could enable silent zero-click infections of target devices anywhere in the world. The vector exploits the commercial mobile advertising ecosystem to carry out these infections.
Intellexa is a surveillance company that develops spyware, with Predator as its signature product, and sells it for use by governments. According to the investigation, the company’s internal operations remained largely unknown to researchers.</p><small>2025-12-04 18:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041813492133ed2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959155/in-meeting-with-uk-high-commissioner-naqvi-hands-over-extradition-papers-for-shahzad-akbar-and-adil-raja' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with UK high commissioner, Naqvi hands over extradition papers for Shahzad Akbar and Adil Raja</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met United Kingdom (UK) High Commissioner Jane Marriott on Thursday, where he handed over the extradition papers for former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber Adil Raja.
The development comes three days after Naqvi announced a crackdown on those involved in fake news, declaring that the government would repatriate from the UK YouTubers involved in this activity or the targeting of state institutions.
Currently, no formal extradition treaty exists between Pakistan and the UK, though Section 194 of the UK Extradition Act 2003 contains provisions for special “ad hoc” extradition arrangements.
According to a statement released by the interior ministry, Naqvi held an “important” meeting with Marriott in Islamabad, where the two discussed Pak-UK relations, security cooperation and issues of mutual interest.
Federal Secretary for Interior Muhammad Khurram Agha and other relevant officers were also present, it said. They also discussed the return of Pakistanis illegally residing in the UK, it added.
“The extradition papers for Akbar and Raja from the government of Pakistan were handed over [to Marriott],” the statement said.
“Both individuals are wanted in Pakistan. They should be handed over to Pakistan immediately,” Naqvi was quoted as saying.
He also provided evidence against Pakistani citizens who were spreading propaganda, the statement said.
“I fully believe in freedom of expression, but fake news is a problem for every country,” he said, as per the statement.
“No country can allow slander and defamation against state institutions from those sitting abroad,” the minister said. Naqvi also said that Pakistan would welcome British cooperation for the return of those who “spread anti-Pakistan propaganda”.
The statement further said that the interior ministry had initiated the extradition process through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Reacting to the news, Akbar took to social media platform x, “It has become increasingly clear that my publications, broadcasts, and political commentary on human rights abuses in Pakistan, the rise of authoritarianism, unconstitutional amendments, and the current impasse over military appointments have deeply angered the regime.”
Tagging Marriott as well as the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), he said, “I urge you to note that, as I have repeatedly stated, the worst forms of retaliation have already been used against me, including the abduction of my family members in Pakistan and an acid attack against me here in the UK.”
In 2023, Akbar said he was attacked at his England home, adding that “acidic liquid” was thrown at him. He had initiated legal action against the Pakistan government last year, after which the Foreign Office said the claims by Akbar were “simply preposterous”.
“I trust that UK authorities will uphold due process, rule of law, and human-rights obligations,” he said.







“The Pakistani regime’s standing on the world stage is reflected in its failing economy, rampant corruption, and poor governance — all of which were detailed in the recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) review,” said Raja, while responding to Akbar.
“They may call the British High Commissioner to complain, but such a complaint is itself unlawful under UK statutes, as we have committed no wrongdoing,” he said.







Both Akbar and Raja have been residing in the UK. Raja, who is also a former Pakistan Army officer and has positioned himself as a whistleblower, was ordered to pay £350,000 in damages and legal costs after a London high court ruled he had defamed a former intelligence officer with unfounded allegations of corruption and electoral interference.
Akbar also runs his own YouTube channel, where he comments on Pakistan’s political developments.
Naqvi announces crackdown on fake news mongers
In his press conference on Monday, the interior minister had said the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) and the information ministry will jointly initiate action on a massive scale against those spreading fake news.
“The state will no longer allow individuals to declare a living person dead, a dead person alive (a reference to fake news about the health of Imran Khan), or make any allegation they please without evidence. Since the past few days, 90 per cent news on social media was fake,” Naqvi told a press conference in Lahore.
The remarks had come as social media was abuzz with reports about the health of former prime minister Imran Khan.
Naqvi had singled out some so-called social media journalists for spreading fake news.
“Mainstream journalists are a part of a strong editorial system unlike those on social media who spread fake news. We will not allow anyone to create panic in the garb of journalism on social media. Those who spread fake news are not journalists for us. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) takes action on incorrect reporting in the mainstream media but social media lacks accountability mechanisms,” he explained and added that a regulatory body for online content was being established.
When asked about criticism directed towards Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Gen Asim Munir, Naqvi said: “The state is clear. We will not spare them. The other day someone was saying in London that there was a dispute within the institutions. This will have to stop. Those sitting out there (UK) will be brought back soon.”</p><small>2025-12-04 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/04221352049af93.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959164/russias-putin-in-india-for-defence-trade-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Russia’s Putin in India for defence, trade talks</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in India on Thursday for a two-day visit aimed at deepening defence ties, as New Delhi faces heavy US pressure to stop buying oil from Moscow.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was at the airport to welcome the Russian leader in person, greeting him on the red carpet with a hug, before riding together in the same car.

Putin, on his first visit to India since the Ukraine war, is accompanied by his Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, with possible deals on fighter jets and air defence systems expected to be discussed.
In an interview with India Today, Putin said he was “very happy” to be meeting “my friend” Modi.
“The range of our cooperation with India is huge,” he said in remarks translated by the broadcaster, citing ship and aircraft manufacturing, nuclear energy and space exploration.
The Indian premier said he was “delighted to welcome my friend, President Putin to India”.
“Looking forward to our interactions later this evening and tomorrow,” Modi said in a post on X.
He will host Putin for a private dinner on Thursday evening, followed by a summit meeting on Friday.
“India-Russia friendship is a time tested one that has greatly benefitted our people,” Modi added, posting a picture of them from inside the car.
Trade relations are expected to feature prominently as India walks a diplomatic tightrope – relying on strategic Russian oil imports while trying not to provoke US President Donald Trump during ongoing tariff negotiations.
Energy imports
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said talks to expand the supply of Russia’s advanced S-400 air defence systems had an “important place on the agenda”.
Indian media reports suggested Moscow may also offer co-production of Russia’s Su-57 fighter jets.
India is one of the world’s top arms importers, and Russia has long been a principal supplier.
But New Delhi has also sought alternative suppliers, as well as boosting domestic production – with the Russian share of India’s arms imports falling from 76 percent in 2009-13 to 36 percent in 2019-23, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
Putin’s visit comes after Trump imposed 50-percent tariffs on most Indian products in August, citing Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil – revenue Washington argues helps fund the war in Ukraine.
India, the world’s most populous nation, has become a major buyer of Russian oil, saving itself billions of dollars and providing Moscow with a much-needed export market after it was cut off from traditional buyers in Europe because of the war.
But Delhi has recently cut down on crude imports under pressure from sanctions on Russia’s top oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil.
The Indian government fears any fresh energy or defence deals with Russia could irk Trump, with possible ramifications on trade negotiations with Washington.
Peskov said Moscow wanted to “maintain and increase the volume of our bilateral business with India, without allowing anyone to interfere”.
Nandan Unnikrishnan, of the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation, told AFP: “There may be some reduction in energy purchases – under US pressure – but the overall direction of the ties will be maintained because both countries need each other at the strategic level.”
‘Critical moment’
A senior Indian foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was a need to address the trade imbalance “one way or the other”.
Bilateral trade reached $68.7 billion in 2024-25 – almost six times higher than the pre-pandemic levels – but Indian exports accounted for only $4.88 billion.

Delhi has been pressing Moscow for expanded market access for its key industries including pharmaceuticals, automobiles and the service sector.
Harsh V Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College London, said the visit was an attempt by “to reset their relationship at a critical geopolitical moment for both”.
“For India, the optics is a statement of intent for strategic autonomy, and Putin, who rarely travels, is sending a message about the importance of the relationship by travelling here,” Pant told AFP.
The Indian foreign ministry official described the ties between Moscow and Delhi as the “most stable relationship in modern times”.
The official acknowledged the global geopolitical significance, but insisted that the meeting should seen in the context as “just another annual summit”.</p><small>2025-12-04 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0419461568edd5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959177/balochistan-govt-to-approach-interpol-to-apprehend-leaders-of-banned-outfits-residing-outside-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan govt to approach Interpol to apprehend leaders of banned outfits residing outside Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The Balochistan government on Thursday announced that it would launch a crackdown against 300 suspected terrorists, while approaching Interpol to apprehend leaders of proscribed organisations residing outside of Pakistan.
According to a statement from the Chief Minister’s Secretariat, the decision was made during a high-level meeting under the chairmanship of CM Sarfaraz Bugti. During the meeting, officials presented evidence of links between overseas leadership of banned outfits and their local networks through call recordings.
“After reviewing the material, the provincial government approved stringent and extraordinary measures to dismantle the outfits and tighten the noose around their operatives.
“The provincial government, therefore, decided that it would seek Interpol’s assistance to nab the suspected terrorists who took refuge outside Pakistan,” the statement said.
Interpol, or the International Criminal Police Organisation, is the world’s largest international police body, dedicated to helping police in 196 member countries cooperate to combat crime and promote security.
During the meeting, it was also decided to expedite registered cases against the leadership of banned groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), United Baloch Army, Baloch Revolution Group and Lashkar-i-Balochistan.
“The chief minister directed relevant departments to speed up the process of issuing Interpol red notices with support from the interior and foreign ministries,” the statement added.
The crackdown, it added, will target both local facilitators and commanders operating from abroad, under the guidelines provided in the Provincial Action Plan.
CM Bugti instructed the home department to activate the specialised cell set up under the plan, enforce new anti-terrorism laws, and compile a complete list of leaders and facilitators, ensuring that evidence becomes part of the official record.
Bugti said that the provincial government, in coordination with the centre, would present the evidence at international forums to initiate strong legal action.
“Eliminating the elements challenging the writ of the state has become inevitable and has entered a decisive stage,” the statement quoted him as saying.
“There will be no compromise on peace, protection of citizens, and the dignity of the state,” he said.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened over the last few months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. Last Sunday, the Frontier Corps headquarters in Nokundi, a town in Chagai district, came under attack.</p><small>2025-12-04 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0416452432431d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959160/police-block-routes-to-karachi-press-club-detain-activist-ahead-of-aurat-march-press-conference' target='_blank'><strong>Police block routes to Karachi Press Club, detain activist ahead of Aurat March press conference</strong></a><br><p>Police on Thursday blocked routes leading to the Karachi Press Club ahead of a press conference by Aurat March over the alleged “abduction” of two Baloch girls and briefly detained an activist, with organisers claiming that other members were also manhandled.
Aurat March, a women’s rights group, was set to hold a press conference at 3pm over the alleged “abduction” of two Baloch girls — 15-year-old Nasreen Baloch and 24-year-old Mahjabeen Baloch.
Authorities closed off roads leading to KPC ahead of the press conference, which eventually began with a delay of approximately 20 minutes as the organisers said they were “stopped by the police” at the gate of the press club.
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) member Qazi Khizar said an activist named Sara was taken by the police from outside the KPC. Within a few hours, Aurat March confirmed to Dawn that she had been released.
Dawn has reached out to the police for a comment on the detention.
Senior journalist Dodal Chandio said in a post on Facebook that “police stopped the Aurat March women who were to hold a press conference” outside the KPC.



The police “misbehaved” with activist Sheema Kirmani, he added. In the video he shared, Kirmani could be heard saying, “You have no right to touch me. How dare you touch me?”
The video also showed policewomen grabbing another woman’s hand to detain her, as Kirmani told the cops that the woman was a reporter. As the tussle between them and the police continued, the woman said, “Let go of my hand. This is not a legal process.”
In other videos that surfaced on social media, the woman identified herself as Shakeela and a member of “JMDC, Joint Minority Development”. She showed a “slip” issued to her for the press conference, which was being attended by “10 people” from her group.







Journalist Zofeen Ebrahim, who was barred from attending the press conference, recalled to Dawn: “Police stationed outside KPC stopped me and asked me where I was going.
“I told them I am here for the press conference, to which they said that it is not going to happen,” she continued.
Ebrahim said that when she tried to make her way towards the KPC and was stopped by the police, she called the organisers to ask whether the press conference had been cancelled. “They also did not know what was going on,” she said.
“Some other women who were trying to enter were stopped at the gate as well,” the journalist added.
She also shared a video on X, asking, “What’s happening to my city, my country?”







Prior to the press conference, the Karachi police also heightened security outside the KPC, with a considerable number of women personnel present, a Dawn correspondent reported. The nearby roads that had been shut to traffic were reopened by about 5pm.
In a press release issued yesterday, Aurat March had said their press conference would “address the escalating pattern of enforced disappearances in Balochistan — particularly the alarming rise in the abduction of Baloch women and girls”.
“The 4th Schedule has become a tool of coercion in Balochistan, with women — many of them entirely unaffiliated with activism — being placed on the list and denied freedom of movement,” the statement read.
On November 27, police had detained 24 PTI leaders and workers following a protest at KPC to voice their concerns over former prime minister Imran Khan’s well-being.
A week before that, the police had detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the venue of a scheduled protest by the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) against the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In March, Karachi police had arrested six people at Fawara Chowk as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) attempted to reach the KPC for a protest against the arrests of its leadership.
Civil society seeks recovery of Mahjabeen Baloch, teenage Nasreen Baloch
Aurat March’s press conference highlighted two cases — one of Nasreen who the group said was “abducted from Hub” in Balochistan in November, and another of Mahjabeen who was “taken from Quetta” earlier this year.
Mahjabeen, the daughter of Ghulam Mustafa and a student of the University of Balochistan, was picked up from Quetta’s Civil Hospital in May, as per the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) Chairman Nasrullah Baloch.

At the outset of the press conference, Kirmani said she was “grabbed and pushed around” by police outside and questioned why the state was stopping them from holding a press conference.
“What right did the state have to stop them from demanding the recovery of young Baloch girls?” she asked.
“Are you a fascist government or a democratic government? What are you scared of?” Kirmani said furiously, adding that by meting out such treatment, the state was creating an atmosphere of hatred.
Aurat March organiser Moneeza Ahmed asked, “Why are the families of Nasreena and Mahjabeen not even being allowed to ask the state about the whereabouts of their daughters?”
She alleged that the state was attempting to intimidate activists and families of the missing young girls. “To what extent is the state willing to go?” Ahmed wondered.
Kirmani claimed that police had also attempted to arrest BYC activist Sammi Deen Baloch as she made her way to the press conference.

 

“The Baloch women have repeatedly stated that they have no relation to BLA, yet the state continues to harass them,” she lamented, referring to the banned so-called Baloch Liberation Army.
Addressing the press conference, Khizer noted that “at the moment, KPC is surrounded by police from every corner”. “This is fear,” the vice chairman of the HRCP’s Sindh chapter added.
He stressed that the “young Baloch girls fighting for their rights and those [militants] in remote mountains were not the same”.
“The state has now resorted to picking up young girls,” he alleged, expressing his disappointment.
Kirmani called on the government to “negotiate”, asking, “Why should they not know where their daughters are?”

 

“Seven months have gone by ever since she has been gone, and we don’t know anything,” she said, referring to Mahjabeen. “Why are we not allowed to ask about their whereabouts?” she questioned.
The activists demanded the “immediate recovery and safe return of both the girls, an end to enforced disappearances, protection for families of missing persons, and transparency from state institutions”.</p><small>2025-12-04 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0420494094a36f5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959179/saudi-arabia-rolls-over-3bn-deposit-for-another-year' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia rolls over $3bn deposit for another year</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Thursday that Saudi Arabia has agreed to extend the $3 billion deposit held with the bank for another year.
It said the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), on behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has rolled over the deposit, which was set to mature on Monday.
“The extension of the term of the deposit is a continuation of the support provided by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which will help in strengthening the foreign exchange reserves of Pakistan and contribute to the country’s economic growth and development,” the bank said.







The $3bn deposit was initially agreed upon in 2021 and rolled over in 2022, 2023 and 2024.
Last week, the SBP said its forei­­gn exchange reserves rose by a meagre $9 million to $14.560bn during the week ending Nov 21.
However, the country’s total liquid foreign reserves decreased to $19.605bn from the previous week’s $19.738bn due to a decline in commercial banks’ foreign exchange holdings, which fell from $5.186bn to $5.044bn in the latest week.

Imran’s sister Uzma Khan met the party founder in prison on Tuesday after weeks of effort, with CM Afridi and other party leaders scheduled to meet him today. The meeting took place as rumours regarding Imran’s health began circulating in local and foreign media, despite claims by the government and PTI leaders that the former prime minister was in good health.
These speculations, however, gained traction due to the government’s reluctance to let visitors, including his family members and legal team, meet Imran over the past few weeks.
According to a post on X by the PTI, CM Afridi went to Adiala jail to visit Imran, but access was not granted.
Afridi addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access. He said he would update the media on the immediate course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not.







The PTI also shared a video of the KP CM and his delegation in a waiting room, saying that today was the ninth instance of Afridi not being allowed to meet Imran.







In a talk with the media after exiting the room, CM Afridi said: “I think the meeting is not being allowed. Today is the ninth time I have come; a chief minister of a province is repeatedly coming, but even a five-minute meeting is not being allowed. The whole world is witnessing this discriminatory treatment, and their actions are being noted and will be remembered.”
“This government won’t remain forever and then no one will get a chance to complain.”
When asked if he planned to spend another night outside the prison in protest, he said that Imran’s good physical health had been confirmed in the meeting with Uzma. He added that the party would now devise its next course of action regarding concerns about the party founder’s mental duress.
“I have been told to play on the front foot, and there are instructions that the umpires are colluding, so be careful. So we will play on the front foot and also keep a watch on the umpires.”
The provincial chief executive said the continued denial of a meeting showed that “our coming here pains them, so we will mete out that pain again and again.” CM Afridi said street protests were certainly an option for the party, as per the law and Constitution.
On a question about the possible imposition of governor’s rule in KP, Afridi responded: “What are they waiting for … impose it today. We are not afraid of any governor’s rule.”
“They will not be able to control and handle the conditions that I am foreseeing,” warned KP CM.
He also lashed out at the government for not being able to tolerate and bear a chief minister from the tribal areas for the first time. Afridi said removing him would cause anger and frustration among the people from the tribal belt.
“The people of KP and Pakistan see their future in me,” Afridi claimed, adding that the governor’s rule would be a “win-win” situation for him since he would be able to operate freely.
The KP CM said he would visit Punjab soon.



Visuals shared by the party showed a large group of supporters gathered outside the prison as well.
