She, however, stated that concerns regarding Imran’s vision “remain” and requested that his treatment be conducted transparently under the supervision of his personal doctors.
On February 12, Imran claimed that his right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, following which the Supreme Court (SC) ordered the formation of a medical team to examine him. It was ordered that the eye examination be conducted before February 16 (Monday).
In a post on X, Noreen confirmed that the party founder underwent an eye examination by doctors on Sunday and said “no major complications” have emerged so far.







Elaborating on Sunday’s medical examination, Noreen said a slit lamp, an OCT scan machine and a fully equipped ambulance were brought to Adiala jail for the eye examination.
Dr Arif from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) and Dr Nadeem Qureshi from Al-Shifa Trust Hospital conducted the examination within jail premises, said Imran’s sister.
“Afterwards, they briefed senior doctors on their findings, including Dr Asim Yousuf and Dr Mirza, who joined via conference call. Barrister Gohar has also been kept informed of all developments.”
Noreen said that doctors at Shifa International Hospital remain cautious. “They said that although it had earlier been stated that Imran Khan would be transferred to Shifa, he was not moved there.”
Giving further details, the PTI founder’s sister said the medical facility’s retina specialists, including Dr Aamir Awan, remained on standby until late at night.
“One dose of the Eylea injection has already been administered, while the second dose will be given on February 25.”
In her social media post, Noreen added that according to experts, including Dr Khurram Mirza, a Vabysmo injection “may be stronger and more effective”.
“This opinion has been conveyed to the CEO of PIMS and retina specialist Dr Nadeem Qureshi. However, for now, it has been decided to continue with Eylea, as positive results are being observed.”
Noreen further revealed that the next step in Imran’s treatment is an angiogram, following which doctors will decide whether laser treatment is necessary.
Government figures on Saturday had hinted that Imran would soon be taken to a hospital, but no such development had occurred over the weekend.
HRCP calls for ‘uninterrupted access’
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed “grave concern” over reports regarding the deteriorating health of prisoners affiliated with the PTI, particularly Imran Khan and former Punjab health minister Yasmin Rashid.
The rights body urged the interior ministry, the Punjab Home Department and prison authorities to ensure that inmates were allowed immediate, independent medical examinations and “uninterrupted access to prescribed treatment”.</p><small>2026-02-16 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16090552b63d7d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973590/rcc-work-on-diamer-dassu-power-projects-to-start-this-year-wapda' target='_blank'><strong>RCC work on Diamer, Dassu power projects to start this year: Wapda</strong></a><br><p>GILGIT: The roller-compacted-concrete (RCC) works on Diamer-Basha Dam and Dassu Dam Hydropower projects will commence this year, Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) Chairman retired Lt Gen Muhammad Saeed was informed on Sunday during a briefing held to review construction progress of both the projects.
The briefing took place during Wapda chairman’s visit to the under-construction Diamer Basha Dam and Dasu Hydropower Projects sites to review construction progress of the projects.
During the visit, the chairman was briefed that RCC works on the main dams of the projects will commence this year, as pre-requisites of the projects are now heading for completion at a faster pace.
During the visit, the chairman directed general managers, consultants and contractors of the projects to adhere to implementation plans in letter and spirit by accelerating the construction work to complete the projects on time.
In the first leg, the chairman had a detailed visit of Diamer-Basha Dam, being constructed on the River Indus, 40 kilometres downstream of Chilas town, and reviewed construction works on major sites including power intake, dam pit, downstream coffer dam, left abutment, flushing tunnel, guide wall, RCC batching plant and laboratory.
The general manager/project director along with the consultants and the contractors briefed the chairman site-wise achievements versus targets. At present, the construction is being carried out on 20 work sites of the project. Excavation work at the left abutment and dam pit (foundation) is substantially completed. RCC trials for the main dam have also been conducted successfully.
With completion of the right abutment’s excavation, placing of RCC for the main dam will start during the current year. Completion of the dam is scheduled in 2030. Later, the chairman had a meeting with local ulema and progress on confidence-building measures (CBMs) for uplift of the people in the project area was reviewed.
The chairman was informed that construction of a cadet college in Chilas has been completed, progress on Harpan Das model village stands at about 61 per cent while levelling of plots and additional works of roads, water supply and sewerage system are in progress.
The chairman was further informed that a contract has also been awarded for water supply scheme in Chilas town while bidding is in progress for construction of a rural health centre at Shatial in upper Kohistan.
In the second leg of his visit, the chairman visited Dasu Hydropower project in upper Kohistan district of KP.
His visit included tour of all key sites, including dam pit, underground power house and underground transformer cavern. The general manager/project director of the project informed the chairman that construction work has continued on 23 work sites of the project.
He was further informed that crushing and batching plants have been completed and they are now in operation. Pouring of RCC for the main dam will start during the current year. The 132 KV transmission line, meant for providing supply of electricity during construction of the main dam, is in the final phase of testing and commissioning, which will be energised within days.
Electricity generation from the project will start in 2028.

He stressed that if corrective measures are not undertaken, the matter would be taken to the “people’s court”.
Speaking at a press conference at the Quetta Press Club on Sunday alongside his lawyer Barrister Muhammad Iqbal Kakar and Prof Hanif Bazai, Mr Lashkari warned that if parliament fails to act, political parties will be forgotten by both history and the people of Balochistan.
He said that in the absence of corrective measures, they would take the matter to the “people’s court” and launch a political, constitutional, and democratic struggle with public support to stop illegal actions.
He said that on March 12 last year the Balochistan Assembly passed the Mines and Minerals Act, transferring sweeping powers over the land and mineral resources of the province to federal government. He said a seven-member committee, headed by a DG-rank officer, had been granted authority to allocate lands and mineral areas — powers that he said directly contradict the 18th Cons­titutional Amendment, which devolves authority to provinces.

Ex-senator Raisani vows to take matter to people’s court if corrective measures are not taken

He expressed concern that political parties, both inside and outside parliament, remained silent on the law despite their responsibility to safeguard the public rights and act as a bridge between the state and citizens.
He said no political party raised objections to the Act, prompting him and his colleagues to mobilise the people on the issue and reach out to political leaders, lawyers, journalists, and civil society to unite against this legislation.
He alleged that deals over Reko Diq had already been finalised and described the Act as a tool to strip Balochistan province of its rights. According to him, behind-the-scenes benefits, including assembly seats and other favours, were secured by some stakeholders.
The former senator said a constitutional petition challenging the Act is currently under hearing in the court, adding that despite an executive order from the Mines Department to suspend the Act, reports of tenders and allotments continue to surface. He claimed that repeated requests for official details have gone unanswered, and even efforts to obtain a copy of the chief minister’s executive order through the courts have seen no progress.
Mr Raisani claimed he did not believe in taking “backdoor routes” to power and said they have approached the courts seeking justice and protection for people’s rights from flawed legislation. He warned that future generations’ survival depended on control over provincial resources and criticised political parties for failing to fulfil their constitutional, political and social responsibilities.
He urged the judiciary to play an effective role and said that if the parliament does not review and amend the law, they will take the issue directly to the masses.

He’s a trained pharmaceutical chemist with an MPhil degree who used to work in the allopathic drug business. Over time, however, he grew disillusioned with what he describes as the “side effects of modern medicines” and turned instead to traditional healing.
He, therefore, enrolled for the Fazil-i-Tibb-wal-Jarahat qualification, hoping to practise Unani medicine.

Fazil-i-Tibb-wal-Jarahat is a government-recognised degree that trains practitioners in Unani medicine, a tradition of healing that has been practised in South Asia and modern-day Central Asia for hundreds of years. It is a healing system that employs herbal remedies to maintain a balance of bodily temperaments, based on Greek, Persian and Arabic influences.
Currently enrolled at a tibb college in Lahore, Ali says recent developments have left students like him questioning whether their education will mean anything in legal terms.
“I have come to know that a new legislation has been proposed, due to which not only will my college be closed in a few years, but there will be a question mark on my degree and licence to practice,” he said while talking to Dawn.
What changed?
The government has recently instructed colleges not to induct new students from the next academic session, giving rise to fears that the proposed merger of the National Council for Tibb and the National Council for Homoeopathy will lead to the closure of institutions that have trained traditional hakeems for decades and leave thousands of practitioners, many of whom are serving rural and low-income communities, without legal recognition.
The fears have become more intense after the health ministry moved to “right-size” its regulatory bodies through an Act of Parliament.

Practitioners say the decision places more than 70,000 hakeems holding the Fazil-i-Tibb-wal-Jarahat qualification at risk of losing their livelihoods and could result in the closure of all 40 tibb colleges currently operating across the country.

According to college administrators, these fears are not speculative but rooted in official instructions already issued by the government.
Professor Imran Lodhi, principal of Rawalpindi’s Ajmal Tibbia College, explained that traditional medicine operates within a distinct legal and educational framework that is at risk of being erased by the proposed merger.
“There are mostly three types of healthcare practitioners in Pakistan, i.e. allopathic, homoeopathic, and hikmat,” he said while talking to Dawn.

Outlining the regulatory distinction underpinning each system, he said that while allopathic practice is being done under the Drug Act 1976, hikmat is being carried out under Pakistan’s Unani, Ayurvedic and Homoeopathic Practitioners Act, 1965.
“Under the Act, regulatory councils, including the National Council for Tibb and the National Council for Homoeopathy, were established,” he said.
Professor Lodhi added that the education pathways for tibb students were already structured and regulated, as there were 40 colleges of hikmat and 140 homoeopathic colleges functioning across the country.
“Hakeems believe they are the only practitioners consistently working in far-flung regions, noting that MBBS doctors, even those from rural backgrounds, rarely practise in their native areas.”
Pakistan Tibbi Alliance General Secretary Hakeem Muhammad Sajjad has formally raised these concerns with the ministries of health and law. In letters, he has urged the government to halt consideration of the draft legislation.
He said the draft law, titled the “National Traditional and Complementary Medicine (NTCAM) Act, 2025”, contains serious gaps that could dismantle the sector.
According to him, the proposed changes stem from broader fiscal reforms driven by international commitments.
“As per the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), all the ministries and divisions have been taking steps for right-sizing,” Professor Lodhi added.
Last year, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the government planned to abolish 150,000 posts as part of IMF-backed structural benchmarks.
‘Unfortunate’ decision
From Lahore, Hakeem Sajjad pointed out that the financial burden of the councils was “minimal” for the government, questioning the logic behind their merger.
Other practitioners warned that the merger could make practice itself impossible.
“It is unfortunate that there are so many departments, which have been using tens of millions of rupees from the exchequer, were ignored, and two councils, which hardly get any amount from the exchequer, are being merged,” said Hakeem Sarfarz Bhatti from Gujranwala.
A senior health ministry officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the policy’s risks but said officials had little room to manoeuvre.
“We know that the decision will create a huge vacuum and administrative issues, but we are helpless. Merging both councils is similar to mixing black tea, coffee and green tea, as their scope and nature of work are different.
He added that internal disagreements between practitioners would further complicate the plan.

“Hakeems and homoeopathic doctors don’t recognise each other, so how will they be placed under one umbrella?” he said.
The health ministry, however, maintains that the process is consultative. According to spokesperson Sajid Hussain Shah, the merger aims to improve standards.
Loss of ‘affordable’ qualification
Akin to practitioners, students have expressed experiencing similar anxiety.
Sameera Kamran, a student at the Ajmal Tibbia College in Rawalpindi, told Dawn that she enrolled believing that tibb colleges offered an affordable path into healthcare, especially for those from lower-middle-income backgrounds. That belief, she said, had now been shaken.
“Annual fees at colleges ranged between Rs 35,000 and Rs 40,000, compared to medical university fees that could be up to five times higher,” she said.
Ijaz Ahmed, a fourth-year student from Narowal, agreed, saying tibb colleges remained the last viable option for many families.
“We have been paying Rs 300,000 for the entire course in colleges, but in universities, students will have no choice but to pay over a million rupees. The government’s move will close the doors to hikmat and shatter students’ dream of becoming tabeebs, especially those who belong to the lower middle class,” he said.
Both students also agreed that rural healthcare would suffer because of the decision.

“The majority of the basic health units (BHUs) in rural areas lacked doctors. So hakeems are providing treatment to the masses. There will be no one to take care of them if colleges are closed,” said Ahmed.
For students like Arsalan Ali, however, the debate remains deeply personal. He says his decision to study tibb was rooted in belief as much as career planning.
“I had decided to return towards the nature as there was a remedy for every disease in herbs. However, after spending over three years, I have been facing uncertainty regarding my future. I fear that soon the name of Tibb-i-Unani (Unani Medicine) will be eliminated from Pakistan, and medicines prepared by different companies will be sold,” he said.
He pointed to neighbouring countries where traditional medicine is actively promoted.
“On the other hand, that business is not only flourishing in India and China, but they have been earning a huge amount of foreign exchange from it. The traditional Chinese medicine is made under the theory of ‘Ying and Yang’, which refers to wood, fire, earth, metal and water,” he explained.
Ali added that Unani practice relies on individualised treatment.
“A number of books regarding human temperament were used by Hakeems, and they prescribe different medicines to different patients having the same complaint,” he said.
‘The last resort’
Patients, too, share stories of reliance on traditional medicine. Awais Siddique, a Lahore resident, recalled seeking help for his wife after exhausting hospital options.
“I had a baby boy after three years of my marriage, but after that, my wife started getting sick. At that time, I was residing in Sheikhupura, so I took her to the hospital, and they gave her some of the medicines due to which my wife started feeling a bit better,” he said.

He said her condition worsened after their second child.
“Later, she was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer, and doctors suggested taking her to Rawalpindi. But they informed me that the bone marrow transplant would cost me Rs7 to Rs8 million. On the other hand, my wife frequently required three to four units of platelets. It was impossible for me to arrange such a huge amount,” he said.
Turning to a hakeem was a last resort, he said.
“So, I went to a hakeem’s clinic, who prescribed three months of medicine, and just after two weeks, my wife’s platelets reached 150,000,” he claimed.
Siddique said the treatment brought “lasting relief”.
“After three months, hakeem sahib told me that my wife would never face the same issue and does not require medicine anymore. She has been healthy for the last two and a half years,” he claimed.
According to the Cancer Research Centre UK, there is no scientific evidence that traditional or homoeopathic treatments can prevent or cure any type of cancer.

Amid the increasing pressure, representatives of the Pakistan Medical Alliance met government officials earlier this month. A delegation, including Hakeem Sajjad, Professor Lodhi, and principals of leading Tibb colleges, held meetings with the Minister of State for Health, Malik Mukhtar Ahmed Bharat, as well as senior officials at the health ministry and the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), to discuss the survival and protection of the Unani, Ayurvedic and Homoeopathic Practitioners Act, 1965.
Until clarity emerges, students like Arsalan continue attending classes with no assurance that the system training them will still exist when they step out to practise.

ISLAMABAD: Carrying the largest outstanding loan portfolio on its books and a negative return on assets, the National Highway Authority (NHA) — the country’s logistics backbone — is the single largest entity bleeding the federal budget, exposing Pakistan to substantial fiscal risk despite the recent doubling of tolls.
The NHA is the “largest loss-maker”, operating on a “structural deficit model and reliant on budgetary support”, the Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) of the Ministry of Finance said in its Annual Aggregate Report on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) for the year ended June 30, 2025.
With accumulated losses of Rs2.074 trillion, the entity that owns and operates all the national highways and motorways accrued around Rs1.004tr in the last three years alone — about Rs295 billion each in FY24 and FY25 and Rs413bn in FY23.
Moreover, it stands out at the top of the SOE list, with the largest accrued financing cost of Rs210bn in FY25, as its toll revenue remains unaligned with debt servicing, leading to fiscal dependence and sovereign guarantee exposure.
“Currently, the NHA holds outstanding loans totalling approximately Rs3.1tr, with an annual debt accretion rate of Rs300bn. This debt portfolio generates Rs98bn in markup, which is expected to rise to more than Rs150bn per annum, creating a substantial credit risk for the government of Pakistan (GoP), which guarantees these loans”, the CMA said.
It said the presence of sovereign guarantees for public-private partnership (PPP) contracts added further financial strain, amplifying the government’s credit risk exposure.
With more than Rs115 billion in loans given by the federal government last year, it is also among the top borrowers. On the other hand, its net assets remained almost static over the last three years, actually declining slightly from Rs5.84tr in FY23 to Rs5.83tr in FY25. Its total equity has been declining over time from Rs2.57tr in FY23 to Rs2.27tr in FY24 and Rs1.95tr in FY25.
Conversely, NHA’s total liabilities have been increasing, making it the single-largest entity to accrue current liabilities. Its total liabilities amounted to Rs3.27tr in FY23, increasing to Rs3.54tr in FY24 and reaching Rs3.88tr by the end of FY25.

 

The CMU observed that National Highway Authority’s 2025 performance underscored its strategic importance yet exposed growing fiscal vulnerability. “Despite an impressive surge in toll revenues and build, own and transfer (BOT) project inflows, the authority continues to operate under a persistent deficit, driven by high depreciation and finance costs,” it said.
Operating income rose sharply to Rs83.1bn in FY25 (against Rs42.4bn in FY24), propelled by the doubling of toll income to Rs64.4bn. However, the overall income of Rs119.7bn remained insufficient against total expenditures of Rs408.1bn. Consequently, the deficit before levy and taxation stood at Rs292.98bn and the deficit after tax at Rs294.86bn, reflecting continued structural stress.
It noted that two critical components eroded National Highway Authority’s profitability. These include depreciation expense of Rs133.8bn, reflecting a heavily capital-intensive asset base and growing maintenance backlog and Rs193.5bn finance cost, up from Rs182bn last year, highlighting the escalating burden of debt and interest rate exposure.
The CMU advised diversification of funding sources through infrastructure bonds targeted at domestic institutional investors and international development markets.
It said the expansion of public-private partnerships for new road construction, maintenance outsourcing and service area development can shift part of the fiscal and operational burden to the private sector while improving efficiency and service quality.
The CMU also called for renegotiating loan terms with lenders to extend maturities, reduce interest rates or convert debt into quasi-equity instruments to create immediate fiscal space.

After the hullabaloo of the boycott and “un-boycott”, after the claim of a moral victory in the immoral corridors of the ICC, there was some expectation that Pakis­tan’s chutzpah in cricket politics would translate onto the cricket pitch. But it was not to be.
For the Pakistani fan, it is usually the expectation that kills you. Beyond the post-boycott optimism, there were genuine cricketing reasons to be optimistic this time around.
The only silver lining for Pakistan now is that the outcome of this match should not stop their qualification for the next stage.
In recent months, Pakistan have looked like a team getting to grips with modern T20 cricket. They rediscovered spin and are reconnected with the joy of hitting.

In recent months, Pakistan seem to have rediscovered spin and the joy of hitting, but the team still have much to learn if they are to challenge the stronger nations

A team and game formula has begun to emerge under the low-key technocracy of Mike Hesson. Importantly, Pakis­tan seem to have rediscovered themselves, and built a platform for a better future.
It is worth remembering that they also started this tournament well.
Yet, that platform is very much under construction, and on Sunday, India ruthlessly exposed how far it is from being finished.
It is a shocking and sobering statistic, but India have now defeated Pakistan in 11 consecutive World T20 matches.
The question the PCB should be asked now is: What are you going to do about this form of cricket domination?
Salman Ali Agha’s team will have learnt an important lesson: you need to walk before you can run. Pakistan can walk, but breaking out too early into a sprint is inadvisable.
In Colombo, Pakistan’s execution of their plan was hapless, but the plan itself was also a problem. The bowling plan failed to apply early pressure on India, and the batting plan threw the game away in the first power play.
For once, only the fielding stood up to scrutiny.
Dissecting the failures
India’s target looked a stiff challenge, and Pakistan began in disastrous fashion. Being positive is good, but Pakistan were reckless, especially since they were losing wickets.
Saim Ayub was undone by a Jaspreet Bumrah pearler, but the rest of the top order hit like they were playing tape-ball cricket on the streets of Lahore, not in an ICC showcase event against India. It was a baffling and careless effort.
What adds salt to the wound is the fact that while India were competent in the field, they weren’t spectacular enough to deliver a 61-run thrashing.
The parade of irresponsibility was led by Salman Agha and Babar Azam, Pakistan’s most senior top order batsmen. When Pakistan needed at least one of them to stand and anchor the innings, neither was willing to embrace the mental application required from them. The easy option was to hit out, and get out.
Resistance came in the form of Usman Khan, but the pressure of losing early wickets — and the consequent impact on run rate — was too much. Usman’s rally was half-decent, at a time when something extraordinary was needed.
All eyes were on the toss for evidence of a reset in the rivalry. Would the captains shake hands, the standard etiquette of cricket? They didn’t. Normal service resumed. Salman and Suryakumar barely exchanged a glance.
The decision at the toss — to bowl first — looked a defensive one. What followed suggested that Pakistan had, once again, shrivelled to the occasion.
Suryakumar was happy to be invited to bat. But Salman followed this decision by bowling the first over himself. It was a good one on a turning track, with the wicket of Abhishek Sharma to boot.
That was as good as it got. Any genuine hopes lasted but one over. From that point on, Pakistan’s plan and senses unravelled.
Kishan VS the bowling
This was in large part due to the brilliance of Ishan Kishan. The small opener stood and delivered, rooted to the crease and striking powerfully. When he did dance down to the spinners, he moved decisively.
For the first half of the match, it was Kishan versus Pakistan, and Kishan won. On a day of batting mediocrity, he was a class apart. Pakistan’s bowlers didn’t help themselves. Shaheen Shah Afridi and Abrar Ahmed, arguably the spearheads of our attack, were poor. Shadab Khan was also off his game.

 

They bowled like a team going through the motions, barely adjusting to Kishan’s advance. If you can’t get the man while he’s on a rampage, the captain’s job is to get the rampager off strike.
But Pakistan were stuck in a groove of needless variation. The general problem was that having backed spin, Pakistan didn’t utilise it properly.
Bright sparks
The pitch was taking turn off a length, and when Pakistan chose to exploit it with more classical spin bowling, it worked. Usman Tariq kept this in mind as he reeled off his freeze frame variations to valuable effect.
Saim Ayub stuck to the disciplines best, though, bringing Pakistan back into the contest with Kishan’s wicket, followed immediately by Hardik Pandya’s. Pakistan’s impact player was suddenly on a hat trick. It was possibly game on.
The hat-trick ball that Saim produced was perhaps the ball of the innings. Shivam Dube might have been bowled, caught or stumped, but managed to avoid each of these catastrophes.
Still, Pakistan’s spinners pulled the game back, slowing a run rate of 9 an over to a mere 6-7 an over, until Afridi’s disastrous final offering allowed India to reach a formidable 175.
For the Pakistan fan, the main takeaway on Sunday is the relief that they are not out of the tournament, yet. But the team have much to learn if they are to challenge the stronger nations.
And even if Pakistan did not please their fans with their performance in Colombo, they at least did manage to placate Sri Lanka, India, and the ICC by honouring their tournament commitment.

TOP European government officials who led a smear campaign against United Nations special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, have failed to apologise or withdraw their calls for her resignation, even after multiple reports confirmed the allegations were based on a fabricated quote.
France 24 and Reuters verified that Albanese did not describe Israel as the “common enemy of humanity” during a forum in Qatar earlier this month, an allegation levelled by Israeli officials and echoed by European ministers.
Transcripts of the event show she was referring to a global system of finance and weaponry. Yet diplomats from France, Germany and other nations have so far declined to correct the record.
Amnesty International has demanded that European states immediately withdraw their accusations. Its secretary general, Agnès Callamard, said ministers in Austria, Czechia, France, Germany and Italy had attacked Albanese on the basis of a “deliberately truncated video” that gravely misrepresented her remarks.
“The ministers that have spread disinformation must act beyond merely deleting their comments on social media — as some have done,” Callamard said. “They must publicly apologise and retract any calls for Francesca Albanese’s resignation.”
She described the refusal to issue corrections as political cowardice, pointing to the stark contrast between the speed with which governments condemned a UN expert and their reluctance to hold Israel accountable for actions Amnesty has characterised as genocide and apartheid.
Meanwhile, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation added its voice to the chorus of condemnations. In a statement, the bloc said the allegations were “based on misrepresented and fabricated claims” regarding remarks the rapporteur neither made nor endorsed. The OIC warned that distorting the statements of UN mandate holders risked undermining the integrity of the Human Rights Council.
Albanese also responded to the diplomatic fallout directly. Addressing the controversy, she clarified that her speech in Doha had identified the “common enemy” as the system enabling violence, specifically “financial capital”, “algorithms” and “weapons”.
“A lie was exposed. Instead of retracting it, the SYSTEM that enabled the genocide, attacks the messenger,” Alban­ese wrote on X. “France knows it stepped in something foul, but pride forbids correction.”
She noted that three European governments had accused her with a “virulence” they never applied to the perpetrators of violence in Gaza, where the death toll has reportedly surpassed 72,000.







Legal complaint filed in Paris
Legal pressure is now mounting in France over the government’s refusal to correct its public statements. Middle East Eye reported that Jurdi, the Association of Lawyers for the Respect of International Law, had filed a crime report with the Paris public prosecutor accusing the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, of disseminating false information by a public authority.
Barrot told the French parliament that Albanese had made “outrageous and reprehensible remarks”, claiming she had targeted Israel as a nation.
Jurdi argues that because the verified transcript proves otherwise, the minister’s statement makes up a misrepresentation that could endanger the UN expert’s safety.
Support for Albanese also comes from the cultural sphere. According to AFP, over 100 figures from the entertainment industry — including actors Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon and Javier Bardem — have signed an open letter defending her work. The letter, organised by Artists for Palestine, said the rapporteur was being targeted for her defence of Palestinian rights.

TIRANA: Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama will travel to Washington next week to join the first meeting of US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace”, he told a podcast on Sunday.
“I will be in Washington for the official creation of the peace council and the launch of the activities of this council,” Rama said in an interview with Albanian podcast Flasim.
The board, of which Trump is the chairman, was originally intended to oversee the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip after two years of the Israel-Hamas war, but its charter appears to extend beyond the Palestinian territory.
The first meeting is scheduled to take place on February 19 in Washington.
Permanent members of the “Board of Peace” must pay $1 billion to join, leading to criticisms that the board could become a “pay-to-play” version of the UN Security Council.
Trump launched his “Board of Peace” at the WEF in January, and at least 19 countries have signed its founding charter.
Some countries — including Croatia, France, New Zealand and Norway — have already declined to join it, and others have said they could only consider doing so if its charter were changed.
Rama has previously said his country would not pay to be permanent members of the initiative.
“Albania has the privilege of being a founding state, and it will not contribute financially to join or remain as a permanent member,” Rama said on Sunday.
Romanian President Nicusor Dan also announced on Sunday that he would attend as observer the first meeting of US president’s “Board of Peace”.
“Next week I will take part in the first meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, responding to the invitation addressed by the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump,” Dan wrote on X.
“Romania will have observer status and I will reaffirm our strong support for international peace efforts and our willingness to participate in the reconstruction process in the Gaza Strip,” Dan added on X on Sunday.







Netanyahu won’t attend
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not attend next week’s Gaza Board of Peace summit in Washington, with Foreign Min­ister Gideon Saar set to represent the country instead, officials said.
The statement was issued as Neta­nyahu departed for the US, where he met Trump and signed on as a “Board of Peace” member.
Italy will also participate as an observer in the “Board of Peace”, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni confirmed on Sunday, Anadolu reported.
Speaking in an interview with Italian daily Corriere della Sera, Meloni said Italy had received an invitation to attend in observer status and would respond positively.
She noted that constitutional constraints prevent Italy from formally joining the body.
Meanwhile, Trump asked Hamas to move forward with disarmament under his plan for post-war Gaza, and said peace board members pledged $5bn to the Palestinian territory’s reconstruction. “Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarisation,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, ahead of a Feb 19 meeting of the board in Washington.
He added that member states of the “Board of Peace” had “committed thousands of personnel” to join the International Stabilisation Force.

In a late-night announcement, the petroleum division said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to the announcement, the ex-depot price of HSD has been increased by Rs7.32 per litre (2.7pc) to Rs275.70 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs268.38 per litre. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
The ex-depot petrol price was increased to Rs258.17 from Rs253.17 per litre, up 2pc. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
The government is currently charging about Rs105 per litre on petrol and about Rs97 per litre on diesel. Although, general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, yet the government is charging petroleum levy at the rate of Rs79 per litre on diesel and Rs87 per litre on petrol and other high octane products. This also includes Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs17-18 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly average sales of about 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene. The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through petroleum levy alone in FY2025 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during current fiscal year.

JERUSALEM: The Israeli government has approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property”, for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of the international law that states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories, Al Jazeera reported.
The development was annou­nced by Israeli public broadcaster KAN on Sunday when Israeli forces killed at least 12 Palest­inians in less than 24 hours, according to Gaza’s civil defence agency.
The proposal, approved by the Israel security cabinet, was submitted by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defence Minister Israel Katz. “We are continuing the settlement revolution to control all our lands,” Smotrich said.
The Palestinian Presidency slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, Wafa news agency reported.
Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership. International law states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
However, Katz described the move as an “essential security and governance measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for the state of Israel in the area”, the Jerusalem Post stated.
Palestinian group Hamas condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.
In a statement, the group called the approval “a null and void decision issued by an illegitimate occupying power. It is an attempt to forcibly impose settlement and Judaisation on the ground, in flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions.”
De facto annexation
Analysts describe the move as a de facto annexation of the Palestinian territory, warning that it will profoundly reshape its civil and legal landscape by eliminating what the Israeli ministers cal­led longstanding “legal obstacles” to the expansion of illegal settlements there.
Speaking from Ramallah, political analyst Xavier Abu Eid told Al Jazeera that Israel is “packing annexation into some sort of a bureaucratic move”. He said the International Court of Justice in 2024 said that Israeli actions amount to annexation of the occupied West Bank.

 

“People should understand this is not just a step towards annexation, we are experiencing annexation as we speak today.
What the Israeli government is doing is implanting their political programme — a policy that has already been presented,” he said.
Strikes amid ceasefire
In multiple strikes since dawn on Sun­day, Israeli forces killed at least 12 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency reported.
Despite a US-brokered truce that entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the Palestinian territory, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement.
The civil defence agency said five people were killed and several injured in the attack on a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia, five others were killed and several injured in a separate early morning strike in the southern city of Khan Yunis, and another Palestinian was killed in Israeli shelling in Gaza City. Besides, Israeli gunfire killed one person in Beit Lahia in north Gaza, it added.
“Israel doesn’t understand ceasefires or truces,” said Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabalia attack.
He said the people were killed as they slept. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 601 Palestinians have been killed since the truce began, while Israel claimed at least four of its soldiers were killed in the same period.

WASHINGTON: After Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir discussed “global and regional security dynamics” with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a senior US diplomat has highlighted Pakistan’s key role in Washington’s global strategy.
US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz highlighted Pakistan’s role in Washington’s global and regional diplomacy.
“We could walk around the world — Kashmir and India and Pakistan — where we faced a very serious nuclear escalation,” he said during the Munich Security Conference, underlining enduring US concerns about strategic stability in South Asia.
Ambassador Waltz also linked Pakistan to multilateral diplomacy. “The United Nations Security Council created the ‘Board of Peace’ — unanimously — with countries such as Pakistan, our friends in the UK, France and others,” he said.
He further highlighted Islamabad’s role in Washington’s engagement with Muslim-majority nations. “…having our goal of a network of friends — Muslim-majority nations such as Turkiye, Pakistan and Indonesia involved,” he said.
In another reference to regional coordination, he added: “…the President [Donald Trump] convened the countries of the region and the Muslim-majority nations, namely Pakistan, Turkiye and Indonesia.”
Earlier, during their meeting, Field Marshal Munir and Secretary Rubio focused on “matters of mutual interest, including global and regional security dynamics and counterterrorism cooperation”, said a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where Field Marshal Munir also engaged with European and international military leaders to discuss pressing security challenges.
In his talks with German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, the Chancellor’s foreign and security policy adviser Gunter Sautter, and Chief of Defence Carsten Breuer, Field Marshal Munir discussed contemporary security threats, bilateral defence cooperation, and the need to promote global peace and security through multilateral dialogue.
The CDF also held talks with Renato Rodrigues de Aguiar Freire, chief of the joint staff of the Brazilian Armed Forces, and Rodolph Haykal, commander of the Lebanese Armed Forces, focusing on measures to enhance bilateral defence collaboration and address regional security challenges.
According to the ISPR, the visit and accompanying engagements were aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s defence ties and expanding cooperation with partner countries on key security issues.

The PTI activists have blocked Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway.
Protesters remained present all the time at exit and entry points and did not allow a single vehicle to enter the province, causing serious problems to passengers and motorists destined to Islamabad and other parts of the country.
Former governor Shah Farman, PTI Peshawar district president Irfan Saleem, deputy secretary information Ikram Khattana and other leaders of the party were present at Khairabad Bridge, connecting Attock district of Punjab with KP.

Commuters, motorists face hardships

Protesters have been demanding of the government to shift PTI founder Imran Khan from jail to hospital for treatment of his eye by doctors of his choice.
Speaking on the occasion, Shah Farman said that under Article-4 of the Constitution, no authority could deny treatment of his choice to a patient. He said that the people, who were not allowing treatment of Imran Khan through doctors of his choice, would be responsible if his eye was further damaged.
PTI workers blocked Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway near Swabi Interchange to all types of traffic, vowing to stay on roads till Imran Khan was shifted to hospital for medical treatment.
Vendors were seen selling various eatables while setting up stalls on motorway, converting it into a market. PTI Swabi general secretary Afsar Khan told journalists that they were not ready to go back homes under any circumstances.
“We will continue to sit here and if our demand is not accepted. This protest will continue. The federal government is responsible for the prevailing mess in the country,” he said.
Stranded commuters said that government should take action against PTI workers to open the motorway to traffic because people, especially patients, were facing difficulties.
“Where should we go, who should we beg, who should we ask and who should we request to open the motorway,” questioned Shahzad Khan, a resident of Peshawar.
Uzair Khan, a resident of Gundam who was seriously injured in a firing incident on Saturday, was not allowed to reach a hospital in Peshawar through motorway. The circumstances forced his family to pass through Swabi and Mardan but he did not reach hospital and passed away.
His relatives said that PTI workers were responsible for his death. During the last three days, it has been observed, that there is no rush at daytime at the venue of protest. In the afternoon youth start to arrive at rest area and in the evening there is a lot of crowd on motorway.
PTI workers blocked roads at four key points in Dera Ismail Khan district on Sunday, suspending traffic and causing inconvenience to commuters and motorists.
The sit-ins were held on Bhakkar Road, Multan Road, Chashma Road and CPEC route, bringing vehicular movement to a standstill at these locations. As a result, long queues of vehicles were seen on major arteries.
Witnesses said that several commuters remained stranded for hours, while alternative routes also experienced heavy congestion due to diverted traffic. The protest is being held on the call of PTI central leaders, who have urged workers to demonstrate over the deteriorating health of Imran Khan and demand his immediate release.
The district administration was monitoring the situation while residents called for restoration of traffic flow to ease their hardships.
PTI activists continued protest demonstrations in Lakki Marwat and Karak districts on the second consecutive day on Sunday.
A good number of party workers led by former district nazim Ishfaq Ahmad Khan Minakhel gathered at Darra Tang Point where they closed Bannu-Mianwali road, linking KP with Punjab and Islamabad via CPEC route.
The closure of road on the second consecutive day troubled transporters and commuters as passenger and good transport vehicles queued up on both sides of the main artery.
On the occasion, the former district nazim said that denial of access to healthcare and maltreatment by federal government had led to loss of Imran’s vision. He said that PTI activists had come on roads to hold peaceful protests against the PML-N government, which was responsible for the poor health of their party leader.
In Karak, the PTI workers gathered outside Nashapa oil and gas field and staged a sit-in there. They stopped supply from the oil and gas field as oil tankers could not enter or come out of the area.
An official of district administration confirmed disruption of oil supply from the field. PTI district president Inayat Khattak said that leaders and workers of the party decided in a meeting to shut down oil and gas fields in Makori, Nashapa and Gurguri to record their protest against non-provision of treatment facilities to Imran Khan.

With the win against Pakistan, India made it to the Super Eight. Pakistan, however, will have to beat Namibia in their last group-stage match on February 18 to qualify for the next round.
After the match, criticism of the national team’s performance flooded social media, coming from former players and cricketing icons.
Former Pakistan player and commentator Ramiz Raja called the match “a bit of a disaster — especially batting”.
“India have been fielding [the] same bowling attack against Pakistan since last two or three years, and every time [the] batsmen have been woefully ordinary,” he said in a post on X, adding that there was no growth.







Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain Mohammad Yousuf took aim at Shaheen Shah Afridi, Babar Azam and Shadab Khan, saying that “time’s up” for them.
“Pakistan’s T20 squad needs new performers, not empty wins against weaker sides,” he said.







Former opener Ahmed Shahzad called Pakistan’s performance “pathetic cricket” and said it was the “sad story of Pakistan cricket. Same old faces, same old results. Please don’t fool the nation anymore.”
However, he noted that there was still time to bring in some positive change by bringing in Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Nafay and Salman Mirza.
“They should be playing,” he added.







Pakistan player Sohaib Maqsood criticised Pakistan’s bowling, calling it “by far the reason for today’s defeat”.
“It’s not a 180 [run] pitch, even 140 could have been tough to chase on this pitch,” Maqsood said on X.
He added that Pakistan prepared on similar pitches against Australia at home before [the] World Cup, noting that “Agha won all the tosses and batted first. Why [choose] to bowl first today?”







Former England captain Michael Vaughan opined that India “seem to intimidate Pakistan on the cricket field”.
“They (India) are so much better in all facets of the game and [have] such a better mentality of coping with the huge occasion,” he said.







Indian commentator Harsha Bhogle stated that Pakistan’s cricket administration put far too much pressure on the team.
“You could see that in how tentative they were,” he wrote on X.








Sports presenter and television host Zainab Abbas said the game was turning out to be a “one-sided affair” & “really indicative” of the gap between the two sides over the years.







“That said, Pakistan did not even come close to playing to its potential, bowled poorly & batted recklessly,” she continued.
In her X post, she said, “The ones Pakistan have backed and relied on in bilaterals have put up a poor show in tournaments & not for the first time.”
Former Indian batter Sachin Tendulkar said that the powerplay was where India took the game away from Pakistan.







In his X post, the Indian batting icon said, “Ishan Kishan in the first innings, and the clinical bowling we saw in the second innings, made all the difference.”
“We were always in the driver’s seat. India rocked it tonight!” he hailed.</p><small>2026-02-15 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15220328ce1aa52.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973479/man-arrested-for-attacking-engineer-muhammad-ali-mirza-in-jhelum-police' target='_blank'><strong>Man arrested for attacking Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza in Jhelum: police</strong></a><br><p>JHELUM: A man was arrested on Sunday after he reportedly attacked cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza, the police said.
Per a first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn, the incident took place in Jhelum at Mirza’s Qur’an-o-Sunnat Research Academy at the end of a lecture.
According to the complainant Muhammad Kashif Qureshi, a core member of the academy, attendees were returning home after listening to the lecture, but some of them stayed back to take selfies with Engineer Mirza.
“Just then, a man attacked Engineer Mirza by grabbing his collar, throwing punches at him, and removing his turban,” the FIR quoted Qureshi as saying.
“He violently threw his honourable turban onto the ground, strangled him with both hands to suffocate him, and loudly chanted slogans,” he added.
Qureshi was quoted as saying that people present at the site of the incident intervened immediately to protect the scholar.
“We then handed him over to the police on duty to ensure that legal action is taken against the criminal,” he said in his complaint.
District Police Officer (DPO) Jhelum Tariq Aziz Sindhu, while talking to Dawn, said that the police have arrested the alleged attacker and the FIR was filed against him under section 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“Further investigations about the background of the attacker are underway,” DPO Sindhu added.
The DPO said that a four-tier security of police had been deployed at Mirza’s academy, adding that the police had repeatedly warned him to avoid taking selfies with the strangers entering as audience at his sessions.
The officer added that the scholar had previously been attacked too and was taken into the police’s protective custody last year under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) by Jhelum’s deputy commissioner after an activist of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) accused him of blasphemy and registered a case against him. He was later released on bail.
Section 3 of the MPO ordinance gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected persons to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order.
Mirza, a resident of Machine Mohallah of Jhelum city, frequently uploads his lectures and speeches on his social media accounts and has amassed 3.1 million followers on his YouTube channel.
In 2024, he was among 17 clerics whose speeches were banned by then-Jhelum DC during Muharram to prevent any potential sectarian violence.
The popular cleric survived an assassination attempt at a religious academy in March 2021. The suspect was taken into custody, and a case of attempted murder was registered against him.
The cleric had also been booked and arrested by the Jhelum police in May 2020 for derogatory remarks against some religious figures. However, he was later released on bail.</p><small>2026-02-15 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/152314008f70121.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973485/bold-calls-soft-results-5-takeaways-from-pakistans-loss-to-india' target='_blank'><strong>Bold calls, soft results: 5 takeaways from Pakistan’s loss to India</strong></a><br><p>There are nights when Pakistan versus India feels like theatre: breathless, chaotic, hanging by a thread. And then there are nights like the one in Colombo.
At the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, this was not a last-over classic or a heart-stopping choke. It was clinical. India posted 175, Pakistan were rolled for 114. A 61-run defeat. No controversy to dissect, no umpiring debate to hide behind, no “if only” moments to cling to.
Just a gulf.
Here are five takeaways from a game that was disappointingly straightforward.
Agha’s captaincy: bold or baffling?
Salman Ali Agha did not hide behind convention and that alone deserves akcnowledgement.
He decided to chase on a slow Colombo surface that was expected to grip more under lights. Bold. He opened the bowling himself and dismissed Abhishek Sharma for a duck - poetic, especially after publicly stating he wanted the Indian opener to play. He even promoted himself to bat at no.3 earlier in the tournament, leading by example.
But bold decisions are a double-edged sword. On a wicket likely to slow further, bowling first was always going to be a gamble. When India reached 175, that decision loomed large. Tactically, there were lapses in his usage of bowlers like introducing Usman Tariq later than ideal, despite his mystery element and control, and repeatedly feeding leg-spin - Abrar, Shadab and Saim - to left-handers Ishan Kishan and Tilak Varma.
Then came Agha the batter. After Pakistan collected 13 runs off a Jasprit Bumrah over, including a boundary that briefly unsettled India’s premier pacer, he gifted his wicket away. That was reckless. If you take on Bumrah and win the round, you don’t throw the next punch blindfolded.
Shaheen Afridi: Living on past headlines
There was a time when Shaheen Shah Afridi against India felt like an event within the event. Headlines once screamed, “They cannot play him”. Now, they comfortably do.
Since returning from injury, Shaheen has looked diminished; lower pace, inconsistent lengths, and less bite. In seven T20Is against India, he now has six wickets at an average that hardly intimidates. In Colombo, he conceded 31 runs in just two overs before collecting a consolation wicket.
Ishan Kishan took 15 off his first over and flipped momentum instantly. Meanwhile, Salman Mirza - 22 wickets in 14 T20Is and three in Pakistan’s opening World Cup game watched from the sidelines. Naseem Shah’s record against India is statistically superior. Yet reputation trumped form.
Pakistan cricket has a habit of clinging to narratives. The “eagle” narrative once fit. Right now, the numbers don’t.
The Ishan Kishan gulf
Pakistan’s batting and Ishan Kishan existed in parallel universes tonight.
Kishan’s 77 off 40 balls was not just an innings; it was a statement. A fifty off 27 deliveries. Authority against pace and spin alike. He dismantled Abrar’s mystery with 11 in his first over and treated Shadab’s leg-spin as a warm-up drill, plundering 17 in one. By the time Saim Ayub removed him, India were 88/2 in 8.4 overs, scoring at over ten an over. The game was effectively sealed.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s top order evaporated inside two overs. No scoreboard pressure. No scoreboard at all.
Usman Khan’s 44 off 34 offered some resistance, but in the context of 175, it was insufficient. When your second-highest scorer is your No. 10, the problem is not tempo, it is structure. Babar Azam had the perfect chance to anchor and remind the world why he’s elite but he faded quietly despite earlier form in the tournament.
Pakistan, at one time, was struggling to reach 100, let alone threaten 175. Embarrassing, particularly given they had no travel fatigue and were arguably more familiar with Colombo conditions than India, something Agha himself highlighted during the toss.
India bowled in units, Pakistan bowled in episodes
India’s bowling card tells a story of balance: Hardik’s variations, Axar’s control, Bumrah’s precision and Varun’s mystery, all getting two wickets apiece. No overindulgence, no panic, just pressure applied in layers.
Pakistan’s bowling, by contrast, operated in fragments. Saim Ayub and Nawaz built pressure in spells while Usman Tariq provided control but the expensive overs in the first half of the innings allowed India to surge. The trio in particular, Shaheen, Abrar and Shadab, leaked 86 runs in six overs; nearly half of India’s 175.
T20 cricket thrives on partnerships, both with bat and ball. India functioned as a unit. Pakistan swung between moments of discipline and stretches of leakage.
When one bowler tightened, the next released. When one batter resisted, the rest retreated.
Spirit of Cricket - 404 Error
India once again avoided the toss and post-match handshake with their Pakistani counterparts. In a fixture marketed as cricket’s grandest rivalry, the absence of basic sportsmanship is jarring. You can compete fiercely, you can carry political baggage, but refusing a handshake after sharing a field for three hours feels petty, not powerful.
Cricket loves preaching the “spirit of game” yet, when it comes to this clash, that spirit has gone missing for a while now. Players are not policymakers; they are professionals. And professionals acknowledge each other.
The irony remains that this contest is the financial engine of the International Cricket Council ecosystem as broadcast numbers soar, sponsorships inflate, and global attention spikes. So, if the sport can monetise the rivalry so comfortably, surely it can insist on preserving its dignity too.

“The prime minister and the Pakistani delegation were warmly welcomed upon arrival at the Vienna International Airport, and a contingent of the Austrian Armed Forces presented a salute,” the statement read.







PM Shehbaz announced his arrival in Vienna in a post on X, calling it a “city of history, culture and global diplomacy”.
“I look forward to my meeting with Chancellor Christian Stocker to further strengthen the bonds of friendship between Pakistan and Austria,” the premier said, adding that their focus would be trade, investment and economic cooperation.
He added that he was keen to meet the leadership of the International Atomic Energy Agency, (IAEA) the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the UN Industrial Development Organisation during his visit.
PM Shehbaz said that these engagements aimed to “deepen our cooperation in peaceful nuclear energy, counter-narcotics and crime control, [and] sustainable industrial development and shared progress”.







Earlier in the day, the Foreign Office said the premier was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and one of his aides, Tariq Fatemi.
The government’s official X account shared a video earlier in the day of the premier and his delegation departing for Vienna from PAF Base Lahore.
In its statement, the Foreign Office (FO) noted that the trip marked “the first visit by a Pakistani prime minister to Austria in over three decades, the last having been undertaken by the then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1992”.
PM Shehbaz is undertaking the visit at the invitation of the Austrian chancellor.
The two leaders will hold bilateral meetings at the Federal Chancellery in Vienna and “co-chair a meeting of prominent business leaders aimed at enhancing the volume of investment between the two countries”, the government post said.







“The prime minister’s official visit to Austria will add new dimensions to the bilateral relations between the two countries,” the statement added.
The premier will also attend and address the Pakistan-Austria Business Forum, which will be organised by the Austrian Economic Chamber (WKO).
Additionally, during the two-day visit, PM Shehbaz is also expected to meet IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi.
In September 2025, Grossi acknowledged the country’s steady progress and close cooperation with the agency, observing that Pakis­tan’s nuclear power programme was advancing “at a good pace”.
PM Shehbaz will also address a United Nations event on the theme of ‘Sustainable Development: The Path to Global Peace and Prosperity’.
The visit marks 70 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the FO noted in its press release.







It added that the two leaders “will take stock of the entire gamut of bilateral relations”.
“Pakistan and Austria enjoy cordial and friendly relations, underpinned by shared values of dialogue, cooperation, an international order based on the principles of the UN Charter, multilateralism, and respect for international law,” FO said.</p><small>2026-02-15 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15212355f24dcfd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973471/former-us-president-obama-says-aliens-are-real-report' target='_blank'><strong>Former US president Obama says ‘aliens are real’: report</strong></a><br><p>Former United States president Barack Obama has said during an interview that “aliens are real”, Time magazine reported on Sunday.
Citing an interview of Obama by podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen, the report stated that when asked about the existence of extraterrestrial life, the former president responded: “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them.
“They’re not being kept at Area 51. There’s no underground facility — unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States,” Obama jokingly added.







Time reported that Cohen “did not ask a follow-up question on the topic”.
Obama has been known for having a sense of humour, as seen in White House Correspondents’ Dinner ceremonies during his presidency.
The report added that Obama spoke out about the deployment of thousands of immigration agents to Minnesota, condemning what he deemed “rogue behaviour” on the part of the federal government.
“Obama compared the actions of the Trump Administration in Minnesota to behaviour that ‘we’ve seen in authoritarian countries and we’ve seen in dictatorships, but we have not seen in America’,” Time reported.
The former president was quoted as saying that recognising the unprecedented nature of federal agents’ activities in the city of Minneapolis and their actions, including “pulling people out of their homes [and] using five-year-olds to try to bait their parents”.
“So the rogue behaviour of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous, but we should take a moment to appreciate the extraordinary outpouring of organising, community building [and] decency,” Obama said.</p><small>2026-02-15 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/152155328fb5915.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973428/pakistan-mother-languages-festival-climate-cultural-identity' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Mother Languages Festival highlights link between climate change and cultural identity</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: ‘When the river dries, our cultural imagination dries with it,’ remarked one of the speakers as a panel on Folk Literature and Climate Change session, which turned into an urgent call to reconnect language and land for survival on the third day of the Pakistan Mother Languages Festival 2026 held at Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) on Sunday.
The talk, moderated by Ghina Mehr, brought together poets, academics, activists and journalists who argued that the climate crisis is not merely an environmental or technical issue, but a cultural and civilisational one.

“In our folk tradition, the river, soil and land are not just a backdrop; they are the main protagonists,” Mehr said at the outset, asking whether climate change was only “a matter of files” or fundamentally “a matter of culture and land.”
Opening the discussion, climate activist and performer Abuzar Madhu invoked the verse of Guru Nanak, translated as “Air is the Guru (teacher), Water is the Father, and the Great Earth is the Mother“. This verse establishes a deep ecological and spiritual connection to underline the sacred relationship between humans and nature embedded in regional traditions.
Tracing stories of the Ravi from mythology to folklore, Nadhu said rivers were once understood as living beings shaping identity. “We have lived with the river for thousands of years. Our stories narrate its bends, its moods, its journey from mountains to the sea”.

Yet Madhu warned that as rivers shrink and change course, so too does collective imagination, criticising what he described as a “colonial lens” through which rivers and land are studied. “If language survives, the story survives,” he stressed.
Sindhi poet Javed Soz admitted that while folk poetry has historically resisted political oppression, its engagement with climate change remains uneven. “In Sindh, poetry has always taken the side of the river and the land,” he said,
He pointed out that biodiversity, once central to folk poetry, is gradually fading from contemporary literary discourse. While poetry reacts to disasters, it must develop a sustained engagement with climate realities.
Soz emphasised that literature has an important role in bringing about change, adding that new modes of communication, especially social media, must be used to carry climate narratives to younger audiences.
Seraiki scholar Dr Ismatullah Shah linked climate change directly to lived realities in riverine and desert regions. Sharing verses and proverbs from Seraiki folklore, he illustrated how seasonal cycles and migratory birds are incorporated into lullabies and rituals.

“Our entire folk literature is connected to the environment; rivers do not die, but civilisations do,” he remarked.
Dr Ismail Kumbhar, an academic whose work particularly focuses on water resources and sustainable development, emphasised that climate change is not only environmental but existential.
He explained the difference between weather and climate, describing that climate refers to long-term shifts in patterns that directly affect agriculture, food security and social stability.
From seed germination to harvest cycles, he said, farming depends on precise temperature and water conditions. Floods in 2010 and 2022 had already exposed vulnerabilities, and further temperature rise could devastate the agro-ecological base of the country.
“When fertility declines, when drainage fails, when certified seed is unavailable, it is not only crops that suffer, but human life and social systems suffer,” he stressed.
Journalist and Researcher Aliza Khalid called for a fundamental shift in reporting and also cautioned against commodifying indigenous knowledge “Nature can exist without humans. We must decide whether we want to exist within nature’s system,” she expressed.
Concluding the discussion, speakers collectively stressed that climate change must be addressed not only through policy but through cultural revival by restoring indigenous languages and strengthening folk traditions.
The debate highlighted a central message of the festival that saving rivers and land may require first saving the stories that give them meaning.

In a post on Truth Social, the US president said he would announce this development when the Board meets in Washington on February 19 at the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace.
“We will announce that member states have pledged more than $5 billion dollars toward the Gaza humanitarian and reconstruction efforts, and have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilisation Force and local police to maintain security and peace for Gazans.” Trump wrote.
He also stated that Hamas must uphold its “commitment to full and immediate demilitarisation”.
“The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History, and it is my honour to serve as its Chairman,” Trump wrote.



Earlier this week, Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi confirmed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting in the US, adding that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would also accompany him.
“I can confirm that the prime minister will attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting. He will be accompanied by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” Andrabi said during a weekly briefing of the FO.
He added that information about other members of Pakistan’s delegation and its engagements would be shared in due course of time.
The board was initially proposed in September 2025 and formally established last month. Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository and Trump has designated the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the Board’s headquarters.
A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November last year authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza following a ceasefire that began in October under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas.
However, the ceasefire has remained fragile, with repeated violations by Israel.
Under Trump’s Gaza plan unveiled late last year, the Board of Peace was originally intended to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance following a ceasefire, before being expanded to address global conflicts.</p><small>2026-02-15 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1518311533c8d81.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973372/medical-team-leaves-adiala-jail-after-examining-imran-khan-pti-rejects-inspection' target='_blank'><strong>Medical team leaves Adiala Jail after examining Imran Khan, PTI rejects inspection</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A team of doctors examined PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail on Sunday and left the premises after around an hour, sources said, as the party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”.
On February 12, Imran, currently incarcerated at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, claimed that his right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, following which the Supreme Court (SC) ordered the formation of a medical team to examine him. The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday).
Although government figures on Saturday had hinted that Imran would soon be taken to a hospital, no such development had occurred till Sunday afternoon.
At 3:45pm, however, Imran’s sister Noreen Khanum said on X that an “ambulance has reached Adiala jail to move Khan sahib to a hospital”.







“But, this is unacceptable to us without us and Khan sahib’s personal doctors being taken into confidence,” she added.
According to sources, Adiala’s jail superintendent, however, dismissed the development as a “rumour”, saying that Imran was only being examined and not being taken anywhere yet.
“The medical team will examine Imran’s eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the jail superintendent was quoted as saying by the sources.
At about 5:30pm, sources said that the eye examination, carried out by a team of five doctors, was completed. “A detailed eye examination and blood sampling were carried out, while his blood pressure was also checked,” they said.
“Senior doctors continued the medical examination for an hour,” they said, adding that the medical team was able to start the examination after waiting for two-and-a-half hours.
They said that the team brought eye examination equipment with them and that their report is “likely to be compiled soon”.
Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
On the other hand, shortly after the eye examination was completed, the PTI refused to accept the inspection, saying that without the presence of the PTI family and Imran’s personal doctors, the government’s stance was “deemed malicious”.
“Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan’s eye in Adiala Jail. The government’s claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the PTI said in a post on X.







“This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership. In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan’s family.
“And the family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan’s personal doctors are present during the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification.”
Aleema demands Imran’s treatment as per personal doctors’ advice
Earlier in the day, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said the party would not accept any medical board formed without the approval of the PTI founder’s personal doctors.
Aleema referred to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry’s post from Saturday, which announced that a medical board would be set up. She added, “Secondly, we are hearing in the news that Imran Khan is to be taken to Al Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi.

 

“Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment WITHOUT the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.”
The former prime minister’s sister affirmed: “We do NOT accept any medical board they set up and control! We do NOT accept any reports or results they manufacture.”
She added that the family was “extremely worried as to why they are resisting the selection of specialists advised” by Imran’s personal doctors.
“Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan’s personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan’s family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?” Aleema wondered.







Earlier on Sunday, Imran’s longtime personal physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, issued a joint video statement, reiterating that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad.
“In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad,” read the post accompanying their statement.








‘Will continue sit-in to pressure govt’
Meanwhile, the sit-in by the main opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) at Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health entered its third day on Sunday.
The alliance had announced staging the sit-in until the ex-premier was taken to a hospital of his personal doctors’ choice.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday afternoon, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital.
“We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party.
“We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. Moreover, we have also decided to approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Monday to get justice and the right to medical treatment for Imran,” he told Dawn.
He said that the government representatives, throughout the day on Sunday, remained in contact with the PTI and TTAP leadership but could not give a proper response that the demands had been approved.
TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, while talking to Dawn, said that the sit-ins were being held at all three places, i.e. in the Parliament house, outside the Parliament lodges and at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, where the KP chief minister has been staging a sit-in.
“It is unfortunate that even water and food are not being allowed to reach the Parliament House. We have been eating dates and biscuits. Mineral water has been consumed, so now parliamentarians have been drinking tap water,” he claimed.
Yousafzai said that the strikes will be continued till the outcome. “History is in the making”, he said.
Earlier in the day, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan shared visuals of himself, TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Qaiser and Senator Faisal Javed, among others, sitting at Parliament House.







A TTAP leader, wishing not to be named, told Dawn that things have become more confusing rather than being streamlined.
“Last night we were informed that Imran Khan will be shifted to Shifa International Hospital [in Islamabad], but a demand was made that doctors in the medical board be changed, as including doctors of our choice will give a message that the government has gone on the back foot.
“[Therefore,] we decided to show flexibility and gave names of a few more doctors, and there was an understanding that we will not reveal their names in the media,” the TTAP leader said.
He added: “However, today we have been getting messages that first we should call off the sit-in and then Imran Khan will be shifted to the hospital and a medical board will be announced. How can we call off the sit-in without implementation of our demands?” he asked.
Replying to a question, the leader said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi — who is staging a sit-in at KP House in the capital — also contacted government representatives to make it clear that the situation could go out of his control if the issue was not resolved soon.
He added that the government representatives told them that the interior minister was in Sri Lanka, while the National Assembly and Senate chairs were also abroad, making it “difficult to decide” for the authorities.







In the evening, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) issued a statement, saying that Allama Nasir Abbas was in bad health and that a delegation of parliamentarians had arrived at Parliament House to deliver food to TTAP lawmakers.“Delivering food to parliamentarians is not allowed,” he said. “Female members are also inside, concern has grown.”He added that the delegation was at the door but was not allowed to enter the premises.“An atmosphere of fascism and oppression has been imposed on the country … The public mandate is being insulted,” Abbas added. “The leadership of the party that won 180 seats is in jail … it is unjust to give power to those with fewer seats.”
‘Inhumane, blatant violation of constitutional values’
Earlier, the TTAP said today was the “third consecutive day that access to food, water, and medicines has been blocked for the protesters encamped inside Parliament House”.
“This action is not only inhumane but a blatant violation of fundamental democratic and constitutional values,” it added.
The alliance further alleged that access to medicines was blocked for Senator Abbas, terming it an “extreme and condemnable act”.
“Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression,” the statement read.
The TTAP stated that its leadership was firm on its demands, adding: “History bears witness that yazidi (tyrannical) tricks, sieges and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands. Such tactics only add to the record of cruelty; they cannot silence the voice of truth.”
The TTAP reiterated its “clear demand” that Imran be provided full medical facilities at Islamabad’s Al-Shifa International Hospital, emphasising that providing quality medical facilities to a prisoner was the state’s responsibility, “not a favour”.
The alliance vowed that it would not be “cowed by tactics of oppression, coercion and siege”.







HRCP calls for ‘uninterrupted access’ to treatment
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed “grave concern over reports regarding the deteriorating health of prisoners affiliated with the PTI, particularly” Imran and former Punjab health minister Yasmin Rashid.
In a statement, the HRCP urged the interior ministry, the Punjab Home Department and the relevant prison authorities to ensure that “all such inmates are allowed immediate, independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to prescribed treatment”.
“Their condition must be verified with transparency,” the rights body stressed.
It pointed out: “Denial or delay of adequate healthcare to any detainee violates legal and constitutional guarantees, including under the Prison Rules, as well as Pakistan’s human rights obligations.”







Awaam Pakistan leader Dr Zafar Mirza, noting the government’s assurances and the development of Imran speaking to his sons on phone, said: “The last two days have proven the power of non-violent peaceful protest, as it has before many times in human history.
“Decision to let Imran Khan speak with his sons, move him to hospital, establishment of a medical board, all this has not happened in a vacuum and for nothing.”
However, Dr Mirza stressed that the former premier “still needs access to a personal physician, family, and his cases also need to be heard without politically motivated delays”.
“Awaam Pakistan is fully supporting the dharna (sit-in) as we are standing with the moral principle of human right to health care, and we are standing on the right side of history,” he affirmed.

According to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), the first day of Ramazan is “likely to fall” on February 19, 2026. However, the final announcement regarding the beginning of the Islamic holy month will be made by the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, the sole competent authority, based on credible witness testimonies from across the country.
“Exploiting citizens in this sacred month will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” the provincial chief executive said in a post on X.
She added that directives and enforcement measures would be outlined in a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning (Monday).







The Punjab Food Safety and Consumer Protection department (FS&CP), earlier this week, instructed the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera) force to ensure the availability of food items at officially notified prices across Punjab during Ramazan.
Chairing a departmental meeting regarding prices of essential commodities during Ramazan on Monday, FS&CP Special Assistant Salma Butt said the department had completed all preparations ahead of the holy month.
She said the Pera force should take strict legal action against those found involved in overcharging.
Additionally, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced a Rs38 billion Ramazan Relief Package a day prior, which will be disbursed among deserving people across the four provinces as well as the people of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
“Rs38bn will be disbursed through digital bank accounts among 12.1 million families, without discrimination,” said the premier while addressing the ceremony of the PM Ramazan Package 2026.</p><small>2026-02-15 15:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15130853fb89642.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973374/iran-says-potential-energy-mining-and-aircraft-deals-on-table-in-talks-with-us' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says potential energy, mining and aircraft deals on table in talks with US</strong></a><br><p>Iran is pursuing a nuclear agreement with the United States that delivers economic benefits for both sides, an Iranian diplomat was reported as saying on Sunday, days before a second round of talks between Tehran and Washington.
Iran and the US renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation.
The US has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.
“For the sake of an agreement’s durability, it is essential that the US also benefits in areas with high and quick economic returns,” foreign ministry deputy director for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.
Iran has threatened retaliation against any US attack, but the official struck a conciliatory note on Sunday.
“Common interests in the oil and gas fields, joint fields, mining investments, and even aircraft purchases are included in the negotiations,” Ghanbari said, arguing that the 2015 nuclear pact with world powers had not secured US economic interests.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at a news conference in Bratislava, said President Donald Trump had made it clear that he would prefer diplomacy and a negotiated settlement.
“No one’s ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran, but we’re going to try,” Rubio said.







In 2018, Trump withdrew the US from the pact that had eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, and re-applied tough economic sanctions on Tehran.
On Friday, a source told Reuters that a US delegation, including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, would meet Iranian officials in Geneva on Tuesday, a meeting later confirmed to Reuters by a senior Iranian official on Sunday.
“Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be travelling, I think they are travelling right now, to have important meetings and we’ll see how that turns out,” Rubio said, without providing further details.
While talks leading to the 2015 nuclear pact were multilateral, the current negotiations are confined to Iran and the United States, with Oman acting as mediator.
Open to compromise
Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signalled Iran’s readiness to compromise on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, telling the BBC on Sunday that the ball was “in America’s court to prove that they want to do a deal”.
The senior official referred to the Iranian atomic chief’s statement on Monday that the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions as an example of Iran’s flexibility.
However, he reiterated that Tehran would not accept zero uranium enrichment, a key sticking point in past negotiations, with Washington viewing enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking such weapons.
In June, the US joined Israel in a series of air strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear sites. The US is also stepping up economic pressure on Iran.
At a White House meeting earlier this week, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed that the US would work to reduce Iran’s oil exports to China, Axios reported on Saturday.
China accounts for more than 80 per cent of Iran’s oil exports, so any reduction in that trade would significantly lower Iran’s oil revenue.</p><small>2026-02-15 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15175003905c848.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973389/shaukat-khanum-hospital-dismisses-claims-over-noc-withdrawal-for-karachi-fundraising-event' target='_blank'><strong>Shaukat Khanum Hospital dismisses claims over NOC withdrawal for Karachi fundraising event</strong></a><br><p>The Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital on Sunday dismissed social media claims regarding the withdrawal of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for a fundraising event for its Karachi facility, clarifying that the purported notification being circulated dates back to December 2023.
Several reports emerged on social media and television platforms claiming that the NOC issued by Islamabad’s administration related to holding a fundraising ceremony for the under-construction SKMCH in Karachi had been withdrawn.







SKMCH issued a formal clarification regarding the purported development, saying, “The news currently circulating on social media about the withdrawal of a NOC by the Islamabad administration is from December 2023.”
“It relates to a fundraising gala dinner planned in Islamabad for December 29, 2023, in support of Shaukat Khanum Hospital Karachi,” it added.
It said that fundraising and construction had continued without interruption since then.
“The Karachi hospital remains on track for opening in December 2026.”
We appreciate the concern shown by our supporters on this matter and would like to assure you that our mission to fight cancer continues with your trust and generosity, it said.
Earlier, the SKMCH administration had said that “approximately 70 per cent” of the nuclear medicine facility had been completed, with the remaining work on track.







The SKMCH and research centres already exist in Lahore and Peshawar.

According to a police statement, a group of terrorists attacked the police station using both light and heavy weapons. They added that personnel deployed at the station quickly acted and repelled the assault.
“The police personnel successfully foiled the overnight attack of militants at the War Mamund station, but Additional SHO Gul Mahmood Din was martyred after fighting bravely,” said a senior police official who visited the area on Sunday morning with his team.
The official told Dawn that all the other station personnel were safe and secure following the attack.
Attacks on police personnel, law enforcement agencies, and security forces have escalated across KP and Balochistan, especially after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in November 2022.
Earlier this week, at least four policemen, including an SHO, were martyred as armed terrorists attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area in Dera Ismail Khan, police said.
According to a police statement, the incident occurred as the police party was returning after a search operation. Militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire.
Four policemen were martyred in the attack, and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire.
1 killed, 8 injured as mortar shell explodes
Separately, in the Kardok area of Bajaur’s Salarzai tehsil, an unexploded mortar shell detonated on Sunday afternoon, killing a child and injuring eight other people, including a woman.
According to initial reports and rescue sources, eight children and one woman were injured in the incident and were moved to Khar Hospital for medical treatment.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Riaz Ahmed Khan told Dawn that one of the children succumbed to their injuries, while four of the injured were referred to a Peshawar hospital for “advanced treatment”.
Preliminary information suggested that the children found an unexploded mortar shell and brought it home. The shell later exploded, injuring nine people at the house.
An initial investigation indicated that the incident was accidental in nature, but an investigation was launched. Local administration and security agencies cordoned off the area and began collecting evidence.
Last September, at least four teenagers were killed, and two other people were injured when a mortar shell exploded in a field in Bajaur, according to police officials.
Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafiq told Dawn about the incident and said that the dead and injured were transported to Khar Hospital.
“Initial reports suggest that a mortar shell exploded in the field, killing the young men,” he said, adding that the deceased ranged in age between 13 and 18.</p><small>2026-02-15 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1514164292b677c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973377/west-indies-beat-nepal-to-become-first-team-into-t20-world-cup-super-eights' target='_blank'><strong>West Indies beat Nepal to become first team into T20 World Cup Super Eights</strong></a><br><p>The West Indies became the first team to qualify for the Super Eights phase of the T20 World Cup when they cruised to victory against Nepal by nine wickets on Sunday.
After restricting Nepal to 133-8 in their 20 overs, captain Shai Hope’s 61 not out helped his team romp to 134-1 in 15.2 overs in the Group C clash at Mumbai’s Wankhede stadium.
Hope reached his fifty off 38 balls and scored three sixes and five fours in all.







He put on an unbroken 91 with Shimron Hetmyer to reach the 134 target with 28 balls to spare.
Hetmyer was 46 not out at the end from 32 balls, with two sixes and four fours.
Hope said the qualification was “one step, one hurdle that we’ve crossed”.
“Good to contribute to wins,” he added of his own batting, after scores of 19 and nought in his side’s two previous matches at the tournament.







“It’s about continuing how we’ve been playing. Hopefully, we can carry through that.”
Hope won the toss and chose to field and his decision was justified by a magnificent spell by Matthew Forde.
The Nepal batsmen found it almost impossible to score off him as Forde took 1-10 from four overs, and bagged the prize wicket of Nepal captain Rohit Paudel for five.
“You must give him credit, he’s been hitting his areas,” Hope said of Forde. “He really exploits the movement.”
Nepal were in all sorts of trouble at 22-3 at the end of the six-over power play, then 23-4 and 46-5 as Jason Holder also got among the wickets.
It was only Dipendra Singh Airee’s 58 that pushed Nepal past the 100 mark as he shared in a partnership of 54 for the seventh wicket with Sompal Kami, who was there at the end unbeaten on 26.
“I am glad that I got an opportunity to decide what we wanted to do,” Hope said of winning the toss.
“We wanted to limit the flow of runs and keep taking wickets.”
Holder took 4-27 from his four overs and was named player of the match.
“I thought the ball did a little bit more. Probably held in the surface a little bit more up front,” Holder said.
“It became a little bit more difficult to hit through the line of the ball.
We were able to get a little bit of movement as well, too, which was key.
“I thought our bowlers bowled a really tight line.”







The result eliminates Nepal after three defeats. Their final group match is against Scotland in Mumbai on Tuesday.
The West Indies’ final group game will be against Italy in Kolkata on Thursday.
The Caribbean side will then return to Mumbai for their first Super Eights match on February 23, with their opponents still to be decided.</p><small>2026-02-15 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15162419393299a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973385/israeli-strikes-kill-12-in-gaza-since-dawn-civil-defence' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli strikes kill 12 in Gaza since dawn: civil defence</strong></a><br><p>Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that Israeli strikes killed at least 12 people since dawn on Sunday, while a military official said the attacks were in response to ceasefire violations.
Despite a US-brokered truce that entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the Palestinian territory, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement.
The civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue force, said one strike hit a tent of displaced people in northern Gaza and another targeted an area in the south.
Five people were killed and several were injured when an air strike targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia in the north, the agency said in a statement.
Five more were killed and several were injured in a separate early morning strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, the agency said, adding that one more was killed in Israeli shelling in Gaza City.
The agency also said that one person was killed by Israeli gunfire in Beit Lahia in north Gaza.
The Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals confirmed they had received the bodies of at least seven people.
“Israel doesn’t understand ceasefires or truces,” said Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabalia attack.
He said the people killed there were hit as they slept.
“We’ve been living under a truce for months, and they’ve still targeted us. Israel operates on this principle — saying one thing and doing another,” Askar told AFP.
Funeral prayers
Dozens of relatives and mourners gathered at Nasser Hospital, where the bodies of some of those killed were laid out in white shrouds. Men and women stood in prayer ahead of the funeral, facing the corpses in the hospital compound.
A military official said Israeli forces attacked in response to Hamas violating the ceasefire agreement.
“The violation included an identification of several armed terrorists who took cover under debris east of the yellow line and adjacent to IDF (Israeli military) troops, likely after exiting underground infrastructure in the area,” the official said.
“Crossing the yellow line in the vicinity of IDF troops, while armed, is an explicit ceasefire violation, and demonstrates how Hamas systematically violates the ceasefire agreement with intent to harm the troops,” the official added.
Under the terms of the ceasefire, which took effect on October 10, Israeli troops withdrew to positions behind a so-called “Yellow Line”, although they remain in control of more than half of the Palestinian territory.
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem, in a statement on Sunday, accused the Israeli military of violating the ceasefire.
“Targeting of displaced people in their tents is a serious violation of the ceasefire agreement,” Qassem said.
Gaza’s health ministry says that at least 601 people have been killed since the truce began. The Israeli military says at least four of its soldiers have been killed in the same period.
Media restrictions and limited access to Gaza have prevented AFP and other news organisations from independently verifying casualty figures or freely covering the fighting.</p><small>2026-02-15 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15122752501c74c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973373/cm-maryam-wants-grooming-of-punjab-police-to-deal-with-citizens-respectfully' target='_blank'><strong>CM Maryam wants ‘grooming’ of Punjab Police to deal with citizens respectfully</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Sunday issued directions to the Punjab Police to ensure “grooming” of their personnel as part of police reforms, warning them against violating the “dignity of common people”.
In a high-level televised meeting, the chief minister directed Punjab Inspector General (IG) Abdul Kareem to “groom” the police staff, citing complaints of “intimidating behaviour” exhibited by Punjab Police.
“Teach them how to talk to people, and groom them mentally as well,” CM Maryam stressed, warning that the police officials would “not be permitted to interact with people if they refuse to address them as sir or sahib”.
“Police staff that patrol or interact with the public should directly teach them the appropriate body language,” she directed.







The chief minister noted that police in Punjab often addressed people in public spaces with “oye”, rather than speaking to them respectfully.
“Do not violate the dignity of the public,” CM Maryam stressed.
She further underscored the “need for accountability and unlearning harmful attitudes”.
“Do not deny your wrongdoing,” she said, but “take accountability and work towards rectifying the error”.
“We are here to serve people, not threaten and intimidate them,” she remarked, adding that the monthly evaluations would be conducted for each police officer.
“Whoever is coming to us should be treated in a dignified manner,” she emphasised, issuing strict directions to register complaints immediately when they are reported and to wear body cameras while on duty.







On February 12, in a meeting at the Central Police Officer, newly-appointed IG Kareem reviewed the implementation of reform measures in Punjab Police under the ‘Fast, Fearless, Transparent Justice’ initiative.
During the meeting, it was decided that all Punjab Police and traffic personnel will be provided with body cameras in phases within the next two months.
The Punjab IG said that “panic buttons” were being installed outside police stations so that citizens could immediately lodge complaints in case of any misconduct or lack of hearing.
He also directed that at all police stations, offices, checkpoints and Khidmat Marakaz, citizens should be addressed respectfully as “sir or madam” and “sahib or sahiba”.
He said that counselling and training of officers and personnel would be arranged to improve the overall perception of Punjab Police’s conduct.</p><small>2026-02-15 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15082115b91b1ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973325/thunderstorm-rain-forecast-from-monday' target='_blank'><strong>Thunderstorm, rain forecast from Monday</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has predicted rain and thunderstorm in southern parts of the country.
